40|$|This paper {{presents}} annual Swedish {{time series}} {{data on the}} top <b>marginal</b> tax <b>wedge</b> and <b>marginal</b> tax <b>wedges</b> on labor for a low, average and high income earner for the period 1862 to 2010. We identify four distinct periods separated by major tax reforms. The tax system can be depicted as proportional, with low tax wedges until World War II. Next follows a period featuring increasing tax wedges beginning in connection with World War II. During the third period, starting with the 1971 tax reform and continuing throughout the 1980 s, the efforts to redistribute income culminated and tax wedges peaked. The high income earner started to pay the top <b>marginal</b> tax <b>wedge</b> which could be 90 percent. The main explanations for this development are temporary crises leading to permanent tax increases, expansion {{of the public sector}} and distributional ambitions, bracket-creep and the introduction of social security contributions paid by the employers. The 1990 - 1991 tax reform represents {{the beginning of a new}} and still continuing period with decreasing <b>marginal</b> tax <b>wedges...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper studies simple {{strategies}} of labor tax reform {{in a search}} and matching model {{of the labor market}} featuring endogenous labor supply. Changing the composition of the tax wedge [...] -that is, reducing a payroll tax and increasing a progressive wage tax such that the <b>marginal</b> tax <b>wedge</b> remains unaffected [...] -increases employment, reduces the equilibrium unemployment rate, and increases public revenue as long as workers do not have all the bargaining power in wage negotiations. A strategy of replacing employment taxes by payroll taxes increases employment and reduces the equilibrium unemployment rate, while the effect on public revenue is ambiguous. ...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{understanding}} of the behaviour of surging glaciers and ice streams is hampered {{by the lack of}} data on landsystem evolution and sedimentary environments. This study concerns the ice-marginal environment of the surge-type Brúarjökull in Iceland. The sediment distribution in the glacier forefield as well as the morphology, sedimentology and tectonic architecture of the 1890 end moraine is investigated for highlighting the interaction between very dynamic ice and sediment/landform associations. As a result of substrate/bedrock decoupling during the 1890 surge, subglacial sediment was dislocated across the bedrock surface and deformed compressively, leading to gradual substrate thickening and the formation of a sediment <b>wedge</b> in the <b>marginal</b> zone. A drop in subglacial porewater pressure {{at the very end of}} the surge led to substrate/bedrock coupling and a stress transfer up into the sediment sequence causing brittle deformation of the substrate. Simultaneously, the glacier toe ploughed into the topmost part of the <b>marginal</b> sediment <b>wedge</b> initiating the moraine-ridge construction. Fine-grained and incompetent sediment deformed in ductile manner, resulting in a narrow moraine dominated by rooted folds, while coarse-grained and competent sediment deformed in brittle fashion, resulting in a wider moraine dominated by thrust blocks. A new sequential model of subglacial and ice-marginal processes operating during a glacier surge is proposed, illustrating the stepwise formation of a <b>marginal</b> sediment <b>wedge</b> and an end moraine—a twofold, inseparable marginal end-product that formed during the last days of the 1890 surge...|$|R

40|$|We use a neoclassical {{open economy}} model with traded and non traded goods to {{investigate}} the sectoral effects of three tax reforms: i) two revenue-neutral shifting the tax burden from labor to consumption taxes and ii) one labor tax restructuring keeping the <b>marginal</b> tax <b>wedge</b> constant. Regardless of its type, a tax reform crowds-in both consumption and investment and raises employment. Whereas tax reforms have a small impact on GDP, they exert substantial effects on sectoral outputs which move in opposite direction in the short-run. The sensitivity analysis reveals that raising the elasticity of labor supply or reducing the tradable content in consumption expenditure amplifies the heterogeneity in sectoral output responses. Finally, allowing for the markup {{to depend on the}} number of competitors, we find that a substantial share of sectoral output variations {{can be attributed to the}} change in the markup triggered by firm entry.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} four European Union member states: Romania, Italy, France and the United Kingdom {{to provide a}} {{cross-country}} comparison for the year 2012, regarding the progressivity of personal income tax systems. By making use of the information available in the OECD dataset and OECD’s Taxing Wages framework and {{on the basis of}} the tax rules in place were computed average personal income tax rates, average tax <b>wedges</b> and <b>marginal</b> tax <b>wedges</b> in order to measure the tax progressivity of wage earners at different wage levels and for different families types. The analysis performed reveals the fact that for families with children the United Kingdom has the highest rate of progressivity while for a single taxpayer with no children who gets an average wage, the total tax burden as a percentage of the total cost of labor is the highest in France (50. 2 %), followed by Italy (47. 6 %), Romania (44. 4 %) and the United Kingdom (32. 3 %) ...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{analyzes}} {{the differences in}} the labor laws and their impacts {{on the development of the}} labor markets in large selection of OECD countries, including the Czech Republic. The thesis covers both historical and current data including the late- 2000 s recession. The labor market performance is measured by hours worked per person, which combines the extensive margin (employment rate) and the intensive margin (hours worked by employed individuals). Labor laws are represented by the average and <b>marginal</b> tax <b>wedges,</b> employment protection legislation, labor market policies and trade union density. The thesis contains an empirical model of the relationship between the labor market performance and labor laws for 24 OECD countries for the period 2000 - 2008. The thesis shows that the lower hours worked are associated with more strict employment protection legislation and lower trade union density. The effect of taxation (in terms of tax wedges) varies substantially among different subgroups of the population, but it is generally quite weak (elasticity around - 0. 15) and it cannot explain the overall differences in the development of the labor market performance among countries...|$|R
50|$|The {{share of}} {{employees}} leaving jobs every year (for a new job, retirement or unemployment (unempl.:15% of job leavers)) {{in the private}} sector is around 30% (of 1.25 million), at more than 300,000 - a level also observed in the U.K. and U.S.- but much higher than in continental Europe, where the corresponding figure is around 10%, and in Sweden. This attrition can be very costly, with new and old employees requiring half a year to return to old productivity levels, but with attrition bringing {{the number of people that}} have to be fired down. Productivity increased at an average of 2.3% a year in 2004, 2005 and 2006, recently being revised upward from an average of just 0.9% and previously with a too high employment level estimated. The upward revision is good, because a high wage economy like Denmark's with very few valuable natural resources needs to be highly productive, or efficient, and innovative to compete with other countries for a market share in the global economy. However, according to OECD, the distortions imposed by a combined <b>marginal</b> tax <b>wedge</b> of 70% (60% income tax plus 25% VAT, not counting elevated excise duties on certain goods) are hurting productivity and in turn the country's competitiveness.|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} {{of the eastern}} European countries into market-based economies and their potential integration into the European Union raise questions about how their capital income tax systems should be structured {{and to what extent}} they are in line with the rest of Europe. This note presents a brief analysis of the tax systems currently in place and considers what issues should be of concern in setting tax policy in the future. The impact capital income taxes have on the incentives for firms to invest in the Czech Republic and Poland is described using a <b>marginal</b> effective tax <b>wedge</b> and an average effective tax rate. Simulations of some simple reforms are also presented. First, some brief comments are made on what the optimal tax policy for smaller capital-importing countries might be and how this should inform policy in the transition economies. The standard theoretical literature on optimal taxation in a small open economy suggests that residence-based taxation is optimal, implying that the tax...|$|R
40|$|The magnetostratigraphy of the mammal-bearing {{alluvial}} fan-fan delta {{sequences of}} the Fortuna basin (SE Spain) has yielded an accurate chronology {{for the late}} Turolian (Messinian) basin infill. From early to late Messinian (at least between 6. 8 and 5. 7 Ma), the Fortuna basin records the sedimentation of alluvial-palustrine deposits over a confined shallow basin. Changing environmental conditions in the latest Messinian are illustrated by the retreat of palustrine facies. A rapid progradation of the <b>marginal</b> clastic <b>wedges</b> and the initiation of an efficient basin drainage at 5. 8 Ma (lower part of chron C 3 r) most likely represents the onshore response to the drastic drop of base level taking place during the Messinian salinity crisis. This study further provides improved age estimates for the late Turolian land mammal events in southern Spain. The oldest MN 13 locality in the studied sections is correlated to chron C 3 Ar at an age of 6. 8 Ma. The entry of camels and the murid Paraethomys in southern Spain occurs in chron C 3 An. 1 n at 6. 1 Ma, and gives further support for land mammal exchange between Africa and the Iberian peninsula prior to the salinity crisis, in good agreement with results from northern Africa [M. Benammi, M. Calvo, M. Pre´vot, J. J. Jaeger, Magnetostratigraphy and paleontology of Ai¨t Kandoula basin (High Atlas, Morocco) and the African-European late Miocene terrestrial fauna exchanges, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 145 (1996) 15 - 29]. The age of the studied sequences provides important constraints on {{the understanding of the}} sedimentary evolution of the eastern Betic margin, and shows that previous interpretations of the evaporitic-diatomitic sequences of the Fortuna basin, as being coeval to the late Messinian salinity crisis in the Mediterranean, are not correct. The confinement leading to the emergence of the Fortuna basin occurred in the late Tortonian to earliest Messinian, similar to other intramontane basins in the Betics. Therefore, the inclusion of the Fortuna basin in a hypothetical marine Betic Corridor during the late Messinian is no longer tenable. Ó 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} new and useful {{insights}} into the effects that various tax, labour and product market reforms have on the overall economic performance. Additionally, it aims also to provide insights about the optimal monetary and fiscal policy behaviour within the economy characterized with various real labour market frictions. We analyze the benefits of tax reforms and their effectiveness relative to product or other labour market reforms. A general equilibrium model with imperfect competition, wage bargaining and different forms of tax distortions is applied in order to analyze these issues. We find that structural reforms imply short run costs but long run gains; that the long run gains outweigh the short run costs; and that the financing of such reforms will be the main stumbling block. We also find that the effectiveness of various reform instruments depends on the policy maker's ultimate objective. More precisely, tax reforms are more effective for welfare gains, but market liberalization is more valuable for generating employment. In order to advance {{our understanding of the}} tax and product market reform processes, we then develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model which incorporates search-matching frictions, costly ring and endogenous job destruction decisions, as well as a distortionary progressive wage and a at payroll tax. We confirm the negative effects of marginal tax distortions on the overall economic performance. We also find a positive effect of an increase in the wage tax progressivity and product market liberalization on employment, output and consumption. Following a positive technology shock, the volatility of employment, output and consumption turns out to be lower in the reformed economy, whereas the impact effect on inflation is more pronounced. Following a positive government spending shock the volatility of employment, output and consumption is again lower in the reformed economy, but the inflation response is stronger over the whole adjustment path. We also find detrimental effects on employment and output of a tax reform which keeps the <b>marginal</b> tax <b>wedge</b> unchanged by partially offsetting a decrease in the payroll tax by an increase in the wage tax rate. If this reform is anticipated one period in advance the negative effects remain all over the transition path. We investigate the optimal monetary and fiscal policy implication of the New-Keynesian setup enriched with search-matching frictions. We show that the optimal policy features deviation from strict price stability, and that the Ramsey planner uses both inflation and taxes in order to fully exploit the benefits of the productivity increase following a positive productivity shock. We also find that the optimal tax rate and government liabilities inherit the time series properties of the underlying shocks. Moreover, we identify a certain degree of overshooting in inflation and tax rates following a positive productivity shock, and a certain degree of undershooting following a positive government spending shock {{as a consequence of the}} assumed commitment of policy maker...|$|R

San Diego State UniversityTitle of folded map on Plate 1 in pocket (inside back cover) : Geology of {{a portion}} of the Julian Schist, Julian, CalifOriginal map upon which map on Plate 1 was based: Polyconic projection. North American Datum 1927 (NAD 27). California Coordinate System, zone 6. Universal Transverse Mercator, zone 11 (UTM 11). Contour {{interval}} 20 feet. 1960 The Julian Schist is a group of pre-batholithic metasedimentary rocks that are found as roof pendants in the Peninsular Ranges batholith of central and eastern San Diego County. The area {{that is the subject of}} this study is located approximately 64 km east-northeast of San Diego, around the community of Julian, California. Through field mapping and petrographic analysis, several lithologies of andalusite- and sillimanite-bearing pelitic schists and gneisses were recognized, along with a group of calc-silicate-bearing feldspathic quartzites. These rocks are strongly foliated, generally striking to the northwest. Tightly appressed isoclinal folds, boudins, and elongate minerals all lie steeply inclined in the foliation. The metamorphic mineral assemblages and textural relationships are indicative of pressure and temperature conditions of approximately 2 - 3 kb and 600 - 650 ??C. Relict bedding and sedimentary structures, such as graded laminations, channel scours, and rip-up clasts preserved in a section of interbedded quartz-mica schist and feldspathic quartzites are indicative of deposition by turbidites. Several facies of turbizite fan were recognized, suggesting deposition in the middle- to outer-fan lobes and fan fringe. Chemical analysis of the metasedimentary rocks by X-ray fluorescence and comparison with known sedimentarychemistries indicated that the quartzites had a protolith of a carbonate-cemented arkosic arenite. Regional correlations were made with the other pre-batholithic metasedimentary rocks of the Peninsular Ranges. A model developed for the early Mesozoic continental margin indicates that these metasedimentary rocks were once part of a large clastic wedge, shed from the craton to the east into the fore-arc portions of a <b>marginal</b> basin. The <b>wedge</b> contains shallow deltaic, turbidite fan, and basin deposits. These rocks were deformed and metamorphosed by the mid- to late Mesozoic subduction, island arc collision, and emplacement of the Peninsular Ranges batholith...|$|R
