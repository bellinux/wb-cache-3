40|$|Ocean {{thermal energy}} {{conversion}} (OTEC), {{the concept of}} extracting energy from the ocean by utilizing the temperature differential between the surface and deep oceanic waters, was first proposed by the nineteenth century French scientist Jacques-Arsène d’Arsonval in 1881. It was another Frenchman, Georges Claude, who made the first attempts to put the concept into practice {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century. Between 1928 and 1930 Claude built the first OTEC electrical generating facility at Matanza Bay, Cuba. The facility only operated for 11 days generating sufficient power to light forty 500 watt bulbs during a demonstration; however backers were not sufficiently impressed to finance a proposed 25 megawatt plant (Chiles, 2009). In 1934, using mostly his own money, Claude made his second attempt at a commercial scale OTEC facility. This one was a plant ship for the production of ice off the coast of Brazil. Before the cold water pipe could be completed a storm sank it and the project had to be cancelled due to lack of funds. Jumping ahead to the 1970 ’s and the Arab oil embargo; oil prices soared as did interest in alternative energy sources, including OTEC. In 1979 a project called <b>Mini-OTEC,</b> operating off of a US Navy barge, successfully generated 50 kilowatts of electricity in waters off Hawaii and a Japan sponsored 100 kilowatt land-based plant was operated on the island nation of Nauru and a 40 megawatt plant wa...|$|E
