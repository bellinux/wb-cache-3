5|$|Among {{the many}} other {{statistics}} that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, {{the manager of the}} fielding team <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E
5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely.</b>|$|E

5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} levels {{steadily}} increase with increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E
25|$|Mania or {{hypomania}} {{may occur}} in 1% {{of patients with}} depression and up to 12% of patients with bipolar disorder. This side effect can occur in individuals with no history of mania but it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to occur in those with bipolar or with {{a family history of}} mania.|$|E
25|$|To {{the extent}} that the {{exhaustion}} doctrine is grounded in considerations of public policy, and to {{the extent that}} the interests of the public and third parties (such as Quanta in the Quanta case) are to be considered as well as those of the contracting parties, the courts <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to place limits on whether the parties can by contract make the doctrine inapplicable to the goods that are the subject of their contract. On the other hand, if the policy of the exhaustion doctrine is seen merely as a rule to make sure that downstream purchasers get fair notice that their use of goods whose purchase they are considering will be restricted, courts <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to uphold such restrictions unless they collide with other policies, such as those of competition or antitrust law.|$|E
30|$|The {{diagnosis}} of CTE relies on postmortem tissue analysis; therefore, forensic pathologists {{play an important}} role in the identification and epidemiology of CTE since the disease can only be definitively diagnosed by direct tissue examination. Although the majority of professional and collegiate athletes examined for CTE have in fact been found to have had the disease, this represents a biased sample in that families who suspect their loved ones <b>may</b> <b>be</b> impaired <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to agree to brain donation for research purposes.|$|R
30|$|While {{the goals}} {{set for the}} {{training}} included that all MLPs complete the series of three tests and accumulate 20 proctored scans, there was drop out of MLPs and not all scans were completed. This potentially impacts the results as more motivated providers <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> compliant with the training requirements and potentially perform better.|$|R
50|$|Aprons are {{nowadays}} considered equally {{appropriate for}} {{both women and}} men by most people. However, prevailing social norms ensure that women frequently wear more delicate clothing, and <b>may</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to want the protection an apron offers. This can also be because the apron is the traditional clothing for cooking and washing dishes, usually done by women.|$|R
25|$|While {{agreeable}} {{individuals are}} habitually likely to help others, disagreeable people <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to cause harm. Researchers {{have found that}} low levels of agreeableness are associated with hostile thoughts and aggression in adolescents, as well as poor social adjustment. People low in agreeableness {{are also more likely}} to be prejudiced against stigmatized groups such as the overweight.|$|E
25|$|The American Psychological Association's 1995 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns {{stated that}} the {{correlation}} between IQ and crime was −0.2. It was −0.19 between IQ scores and number of juvenile offenses in a large Danish sample; with social class controlled, the correlation dropped to −0.17. A correlation of 0.20 means that the explained variance is 4%. The causal links between psychometric ability and social outcomes may be indirect. Children with poor scholastic performance may feel alienated. Consequently, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to engage in delinquent behavior, compared to other children who do well.|$|E
25|$|Like other opioid drugs, {{pethidine}} has {{the potential}} to cause physical dependence or addiction. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be abused than other prescription opioids, perhaps because of its rapid onset of action. When compared with oxycodone, hydromorphone, and placebo, pethidine was consistently associated with more euphoria, difficulty concentrating, confusion, and impaired psychomotor and cognitive performance when administered to healthy volunteers. The especially severe side effects unique to pethidine among opioids—serotonin syndrome, seizures, delirium, dysphoria, tremor—are primarily or entirely due to the action of its metabolite, norpethidine.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, the BBC {{reported}} that the latest research by experts indicate that Catholic priests <b>may</b> <b>be</b> no <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than others to abuse. However, {{a major cause of}} the scandal was the cover-ups and other alleged shortcomings in the way the church hierarchy has dealt with the abuses. Particularly, the actions of Catholic bishops in responding to allegations of clerical abuse were harshly criticized.|$|R
25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing to say no to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to hyperglycemia, significant weight gain is frequently experienced by patients treated with clozapine. Impaired glucose metabolism and obesity {{have been shown}} to be constituents of the metabolic syndrome and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The data suggest that clozapine <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to cause adverse metabolic effects than some of the other atypical antipsychotics. A study has established that olanzapine and clozapine disturb the metabolism by making the body take preferentially its energy from fat (instead of privileging carbohydrates). Levels of carbohydrates remaining high, the body develops insulin resistance (causing diabetes).|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} shows that LGBT homeless youth <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to abuse substances than their heterosexual counterparts. For example, a 2002 study using structured interviews of homeless youth in the Seattle area found {{that in the past}} six months, sexual minority youth had used each tested substance (including marijuana, cocaine/crack, acid, ecstasy, and several others) more frequently than heterosexual youth. That being said, a 2008 study that used interviews of substance-abusing homeless youth in the Southwestern United States found no significant difference in drug use between heterosexual and gay, lesbian and transgender youth within its sample.|$|E
5000|$|Individuals who use guns defensively {{tend not}} to have {{extremely}} punitive attitudes toward criminals, but people with punitive attitudes <b>may</b> <b>be</b> somewhat <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to own guns, and, thus, to use them defensively. A 2009 study found no support for the [...] "Southern culture of honor" [...] hypothesis, in that no significant relationship was seen between living in the Southern United States and defensive gun use.|$|R
50|$|Short squeezes <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to occur}} in stocks with small market {{capitalization}} and small floats, although can involve large stocks and billions of dollars, as happened in October 2008 when a short squeeze temporarily drove the shares of Volkswagen on the Xetra DAX from €210.85 to over €1000 {{in less than two}} days, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world. Short squeezes <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to occur when a large percentage of a stock's float is short.|$|R
50|$|An {{overdose}} of zolpidem may cause excessive sedation, pin-point pupils, or depressed respiratory function, which may progress to coma, and possibly death. Combined with alcohol, opiates, or other CNS depressants, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> even <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to lead to}} fatal overdoses. Zolpidem overdosage can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, which displaces zolpidem from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor to rapidly reverse {{the effects of the}} zolpidem.|$|R
25|$|Emerging {{research}} suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While {{further research is needed}} to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to provide mental health benefits than consequences.|$|E
25|$|T. stagnalis is {{the only}} Anostracan species to occur in Ireland, and {{one of only two}} in the British Isles (the other being Chirocephalus diaphanus which occurs in a few sites in {{southern}} England). It was discovered in Rahasane turlough in 1974, and was soon discovered at six other sites, in temporary pools in fields, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to represent the species' usual habitat. T. stagnalis is thought to have arrived in Ireland in mud on the legs of a migratory bird, or on the footwear of a wildfowler; various ducks such as mallard, teal and shoveller, and waders such as lapwing and curlew have been observed in Ireland after migrating from areas with T. stagnalis populations, such as Scandinavia and France.|$|E
25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration {{have been shown to}} be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E

25|$|The northernmost {{subspecies}} C. c. bromia is migratory, {{subject to}} necessity. It may withdraw several hundred kilometres {{south in the}} northernmost parts of its range. Thousands of blue jays have been observed to migrate in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. It migrates during the daytime, in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds. Much about their migratory behavior remains a mystery. Some are present throughout winter {{in all parts of}} their range. Young jays <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to migrate than adults, but many adults also migrate. Some individual jays migrate south one year, stay north the next winter, and then migrate south again the next year. To date, no one has concretely worked out why they migrate when they do. Likely, it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are, which can determine whether other northern birds will move south.|$|E
25|$|Attachment {{influences}} {{both the}} perception of support from others and the tendency to seek support from others. People who have attachments who respond consistently and positively to requests for closeness allow individuals to have secure attachments, and in return they seek more support, in a generally relaxed way, while people whose attachments are inconsistent in reacting positively or regularly reject requests for support find they need to use other attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles may trust their attachments to provide support because their attachments have reliably offered support in the past. They <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to ask for support when it's needed. People with insecure attachment styles often {{do not have a}} history of supportive responses from their attachments. They may rely less on their attachments and be less likely to ask for support when it's needed, though there may be other factors involved, as well.|$|E
500|$|Because the {{ordinance}} imposed content-based restrictions on free speech, Justice Thomas held that {{the ordinance}} would only be constitutional if it survived strict scrutiny. Assuming that the town's interests of preserving aesthetic appeal and traffic safety were compelling, he concluded that these were [...] "hopelessly underinclusive" [...] because the ordinance allowed for the proliferation of an unlimited number of larger, ideological signs that pose the same threats to aesthetics and traffic as directional signs. In fact, Justice Thomas suggested that a [...] "sharply worded" [...] ideological sign <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to distract drivers than a directional sign. Justice Thomas also suggested that some directional signs [...] "may be essential, both for vehicles and pedestrians, to guide traffic or to identify hazards and ensure safety". Therefore, Justice Thomas remanded the case for reconsideration {{in light of the}} Court's opinion.|$|E
25|$|Women {{who have}} a more {{unrestricted}} sociosexual orientation index <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to resist mate guarding too. This type of sociosexuality <b>is</b> defined by <b>more</b> promiscuity {{and low levels of}} intimacy in relationships. Related to this, females who report less investment in their current relationship also exhibit more resistance to mate guarding by avoiding contact with their partner. This strategy along with resisting control has also been found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> widely used for women who report less intimacy in their relationship.|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} reasons why older {{adolescents}} may have chosen to accept the FR. First, the study profile was clearly identified as belonging to a clinician; it contained information to validate the identity of its owner, and included links to the university website for her practice. This may have engendered trust from the adolescents who received the FR. It {{is important to note}} that none of the adolescents in this study had offline connection to or knowledge of the research team or its SNS profile prior to the commencement of this study. Second, adolescents often have several hundred online friends and previous studies suggest these online friendships represent “weak ties” and “loose connections” between individuals[26]. Adolescents may have viewed this FR as an opportunity to establish a higher online friend count and a “weak tie” to the Dr Meg profile. This is supported by the finding that Acceptors had a higher friend count compared to Non-Acceptors; Acceptors <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to accept a FR from a stranger in order to increase their friend count. Lastly, the FR came from a female profile owner, and most Acceptors <b>were</b> male. Males <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to accept a FR from a female stranger.|$|R
5000|$|Detection bias {{occurs when}} a {{phenomenon}} <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> observed for {{a particular set of}} study subjects.
