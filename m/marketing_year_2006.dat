Three stock selection methods were applied from the Benjamin Graham’s criteria, two selection methods were adopted from Peter Lynch’s criteria, and two selection methods were from Joel Greenblatt’s Magic formula. The stocks listed in SSEAI were filtered by these seven screening rules, and then equal-weight portfolios were set up with stocks which can pass the screening rules. The returns of portfolios were compared with market return. This research found that the portfolios that created by Peter Lynch and Joel Greenblatt’s methods produced higher return than <b>market</b> in each <b>year</b> from 2007 to 2010, and the portfolios that created by Benjamin Graham’s method produced higher return than <b>market</b> in each <b>year</b> from 2007 to 2011, except eight portfolios had no stock and no return.

40|$|In {{knowledge-based}} economy, {{intellectual capital}} (IC) {{plays an important}} role compared to the physical assets in achieving a company value and success. The ignorance of IC would result in management putting less attention on IC, and hence IC value added capabilities would not be fully exploited. The study aims {{to examine the relationship between}} IC performance (VAIC) and company characteristics with IC disclosure in the annual reports of 68 biggest Malaysian companies listed in Bursa Malaysia based on <b>market</b> capitalization in <b>year</b> <b>2006.</b> The study follows the classification of IC disclosure (ICD) by Huang et al. (2007), with three broad IC categories in forty-five items. Content analysis was used to collect the IC related information. Other data are gathered from annual reports and datastream. Results show that VAIC is negatively related to IC disclosure. Further classification of VAIC shows that Intellectual Capital Efficiency (ICE) and Human Capital Efficiency (HSE) are negatively related to IC disclosure whilst Structural Capital Efficiency (SCE) is not related to IC disclosure. Negative association suggests that companies reduce intellectual capital disclosure for competitive advantage reason which supports the proprietary cost theory. Company size and leverage are found to be positively related to IC disclosure...|$|R

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between intellectual capital (IC) performance (value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC)) and company characteristics with IC disclosure (ICD) in Malaysian listed companies. Design/methodology/approach– Sample of the study is 68 biggest Malaysian companies listed in Malaysian Stock Exchange based on <b>market</b> capitalization in <b>year</b> <b>2006.</b> The paper follows the classification of ICD by Huang et al. (2007), with three broad IC categories in 45 items. Content analysis was used to collect the IC information from the annual reports. Regression analysis was conducted for VAIC and its components. Log linear analysis was also conducted to cater the possible misspecification in the model. Findings– Results of the study show that VAIC is negatively related to ICD. Further classification of VAIC shows that intellectual capital efficiency and human capital efficiency are negatively related to ICD whilst structural capital efficiency is not related to ICD. Company size and leverage are found to be positively related to ICD. Research limitations/implications– Negative association between VAIC and ICD suggests that companies reduce ICD for competitive advantage reason which supports the proprietary cost theory. The findings of the study may provide some evidence to regulators to enhance the reporting practices of IC for the benefits of users of financial reporting in making relevant decisions. The focus should be given on the reporting of human capital items. Originality/value– This is the first paper to use IC framework by Huang et al. (2007). Consistency of findings with other studies using different IC framework can be compared for the choice of IC framework in future studies...|$|R
