500|$|It {{is a great}} {{outlet for}} me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which is one of my most {{personal}} songs and remains one of my favorites. I think [...] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go {{hand in hand with the}} song's composition.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2010, Emerson {{released}} a message stating: [...] "During a routine medical examination, a colonoscopy revealed a rather dangerous polyp in <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> colon. It is {{the conclusion of}} the doctors here in London that I must undergo surgery immediately. Unfortunately, the timing of this urgent surgery does not allow me to start touring in early October because of the required period of hospitalization and recuperation. I must remain optimistic that all will turn out well".|$|E
2500|$|Since his injury, Lewis {{has been}} cleared to {{participate}} in organized team activities, including on-field work, {{but he wants to}} make sure he remains healthy for the rigors of the preseason. He was quotes as saying [...] "As of right now I want to get through this offseason program and make sure everything is good," [...] he said. [...] "I want to get confident with my knees right now so, when training camp starts, I'm full throttle and there's no holding back whatsoever." [...] When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: [...] "I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in my upper body. <b>My</b> <b>lower</b> body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury. I'm excited to see what I can do now with a year of NFL lifting and training without banging on (the knee)." [...] He competed for the starting job in the 2009 NFL Season.|$|E
60|$|She {{took up a}} {{magazine}} and turned away with a shrug of the shoulders. I leaned a little further forward in <b>my</b> place, and <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> voice {{so as not to}} disturb the sleeping man.|$|R
60|$|Oh <b>My</b> <b>lowered</b> his head, ebbed swiftly {{through the}} French windows, and as swiftly {{returned}} {{with the rest of}} Forrest's clothes-gear, helping him into undershirt and shirt, tossing a tie around his neck for him to knot, and, kneeling, putting on his leggings and spurs. A Baden Powell hat and a quirt completed his appareling--the quirt, Indian- braided of rawhide, with ten ounces of lead braided into the butt that hung from his wrist on a loop of leather.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Not I alone,’ {{returned}} <b>my</b> father, <b>lowering</b> his voice; ‘for {{see where}} {{these have been}} scraped away. Am I right? Was that your secret store?’ ...|$|R
2500|$|In the meantime, Berthold fretted, [...] "And I {{will fly}} again…even if they must carry {{me to the}} airplane." [...] He kept his sister apprised of his medical condition. On 25 April, he wrote, [...] "…a bone {{splinter}} protruded from <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> wound. My very capable medical orderly came immediately {{with a pair of}} tweezers, and with much skill and force, he removed it…. I passed out during this violent procedure. The pains were horrific. But the lower wound is beginning to close. Only the upper wound still festers very heavily. When the bone fragment was being withdrawn it broke into pieces, as the opening was too small and the splinter was snagged in the flesh, and so he had to probe and extract each piece." [...] Franziska Berthold wrote of her brother, [...] "…his vigor was gone. The constant discharge from his wounds and the nerve pain wore down the body more and more. In order to work…he had to be given drugs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But look here,' said Arnott aghast; 'they're {{saying what}} isn't true. <b>My</b> <b>lower</b> deck isn't noisome, and I saw to the finger-bowls myself.' ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the moment}} I {{felt as though}} seven pounds of crushed ice had been neatly applied {{in the form of}} a {{compress}} to <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> stomach.|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> {{informant}} <b>lowered</b> her {{big brown}} eyes, {{with an air}} of conscientious meditation that was inexpressibly quaint. [...] "To me she appears so," [...] she said at last, looking up.|$|R
60|$|I gaped foolishly in my amazement, {{a little}} dazzled, too, by the effulgence of her eyes, which were now {{raised to the}} level of <b>my</b> own. I <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> glance abashed, and {{answered}} her as courteously as I could. Then she led me to the table, and presented me to the company, naming each to me.|$|R
60|$|I {{took the}} paper, but before I <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> eyes to it, I gave him warning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, I believe I will," [...] he replied, with candid heartiness. [...] "I {{was riding}} one of <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> trails to-day, so I just thought I'd drop {{down and see}} how you were all coming on." ...|$|E
60|$|It became {{manifest}} {{then that}} my knees were wabbling, my feet puttering around, my whole lower limbs shaking as if I had the palsy. I had {{lost control of}} <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> muscles. It was funny; it was ridiculous. It showed just what was my state of excitement.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now {{the spirits}} twain discoursed of things, whose very terms, to me, were dark. But my first guide grew wise. For me, I could but blankly list; yet comprehended naught; and, like the fish that's mocked with wings, and vainly seeks to fly;--again I sought <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> element.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Giver {{is someone}} else, giving day and night. But the world {{gives me the}} credit, so I <b>lower</b> <b>my</b> eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, dear madam, lovely, too lovely Miss Moseley, has one act of folly, of wickedness if you please, lost me {{your good}} opinion for ever? Derwent {{had given me}} hopes that you yet {{retained}} some esteem for <b>my</b> character, <b>lowered,</b> as I acknowledge it to be, in my own estimation." ...|$|R
60|$|Like {{lightning}} he wheeled {{and before}} I could {{so much as}} <b>lower</b> <b>my</b> hand the point of his long-sword was at my breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is," [...] the {{newcomer}} said, with an angry scowl. [...] "Any beauty I once {{may have had}} is gone forever. I have lost three of my upper teeth, and two of <b>my</b> <b>lower,</b> and I am learning now to speak with my lips shut, so as to hide the gap." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Less than {{justice to}} Mr Boffin, Sophronia,' said Mr Lammle, soaring into {{a tone of}} moral grandeur, 'because it {{represents}} Mr Boffin as on <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> level; more than justice to me, Sophronia, because it represents me as on Mr Boffin's higher level. Mr Boffin bears and forbears far more than I could.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, dear Sophronia. From <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> level, I regard Mr Boffin as too generous, as {{possessed of}} too much clemency, as being too good to persons who are unworthy of him and ungrateful to him. To those noble qualities I can lay no claim. On the contrary, they rouse my indignation when I see them in action.' ...|$|E
60|$|She spoke {{a little}} sharply. Mr. Dubourg was {{the hero of}} her romance. She resented--seriously resented--any attempt on <b>my</b> part to <b>lower</b> him in her estimation.|$|R
6000|$|... "His arm stole round me again; and I {{felt the}} quick beat {{of his heart}} get quicker and quicker. 'If you only knew!' he whispered back; 'if you only knew--' He could say no more. I felt his face bending toward mine, and dropped <b>my</b> head <b>lower,</b> and stopped him in {{the very act of}} kissing me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I asked no more questions, for I did {{not like}} to <b>lower</b> <b>my</b> dignity by seeming inquisitive, but I was puzzled. Presently Jim {{finished}} cutting his tobacco.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>lower</b> nature rose {{within me}} to {{proclaim}} the foolish chatterer as a prophet. So {{life was not}} as I had been taught--a painful struggle between good and evil. There {{was no such thing}} as evil; the senseless epithet was a libel upon Nature. Not through wearisome repression, but rather through joyous expression of the animal lay advancement.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They rouse my indignation, my dear, {{against the}} unworthy persons, {{and give me}} a combative desire to stand between Mr Boffin and all such persons. Why? Because, in <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> nature I am more worldly and less delicate. Not being so magnanimous as Mr Boffin, I feel his {{injuries}} more than he does himself, and feel more capable of opposing his injurers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The scales {{fell from}} my eyes. I understood. I {{had had the}} same sort of thing happen to me in moments of crisis. I {{remember}} once detaining a dentist with the drill at one of <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> bicuspids and holding him up for nearly ten minutes with a story about a Scotchman, an Irishman, and a Jew. Purely automatic. The more he tried to jab, the more I said [...] "Hoots, mon," [...] "Begorrah," [...] and [...] "Oy, oy". When one loses one's nerve, one simply babbles.|$|E

6000|$|... "Listen!" [...] I looked round, {{the others}} were out of earshot. I <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> voice to a whisper. [...] "I believe she has been poisoned! I'm certain Dr. Bauerstein {{suspects}} it." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were already}} cleared for action, having had full {{time to prepare}} {{ourselves}} since danger had first threatened us; accordingly, leaving Mr. Langely to supervise such few details as might still remain to demand attention, I had <b>my</b> gig <b>lowered,</b> and went aboard of the Greenwich to consult with Captain Kirby as to means of defending ourselves against this new and additional danger that threatened our existence.|$|R
6000|$|... "You do not understand," [...] said Lorison, {{removing}} {{his hat and}} sweeping back his fine, light hair. [...] "Suppose she loved me in return, and were willing to marry me. Think, if you can, what would follow. Never a day would pass but she would be reminded of her sacrifice. I would read a condescension in her smile, a pity even in her affection, that would madden me. No. The thing would stand between us forever. Only equals should mate. I could never ask her to come down upon <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> plane." ...|$|E
60|$|I am quickly {{rolled in}} <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> berth, where I feel the {{trembling}} of the machine-impelled ship, {{and hear the}} creaking of the berth above me as its occupant rolls over: I listen to the sighs of the others, the wash of dark water. And so, uneasily, rather hot and very airless, uneasy with the machine-throbbing and the sighing of my companions, and with a cock that crows shrilly {{from one of the}} coops, imagining the ship's lights to be dawn, the night goes by. One sleeps--but a bad sleep. If only there were cold air, not this lower-berth, inside cabin airlessness.|$|E
60|$|But it was {{the cold}} that was most distressing. I felt that I could survive but a few minutes. People were {{struggling}} and floundering in the water about me. I could hear them crying out to one another. And I heard, also, the sound of oars. Evidently the strange steamboat had lowered its boats. As the time went by I marvelled that I was still alive. I had no sensation whatever in <b>my</b> <b>lower</b> limbs, while a chilling numbness was wrapping about my heart and creeping into it. Small waves, with spiteful foaming crests, continually broke over me and into my mouth, sending me off into more strangling paroxysms.|$|E

6000|$|In you the Bull divine again [...] Bellows and paws {{the dusty}} plain, [...] To nature true. [...] I {{challenge}} not his ancient hate [...] But, <b>lowering</b> <b>my</b> knurly pate, [...] Lock horns with you.|$|R
