40|$|Due to {{technological}} problems {{physical models}} of complex shapes still are {{of great importance}} e. g. in mould and die production. Two tasks for the metrology of curved surfaces can therefore be specified: {{on the one hand}} an initial CAD data model has to be generated {{on the basis of a}} physical design model and on the other the actual and nominal shape of a complex surface given by measured point data and a CAD data model has to be compared. In order to improve accuracy, speed and tracability of coordinate measuring and to create a tool for research on new measuring strategies the IPA has developed a measuring system for curved surfaces which is integrated within a CIM system. This system will be introduced in this paper and comprises model making, metrology, CAD/CAM, traditional NC manufacturing and rapid prototyping techniques. The presented measuring software package can be an enhancement to any CAD system open for user applications. By this means measuring and construction sessions tak e place within a common software environment and all of the CAD system's capabilities can be used. The software has been adapted to different CAD systems and is able to interact both with tactile coordinate measuring machines (CMM) and optical sensor systems. For digitizing point data are collected on a physical model by scanning and sent to the CAD system, where the IPA software generated an initial surface description. Based on this model a physical representation can be created to the original model.

The paper will highlight lessons learned during this process. Recent developments in phased array technology, using for example innovative Inverse Wave field EXtrapolation (RTD IWEX) technology are going to enable 3 D imaging of defects in the real sense.

40|$|Abstract: A {{variety of}} {{inspection}} equipment exists in industry {{to capture the}} points on a surface that will envisage manufacturing form errors. Manufacturing inspection faces a problem of finding optimal methods to capture an evenly spread distribution of points on the surface. Sampling does not yield complete information about a surface. Each material removal process leaves a unique pattern {{on the surface of}} the workpiece, which has to be taken into consideration while developing the sampling strategy. For instance, round patterns left by face milling at low feeds on flat surfaces, and spiral patterns left during surface milling and turning operations on surfaces of revolution. Two new methods have been developed to improve sampling using the coordinate measuring <b>machine</b> (CMM) <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> of flat and revolved surfaces. These are the Spiral, and Hamspi sampling methods. The Spiral method focuses on the centre of the area and uses the Archimedean spiral. Hamspi is a method that combines both the Spiral and randomized Hammersley tomeasure points in the middle as well as the outer zone of the workpiece. Mathematical comparisons of these methods have been made to establish feasibility. An experiment was performed to determine the accuracy of these models using two dependent variables: inspection time and minimum zone. The minimum zone was (statistically) significantly affected by only two factors: sample size and workpiece shape. The sampling time was however affected by sample size, workpiece shape, and the interaction between them. This study observed that the beginning and ending cutting zones of spherical surfaces were the most significant regions to verify. It was found that the Spiral and Hamspi methods had similar point distributions as the Hammersley method while placing more emphasis on the origin of the workpiece...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new type of local image {{descriptor}} which yields binary patterns from small image patches. For the application to fingerprint liveness detection, we achieve rotation invariant image patches by taking the fingerprint segmentation and orientation field into account. We compute the discrete cosine transform (DCT) for these rotation invariant patches and attain binary patterns by comparing pairs of two DCT coefficients. These patterns are summarized into one or more histograms per image. Each histogram comprises the relative frequencies of pattern occurrences. Multiple histograms are concatenated and the resulting feature vector is used for image classification. We name this novel type of descriptor convolution comparison pattern (CCP). Experimental results show the usefulness of the proposed CCP descriptor for fingerprint liveness detection. CCP outperforms other local image descriptors such as LBP, LPQ and WLD on the LivDet 2013 benchmark. The CCP descriptor is a general type of local image descriptor which we expect to prove useful in areas beyond fingerprint liveness detection such as biological and medical image processing, texture recognition, face recognition and iris recognition, liveness detection for face and iris images, and <b>machine</b> vision <b>for</b> surface <b>inspection</b> and material classification...|$|R

Moreover, the use of <b>machine</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>for</b> maintenance and restoration purposes has not been considered. On the other hand, past studies on maintenance models do not consider the length of a production run to be a decision variable. This paper addresses the problem of joint control of production cycles or manufacturing quantities and maintenance by inspection. A simple relationship has been developed to determine the effectiveness of maintenance by inspection. Furthermore, when maintenance by inspection is adopted, it is shown that the optimal inspection intervals are equally-spaced. The problem of simultaneous determination of EMQ and the inspection schedules is solved by using an approximation to the cost function. The resulting EMQ is found to be an adjustment to the classical EMQ.
