40|$|In {{this paper}} I present {{a model of}} {{asymmetric}} pricing. Firms here follow the (<b>S,s)</b> <b>pricing</b> rule with different lengths of tails. I use numerical simulations with four-state shocks to detect {{the link between the}} present asymmetry in pricing on the micro level and asymmetry in aggregate output movements. This paper investigates whether the asymmetry on firm level can result in asymmetry on the macro level and {{what is the role of}} heterogeneity of agents in the process. It looks at two kinds of asymmetries on the aggregate level: (i) asymmetric output responses to positive and negative monetary shocks and (ii) asymmetric responses to shocks during different phases of business cycle. The basic conclusion is that to some extent the first type of asymmetry can be attributed to the asymmetry of adjustment bands and that heterogeneity softens the effect, but the second type of asymmetry is the result of (<b>S,s)</b> <b>pricing</b> behaviour of firms, thus of heterogeneity itself.

40|$|Abstract. By placing store-level {{price data}} into {{structural}} VAR systems comprised of inflation and relative price asymmetry, this paper evaluates the quantitative importance of idiosyncratic pricing shocks in short-run inflation dynamics. Robustly to alternative {{definitions of the}} relative price, identification schemes dictated by (<b>S,s)</b> <b>pricing</b> theory and measures of asymmetry in the relative price distribution, idiosyncratic shocks explain about 25 to 30 percent of the forecast error variance in inflation at the 12 -month horizon.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{structural changes}} and the dynamics of price relationships in the U. S., British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario lumber markets. With monthly price series from 1981 to 2002, we use Perron’s method to identify structural shifts and the Johansen cointegration analysis and vector-error correction (VEC) model to determine both short-run and long-run price relationships. We find that, due to restrictions on federal timber harvests in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), price instability experienced in 1992 has caused structural shifts for the U. S. and Canadian lumber prices. We also find that the North American lumber market is indeed integrated where the U. <b>S.</b> <b>price</b> significantly affects Canadian prices in both short-run and long-run. This result indicates the price leadership role for the U. S. in the North American lumber market where the Canadian prices respond to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>price</b> change, but that the reverse does not hold. Therefore, this finding may not support the claim of U. S. producers that subsidized Canadian lumber has depressed the U. <b>S.</b> <b>price</b> and harmed the U. S. lumber industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to analyze the factors causing an increase in wheat imports from Canada and to estimate the effect of increased wheat imports on U. <b>S.</b> <b>prices</b> and farm income. An econometric model is developed and estimated to determine these factors and effects. Canadian exports to the United States are estimated as a function of U. <b>S.</b> <b>price,</b> the U. <b>S.</b> - Canada exchange rate, and other variables, while U. <b>S.</b> <b>price</b> is estimated as a function of imports from Canada, U. S. domestic supply and consumption, and exports. The two equations are estimated simultaneously. Results from this model are used to estimate the effect of imports from Canada on U. <b>S.</b> farm <b>prices</b> and income. Results indicate that imports from Canada have a significant negative effect on U. S. hard red spring and durum wheat prices and consequently decrease farm income for U. S. producers. However, while the effect is significant, it is still {{only a small portion of}} the total decrease in price in recent years. Some portion of the increased wheat imports is due to the elimination of import restrictions under the Canada - U. S.
