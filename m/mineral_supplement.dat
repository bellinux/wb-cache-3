25|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} to indicate that chronic human exposure to copper results in systemic effects other than liver injury. Chronic copper poisoning leading to liver failure was reported in a young adult male with no known genetic susceptibility who consumed 30–60mg/d of copper as a <b>mineral</b> <b>supplement</b> for 3 years. Individuals residing in U.S. households supplied with tap water containing >3mg/L of copper exhibited no adverse health effects.|$|E

40|$|Usage of <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> {{regarding}} {{avoidance of}} lacks in supply (especially phosphor or selenium) and fulfilling {{the ideal of}} a closed materials cycle within a farm is controversial discussed among bio-dynamic farmers. A representative survey in Swiss and German bio-dynamic dairy farms was conducted to investigate the mineral feeding strategies of bio-dynamic farmers and the relationships between farm characteristic and usage of <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements.</b> It was shown that 30 % of the dairy herds were fed without external <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> whereas 97 % were fed with salt. Farms in highlands, with loamy soils, a high amount of permanent grassland and lower yielding dairy cows were associated with lower use of <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements.</b> Alternatively most often feeding of fresh or dried leaves of trees and hedges were mentioned in the questionnaire. The survey results demonstrated the differences in usage of <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> in bio-dynamic farms and determined further need {{of research in the}} area of mineral supplementation...|$|R

25|$|In November 2011, a music {{writer and}} editor for the British {{newspaper}} The Observer sought help raising £200,000 to have his 4-year-old niece, who was diagnosed with glioma, treated at the Burzynski Clinic. Several bloggers reported other cases of patients who had spent similar amounts of money on the treatment, and had died, and challenged the validity of Burzynski's treatments. Marc Stephens, identifying himself {{as a representative of}} the Burzynski Clinic, sent emails accusing them of libel and demanding that coverage of Burzynski be removed from their sites.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to examine whether drenching or mixed with total mixed ration (TMR) of glucogenic and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> can prevent metabolic disorders of Holstein fresh cows. Multiparous cows (n= 24), second lactating cows (n = 24), and first lactating cows (n= 24) were used in a completely randomized block design, immediately after parturition and for 3 weeks experimental period. The treatments used were: 1) the control treatment that without any addition on water or TMR (CONT), 2) drenching treatment (DRCH) that include: 40 liter water contained 2 kg of the glucogenic and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> drenched to cows in two equal meals, 3) feeding treatment (FEED) contained two kg of the glucogenic and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> mixed with TMR, 4) compound diet (DRFD), 20 liter water contained 1 kg of glucogenic and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> drenched to cows plus 1 kg of these materials mixed in the TMR. DRCH treatment had positive effects on negative energy balance and plasma NEFA and BHBA concentrations. Plasma glucose had increased significantly by treatments (P< 0. 05). Time duration of placenta to fall was significantly lower in DRCH treatment than the other treatments (P< 0. 05). Addition of these glucogenic precursors and minerals on water of fresh cows, resulted in optimize animal metabolic status in postpartum period and reduced duration of falling of placenta. So it can be concluded that drenching of glugenic and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> at calving improved the cows' health and prevented the metabolic disorders of parturition...|$|R

40|$|The trace {{minerals}} zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium are {{components of}} a wide variety of enzymes and proteins that support metabolism, growth, production, and reproduction. Trace <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> are added to dairy cattle rations to prevent mineral deficiencies, and supplementation has traditionally been provided in the form of inorganic salts. When these inorganic salts dissociate in the reticulo-rumen, omasum, and abomasum, the trace minerals can form indigestible compounds with other feed components which renders them unavailable for absorption in the intestines. Organic trace <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> that are both stable in the digestive tract and available for intestinal absorption have the potential to be more available to the cow than inorganic supplements. However, measurement of bioavailability of trace <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> is difficult, and studies comparing organic to inorganic trace <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> do not consistently show increased bioavailability. Organic trace mineral supplementation has been shown to increase animal production response relative to inorganic trace minerals in some studies, with or without a concurrent increase in measures of bioavailability. Some studies have shown that trace mineral supplementation above predicted requirements improves animal health, likely due to the antioxidant functions of Zn, Cu, Mn, and Se.
