50|$|To {{determine}} {{the nature of}} the relief one party can claim on a breach of a term by the other, the terms of a contract are sometimes distinguished as either ‘material’ or ‘non-material’. Generally, {{in the absence of a}} clause that provides for cancellation (a lex commissoria), rescission of a contract is permissible only if the breach in question is regarded as a material breach, which is usually the case if it relates to a material (or essential or vital term)—that is, one that goes to the root of the contract. Material terms are those vital to the performance of obligations. The breach of a <b>material</b> <b>term</b> entitles the innocent party to cancel the contract. Breach of a non-material term gives rise to a claim for damages only.|$|E

40|$|Depending on {{the legal}} {{tradition}} one belongs to, the price {{is or is not}} a <b>material</b> <b>term</b> of contract. In American law, the Uniform Commercial Code expressly authorizes the open price contract. On the contrary, the French Civil Code forbids it and renders such a contract void for indefiniteness. This situation does not favor the international relations since, in many cases, the national courts seized read the international contract or law through the lenses of domestic law or principles. To avoid these consequences, a great harmonization has been undertaken since 1929. This effort resulted first in the adoption of the articles 14 and 55 of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. However, these articles conflict with one another and this results in several possible interpretation by the national courts. A work of harmonization has been completed since then by UNIDROIT and resulted in the adoption of the General Principles of International Commercial Contracts. The purpose of this thesis is to criticize the open price system adopted by UNIDROIT and analyse the future of such a principle in the international and national settings. Because of their extreme divergence this study will compare the Uniform Commercial Code's open price system and the French civil code...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{question}} of text and media text {{from the point of view}} of Communicative Linguistics. Its aim is to clarify the notion of text and media text as two discursive categories of the field of cinema and to describe their main peculiarities; to define the notion of film discourse. The research is relevant to the complicity of structural, semantic and communicative organization of the text and it causes the occurrence of different ways to define the text. Both text and discourse have communicative character, but the notion of discourse is wider, because except lingual or written expression, it covers all the extra lingual factors in combination with the social context and this feature gives an opportunity to understand the text as a whole as well as the basis of its functioning in the society. Media text is a kind of the text appeared in the field of mass media. Film terms are widely used within the media text and this fact confirms their communicative value therefore. We define film discourse, firstly, as a kind of communicative activity, which covers all the types of lingual interaction between moviemakers and the audience; between professionals, who take part in creation of films; between researcher of the film history and theory; secondly, it includes professional film communication, namely, texts, theoretical <b>material,</b> <b>term</b> glossaries, textbooks of motion picture arts, critical articles, directors’ diaries etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} a plant depends in part {{on its ability to}} locate water while {{securely}} anchoring in the soil. Cellular growth in roots is driven by water uptake and resulting increases in turgor pressure. Low water potentials slow the rate of primary root growth and induce a suite of changes in the growth zone. To better understand the effects of low water potentials on the growth and structure of primary roots, Zea mays seedlings were grown in different concentrations of polyethylene glycol solution. The effects of low water potentials on the water content, the spatial distribution of growth, and the mechanical properties of the root throughout the growth zone were quantified. Low water potentials decreased the total amount of water in roots and the percent water composition of roots. Low water potentials also decreased relative elemental growth rate and shifted the region of maximal growth rate towards the root tip. Because of water stress induced root thinning and cell wall stress relaxation at the cellular level, low water potentials were expected to alter the mechanical properties of roots. Engineering beam theory was adapted to test for water stress induced changes in the spatial distributions of flexural stiffness (EI), the product of the <b>material</b> <b>term</b> E (Young's modulus of elasticity) and the geometrical term I (second moment of area). Low water potentials decreased EI of roots, due mostly to root thinning (and thus reductions of I). Increasing water stress had no consistent effects on E, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms to maintain root material properties despite cellular changes in wall properties due to water stress. Root thinning in low water potentials results from the promotion of longitudinal over lateral growth to facilitate finding deeper water sources. Though water stress weakens roots by reducing EI, soil impedance has been shown previously to cause root thickening. Soil impedance could thus offset root thinning by low water potentials and increase EI of roots by increasing I. Further studies should test the hypothesis that water stress and impedance have counterbalancing effects on root mechanical properties, thus promoting deep penetration of soils for water while maintaining the mechanical properties necessary for penetrating hard soils...|$|E

40|$|Stress urinary {{incontinence}} (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) are diseases related to weakness of supportive tissues of the pelvic floor due to altered collagen production in middle-aged women and traumatic processes in younger women such as pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Currently {{there is no}} recommended material {{for use in the}} surgical management of these disorders. Synthetic non-absorbable materials, such as polypropylene mesh produce a vigorous inflammatory response followed by dense fibrosis and have been associated with serious complications such as exposure. By contrast acellular biological materials have a tendency toward rapid absorption with questionable long-term mechanical integrity and concerns regarding early failure. Our approach aims to develop a tissue engineered repair <b>material</b> (<b>TERM)</b> to provide the long-term durability of synthetic non-absorbable materials whilst avoiding complications such as exposures and pain. The TERM is composed of a scaffold designed to degrade slowly whilst the inclusion of autologous cells is anticipated to produce a new extracellular matrix (ECM) to remodel fascial tissue for long-term restoration of the mechanical properties. Biodegradable poly-(L) -lactic acid (PLA) scaffolds were identified as the candidate material being more cell compatible in vitro than materials currently used to treat SUI and POP, and with mechanical properties close to the range of native tissues of the pelvic floor. A comparison of oral fibroblasts and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) showed similar results when these cells were cultured on PLA scaffolds to develop a TERM in terms of metabolic activity, ECM production and mechanical properties. Of the two, ADSCs were chosen for further experiments since these cells have been shown in the literature to have regenerative potential and also to be immunosuppressive and to stimulate angiogenesis. The number of cells seeded on the scaffolds, the period of culture and culture conditions were optimized for the production of the best TERM candidate. On the other hand, no significant effects were found when exploring chemical and mechanical stimulation with the aim of increasing ECM production. The host response against the PLA scaffolds implanted cell-free and with ADSCs was studied in rats. The acute host response showed that after an inflammatory response, new collagen ingrowth and blood vessels were developed in all samples. Work was then focussed on the modification of the electrospinning rig to develop a variety of PLA scaffolds with different mechanical properties due to different fibre configuration. Finally, the potential of ADSCs to develop the TERM was assessed using cells from different donors, as well as examining whether this potential was preserved when these cells were rapidly isolated from fat using an enclosed system. In summary, we identified a suitable candidate material, cell candidate and culture conditions to develop a TERM designed for pelvic floor repair. Then, an initial animal study suggested a host response against our TERM leading to constructive remodelling for integration into the native tissues. Finally, a range of PLA scaffolds were produced with improved mechanical properties and preliminary data showed the potential to rapidly isolate ADSCs which were used to develop a TERM in vitro...|$|E
