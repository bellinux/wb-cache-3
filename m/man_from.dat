Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning.

5|$|Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis) {{refers to}} hominins from Sri Lanka's late Quaternary period.

The earliest evidence of Balangoda <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> archaeological sequences at caves and other sites dates back to 38,000 BP, and from excavated skeletal remains to 30,000 BP, which is also the earliest reliably dated record of anatomically modern humans in South Asia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{number of}} studies have {{indicated}} regional differences in semen quality. To examine the current status in Japan, we undertook a cross-sectional study on the semen quality of fertile Japanese men for comparison with recent European results. METHODS: Semen parameters of 324 fertile <b>men</b> <b>from</b> the Kawasaki/Yokohama area were investigated. The semen parameters were compared with those published for fertile <b>men</b> <b>from</b> four European cities, Copenhagen, Paris, Edinburgh and Turku. RESULTS: When adjusting for confounders such as ejaculation abstinence period and age, the lowest sperm concentrations were detected in <b>men</b> <b>from</b> Kawasaki/Yokohama followed by <b>men</b> <b>from</b> Copenhagen, Paris, Edinburgh and Turku, but only the differences between <b>men</b> <b>from</b> Kawasaki/Yokohama and <b>men</b> <b>from</b> Edinburgh and Turku were significant (P = 0. 0008 and P < 0. 0001, respectively). Total sperm count, percentage of motile sperm and percentage of normal sperm observed in Kawasaki/Yokohama were significantly lower than those from all European centres except for motile sperm in <b>men</b> <b>from</b> Paris. CONCLUSIONS: Japanese fertile men had a semen quality at the level of Danish men, who have been reported to have the lowest among investigated men in Europe. The low level of semen quality of the fertile Japanese men may be due to lifestyle or other environ-mental factors; however, ethnic differences caused by different genetic variation or combinations cannot be ruled ou...|$|R
