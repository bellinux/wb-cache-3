60|$|Your Committee have inquired {{into the}} {{observance}} of these necessary regulations, {{and they find}} that they have, like the rest, been entirely contemned, and contemned with entire impunity. After the period of Colonel Monson's death, and Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell obtaining {{the lead in the}} Council, the contracts were disposed of without at all advertising for proposals. Those in 1777 were given for three years; and the gentlemen in question growing by habit and encouragement into more boldness, in 1779 the contracts were disposed of for five years: and this they did at the eve of the expiration of their own appointment to the government. This increase in the length of the contracts, though contrary to orders, might have admitted some excuse, if it had been made, even in appearance, the means of lessening the expense. But the advantages allowed to the contractors, instead of being diminished, were enlarged, and in a manner far beyond the proportion of the enlargement of terms. Of this abuse and contempt of orders a judgment may be formed by the single contract for supplying the army with draught and carriage bullocks. As it stood at the expiration of the contract in 1779, the expense of that service was about one thousand three hundred pounds a month. By the new contract, given away in September of that year, the service was raised to the enormous sum of near six thousand pounds a month. The <b>monthly</b> <b>increase,</b> therefore, being four thousand seven hundred pounds, it constitutes a total increase of charges for the Company, in the five years of the contract, of no less a sum than two hundred and thirty-five thousand pounds. Now, as the former contract was, without doubt, sufficiently advantageous, a judgment may be formed of the extravagance of the present. The terms, indeed, pass the bounds of all allowance for negligence and ignorance of office.|$|E

Truman and his Treasury Secretary, John W. Snyder strongly were in favor of the former strategy of pegging government bond prices, but the Federal Reserve saw the need to encourage macroeconomic stability, meaning fighting inflation. At the outbreak of the war, prices surged; by February 1951, the <b>monthly</b> <b>increase</b> in the consumer price index was almost 20 percent annually.

Bell argued that the network was at a disadvantage against BiteTV, as it could air non-Canadian films, and Teletoon, which aired a late-night block of adult animation, and because Comedy was unable to give its animated acquisitions a larger amount of exposure (such as marathons) due to the restriction. The CRTC rejected its arguments in response to complaints by the two networks cited and other unions, due to their differing natures of service and because Bell's proposed changes were intended primarily to decrease the amount of Canadian content it airs in favor of more U.S.-originated programming.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956 the NHA {{was once}} again amended, this time, to allow the CMHC to {{purchase}} lands for redevelopment. The amendment included a residential building code. In the event that a home owner or occupier failed to meet these standards set by this code, the municipality would be granted permission to expropriate the property. In Vancouver, Moncton, Halifax, Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal large slum areas for cleared {{for the purpose of}} urban renewal. In 1965, Montreal officials estimated that 1779 families had been displaced throughout the duration of the policy. Advocates of this policy pointed to its successes in Calgary and Winnipeg, cities which had historically suffered from particularly severe housing shortages. Opponents of the 1956 NHA amendment state that the policy provided inadequate compensation and housing options to displaced families. Displaced families from Toronto and the Montreal neighborhood of Cote des Neiges reported an average <b>monthly</b> <b>increase</b> in mortgage fees of 44% and 62%, respectively. The clearance policy disproportionately affected immigrant populations in Vancouver and Halifax. In 1967 the NHA was amended to allow mortgage interest to float freely at market rates, which subsequently led to an increase in available mortgage loans. In 1973 the NHA was amended and the urban renewal scheme was discontinued. Several social policies were introduced under this amendment. The New Communities granted $185 million to the CMHC for the purpose of acquiring and redistributing residential land for development. The New Communities Policy was terminated in 1978, however, the land which was acquired during its longevity enabled the building of many cooperatives, including the West Humber Cooperative. The Rent Supplement Act enabled the CMHC to partner with private landlords, cooperatives, and not-for-profit associations to provide affordable housing. Under this act, the CMHC would agree to fund the difference between market rental prices and rent prices geared to the specific occupant's income. The Canada Rental Supply Program provided interest-free loans for 15 years to developers who agreed to allocate a proportion of units toward social housing initiatives. In order to ensure that loans contributed to the provision of low income housing, the CMHC was restricted to giving loans amounting to $7500 or less per unit. The Rental Rehabilitation Assistance Program was also introduced in 1973. Under the program homeowners and occupants in low income neighborhoods could qualify for small grants to be used for home repair. The Assisted Home Ownership Program was also introduced under the 1973 amendment for the purpose of enhancing mortgage accessibility for low income families. Under the program the CMHC provided subsidized interest rates to low income families, in addition to providing them with grants. In 1978 an NHA amendment discontinued the provision of grant money to these families, which led to a high incidence of defaults, and in turn, necessitated that the federal government provide financial assistance to the CMHC.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{onset of}} bipolar {{disorder}} {{is influenced by}} the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. We previously found that a large increase in sunlight in springtime was associated with a lower age of onset. This study extends this analysis with more collection sites at diverse locations, and includes family history and polarity of first episode. METHODS: Data from 4037 patients with bipolar I disorder were collected at 36 collection sites in 23 countries at latitudes spanning 3. 2 north (N) to 63. 4 N and 38. 2 south (S) of the equator. The age of onset of the first episode, onset location, family history of mood disorders, and polarity of first episode were obtained retrospectively, from patient records and/or direct interview. Solar insolation data were obtained for the onset locations. RESULTS: There was a large, significant inverse relationship between maximum <b>monthly</b> <b>increase</b> in solar insolation and age of onset, controlling for the country median age and the birth cohort. The effect was reduced by half if there was no family history. The maximum <b>monthly</b> <b>increase</b> in solar insolation occurred in springtime. The effect was one-third smaller for initial episodes of mania than depression. The largest maximum <b>monthly</b> <b>increase</b> in solar insolation occurred in northern latitudes such as Oslo, Norway, and warm and dry areas such as Los Angeles, California. LIMITATIONS: Recall bias for onset and family history data.

To calculate the IWR during the cycle (difference between crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and effective rainfall (Reff)) and total net irrigation of bean, Cropwat 8. 0 software was used. We considered three sowing dates for the 1 st season (20 September, 20 October and 20 November) and a date for the 2 nd season (January 10) of bean. In the current climate, the IWR (ETc-Reff) increases gradually from northeast to south-central of RS, being lower depths, for sowing in early January and the highest, for sowing in late October and/or November. For net irrigation, for the later sowing of the 1 st season, higher is the water requirement. For each 1 °C increase in temperature (C 1) IWR (ETc-Reff) tends to increase 4 - 10 mm for sowing of the 1 st season.
