5000|$|Pyronia tithonus is a {{characteristic}} field-margin species; it feeds on grasses as larvae and nectar as adults. The larvae of Satyrinae all feed on grasses, such as rough <b>meadowgrass</b> (Poa trivialis), smooth meadow grass (Poa pratensis) and sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina); {{they are usually}} green or brown. The pupae are a flimsy chrysalis either hanging upside down or lying in grass. The adults are often found around blackberry plants. The adult butterflies have a short proboscis and the shallow flowers of the blackberry provide an excellent nectar source.|$|E
5000|$|Poa pratensis is a {{herbaceous}} perennial plant 30 - 70 cm tall.

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of Spectrum® Plus and Spectrum® Gold two new broad spectrum herbicides for pre- and post-emergence application in maize will be available. Their weed spectrum covers warm season grasses, annual <b>meadowgrass</b> and most annual broadleaved weeds. They can be used either alone or in sequence or tankmix with predominantly foliar herbicides. Spectrum® Plus is a premix of dimethenamid-P and pendimethalin. It is especially effective against late germinating warm season grasses and broadleaved species due to its long lasting soil activity. It is also suitable for controlling and avoiding the development of triazine-resistant biotypes. In sequences and tankmixes with herbicides with foliar activity, Spectrum® Plus provides valuable residual activity. Spectrum® Gold contains dimethenamid-P and terbuthylazine. In addition to its residual activity it is also active against larger broadleaved weeds through foliar uptake. It is also an ideal partner for tankmixes with 4 -HPPDinhibitors like topramezone due to synergistic effects. Both products have been proven to show very good crop tolerance in pre- and post-emergence either alone or {{in combination with other}} herbicides...|$|E
40|$|Kentucky {{bluegrass}} or smooth stalked <b>meadowgrass</b> (Poa pratensis L.) {{is widespread}} throughout temperate climates as turfgrass. In Italy {{it is primarily}} used {{for the production of}} high quality amenity and sport lawns and represents the most important apomictic species in terms of cultivated area and economic value. Although P. pratensis has a mode of reproduction ascribable to facultative aposporous parthenogenesis, its reproductive behaviour ranges naturally from nearly obligate apomixis to complete sexuality. In fact not only apomictic reproduction but also sexual reproduction by either outcrossing and selfing may take place in this species. Such reproductive versatility of P. pratensis often requires the estimation of the frequency of apomixis/sexuality expressed by single plants, populations or cultivars. For instance the investigation of the mode of reproduction has important practical implications since it influences breeding strategies, cultivar constitution and seed production. In this paper the AA deal with the screening techniques available to analyze the gametogenesis and embryogenesis processes in P. pratensis. In particular cytoembryological methods capable of estimating the frequency of apospory and/or parthenogenesis directly on the mother plant and molecular tests suitable for definitely assessing the extent of apomixis in the progenies are here reviewed...|$|E
40|$|We tested {{two methods}} aimed at {{providing}} soil coverage {{before and after}} a maize crop, to limit erosion and nitrate leaching. The first method consisted in undersowing a companion crop between maize rows, and leaving this companion crop after maize harvest- The companion crop is sown between seedling emergence and canopy closure of the maize crop. Thirteen species were tested including grasses (rye grass, red and tall fescue, smooth-stalked <b>meadowgrass,</b> common bent, cocksfoot), cereals (rye), legumes (field bean, pea, red clover, lucerne), cruciferae (rape) and phacelia. The technique allowed a fixation of 31 to 42 kg/ha of nitrate nitrogen, according to the species and provided soil cover after harvest of maize. Undersowing a perennial ryegrass (25 and 50 kg/ha seeding rate) reduced soil erosion by 13 and 54 % respectively. Species which can be sown early (to achieve sufficient development before maize canopy closure) and do not compete excessively with maize (to avoid yield losses) appeared preferable. Such a species was red fescue. The use of species such as rape, field bean, pea and smoth-stalked <b>meadowgrass</b> should be avoided. The second method consisted in maize sowing in the residues of a cover crop sown in autumn and destroyed by winter frosts or chemically, according to the species. The cover crop provided soil coverage during the interval between the preceding crop and maize sowing. Direct drilling of maize (no-till or minimum tillage system) in the residues makes this technique especially attractive in erosion sensitive soils. Soil warming up was however slower in early season. Wheat, radish, rye, ryegrass, rye and ryegrass mixture, rape, lucerne, phacelia, triticale and vetch were tested as cover crops. The cover crop must be destroyed early : destruction was easier with a younger crop, risk of competition by survivors was less, and sowing of maize was easier (amount of residues is smaller). Under those conditions only, maize yields were not decreased. Mixture of cover crops, ryegrass and radish appeared {{to be more difficult}} to destroy. The effect on the environment was favourable, since 40 to 70 kg/ha of nitrate nitrogen were fixed by the cover crop during the interseason preceding maize sowing. Both techniques had therefore short term favourable effects on the environment since nitrates were incorporated in the companion crop or in the cover crop organic matter. The fate of this organic matter remains however to be taken into account, and the mineral dressings of the following crops must be adjusted. A last technique tested concerned nitrogen fertilizer application : placement and splitting of different forms and different amounts. Side dressing allowed a 35 to 45 kg N/ha reduction of the amount broadcast applied, without yield decrease. This preliminary result remains to be confirmed, however...|$|E
40|$|Nineteen cool season grass cultivars were {{selected}} for further field evaluation in 2006, based upon their potential to overwinter well in the Northeast and to tolerate stressful production site conditions. We were particularly interested in their winter hardiness, and ability to rapidly establish a dense stand and suppress annual and perennial weeds under minimal maintenance, simulating conditions encountered in low maintenance production sites. Grasses were seeded on September 10, 2005 at 4 lbs/ 1000 sq ft on a well-drained Hudson silt loam soil in Ithaca NY, at the Bluegrass Lane Turf and Landscape Research Center. Plots were evaluated in April 2006 for winter hardiness and survival, and later in May, June and July 2006 {{for their ability to}} produce cover or above-ground biomass, and also to suppress the establishment of weeds. Plots received no fertilization and no irrigation after seeding, and minimal monthly mowing with a large commercial rotary mower. Grasses which performed exceptionally well in terms of weed suppression and biomass production included crested wheatgrass, creeping <b>meadowgrass,</b> no-mow fescue, Rebel Exceda tall fescue, Tar Hill II tall fescue, and Russian winter rye. Columbra and Intrigue chewings fescue and Palmer perennial ryegrass were also good performers. These cultivars generally produced greater than 80 to 90 % stands of cover with minimal weed infestation by July 10, 2006 and continued to perform well into the fall of 2006. Grasses which performed poorly as evaluated by formation of less than 60 % stands and supported large weed infestations included redtop, and Arizona fescue. Grasses will be further evaluated for their ability to withstand environmental stress and perform under low maintenance conditions both in Ithaca and Riverhead NY locations. In additional studies performed at Marcus Nurseries in Allegheny County, several groundcovers proved to be exceptional performers in nursery settings, 2 years after establishment. These groundcovers established and overwintered effectively, and were significantly weed suppressive. They also had no deleterious effects on growth of Frazier fir seedlings transplanted into killed groundcover strips. Best cover crop performers in nursery settings included Intrigue and Wilma fine fescue, and white clover/fine fescue mixtures. Palmer and Prelude perennial ryegrass provided poor weed suppression, despite good initial establishment. Fine fescues were generally most weed suppressive compared to all other groundcovers evaluated and required limited mowing for maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Phyto-oestrogens are a {{group of}} {{secondary}} plant metabolites that may bind to oestrogen receptors and exert oestrogenic or anti-oestrogenic effects in humans and can protect against cancer diseases. When ingested by dairy cows, phyto-oestrogens can be metabolised and transferred to the milk. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the effects of grazing a recently established pasture containing red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and an older pasture containing a variety of sown and unsown plant species on milk concentrations of phyto-oestrogens. Sixteen Norwegian Red dairy cows [mean (standard deviation); body weight 599 (45. 1) kg, stage of lactation 73 (15. 0) d in milk, milk yield 29. 9 (2. 90) kg/d at the start of the experiment] were divided into two groups and grazed either a short-term pasture (SP) or a long-term pasture (LP). The SP was representative of organically managed leys in Norway, which are frequently, approximately every third year, renewed by soil tillage and seeding, whereas LP was representative of organically managed grasslands that are less frequently renewed. The SP contained meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) (mean 34 %), timothy (Phleum pratense L.) (mean 19 %), red clover (mean 28 %), shepherd׳s-purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik.) (mean 6 %), pineappleweed (Matricaria matricarioides Porter ex Britton) (mean 5 %) and scentless mayweed (Tripleurospermum perforatum (Mérat) Laínz) (mean 4 %), and LP contained mainly white clover (Trifolium repens L.) (mean 21 %), smooth <b>meadowgrass</b> (Poa pratensis L.) (mean 19 %), timothy (mean 17 %), meadow fescue (mean 15 %), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) (mean 6 %), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa (L.) P. Beauv.) (mean 5 %), northern dock (Rumex longifolius DC.) (mean 4 %), common couch (Elytrigia repens (L.) Desv. Ex Nevski) (mean 4 %), red clover (mean 3 %) and dandelion (Taraxacum spp.) (mean 3 %). In addition to a daily pasture allowance of 20 kg dry matter per cow, supplements of 3. 0 kg barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) concentrate were fed. Herbage, concentrates and milk was sampled during the last week of three experimental periods and analysed for phyto-oestrogens using LC-MS/MS technology. Herbage from SP had 19 times higher concentration of isoflavones than herbage from LP, whereas only small differences were found for lignans. Milk produced on SP had 14 times higher concentrations of the mammalian isoflavonoid equol, and the concentrations of equol were higher than found in most other studies. This study confirms that grazing pastures containing red clover increases concentrations of isoflavones and especially equol in bovine milk compared to grazing pastures with other botanical composition. The higher milk concentrations of the lignan metabolite enterodiol in milk from SP compared to LP could not be related to differences in intake of the analysed lignans and may therefore be related to unidentified lignans...|$|E
40|$|Ruminal biohydrogenation and {{transfer}} of fatty acids (FA) to milk were determined for 4 silages with different botanical compositions using 4 multiparous Norwegian Red dairy cows [(mean ± SD) 118 ± 40. 9 d in milk, 22. 5 ± 2. 72 kg of milk/d, 631 ± 3. 3 kg of body weight, 3. 3 ± 0. 40 points on {{body condition score}} {{at the start of}} the experiment] fitted with rumen cannulas. Treatments consisted of 4 experimental silages: a mix of the first and third cut of organically managed short-term grassland with timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.; 2 yr old; ORG-SG); organically managed long-term grassland with a high proportion of unsown species (6 yr old; ORG-LG); conventionally managed ley with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.; CON-PR); and conventionally managed ley with timothy (CON-TI). The herbages were cut, wilted, and preserved with additive in round bales and fed at 0. 90 of ad libitum intake. A barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) concentrate constituted 300 g/kg of dry matter of the total feed offered. A Latin square design (4 × 4) with 3 -wk periods and the last week in each period used for sampling was implemented. Omasal flows of FA were measured using Yb acetate, Cr-EDTA, and the indigestible neutral detergent fiber fraction as indigestible markers. The composition of FA was analyzed in feed, omasal digesta, and milk. Compared with ORG-LG, ORG-SG had a higher herbage proportion of red clover (0. 36 vs. 0. 01) and lower proportions of timothy (0. 42 vs. 0. 18), smooth <b>meadowgrass</b> (Poa pratensis L.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), dandelion (Taraxacum spp.), and creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens L.). The silages were well preserved. The concentration of neutral detergent fiber was higher and the concentration of Kjeldahl-N was lower for CON-TI than for the other silages. Silage type had no effect on dry matter intake, but milk yield was lower for CON-TI than for the other silages. Apparent biohydrogenation of C 18 : 3 n- 3 was lower for ORG-SG (932 g/kg) than for ORG-LG (956 g/kg), CON-PR (959 g/kg), and CON-TI (958 g/kg). Compared with the grass-based silages, ORG-SG and ORG-LG resulted in higher omasal flows of C 18 : 1 trans FA and higher milk fat proportions of C 18 : 1 trans FA and C 18 : 2 cis- 9,trans- 11. Apparent recovery of C 18 : 3 n- 3 in milk was higher for ORG-SG (61 g/kg) than for ORG-LG (33 g/kg), CON-PR (34 g/kg), and CON-TI (38 g/kg), and milk fat proportion of C 18 : 3 n- 3 was higher for ORG-SG than for CON-TI. Milk fat proportions of C 16 : 0 were lower for ORG-SG and ORG-LG compared with those for CON-PR and CON-TI. It was concluded that high proportions of red clover and other dicotyledons in the silages affected ruminal biohydrogenation and increased milk fat proportions of beneficial FA...|$|E
