40|$|Hyperspectral imaging in {{the visible}} and near {{infrared}} (VIS-NIR) region {{was used to}} develop a novel method for discriminating different varieties of commodity <b>maize</b> <b>seeds.</b> Firstly, hyperspectral images of 330 samples of six varieties of <b>maize</b> <b>seeds</b> were acquired using a hyperspectral imaging system in the 380 &# 8211; 1, 030 nm wavelength range. Secondly, principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) were used to explore the internal structure of the spectral data. Thirdly, three optimal wavelengths (523, 579 and 863 nm) were selected by implementing PCA directly on each image. Then four textural variables including contrast, homogeneity, energy and correlation were extracted from gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of each monochromatic image based on the optimal wavelengths. Finally, several models for <b>maize</b> <b>seeds</b> identification were established by least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) using four different combinations of principal components (PCs), kernel principal components (KPCs) and textural features as input variables, respectively.

A Targeted Inputs Programme (TIP) of <b>maize</b> <b>seed</b> and a little fertilizer was aimed at the very poor in 2001 and 2002, but 1.5 million TIP packs each year produced little maize because they were issued too late in the planting season.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Incorporation of {{exogenous}} glucanase into {{animal feed}} is common practice to remove glucan, {{one of the}} anti-nutritional factors, for efficient nutrition absorption. The acidic endo-β- 1, 3 - 1, 4 -glucanase (Bgl 7 A) from Bispora sp. MEY- 1 has excellent properties and represents a potential enzyme supplement to animal feed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we successfully developed a transgenic maize producing {{a high level of}} Bgl 7 AM (codon modified Bgl 7 A) by constructing a recombinant vector driven by the embryo-specific promoter ZM-leg 1 A. Southern and Western blot analysis indicated the stable integration and specific expression of the transgene in <b>maize</b> <b>seeds</b> over four generations. The β-glucanase activity of the transgenic <b>maize</b> <b>seeds</b> reached up to 779, 800 U/kg, about 236 -fold higher than that of non-transgenic maize.

40|$|ABSTRACT Although it is {{relatively}} well known that adult plants tend to accumulate proline and trehalose in their tissues as a physiological mechanism in response to drought, there is scarce information {{about the development of}} this physiological response in seeds.

It was found that the proline content in the embryo axis of <b>maize</b> <b>seeds</b> germinating under water limitation is directly proportional to the intensity of this stress.
