The Multilevel Hypermap Architecture (MHA), a self-organizing neural network approach, is used, {{to construct a}} robust system. To process form vari-ant objects the MHA is extended to work with <b>masked</b> <b>input</b> data. Because of using scaled input objects, the system is in-variant to translation. The invariance to rotation is real-ized by the associative memory, which is able to learn different instances of the same input object.

40|$|Retinal {{ganglion}} cells (RGCs) in dark-adapted retinas show a {{range of}} threshold sensitivities spanning ∼ 3 log units of illuminance. Here, we show that the different threshold sensitivities of RGCs reflect an inhibitory mechanism that <b>masks</b> <b>inputs</b> from certain rod pathways. The masking inhibition is subserved by GABAC receptors, probably on bipolar cell axon terminals. The GABAergic masking inhibition appears independent of dopaminergic circuitry that has been shown also to affect RGC sensitivity. The results indicate a novel mechanism whereby inhibition controls the sensitivity of different cohorts of RGCs. This can limit and thereby ensure that appropriate signals are carried centrally in scotopic conditions when sensitivity rather than acuity is crucial. School of Optometr...|$|R

It is {{found that when}} the correlation between input signals is zero, the output signals are separable {{if and only if}} input signals are separable. With positively (negatively) correlated signals, the output signals are separable (mixed) even when input signals are mixed (separable). Exact values of discrimination capacity are obtained for two most interesting cases: the exactly balanced inhibitory and excitatory input case and the uncorrelated input case. Interestingly, the discrimination capacity obtained in these cases is independent of model parameters, input distribution and is universal. Our results also suggest a functional role of inhibitory inputs and correlated inputs or, more generally, the large variability of efferent spike trains observed in in vivo experiments: the larger the variability of efferent spike trains, the easier it is to discriminate between <b>masked</b> <b>input</b> signals.

Side-channel leakages can be explored from unprotected cryptodevices and several power or electromagnetic traces are collected in order to construct (vertical) differential side-channel attacks. On exponentiations, the so-called horizontal correlation attacks originally proposed by Walter in 2001 and improved by Clavier et al in 2010 demonstrated to be efficient even {{in the presence of}} strong countermeasures like the exponent and message blinding. In particular, a single trace is sufficient to recover the secret if the modular exponentiation features long-integer multiplications. In this paper, we consider the application of vertical and horizontal correlation attacks on RNS-based approaches. The Montgomery multiplication, which is widely adopted in the finite ring of an exponentiation, has different construction details in the RNS domain.

We found two solutions to enable ubiquitous interaction and put a stop to the limits imposed by the desktop mode: namely nomadism and mobility. Based on these two solutions, we have proposed three interfaces [46]: In-environment Interface (IEI), Environment Dependent Interface (EDI), and Environment Independent Interface (EII). In this paper, we first discuss an overview of IEI, EDI and EII, before excluding IEI and focusing on EDI and EII, their background and distinct characteristics. We also propose a continuum from physical paper-based interface to digital projected interface in relation with EDI and EII. Then, to validate EDI and EII concepts, we design and implement a MobilePaperAccess system, which is a wearable camera-glasses system with paper-based interface and original input techniques allowing mobile interaction.

It contains medical histories of real but pseudonymous patients with patterns of diagnosis, chosen treatment, and outcome. To be searchable, the patterns contain a feature vector (for similarity search by calculating distances) and a globally unique “pattern name ” which identifies {{the kind of}} data which are represented by the feature vector. Patterns with the same pattern name are directly comparable; they represent {{the same kind of}} data. For pattern selection the database provides a growing well-structured list of initial diagnoses with associated <b>input</b> <b>masks.</b> Procedure: The doctor can assume that the database contains patients similar to the current patient if he finds his initial diagnosis in the list. Clicking on it opens an associated <b>input</b> <b>mask</b> which requests specific further data for finer differentiation. After input a searchable pattern group is built from the provided data, and used to search for histories of patients with similar fine diagnostics, and for the most successful treatment decisions at these patients.

40|$|Abstract. A general {{method to}} secure {{cryptographic}} algorithm implementations against side-channel attacks {{is the use}} of randomization techniques and, in particular, masking. Roughly speaking, using random values unknown to an adversary one <b>masks</b> the <b>input</b> to a cryptographic algorithm. As a result, the intermediate results in the algorithm computation are uncorrelated to the input and the adversary cannot obtain any useful information from the side-channel. Unfortunately, previous AES randomization techniques have based their security on heuristics and experiments. Thus, flaws have been found which make AES randomized implementations still vulnerable to side-channel cryptanalysis. In this paper, we provide a formal notion of security for randomized maskings of arbitrary cryptographic algorithms. Furthermore, we present an AES randomization technique that is provably secure against side-channel attacks if the adversary is able to access a single intermediate result. Our randomized masking technique is quite general and it can be applied to arbitrary algorithms using only arithmetic operations over some even characteristic finite field. We notice that to our knowledge {{this is the first time}} that a randomization technique for the AES has been proven secure in a formal model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an affine invariant shape descriptor for maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). Affine invariant feature descriptors {{are normally}} computed by sampling the original grey-scale image in an invariant frame defined from each detected feature, but we instead use only {{the shape of}} the detected MSER itself. This has the advantage that features can be reliably matched regardless of the appearance of the surroundings of the actual region. The descriptor is computed using the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), with the resampled MSER binary <b>mask</b> as <b>input.</b> We also show that the original MSER detector can be modified to achieve better scale invariance by detecting MSERs in a scale pyramid. We make extensive comparisons of the proposed feature against a SIFT descriptor computed on grey-scale patches, and also explore the possibility of grouping the shape descriptors into pairs to incorporate more context. While the descriptor does not perform as well on planar scenes, we demonstrate various categories of full 3 D scenes where it outperforms the SIFT descriptor computed on grey-scale patches. The shape descriptor is also shown to be more robust to changes in illumination. We show that a system can achieve the best performance under a range of imaging conditions by matching both the texture and shape descriptors. 1...|$|R

In sensory systems, feedforward processing transmits signals from the external world into the cortex, whereas feedback pathways signal the brain’s inference of the world [4 – 11]. However, the integration of feedforward, lateral, and feedback inputs within each cortical area impedes the investigation of feedback, and to date, no technique has isolated the feedback of visual scene information in distinct layers of healthy human cortex. We <b>masked</b> feedforward <b>input</b> to a region of V 1 cortex and studied the remaining internal processing. Using high-resolution functional brain imaging (0. 8  mm 3) and multivoxel pattern information techniques, we demonstrate that during normal visual stimulation scene information peaks in mid-layers.

Further, we found that shifting {{the position of the}} visual scene surrounding the mask parametrically modulates feedback in superficial layers of V 1. Our results reveal the layered cortical organization of external versus internal visual processing streams during perception in healthy human subjects.
