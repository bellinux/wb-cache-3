5|$|The Warner {{brothers}} pooled {{their resources}} {{and moved into}} film production in 1910. Then, in 1912, they lent their support to filmmaker Carl Laemmle's Independent Motion Picture Company, which challenged the monopolistic control of the Edison Trust. That same year, Jack Warner acquired {{a job as a}} film splicer in New York, where he assisted brother Sam with the production of the film Dante's Inferno. Despite the film's success at the box office, Harry Warner remained concerned about the economic threat presented by the Edison Trust. He subsequently broke with Laemmle and sent Jack to establish a film exchange in San Francisco, while Sam did the same in Los Angeles. The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market. In 1917, Jack was sent to Los Angeles to open another film exchange company. Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for <b>My</b> <b>Four</b> Years in Germany, a bestselling novel that condemned German wartime atrocities. The film proved to be a commercial and critical success, and the four brothers were able to establish a studio in California. In the new studio, Jack became co-head of production along with his older brother, Sam. In this capacity, the two brothers secured new scripts and story lines, managed film production, and looked for ways to reduce production costs.|$|E

Between that and <b>my</b> <b>four</b> children, I don't have the time or the energy for anything else. For example, I do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like the DVD of the Sticky & Sweet Tour that we just released, and I have seen the finished product, but I have got no idea how people are going to find out about it or how it's going to be sold." ...|$|E
500|$|According to a 1987 {{interview}} with reporter Roger Starr of The New York Times, she learned much about pool through such activities but [...] "she also learned that, even in fun, pool stars {{did not like}} losing in public, especially not to children, and less, even, to girl children. She also discovered that young men, including her brothers, shared the feeling of shame over losing to girls. She recalls, 'Whenever my brother Paul, the youngest of <b>my</b> <b>four</b> brothers, beat me at pool on the table downstairs at home, he would run through the house shouting 'I won, I beat her'. I guess that was one reason I worked all the harder at my game.'" ...|$|E
500|$|As the 1930s {{came to an}} end, both Jack and Harry Warner became {{increasingly}} alarmed over the rise of Nazism. As Bernard F. Dick observed, the Warners, [...] "as sons of Polish Jews who fled their homeland because of antisemitic pogroms... had a personal interest in exposing Nazism." [...] Moreover, the attraction to films critical of German militarism {{had a long history}} with the Warners that predated their production of <b>My</b> <b>Four</b> Years in Germany in 1918. In 1917, while it was still in distribution, the Warners had secured the rights for War Brides, a movie that featured Alla Nazimova as [...] "a woman who kills herself rather than breed children for an unidentified country whose army looks suspiciously Teutonic." ...|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. {{followed}} up {{the success of}} <b>My</b> <b>Four</b> Years in Germany with a popular serial titled The Tiger's Claw in 1919. [...] That same year, the studio was less successful {{in its efforts to}} promote Open Your Eyes, a tract on the dangers of venereal disease that featured Jack Warner's sole screen appearance. During this period, the studio earned few profits; and in 1920, the Warners secured a bank loan to settle outstanding debts. Shortly thereafter, the Warners relocated their production studio from Culver City, California, to Hollywood, where they purchased a lot on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Bronson Avenue, known today as Sunset Bronson Studios. The new location and upgraded facilities did not significantly improve the studio's image, which remained defined by its low-budget comedies and racy films on declining morality.|$|E

2500|$|Clair's American exile {{had allowed}} him to develop his {{characteristic}} vein of ironical fantasy with several commercially successful films, but there was some feeling {{that it had been}} at the expense of personal control and that his output there had not matched the quality of his earlier work in France. Clair himself recognised that being employed by the highly organized American studios had {{allowed him to}} work in ideal circumstances: [...] "In spite of the restrictions of the American system, it is possible, if one wishes, to take responsibility.

2500|$|Gerald Walter Robert Templer {{was born}} on 11 September 1898 at 15 Wellesley Road, in Colchester, Essex, the son (and only child) of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Francis Templer, of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, and Mabel Eileen Templer (née Johnston). Of Irish descent, Templer {{attended}} an infant school at Rosslyn, Scotland, before being sent to Edinburgh Academy in 1904, later attending a preparatory boarding school at Connaught House, Weymouth, from 1909 until 1911. In January 1912 {{he was sent to}} Wellington College, Berkshire and stayed there until shortly after his 17th birthday in September 1915, a year into the First World War. His time at Wellington was, due mainly to initially being severely bullied, not the happiest period of his life, as he later wrote [...] "I loathed and detested <b>my</b> <b>four</b> years at Wellington", although he also admitted to making numerous friends there.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1917, Dane {{made his}} film début {{in a bit}} part in a Vitagraph Studios short filmed in Fort Lee, New Jersey. He made $3 a day (as a {{mechanic}} he had been making $3 a week) for his part. However, his scenes were cut {{and the name of}} this film is not known. Any footage is presumed lost. Dane then appeared in Warner Bros. anti-German sentiment film <b>My</b> <b>Four</b> Years in Germany as Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg. [...] This would be the first of many such roles for Dane in his early career. The film was released 29 April 1918 and was a success, earning an approximate $500,000 at the box office (the film had a budget of $50,000). His next film was Wolves of Kultur which contained 15 chapters (running about three hours total). The film was released chapter by chapter between 1918 and 1919. He then followed with the June Mathis-penned film To Hell with the Kaiser!, reprising his role as Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg. Dane completed two more anti-German propaganda style films, The Great Victory, Wilson or the Kaiser? The Fall of the Hohenzollerns and Daring Hearts, both released in 1919. In 1920, Dane portrayed [...] "The Wolf" [...] in another 15-chapter serial The Whirlwind. That film is now presumed lost.|$|E

2500|$|The show, {{scheduled}} in a graveyard slot on Tuesday nights at 8:00p.m., {{was not expected}} to challenge the ratings giants Milton Berle and Frank Sinatra, but did surprisingly well. Berle, known to many early television viewers as [...] "Uncle Miltie" [...] and for using ancient vaudeville material, joked about Sheen, [...] "He uses old material, too", and observed that [...] "f I'm going to be eased off the top by anyone, it's better that I lose to the One for whom Bishop Sheen is speaking." [...] Sheen responded in jest that maybe people should start calling him [...] "Uncle Fultie". Life and Time magazine ran feature stories on Bishop Sheen. The number of stations carrying Life Is Worth Living jumped from three to fifteen {{in less than two}} months. There was fan mail that flowed in at a rate of 8,500 letters per week. There were four times as many requests for tickets as could be fulfilled. Admiral, the sponsor, paid the production costs in return for a one-minute commercial {{at the opening of the}} show and another minute at the close. In 1952 Sheen won an Emmy Award for his efforts, accepting the acknowledgment by saying, [...] "I feel it is time I pay tribute to <b>my</b> <b>four</b> writers—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John." [...] When Sheen won the Emmy, Berle quipped, [...] "We both work for 'Sky Chief'", a reference to Berle's sponsor Texaco. Time called him [...] "the first 'televangelist'", and the Archdiocese of New York could not meet the demand for tickets.|$|E
