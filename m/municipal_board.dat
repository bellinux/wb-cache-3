40|$|Over {{the last}} decades {{there has been a}} steady {{increase}} in the representation of women on the political arena. Despite of this there are still fewer women in comparison to men in political organs particularly at the municipal level. It is therefore of great importance to examine which different factors that tend to effect the female representation at this level. Doctor of philosophy at Umeå University Jessika Wide presented in a study from 2000 that the share of women in the municipal councils tended to depend upon cultural, socio-economical and political factors. Other scholars also mean that women have specific interests and therefore are more represented in some areas. This thesis has tested if these theories and results of earlier research also can explain female representation in <b>municipal</b> <b>boards</b> in Sweden at present fiscal year. This was done by formulating hypotheses which was tested via statistical measures and regression analyzes. The main findings where that presented theories and factors stated by earlier research in general could help us to explain the female representation also in <b>municipal</b> <b>boards</b> although the variations between the single municipals are huge. Therefore one should not jump to much large conclusions of these results. Although one could say that the findings in this thesis can serves as indicators on the road of explaining female representation in <b>municipal</b> <b>boards.</b> ...|$|R
