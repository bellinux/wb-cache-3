40|$|International audienceThe {{kinematic}} {{study of}} young stars {{is an important}} tool to discuss {{the early stages of}} star formation. In this context, proper motions allow us to detect moving group structures of young stars to which they belong. Individual distances to moving group members can be inferred from proper motion and radial velocity data using the convergent point strategy. The main objective of this work is to determine proper motions of pre-main sequence stars in nearby star-forming regions. This work represents an improvement of an existing database by including more pre-main sequence stars and refining the astrometry for stars with poor proper motion information in the literature. We calculate the stellar proper motions from observations performed with the CCD <b>meridian</b> <b>circles</b> located at the Abrahão de Moraes Observatory (Valinhos, SP) and the Bordeaux Observatory, and also use data from the literature. Here we discuss the accuracy of our results and compare them with published astrometric catalogs...|$|R
