40|$|This paper follows up the {{factorization}} of integers. Factorization is {{the most}} popular and used method for RSA cryptoanalysis. The SIQS was chosen as a factorization method that will be used in this paper. Although SIQS is the fastest method (up to 100 digits), it can't be effectively computed at polynomial time, so it's needed to look up for options, how to speed up the method as much as possible. One of the possible ways is paralelization. In this case OpenMP was used. Other possible way is optimalization. The goal of this paper is also to show, how easily is possible to use paralelizion and thanks to detailed analyzation the source codes one can reach relatively large speed up. Used method of iterative optimalization showed itself as a very effective tool. Using this method the implementation of SIQS achieved almost 100 <b>multiplied</b> <b>speed</b> up and at some parts of the code even more...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: 802. 11 n is IEEE {{wireless}} {{standards that}} significantly improve throughput {{and range of}} Wireless Local Area Networks(WLAN) compared with other 802. 11 stan dards. It is expected to provide a throughput of over 100 Mbps, which is twice that of 802. 11 g. This difference is because {{it is designed to}} operate in both 5 GHz and 2. 4 GHz frequency band. The key issue in wireless communication is multi-path propagation. This multi-path propagation occurs when signal bounces buildings, walls and other obstacles and arrives at the receiver at different times and from different paths. If the time difference is large enough, the receiver gets confused and can’t interpret the signal causing retransmissions and therefore reducing the speed and data rate of the 802. 11 networks. IEEE 802. 11 n takes the advantages of multi-path propagation to increase throughput to speeds above 100 Mbps, by using MIMO or in other words multiple transmitters and multiple receive (MIMO) antennas. It uses spatial diversity to induce multi-path for the purpose of recombining the multiple signals to increase the signal gain, and channel multiplexing to send multiple signals using multiple antennas, therefore <b>multiplying</b> <b>speeds,</b> increases the range and enhances the performance...|$|R
