5|$|Graf saw {{his first}} {{aircraft}} {{when he was}} twelve years old. This sight created a conflict between his passion for football and a new obsession with flying. From 1930, {{he worked at the}} Engen town hall and saved all his <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> glider. Before his 20th birthday, he provided a homemade glider to the new Engen Sailplane Club. Every Sunday he would go out to the nearby Ballenberg mountain until a heavy crash destroyed his glider in the fall of 1932. In 1935, after Adolf Hitler officially revoked the Treaty of Versailles, Graf applied for flight training in the newly created Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Liverpool, {{he was put}} in charge of the Clarendon Furnishing shop in Hoylake and was made a director of NEMS in 1955. In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend but after being there for only one day, was robbed of his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had on him. He did not want his parents to find out, so he worked as a department store clerk until he had earned enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> train ticket back to Liverpool. Back in Liverpool, he confessed his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions, Epstein revealed his ambition of becoming an actor, so his parents allowed him go to London to study.|$|E

5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what they would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E
5|$|Lenny invites {{his friends}} in Springfield to a party at his apartment, where he tells them that he has adopted a new faith {{in the form of}} a brand new plasma screen television. Homer {{immediately}} falls in love with its high-definition picture, and begins to spend all his time at Lenny's home watching television. Marge sends over Bart and Lisa to convince him to come back but they too become enthralled. After a few days, Homer is kicked out by Lenny, and when he returns home he no longer enjoys watching his regular CRT television. Marge tells him that she has entered the family in a contest where first prize is a plasma screen television. Later, they get a call and discover that instead of first prize, they won the third prize: a trip to the studios of Fox Broadcasting Company. There, Homer learns of a reality show called Mother Flippers in which the mothers of two families switch places, and the grand prize happens to be enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> new plasma screen television.|$|E
5|$|The Berlin Specimen (HMN 1880/81) was {{discovered}} in 1874 or 1875 on the Blumenberg near Eichstätt, Germany, by farmer Jakob Niemeyer. He sold this precious fossil for the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> cow in 1876, to innkeeper Johann Dörr, who again sold it to Ernst Otto Häberlein, the son of K. Häberlein. Placed on sale between 1877 and 1881, with potential buyers including O. C. Marsh of Yale University's Peabody Museum, it eventually was bought for 20,000 Goldmark by the Humboldt Museum für Naturkunde, where it now is displayed. The transaction was financed by Ernst Werner von Siemens, founder of the famous company that bears his name. Described in 1884 by Wilhelm Dames, {{it is the most}} complete specimen, and the first with a complete head. In 1897 it was named by Dames as a new species, A. siemensii; though often considered a synonym of A. lithographica, several 21st century studies have concluded that it is a distinct species which includes the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens.|$|E

50|$|As {{many young}} {{collectors}} {{did not have}} the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>an</b> oil painting, he decided {{to find a way to}} convey the same feeling and meaning in etchings that he had achieved in oils. He started a series of etchings, some in very limited editions. It was original artwork for an affordable price, which is exactly what Fiedler intended.|$|R
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> new television set.|$|E
5|$|John Herschel Glenn Jr. {{was born}} on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a {{plumbing}} firm, and Clara Teresa , a teacher. His parents had married shortly before his father, {{a member of the}} American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own plumbing company, the Glenn Plumbing Company. He was only a toddler when he met Anna Margaret (Annie) Castor, who would later become his wife. The two {{would not be able to}} recall a time when they did not know each other. He took his first flight in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from balsa wood kits. Along with his adopted sister Jean, he attended New Concord Elementary School. He washed cars and sold rhubarb to earn <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> bicycle, after which he took a job delivering The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. He was a member of the Ohio Rangers, an organisation similar to the Cub Scouts; Annie was a girl scout.

25|$|The merger {{would have}} left Law without a job and with poor career-prospects, but the {{retiring}} brothers found him a job with William Jacks, an iron merchant who had started pursuing a parliamentary career. The Kidston brothers lent Law the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> partnership in Jacks' firm, and with Jacks himself no longer playing {{an active part in}} the company, Law effectively became the managing partner.

25|$|Clyde Chestnut Barrow {{was born}} into a poor farming family in Ellis County, Texas, near Telico, a town just {{southeast}} of Dallas.

The family migrated, piecemeal, to Dallas in the early 1920s as part of a wave of resettlement from the impoverished nearby farms to the urban slum known as West Dallas.

25|$|In an {{interview}} with David Letterman, Lewis talked about hitchhiking across the country back to New York City and how he learned to play the harmonica while waiting for rides. He talked about {{hanging out at the}} airport for three days until he stowed away on a plane to Europe. In later interviews, Lewis would reveal other encounters he had traveling around Europe. While visiting Aberdeen, Scotland, with no money and nowhere to sleep, he claimed that the locals were very hospitable by offering him somewhere to stay. In Madrid, Spain, he became an accomplished blues player as he hitchhiked and supported himself by busking with his harmonica. He gave his first concerts in Madrid, earning enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> plane ticket back to the USA.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Dale {{discovered}} a wrecked 1960 Champion 7-GC flipped over and abandoned {{at an airport}} in northern Wisconsin. The brothers then bought the plane from its owner with the very little money they had and rebuilt it in the shed at their family farmhouse. This was their first experience tinkering with an aircraft as a self-taught restoration project, followed by {{the making of a}} Glasair 1 they saw introduced at the 1980 EAA Convention and Fly-In (now called AirVenture) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

25|$|Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South (1969) by Dan T. Carter {{was widely}} {{thought to be}} authoritative, but it wrongly {{asserted}} that Price and Bates were dead. An NBC TV movie, Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys (1976), asserted that the defense had proven that Price and Bates were prostitutes; both sued NBC over their portrayals. Bates died in 1976 in Washington state, where she lived with her carpenter husband, and her case was not heard. Price's case was initially dismissed but she appealed. When the US Supreme Court agreed {{to hear the case}} in 1977, Price disregarded the advice of her lawyer and accepted a settlement from NBC. She used the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> house. Price died in 1983, in Lincoln County, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|Cast {{members in}} the Disney College Program at the Walt Disney World Resort have the {{opportunity}} to meet and live with other cast members within their housing complexes in Lake Buena Vista, FL.

In Japan, many of the larger companies {{as well as some of}} the ministries still offer to their newly graduated freshmen a room in a dormitory. A room in such a dormitory often comes with a communal cook (for the men) or rooms with furnished kitchen blocks (for the women).
