Observation, experiment, induction and confirmation – all practises very closely related to evidence – have been central concerns of philosophers ever since the birth of Western philosophy.

Empirical evidence in the social sciences is extraordinarily varied.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringCaterina ScoglioVector-borne {{diseases}} {{not only}} cause devastating economic losses, they also significantly impact human health {{in terms of}} morbidity and mortality. From an economical and humane point of view, mitigation and control of vector-borne diseases are essential. Studying dynamics of vector-borne disease transmission is a challenging task because vector-borne diseases show complex dynamics impacted by {{a wide range of}} ecological factors. Understanding these factors is important for the development of mitigation and control strategies. Mathematical models have been commonly used to translate assumptions concerning biological (medical, demographical, behavioral, immunological) aspects into mathematics, linking biological processes of transmission and dynamics of infection at population level. Mathematical analysis translates results back into biology. Classical deterministic epidemic models do not consider spatial variation, assuming space is homogeneous. Spatial spread of vector-borne diseases observed many times highlights the necessity of incorporating spatial dynamics into <b>mathematical</b> models. Heterogeneous <b>demography,</b> geography, and ecology in various regions may result in different epidemiological characteristics. Network approach is commonly used to study spatial evolution of communicable diseases transmitted among connected populations. In this dissertation, the spread of vector-borne diseases in time and space, is studied to understand factors that contribute to disease evolution. Network-based models have been developed to capture different features of disease transmission in various environments. Network nodes represent geographical locations, and the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings. Two competent vector populations, Aedes mosquitoes and Culex mosquitoes, and two host populations, cattle and humans were considered. The deterministic model was applied to the 2010 Rift Valley fever outbreak in three provinces of South Africa. Trends and timing of the outbreak in animals and humans were reproduced. The deterministic model with stochastic parameters was applied to hypothetical Rift Valley fever outbreak on a large network in Texas, the United States. The role of starting location and size of initial infection in Rift Valley fever virus spread were studied under various scenarios on a large-scale network. The reproduction number, defined as the number of secondary infections produced by one infected individual in a completely susceptible population, is typically considered an epidemic threshold of determining whether a disease can persist in a population. Extinction thresholds for corresponding Continuous-time Markov chain model is used to predict whether a disease can perish in a stochastic setting. The network level reproduction number for diseases vertically and horizontally transmitted among multiple species on heterogeneous networks was derived to predict whether a disease can invade the whole system in a deterministic setting. The complexity of computing the reproduction number is reduced because the expression of the reproduction number is the spectral radius of a matrix whose size is smaller than the original next generation matrix. The expression of the reproduction number may have a wide range of applications to many vector-borne diseases. Reproduction numbers can vary from below one to above one or from above one to below one by changing movement rates in different scenarios. The observations provide guidelines on executing movement bans in case of an epidemic. To compute the extinction threshold, corresponding Markov chain process is approximated near disease free equilibrium. The extinction threshold for Continuous-time Markov chain model was analytically connected to the reproduction number under some assumptions. Numerical simulation results agree with analytical results without assumptions, proposing a mathematical problem of proving the existence of the relationships in general. The distance of the extinction threshold were shown to be closer to one than the reproduction number. Consistent trends of probability of extinction varying with disease parameters observed through numerical simulations provide novel insights into disease mitigation, control, and elimination...|$|R

40|$|The one-sex stable {{population}} theory {{is a fundamental}} theoretical tool in <b>mathematical</b> <b>demography.</b> However, it cannot answer questions related to the existence and interplay of the sexes. In this work we consider an age structured two-sex population model proposed in the seventies almost simultaneously by Fredrickson and Hoppensteadt. Chapter 1 of this work contains {{an overview of the}} one-sex {{stable population}} theory and a discussion of its importance in <b>mathematical</b> <b>demography.</b> Chapter 2 concentrates on the most problematic component of the Fredrickson-Hoppensteadt model, namely the marriage function. The marriage function is an unknown nonlinear operator which assigns the density of single males and single females to the density of marriages. We also consider a simulation based approach to comparing the marriage functions and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. In Chapter 3 we analyze the Fredrickson-Hoppensteadt model and we prove existence and uniqueness of continuous and classical solutions while keeping the assumptions on the parameters to a minimum and as close to physical reality as possible. In Chapter 4 we show that the Fredrickson-Hoppensteadt model supports persistent solutions (that is, separable solutions in which the time dependent function is an exponential) with a common growth rate for males and females and with a general form of the marriage operator. This result extends a known result for a specific form of the marriage operator. The construction presented here, although more complex, shares properties with the one-sex stable population theory. We believe it provides a good starting point {{for the development of a}} two-sex population theory. ...|$|E

To generalize the fixed rate stable model to the changing rate dynamic model, this paper explores the mathematical regularities that underlie the behavior of all populations. At any time, the composition of a population can be {{expressed in terms of}} current circumstances, using the rates of a "latent" stable model. Closed form solutions for the equations governing dynamic multistate models are not always possible, but are presented for certain special cases. Those solutions provide opportunities for specifying dynamic models of potentially great value, especially for analyses of cyclical and hierarchical populations. dynamic, <b>mathematical</b> <b>demography,</b> multistate, population models, stable population...|$|E
40|$|A central theorem in <b>mathematical</b> <b>demography</b> {{tells us}} that the age {{distribution}} of a closed population with unchanging fertility and mortality behavior must converge to a fixed and stable form. Proofs rely on ready-made theorems borrowed from linear algebra or from asymptotic transform theory, notably the Perron-Frobenius and the Tauberian theorems. But while these are efficient and expedient, they give little insight into the mechanisms that forces the age distribution to converge. This paper proposes a simple argument for convergence. An elementary device allows us to view the birth sequence as the product of an exponential sequence and a weighted smoothing process. Smoothing progressively damps out the peaks and hollows in the initial birth sequence; thus the birth sequence gradually becomes exponential, and this forces the age distribution to assume a fixed and final form...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} Keyfitz’s population momentum, a special case of inertia in long-term population size resulting from demographic transition to the stationary population growth rate. Yet, population inertia can be produced by any demographic perturbation (i. e., not just perturbations that produce stationary growth). Insight into applied population dynamics, population ecology, and life history evolution has been gained using perturbation analysis of the population growth rate. However, a similar, generalized framework for perturbation analysis of population inertia has not been developed. We derive general formulas for the sensitivity of population inertia to change in any vital rate or initial population structure. These formulas are readily computable, and we provide examples of their potential use in life history and applied studies of populations. age distribution, life histories, <b>mathematical</b> <b>demography,</b> migration flow, pest control, stable population...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{attempts}} {{to apply the}} results of martingale theory in probability theory have shown that {{it is first necessary}} to interpret this abstract mathematical theory in more conventional terms. One example of this is the need to obtain a representation of the dual predictable projections (compensators) used in martingale theory in terms of probability distributions. However, up to now a representation of this type has been derived only for one special case. In this paper, the author gives probabilistic representations of the dual predictable projection of integer-valued random measures that correspond to jumps in a semimartingale with respect to the sigma-algebras generated by this process. The results are of practical importance because such dual predictable projections are usually interpreted as random intensities or hazard rates related to jumps in trajectories: applications are found in such fields as <b>mathematical</b> <b>demography</b> and risk analysis...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in <b>mathematical</b> <b>demography</b> offer a new, simple means of producing long-range population projections.

Building upon recent results in the formal demography of nonstable populations, the authors show that analytic methods produce estimates of future population size very similar to those obtained through traditional methods. Simplicity is a virtue in making projections, allowing sensitivity tests of assumptions and avoiding the misleading impression of precision associated with more complicated methods. Cohort-component methods should still be used for short- and medium-term forecasts and projections. For the long term, however, analytic methods should supplement or even replace traditional projections. Copyright 2002 by The Population Council, Inc [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A {{large part}} of <b>mathematical</b> <b>demography</b> is built upon one {{fundamental}} theorem, the "strong ergodic theorem" of demography. If the fertility and mortality age-schedules of a population remain unchanged over time, its age distribution, no matter what its initial shape, will converge in time to a fixed and stable form. In brief, when demographic behavior remains unchanged, the population, it is said, converges to stability. This short paper presents a new argument for the convergence of the age structure, one that is self-contained, and that brings the mechanism behind convergence into full view. The idea is simple. Looked at directly, {{the dynamics of the}} age-distribution say little to our normal intuition. Looked at from a slightly different angle though, population dynamics define a smoothing or averaging process over the generations [...] a process comfortable to our intuition.

40|$|Conflicting {{claims have}} been {{published}} concerning the consequences of earlier reproduction. In particular, it has been claimed that earlier reproduction will increase the rate of decline in a declining population, have no effect in a stable population, and enhance {{the rate of growth}} in an increasing population. However, if fecundity and mortality are conceptually separated so that earlier reproduction is defined as moving the fecundity column of the life table forward in time but not changing the mortality column, then earlier reproduction will nearly always cause the rate of change of a population to become more positive. This definition is believed to be more consistent with what biologists think of as earlier reproduction. Also, this concept requires that the cost of reproducing earlier be explicitly addressed rather than hiding it in assumptions implicit in a definition of earlier reproduction.

These characteristics can either change over the life course of individuals or from one generation to the next.

Although these indices are assumed to be interchangeable, little research has been conducted to show under which conditions this assumption is appropriate, or how to compare their responses to the underlying mortality schedule. We compare seven indices of lifespan variation: life disparity, the Gini coefficient, the standard deviation, the variance, Theil's index, the mean logarithmic deviation, and the inter-quartile range. We derive the sensitivity and elasticity of each index by applying Markov chain theory and matrix calculus. Using empirical French and Russian male data we compare the underlying sensitivities to mortality change under different mortality regimes in order to test under which conditions the indices might differ in their conclusions about the magnitude of lifespan variation. Finally we demonstrate how integrating these sensitivities {{can be used as a}} method of age decomposition.

Some of the theory relates population to variables pertaining to the economy, to technology, or to social change; to use such models would require forecasts of the independent variables of the models. We know much about how fertility depends on income, but until we can forecast income (say 20 years ahead) that relation tells nothing about future population.
