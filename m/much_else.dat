5|$|During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez {{was doing}} {{geologic}} research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop {{on the walls}} of a gorge whose limestone layers included strata both above and below the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary is a thin layer of clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and <b>much</b> <b>else</b> became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.|$|E
5|$|In November 1965, {{together}} with four business partners, David opened Elizabeth David Ltd, a shop selling kitchen equipment, at 46 Bourne Street, Pimlico. The partners were {{spurred on by}} the closure of a professional kitchenware shop in Soho on the retirement of its owner, and the recent success of Terence Conran's Habitat shops, which sold among <b>much</b> <b>else</b> imported kitchen equipment for which there was evidently a market. Among her customers were Albert and Michel Roux, who shopped there for equipment that they would otherwise have to buy in France.|$|E

5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult {{to grow in the}} wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not <b>much</b> <b>else</b> is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|The 1906 {{exhibition}} of Gauguin's work left Picasso {{more than ever}} in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and <b>much</b> <b>else</b> besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping {{a new source of}} divine energy.|$|E
5|$|Bede, who is {{the main}} source for this information, is unclear on his {{chronology}} relating to Wighard. At {{one point in the}} Historia Ecclesiastica, he states that Canterbury had been vacant for some time before Wighard's election, but in other writings he implies that Wighard was appointed soon after the conclusion of the Council of Whitby, which likely took place in 664. However Wighard was selected, he died in Rome. His death possibly occurred around 664, but could have been as late as 667. It may have been caused by the bubonic plague, or perhaps was due to some other disease epidemic. Like <b>much</b> <b>else</b> in his life, it is unclear if he was actually consecrated before his death. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Wighard states that he died before consecration. The historian Peter Blair, however, states that Wighard died {{as he was about to}} head home to Canterbury, after his consecration.|$|E

5|$|Trafford Park {{was largely}} {{turned over to}} the {{production}} of war materiel during the Second World War, such as the Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power the Spitfire, Hurricane, Mosquito and the Lancaster. The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey Bridges, and <b>much</b> <b>else.</b> ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.|$|E
5|$|Like so <b>much</b> <b>else,</b> {{this is hard}} to say, but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E

50|$|Early (pre-Second World War) Australian {{science fiction}} was often what today one could {{consider}} racist and xenophobic, fueled by contemporary worries about invasion and foreigners.
