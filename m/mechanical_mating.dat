5000|$|While mating {{calls in}} insects are usually {{associated}} with <b>mechanical</b> <b>mating</b> calls, such as in crickets, several species of insects use vocalizations to attract mates. In the Asian corn borer, males emit clicking sounds that mimic the echolocation of bats which prey on the moths. They then {{take advantage of the}} female's [...] "freezing" [...] response to mate with the female.|$|E
40|$|The NASA Lunar Electric Rover (LER) {{has been}} {{developed}} at Johnson Space Center as a next generation mobility platform. Based upon a twelve wheel omni-directional chassis with active suspension the LER introduces a number of novel capabilities for lunar exploration in both manned and unmanned scenarios. Besides being the primary vehicle for astronauts on the lunar surface, LER will perform tasks such as lunar regolith handling (to include dozing, grading, and excavation), equipment transport, and science operations. In an effort to support these additional tasks a team at the Kennedy Space Center has produced a universal attachment interface for LER known as the Quick Attach. The Quick Attach is a compact system that has been retro-fitted {{to the rear of}} the LER giving it the ability to dock and undock on the fly with various implements. The Quick Attach utilizes a two stage docking approach; the first is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>mate</b> which aligns and latches a passive set of hooks on an implement with an actuated cam surface on LER. The mechanical stage is tolerant to misalignment between the implement and the LER during docking and once the implement is captured a preload is applied to ensure a positive lock. The second stage is an umbilical connection which consists of a dust resistant enclosure housing a compliant mechanism that is optionally actuated to mate electrical and fluid connections for suitable implements. The Quick Attach system was designed with the largest foreseen input loads considered including excavation operations and large mass utility attachments. The Quick Attach system was demonstrated at the Desert Research And Technology Studies (D-RA TS) field test in Flagstaff, AZ along with the lightweight dozer blade LANCE. The LANCE blade is the first implement to utilize the Quick Attach interface and demonstrated the tolerance, speed, and strength of the system in a lunar analog environment...|$|R

This paper studies the effect of such grooves on the squeeze load characteristics, and hence on the damping capacity, of bearings. A {{comparison}} is given between the damping capacity of bearings with grooved lands and that of bearings with equivalent flat lands to give the same pressure flow characteristics. Different bearing configurations, representing thrust and journal applications, are analysed and discussed. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{selected}} deficiencies of spline connections, such as angular or parallel misalignment (eccentricity) and excessive play. It is emphasized how important these deficiencies are for smooth {{operation of the}} entire driving units. The aim {{of the study is}} to provide a kind of a reference list with such deficiencies with visual symptoms of wear, specification of <b>mechanical</b> measurements for <b>mating</b> surfaces, mathematical description of waveforms for dynamic variability of motion in such connections and visualizations of the connection behaviour acquired {{with the use of the}} FAM-C and FDM-A. Attention is paid to hazards to flight safety when excessively worn spline connections are operated for long periods of tim...|$|R
40|$|The {{tribological}} {{performances of}} Cr/GLC film coupling with Si 3 N 4, SiC, WC, Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 were comparatively studied in seawater. Results {{indicated that the}} Cr/GLC film coupling with different ceramic counterparts exhibited different friction behaviors, which was {{closely related to the}} <b>mechanical</b> performances of <b>mating</b> ceramics. Meanwhile, the tribo-chemical products between the Cr/GLC film and ceramics also {{played an important role in}} improving the tribological performances. Friction coefficient and wear rate of the Cr/GLC film sliding against Si 3 N 4 were lower than others, which indicated that the Cr/GLC film coupled to Si 3 N 4 ceramic exhibited optimum tribological performance in seawater.

Pavla Doležalová Number of pages: 94 Number of attachments: 4 Year of defense: 2011 Keywords: heart failure, cardiac <b>mechanical</b> support, Heart <b>Mate</b> II, {{the quality}} of life, qualitative research, content analysis This bachelor's thesis deals with the life of patients with implanted mechanical cardiac support HeartMate II. It views the patients' life from several angles and examines in particular the changes caused {{by the presence of}} cardiac support in their body. The work is divided into three main parts. The clinical part is an overview of etiology and treatment of the heart failure. It also contains chapters devoted to the mechanical cardiac supports. The methodological part deals with methods for evaluation of {{the quality of}} life and describes the methodology of the qualitative research which is often applied in empirical practice. Identification of patients' view on quality of their life was held by the half standardized interview. After analyzing these interviews, it has clearly shown that despite of slight limitations, the patients with HeartMate II live full-value life, resembling to the life [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{living organisms}} use pheromones for inter-individual communication. In Drosophila melanogaster flies, several pheromones {{perceived}} either by contact/at {{a short distance}} (cuticular hydrocarbons, CHs), or at a longer distance (cisvaccenyl acetate, cVA), affect courtship and mating behaviours. However, it has not previously been possible to precisely identify all potential pheromonal compounds and simultaneously monitor their variation on a time scale. To overcome this limitation, we combined Solid Phase Micro-Extraction with gas-chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry. This allowed us (i) to identify 59 cuticular compounds, including 17 new CHs; (ii) to precisely quantify the amount of each compound that could be detected by another fly, and (iii) to measure the variation of these substances {{as a function of}} aging and mating. Sex-specific variation appeared with age, while mating affected cuticular compounds in both sexes with three possible patterns: variation was (i) reciprocal in the two sexes, suggesting a passive <b>mechanical</b> transfer during <b>mating,</b> (ii) parallel in both sexes, such as for cVA which strikingly appeared during mating, or (iii) unilateral, presumably as a result of sexual interaction. We provide a complete reassessment of all Drosophila CHs and suggest that the chemical conversation between male and female flies is far more complex than is generally accepted. We conclude that focusing on individual compounds will not provide a satisfactory understanding of the evolution and function of chemica...|$|R
40|$|As per {{the modern}} Industrial requirements, higher surface finish <b>mechanical</b> {{components}} and <b>mating</b> parts with close limits and tolerances, {{is one of}} the most important requirement. Abrasive machining processes are generally the last operations performed on manufactured products for higher surface finishing and for fine or small scale material removal. Higher surface finish and high rate of removal can be obtained if a large number of grains act together. This is accomplished by using bonded abrasives as in grinding wheel or by modern machining processes. In the present study, Taguchi method or Design of experiments has been used to optimize the effect of cylindrical grinding parameters such as wheel speed (rpm), work speed, feed (mm/min.), depth of cut and cutting fluid on the surface roughness of EN 15 AM steel. Ground surface roughness measurements were carried out by Talysurf surface roughness tester. EN 15 AM steel has several industrial applications in manufacturing of engine shafts, connecting rods, spindles, studs, bolt, screws etc. The results indicated that grinding wheel speed, work piece speed, table feed rate and depth of cut were the significant factors for the surface roughness and material removal rate. Surface roughness is minimum at 2000 r. p. m. of grinding wheel speed, work piece speed 80 rpm, feed rate 275 mm/min. and 0. 06 mm depth of cut...|$|R
40|$|Homosexual {{mounting}} is {{a common}} behaviour in bed bugs as male sexual interest is directed towards any newly fed individual. The only mode of copulation in the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, is by traumatic insemination, where the male pierces the female abdomen with his needle-like penis. Homosexual mating would result in abdominal injuries in mounted males, as males lack the female counteradaptive spermalege structure. I here show that bed bug alarm pheromones, previously hypothesized to be a predator chemical defence, {{can be used by}} newly fed males to signal their sex and reduce the risk of homosexual <b>mating.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> blocking of the male pheromone glands significantly increased homosexual mounting duration compared to control males, while applying male extracts containing mainly alarm pheromone onto male-female mating pairs completely interrupted or shortened mating duration and reduced sperm transfer. Males confined with other males received piercing scars, demonstrating that homosexual mating occurs. The focal males in the all-male confinement experiment had reduced longevity compared to singly held males, but why this reduction in longevity occurred is not clear. Mounted males thus benefit from being able to discharge alarm pheromones, while mounting males consider the alarm signal a major sex identification cue, suggesting that male bed bugs use alarm pheromone communication to avoid homosexual harassment and mounting.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 In the {{cockroach}} Leucophaea maderae, a centre in {{the brain}} controls the female's acceptance of courting males. This centre is affected by starvation. A brief exposure to food can induce mating but is inadequate for oocyte development. In fed L. maderae {{there appears to be}} a synergistic action of nutrition and mating in controlling the rate of oocyte development. <b>Mating</b> (<b>mechanical)</b> and feeding (chemical) stimuli are both required for activating the corpora allata (CA) to their fullest extent so that the oocytes mature at their maximum rate. A rate of 0. 4 mm/day of oocyte growth was recorded. Activity of CA in vitro was quantified using a radiochemical assay. In starved virgin females, no detectable activity was recorded by our assay conditions. The CA were virtually inactive and yolk was not deposited in the oocytes; mating had no effect on CA and oocyte development in starved females. Experiments with fed females showed that feeding increased CA activity to about 2 pmol JH-III/pair/hr of glands until the roaches were mated (11 - 12 days after eclosion). After mating, the activity of the CA increased over a period of 9 days to a peak of 52. 7 ± 1. 5 pmol JH-III/hr/pair of glands. Farnesol stimulation experiments showed that the inhibition of juvenile hormone synthesis in virgin females was exerted early in the biosynthetic pathway...|$|R
