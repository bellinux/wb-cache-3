500|$|The {{bodywork}} {{was made}} from two injection-moulded polypropylene shells supplied by three manufacturers; J.J. Harvey of Manchester made the moulds, Linpac provided the shells, and ICI supplied the raw material. According to Rodney Dale, the upper shell mould was [...] "one of the largest – if not the largest – injection mouldings of its type in the UK: possibly even in the world". The manufacturing process reflected Sinclair's ambition for the C5 production line. A single <b>mould</b> <b>set</b> was capable of producing up to 4,000 parts every week. The {{two parts of the}} shell were joined together by wrapping a tape around the joint, aligning them on a jig, pressing them together and passing an electric current through the tape to heat and melt it. The same process was used to make the front and rear bumper assemblies of the Austin Maestro and only took about 70 seconds to complete. Although Sinclair had considered producing the C5 at the DeLorean plant at Dunmurry in Northern Ireland, which had one of Europe's most advanced automated plastic-body manufacturing facilities, this was not to be, as the DeLorean Motor Company failed in a controversial bankruptcy that resulted in the plant's closure.|$|E

Sitting on a white stepped base, and attached to a white back plate which runs to the entablature, is a pedestal. The pedestal’s central panel contains inscriptions within a white bolection <b>mould.</b> <b>Set</b> back on either side are inset white oblong raised panels—the top has a projected moulding following the plinth’s horizontal facets.

The entablature contains a white architrave with a plain black frieze above. From the front face of the cornice hangs two heraldic shields. The curved pediment is segmented, with the central open part containing a decorative urn. The inscriptions on the monument appear white, but were reported in 1806 as gilded. The upper panel inscription is to Sir Edmund Turnor—brother of Sir Christopher Turnor [...] (1607–1675), Baron of the Exchequer in 1660—and his wife, Dame Margaret (1627–1679). Turnor, knighted in 1663, was the youngest son of Christopher Turnor (died 1619) of Milton Erneyst, {{and was the first}} Turnor to take possession of the Stoke Rochford estates through marriage settlement for Margaret, the daughter of Sir John Harrison of Balls Park, Hertfordshire and his wife, Margaret, of Fanshawe Gate Hall, Derbyshire. The pedestal inscription is to John Turnor, son to Sir Edmund and Dame Margaret. John Turnor was buried at Bath Abbey in 1719. He married Diana (buried 1736), the only child of Algernon Cecil, son to the Earl of Salisbury. John and Diana's only surviving son, Edmund, was buried at Grantham in 1763. Edmund had married Elizabeth, co-heir of Henry Ferne of Snitterton Hall, Derbyshire. Elizabeth was buried at Hammersmith in 1763. Also recorded is John (died 1752), the younger son of Edmund and Elizabeth, who was captain in the King’s Regiment of Dragoon Guards in the battles of Detingen and Fonteny, and died at Kirmond, near where he was buried.|$|E

5000|$|RTM is {{a process}} using a rigid two-sided <b>mould</b> <b>set</b> that forms both {{surfaces}} of the panel. The mould is typically constructed from aluminum or steel, but composite molds are sometimes used. The two sides fit together to produce a mould cavity. The distinguishing feature of resin transfer moulding is that the reinforcement materials are placed into this cavity and the <b>mould</b> <b>set</b> is closed prior {{to the introduction of}} matrix material. Resin transfer moulding includes numerous varieties which differ in the mechanics of how the resin is introduced to the reinforcement in the mould cavity. These variations include everything from the RTM methods used in out of autoclave composite manufacturing for high-tech aerospace components to vacuum infusion (for resin infusion see also boat building) to vacuum assisted resin transfer moulding (VARTM).

On the lower side is a rigid mould and on the upper side is a flexible membrane made from silicone or an extruded polymer film such as nylon. Reinforcement materials can be placed manually or robotically. They include continuous fibre forms fashioned into textile constructions. Most often, they are pre-impregnated with the resin {{in the form of}} prepreg fabrics or unidirectional tapes. In some instances, a resin film is placed upon the lower mould and dry reinforcement is placed above. The upper mould is installed and vacuum is applied to the mould cavity. The assembly is placed into an autoclave. This process is generally performed at both elevated pressure and elevated temperature. The use of elevated pressure facilitates a high fibre volume fraction and low void content for maximum structural efficiency.|$|E

50|$|When seed {{is first}} {{separated}} from cones it {{is mixed with}} foreign matter, often 2 to 5 times {{the volume of the}} seed. The more or less firmly attached membranous wings on the seed must be detached before it is cleaned of foreign matter. The testa must not incur damage during the dewinging process. Two methods have been used, dry and wet. Dry seed may be rubbed gently through a sieve that has a mesh through which only seed without wings can pass. Large quantities of seed can be processed in dewinging machines, which use cylinders of heavy wire mesh and rapidly revolving stiff brushes within to remove the wings. In the wet process, seed with wings attached are spread out 10 cm to 15 cm deep on a tight floor and slightly moistened throughout; light leather flails are used to free seed from the wings. Wang (1973) described a unique wet dewinging procedure using a cement mixer, used at the Petawawa tree seed processing facility. Wings of white and Norway spruce seed can be removed by dampening the seed slightly before it is run through a fanning mill for the last time.

40|$|The {{classical}} moulds {{which are}} currently used for forming the soles {{directly on the}} uppers, allow obtaining one sole model. One mould for each foot is made, {{and at least one}} mould for each size number in the size number series. To manufacture one single sole model in the sizes series an average <b>set</b> of 16 <b>moulds</b> are needed. Changing the model implies the entire production of a new <b>set</b> of <b>moulds.</b> Therefore, a large diversification of the soles requires the manufacturing a quantity of <b>moulds</b> <b>sets</b> equal with the quantity of sole models. In this paper are presented solutions to obtain more cavity shapes in the same mould, through the use of modular interchangeable pieces. The moulds with versatile cavities have the same functional characteristics as the moulds with unique cavities, are usable on the same type of machines and can be used independently or together with the classical moulds. A brief analysis on the technological processes for manufacturing moulds with versatile cavities reveals a significant lowering of the manufacturing time for moulds in which will be obtained other sole models. This {{is due to the fact}} that some of the mould parts are reused. In conclusion, the producers that chose this type of moulds can launch on the market new models in a shorter time and at lower prices. ...|$|R

They are made {{in a number of}} discrete stages beginning with deposition of unaerated shell chocolate into the bar moulds. A frozen cone shaped to fit into the bar is then pushed down to spread the liquid chocolate into the entire <b>mould</b> and <b>set</b> it. The aerated chocolate is then deposited into the centre and the moulds are shaken to distribute the chocolate evenly in the cavity. This is then chilled to set the bubbly chocolate in place before a final backing off deposit is created to give the back. The moulds are then shaken again to get a flat even back. The moulds are specially shaped to ensure that no meniscus is formed on the bottom, which can give the chocolate a scuffed appearance and also cause issues with the machines when they break off and build up. The bars are then chilled again for a longer period. This helps to make the chocolate contract for easier demoulding. The moulds are then tipped over and hammered to demould the bars, which then go to the packaging section.|$|R
