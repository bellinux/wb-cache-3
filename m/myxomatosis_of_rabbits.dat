40|$|In 1927, a {{preliminary}} report (1) was made concerning certain features of a disease designated by Sanarelli as infectious <b>myxomatosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rabbits.</b> The {{purpose of the present}} communication is to amplify the previous report and to record some results of subsequent work. Infectious myxomatosis is a malady indigenous to rabbits of South America and was first described by Sanarelli (2) in 1898. The disease, as he saw it, was characterized by the presence of nodules in the skin in the neighborhood of the eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and genitalia. A conjunctivitis, accompanied by a profuse purulent discharge, resulted from the involvement of the skin around the eyes. The disease ran a rapid course, death of the ~n~roals usually occurring within 1 or 2 weeks after infection. Upon palpation the tumors were firm and on section revealed a gelatinous consistency. Histologically they were found to be comprised of gelatinous material, large steUate cells, and blood vessels. The lymph nodes and spleen were enlarged, and, in histological preparations of the latter, nests of the large stellate cells were observed. The presence of the virus was demonstrate...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} secure further {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} different viruses and to investigate the immunological relation of closely related ones, it is advantageous if not absolutely essential that the infectious agents be obtained in a relatively pure state in amounts adequate for thorough study. The manner in which this can be accomplished varies with the virus under investigation. Stanley (1) has demonstrated that precipitation and crystallization are methods whereby large amounts of certain plant viruses can be obtained. Ledingham (2) showed that by differential centrifugation the elementary bodies of vaccinia and fowl pox, which either represent the infectious units of these maladies or with which they are intimately associated, can be obtained in a state sufficiently pure for purposes of serological investigations in which a coverslip technique is used. Craigie (S) also used differential centrifugation for the collection of elementary bodies of vaccinia, but Ms method is more practicable than Ledingham's in that large amounts of the bodies in a relatively pure state can be obtained with ease and regularity. Parker and l~ivers (4) have made extensive use of Craigie's method in their chemical and immunological studies of the elementary bodies of vaccinia.

40|$|Mammalian {{cancer as}} well as the Rous chicken sarcoma has been {{successfully}} transplanted into the anterior chamber of the eyes of guinea pigs. It was of interest, therefore, to see if the infectious <b>myxomatosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rabbits,</b> another representative of the infectious tumors, could be grown in the anterior chamber of the guinea pig eye, and, if growth occurred, to compare the tumor's behaviour with that of growths of the above mentioned etiology. Forty-three full-grown guinea pigs from mixed stocks were used throughout, and seventy-eight heterologous transplantation experiments were performed. The grafts measuring less than 2 mm. in diameter were cut from the subcutaneous tissue in skin lesions of rabbits with infectious myxomatosis recently killed. The transfer to the anterior chamber was performed after the usual technique. Some degree of partial survival was found in 23, 8 % of the grafts, in which typical myxoma cells could be demonstrated fifteen days after the transplantation. The transplant apparently does not increase in size, differing in that respect from that of the Rous chicken sarcoma, which increases in size by 2 or 3 diameters in 2 weeks (Shrigley, Greene & Duran-Reynals, 1945). The virus was still alive in 26 % of the grafts 21 days after transplantation, and was able to induce a typical disease when injected to normal rabbits.

40|$|The {{interaction}} among several parasites in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{is crucial to}} host fitness and to the epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>myxomatosis</b> and <b>rabbit</b> hemorrhagic disease.

Taking advantage of an experimental restocking program in Spain, the effects of coccidian and nematode infections on the probability of having detectable antibody to myxoma and rabbit hemorrhagic disease viruses were tested in European wild rabbits. For 14 mo, we monitored rabbit abundance and parasite loads (coccidia and nematodes) in three reintroduced rabbit populations. While coccidian and nematode loads explained seasonal antibody prevalences to myxoma virus, the pattern was less clear for rabbit hemorrhagic disease. Contrary to expectations, prevalence of antibody to myxoma virus was inversely proportional to coccidian load, while nematode load seemed to play a minor role.

40|$|Myxoma virus (MYX) is a leporipoxvirus <b>of</b> <b>rabbits</b> that induces {{a lethal}} {{syndrome}} characterized by disseminated tumorlike lesions, generalized immunosuppression, and secondary gram-negative bacterial infection. A MYX deletion mutant (vMYX-GF- delta M 11 L) was constructed {{to remove the}} entire myxoma growth factor (MGF) coding sequence and that for the C-terminal five amino acids of the partially overlapping upstream gene, M 11 L. Unexpectedly, this deletion completely abrogates the capacity of MYX to cause the characteristic disease symptoms <b>of</b> <b>myxomatosis.</b> Upon inoculation <b>of</b> <b>rabbits</b> with vMYX-GF- delta M 11 L, recipient animals developed only a benign, localized nodule reminiscent of a Shope fibroma virus-induced tumor in which a single primary lesion appeared {{at the site of}} injection and then completely regressed within 14 days, leaving the animals resistant to challenge with wild-type MYX. No evidence of the purulent conjunctivitis and rhinitis that always accompany wild-type MYX infection was observed. To ascertain whether the attenuation observed in vMYX-GF- delta M 11 L was due to a combined effect of the MGF deletion and alteration of the upstream M 11 L gene, two additional MYX recombinants were constructed: an MGF- virus (vMYX-GF-) containing an intact M 11 L gene and an M 11 L- virus (vMYX-M 11 L-) containing an intact MGF gene. Infection with vMYX-GF- resulted in moderated symptoms <b>of</b> <b>myxomatosis,</b> but all clinical stages of the disease were still detectable. In contrast, disruption of M 11 L alone dramatically reduced the virus virulence, resulting in a nonlethal syndrome whose clinical course was nevertheless distinct from that of vMYX-GF- delta M 11 L. Upon inoculation with vMYX-M 11 L-, rabbits developed primary and secondary tumors which were larger and more circumscribed than those of wild-type MYX recipients. Whereas wild-type MYX infection always includes severe, purulent conjunctivitis and rhinitis, vMYX-M 11 L- recipients remained healthy and displayed only minimal signs of respiratory distress. By about 30 days after infection, the tumors induced by vMYX-M 11 L- had completely regressed and these animals were immune to challenge with wild-type MYX. Histological analysis indicated that tumors induced by vMYX-M 11 L- are much more heavily infiltrated with macrophages and heterophils and that the sites of viral replication are more edematous and necrotic than those of wild-type infection, suggesting that the host was able to mount a more vigorous inflammatory response to vMYX-M 11 L- infection.

Specimens of each ITS 2 variant were sequenced for portions of the mitochondrial COI, COII and nuclear EF- 1 alpha genes. Partitioned Bayesian and Maximum Parsimony analyses confirmed the monophyly of the Annulipes Complex and revealed at least 17 clades that we designate species A-Q. These species belong to two major clades, one in the north and one mainly in the south, suggesting that climate was a driver of species radiation. We found that 65 % (11) of the 17 sibling species recorded here had unique COI sequences, suggesting that DNA barcoding will be useful for diagnosing species within the Annulipes Complex. A comparison of the taxa revealed morphological characters that may be diagnostic for some species.

Rabbit fleas, the main vectors <b>of</b> <b>myxomatosis</b> in Britain, were present on full-grown rabbits in sufficient numbers for transmission to occur throughout the year, but the observed seasonal {{pattern of the}} disease appeared {{to be influenced by}} seasonal mass movements of these fleas.

Significantly more males than females, and more adults and immatures than juveniles, were observed to be infected by myxomatosis.

Much of the modern research into wild rabbit behaviour was carried out in the 1960s by two research centres.

40|$|The impact <b>of</b> <b>rabbit</b> {{haemorrhagic}} disease (RHD) on wild rabbit populations {{was assessed by}} comparing population parameters measured before the introduction of RHD into Australia in 1995 with population parameters after RHD. We used data from an arid inland area and a moist coastal area in South Australia to examine the timing and extent of RHD outbreaks, their interaction with myxomatosis and their effect on breeding, recruitment and seasonal abundance <b>of</b> <b>rabbits.</b> From this we propose a generalised conceptual model of how RHD affects rabbit populations in southern Australia. RHD decreased long-term average numbers <b>of</b> <b>rabbits</b> by 85 % in the arid area. In the coastal area, RHD decreased numbers <b>of</b> <b>rabbits</b> by 73 % {{in the first year}} but numbers gradually recovered and were only 12 % below pre-RHD numbers in the third year. Disease activity generally begins a month or two after the commencement of breeding in autumn or winter, peaks in early spring and ceases to be apparent in summer. Where the disease is most active, the pattern of population change is almost the inverse of the former pattern. During the breeding season, RHD severely suppresses rabbit numbers. Compensatory recruitment of late-born young, protected by maternal antibodies until the disease becomes inactive at the end of spring (also the end of breeding), allows the observed rabbit abundance to increase during summer, albeit to lower levels than before RHD. Maternal antibodies are lost during summer and the population becomes susceptible to RHD. The seasonal peak in myxomatosis activity is pushed back from late spring to early summer or autumn. Survivors <b>of</b> <b>myxomatosis</b> breed after opening rains in autumn but many succumb to RHD before raising their litters.

While the initial spread of RCD in Australia resulted in widespread rabbit mortality in affected areas, the possible population dynamic effects <b>of</b> RCD and <b>myxomatosis</b> operating within the same system have not been properly explored. Here we present early mathematical modelling examining the interaction between the two diseases. In this study we use a deterministic compartment model, based on the classical SIR model in infectious disease modelling.

We assume there is no cross-immunity due to either disease. The mathematical model allows for the possibility of both diseases to be simultaneously present in an individual, although results are also presented for the case where co infection is not possible, since co-infection is thought to be rare and questions exist as to whether it can occur. The simulation results of this investigation show that it is a crucial issue and should be part of future field studies.

40|$|In 1953 myxomatosis, a {{viral disease}} <b>of</b> <b>rabbits,</b> {{broke out in}} Britain for the first time. It rapidly killed tens of {{millions}} of the animals from Kent to the Shetlands. Many farmers and foresters welcomed a disease that virtually eliminated a long-standing and serious agricultural pest. Others were horrified by the sight of thousands of dead and dying animals. With meat still rationed, consumers rued the loss of a cheap and nutritious foodstuff. Rough shooters deplored the loss of prey and hatters and furriers the unavailability of the fur on which their businesses depended. Rabbits also had champions within the ‘establishment’; these included Winston Churchill who was personally influential in making deliberate transmission of the disease a criminal offence. The arrival in Britain <b>of</b> <b>myxomatosis</b> presented the authorities with difficult questions: should they try to contain it, spread it or do nothing; should they take advantage <b>of</b> <b>rabbit</b> depopulation and try to exterminate such a destructive animal? In the event the outbreak was allowed to run its course and rabbit extermination became government policy. This article considers who or what was responsible for the disease reaching the UK and how it then spread throughout the country. It examines the responses of government, other institutions and members of the public. Finally, it explores the impact <b>of</b> <b>rabbit</b> de-population on agriculture, the natural environment and public opinio...|$|R
