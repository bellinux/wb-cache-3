500|$|Before {{becoming}} {{a model to}} support her acting career, Guillory waited tables at a club. In an interview in 2000, she said about the experience [...] "Supporting my acting habit with waitressing {{was probably the most}} useful thing I've done." [...] During her time as a model, she studied acting at the New World School of the Arts and the Paris Conservatoire, also taking small television and film roles in The Future Lasts a Long Time (1996), The Rules of Engagement (1999), Star! Star! (1999), Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) (2000), The 3 Kings (2000), and Two Days, Nine Lives (2000). During this time, Guillory decided to go on with her acting career because [...] "I was so scared of going to university and being with people <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>age</b> again, having been with that tiny little sect of girls in Norfolk whose daddies were farmers and politicians, who didn't trust me and didn't know where I was coming from".|$|E
500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million years that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ... So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>age,</b> having played myself previously when 100-and-I-don't-know-what." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp had {{attempted}} to persuade EastEnders writer Tony Jordan to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her. Windsor had previously {{expressed a desire to}} join the cast of EastEnders. Chat show host Chris Evans of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement. However, Windsor was already in negotiations with the BBC about appearing in the serial. June Deitch, the EastEnders casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would [...] "like to play <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>age</b> for a change". At the time, the producers had already thought about reintroducing Peggy, and Windsor was cast despite originally being considered too [...] "well-known". Windsor has spoken of her [...] "terrified" [...] reaction to being asked to audition, commenting: [...] "I had the weekend to prepare and I cried all the time. I didn't know how to do soap acting. I was so used to using my hands, my eyes." [...] She auditioned with two scenes, one emotion, one [...] "jolly" [...] which Windsor has described as [...] "agony", explaining: [...] "I was afraid of playing Barbara Windsor, so when I had to laugh I went 'huh, huh'. Anything rather than 'tee, hee, hee'." [...] In an interview with the Walford Gazette, a US-based newspaper dedicated to EastEnders, Windsor commented on her casting: [...] "I was thrilled, I could rest my tired bones working on a marvelous television show that I deeply respected. I was very excited about the possibility [...] playing this feisty lady who would come in and shake up her two boys' lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|American {{pop singer}} Katy Perry cites [...] "Killer Queen" [...] as an {{important}} influence on her. She said: [...] "Queen's track 'Killer Queen' made me discover music and helped me come into <b>my</b> <b>own</b> at the <b>age</b> of 15. The way Freddie Mercury delivered his lyrics just {{made me feel like}} a confident woman." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{also had}} a {{personal}} significance for Parker, {{who says he was}} forced to examine his own marriage: [...] "It was a painful film to make for me because there were echoes of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> life in it. It was about a breakup of a marriage, and the children in the story were quite close to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> children in <b>age.</b> Shoot the Moon was very, very close to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> life." [...] He spent days with the writer Bo Goldman on developing a realistic story, and states that his marriage became [...] "infinitely stronger {{as a result of the}} film." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Consider then, my lady, and my wife, The solid {{comforts of}} a virtuous life. As, first, {{the love of}} Christ himself you gain; Next, your own honour undefiled maintain; [...] 560 And, lastly, that which sure your mind must move, My whole estate shall gratify your love: Make your own terms, and ere to-morrow's sun Displays his light, by heaven, it shall be done! I seal the {{contract}} with a holy kiss, And will perform, by this--my dear, and this-- Have comfort, spouse, nor think thy lord unkind; 'Tis love, not jealousy, that fires my mind! For when thy charms my sober thoughts engage, And join'd to them <b>my</b> <b>own</b> unequal <b>age,</b> [...] 570 From thy dear side I have no power to part, Such secret transports warm my melting heart. For who that once possess'd those heavenly charms, Could live one moment absent from thy arms?' ...|$|R

40|$|I was {{the eldest}} of four {{children}} from a working class family in which curiosity and creativity were not valued. After high school I woorked as a secretary in an advertising company. Ten years and two daughters later, my husband encouraged me to find and pursue a creative passion and this led me to photography. With camera in hand I found myself drawn to family relationships and the pivotal life events: birth, aging, illness and death. I made portraits of an elder generation of country farmers, urban and rural mothers and daughters, my grandmother in Brooklyn and self-portraits with my mother. Over {{the course of my}} journey as an artist, the passage of time continued to intrigue me. I focused on honoring family history, relationship to family and to one’s self, and the physical beauty of my subject’s bodies and gestures. I was fascinated by the way in which these elements are both rendered and revealed in a two-dimensional photograph. More recently, as a part of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>aging</b> process, <b>my</b> work has become more abstract. I now find myself eager to be surrounded by nature, meditating and photographing in a dynamic yet peaceful way. I have taken part in solo and group exhibitions both nationally and internationally. My photographs are in many private collections and in the Fogg Art Museum, The Berkshire Museum and the Museum Of Fine Arts in Houston. My work has been featured in numerous books including “Sacred Connections: Stories of Adoption” and “A Gate Unfastened” which chronicles my journey through breast cancer. I have received two artist fellowships and the Catalogue Project Award from the New York Foundation for the Arts, been a fellow at the Yaddo and MacDowell Art Colonies and have received the Annenberg Medical Art Award for “When Death Comes” a photo essay about the death of my husband Peter...|$|R
40|$|I {{grew up in}} {{a family}} where helping others was a given. My parents have always been generous with their time, their money, and their {{tangible}} donations. I can remember many occasions when we took food, clothes, or household items to families in our community who were in desperate need of such basic necessities. As a fitting result, I now encourage <b>my</b> <b>own</b> children, <b>ages</b> twelve and fourteen, to volunteer. We assist families during the holidays, make and deliver lunches to children for a local ministry’s summer lunch program, and work with a local pet adoption facility to help homeless dogs find permanent homes, {{just to name a few}} of the ways we try to help out locally. Fortunately, many of today’s youth have ample opportunities to serve others, not just within their own families but in their schools as well, from elementary age all the way through college. Collection drives for school supplies and canned/dried foods have become commonplace for the students in my community. It is a wonderful sight when kindergartners hop off of the school buses and rush to place their packs of paper and pencils or cans of soup in the designated bins for their less fortunate peers. What a wonderful example of service at such an early age...|$|R
6000|$|In {{a letter}} written to me {{a few weeks after}} this time, upon an {{occasion}} when he divined that some word from him would be more than commonly dear, he recurred to the feeling he then expressed: [...] "Fifty-six years ago--more than half a century--I lost <b>my</b> <b>own</b> father, his <b>age</b> being seventy-three years. As I have reached that period of life, passed it, and now left it far behind, my recollections seem to brighten and bring back my boyhood and early manhood in a clearer and fairer light than it came to me in my middle decades. I have often wished of late years that I could tell him how I cherished his memory; perhaps I may have the happiness of saying all I long to tell him {{on the other side of}} that thin partition which I love to think is all that divides us." ...|$|R

But whether so or not, I was put in youth to a very genteel boarding-school, the mistress being no less a lady than yourself, of about your <b>own</b> <b>age</b> or it may be some years younger, and a poorness of blood flowed from the table which has run through my life.’ ...|$|R
