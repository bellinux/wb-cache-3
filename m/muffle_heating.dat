Similarly, the pre-treated PKS was treated again using dilute acid (10, 20 and 30 % wt/wt H 3 PO 4). This was done to determine the appropriate surface area at which if the surface area obtained by using dilute acid was high, then the use of concentrated acid can be reduced and the experimental costs will be less. This ratio (1 : 1) implied that 10  g of the raw PKSs was soaked in 10  g of H 3 PO 4 for 24  h.

40|$|Kaolinite is {{commonly}} used as a coating in the paper industry, and as a filler in the plastics industry. Therefore {{it is crucial that}} the particles are not flocculated. In order to achieve a stable system the surface chemistry is manipulated such that strong repulsive inter-particle forces are present. This paper then investigates the changes in the surface chemistry of a commercial kaolinite after treatment in a muffle furnace and in glow-discharge plasma. The effect of the surface treatment on the zeta potential of the kaolinite was investigated by electroacoustic means. Furnace heating lead to a decrease in the magnitude of the zeta potential at the natural pH, and the zeta potential was always negative over the pH range studied. No iso-electric point was found, rather a minima in the magnitude of the zeta potential was observed at a pH of 3. 5. This minima was shifted to higher pH values after treatment. Analysis of the surfaces of the kaolinite particles was also performed by the use of a DVS Advantage (SMS UK Ltd). The <b>muffle</b> furnace <b>heated</b> kaolinite had a lower water uptake than the untreated kaolinite implying changes to the hydrophobic/ hydrophilic nature of the kaolinite surfaces. Normally dispersants are added to kaolinite suspensions to aid dispersions. As kaolinite is processed at a rate of several millions of tonnes per annum, a small reduction in the amount of dispersant required could result in a significant economic saving...|$|R

40|$|Biochar is a {{fine-grained}} {{and highly}} porous carbonaceous substance, {{arising from the}} pyrolitic decomposition of natural or synthetic organic materials. It is lately applied to soils to favorably affect soil physico-chemical properties, such as water and nutrient retention and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The extent {{of the effect of}} biochar on crop productivity is very variable due to the different biophysical interactions and processes that occur when it is applied to soils. Char properties are greatly influenced by both natures of feedstock and process conditions. An accurate characterization of biochar is crucial to evaluate the possibility to amend soil with such material by avoiding environmental damages.

To solve {{the difficulty of the}} disk-type fly ash filter, five types of granule filters, including a ball type, tube type, and sponge-structure type have been made. Among them, the best filter type was chosen through simple crucible tests. The five types of granule filters packed into containers were loaded into five alumina crucibles of 50 cc. Five grams of CsNO 3 was used as a gaseous cesium source. They were then placed in a <b>muffle</b> furnace and <b>heated</b> to 900 °C and maintained for 2 hours. After the experiment, the weights of the cesium trapped filters were measured. Among the five types of granule filters, the sponge-structure type granule filter was the best, which has the highest trapping capacity of cesium. Its capacity is 0. 42 g-Cs/g-filter. The chosen sponge-structure type granule filters and disk-type filters have been tested using a two-zone tube furnace. Cs volatilization and Cs trapping zones were maintained at 900 and 1000 °C, respectively. Sixteen grams of CsNO 3 was used as a gaseous cesium source.

40|$|High-purity oleate esters can {{decrease}} the melting points {{and improve the}} oxidative stability of lubricants. High-oleic soybean oil (HOSO) was esterified to butyl or isopropyl esters. Fractional distillation and low-temperature crystallization were applied to improve the purity of oleate of HOSO esters. Although the purity of butyl esters of HOSO attained 91. 8 % by fractional distillation, the rate of distillation must be slow which made this approach not very feasible. After subjecting the esters to a two-step crystallization at reduced temperatures, the percentage of oleate in the HOSO esters was increased from 83. 2 to 92. 5 %. The percentage of saturated fatty acids decreased to less than 2. 2 %, but polyunsaturates percentage remained almost unchanged. Methyl linoleate monolayer has a highest lipid oxidation rate. It can be employed to produce useful oxidation products including expoxides and hydroxides. Methyl linoleate (20 % by weight) was coated to silica gel H to form monolayers and heated at 35, 40, 50 and 60 yC. Methyl palmitate (5 % by weight of methyl linoleate) was added as internal standard. The identification of oxidation products was by comparison to standards. The oxidation rate increased with temperature. The temperature for optimal yields of epoxides (20. 26 %) and total non-scission products (NSPs, 38. 79 %) was 50 yC. Citric acid and EDTA (0. 01 % and 0. 02 % by weight of oil) were added as chelating agents to minimize the effects of iron on oxidation. Citric acid at 0. 01 % achieved higher PV and also reduced the loss of NSPs to scission products (SPs) after reaching the maximum peroxide value. The addition of 20 ppm vanadium (by weight of silica gel) increased the yield of epoxides (23. 85 %); however, it also led to lower peroxide values and longer induction period.

Gasification technology has a high potential for reducing biomass energy consumption whilst increasing access to modern energy services. The key aspect for the failure of gasification operations in the Lake Victoria Basin is inadequate adaptation of gasification equipment to fuel characteristics, lack of fuel specification and inappropriate material choice. We therefore investigated the thermo-chemical characterisation of six biomass fuels, namely Pinus caribaea, Calitris robusta, Cupressus lusitanica, Eucalyptus grandis, Pinus patula and sugarcane bagasse from selected regions of the Lake Victoria Basin. Ultimate analysis was done using a Flash 2000 elemental analyser. Moisture content, ash content and volatile matter were determined in oven and <b>muffle</b> furnaces while <b>heating</b> values were determined using a Gallenkamp calorimeter. The mean percentage levels obtained indicate that all six biomass fuels had a mean range for nitrogen of 0. 07 ± 0. 2 – 0. 25 ± 0. 07 %, for carbon of 40. 45 ± 0. 61 – 48. 88 ± 0. 29 %, for hydrogen of 4. 32 ± 0. 13 – 5. 59 ± 0. 18 % and for oxygen of 43. 41 ± 1. 58 – 51. 1 ± 0. 64 %.

Heating values ranged between 16. 95 ± 0. 10 MJ/kg and 19. 48 ± 0. 42 MJ/kg. The results suggest that all six biomass fuels are potential biomass gasification materials...|$|R
40|$|THE {{microstructure}} of the decomposition in minerals {{has been}} related (McConnell, i 975) to their cooling history with special reference to spinodal decomposition in alkali feldspars (McConnell, I 969). Transmission electron micro-scopy (TEM) of potassium-rich alumino-silicate single crystals from a rapidly cooled igneous rock, pantellerite, exhibited spinodal textures {{on the order}} of ioo A suggesting that decomposition by a spinodal mode may occur in the KA 1 Si 30 s-NaA 1 Si 30 s system (McConnell, I 969, i 97 i). Christie (I 968) originally suggested that the alkali feldspars may exsolve by a spinodal mechan-ism and indeed spinodal decomposition may be the operative mechanism in natural exsolution (Fletcher and McCallister, i 974; Champness and Lorimer, I 976; Willaime et al., I 976). In order to examine the kinetic path (or paths) by which un-mixing of a supersaturated solution is accom-plished, as well as the structural and morphological form of the product phases, the earliest regime of decomposition must be detected. A natural KA 1 Si 3 Os-NaA 1 Si 30 s composition was, therefore, rapidly quenched and examined by TEM during in situ annealing. Experimental. The KA 1 Si 3 Oa-NaA 1 Si 30 8 mix-tures were made from natural orthoclase * and albite * sintered in an electrically <b>heated</b> <b>muffle</b> furnace at 1050 ~ in air.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{detailed}} {{studies have been}} performed to further understand the characteristics of biomass for solid fuel combustion purposes. The characterisation work {{was carried out in}} three separate (but interrelated) parts studying each of the different forms/stages of biomass during combustion i. e. original raw biomass, biomass char and biomass ash, respectively. These findings were examined and correlated to see if predictions about combustion behaviour could be made. The effects of blending biomass and coal on milling performance and ash behaviour were also investigated to show the relevance of co-milling and co-firing. The lignocellulosic components, i. e. lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose are the key constituents of plants cell wall, and hence form the major part of biomass. The contributions of these components on biomass behaviour were explored by analysing a matrix of samples with varying lignocellulosic compositions including; a base suite of 11 biomass samples with different lignocellulose contents; samples pre-treated chemically to alter their compositions; pseudo biomass samples synthesised by mixing commercially obtained lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose in different weight percentages. All raw samples, both treated and untreated, as well as their corresponding char samples prepared via the fast heating drop tube furnace and slow <b>heating</b> <b>muffle</b> furnace, were analysed to determine their respective thermal properties, structural characteristics, grindability, etc. Ash samples were characterised using the sinter strength test and the newly developed PAnG (Picture Analysis and Graphing) advanced ash fusion test. The former was originally devised for coal ash characterisation whilst the latter was designed to accommodate the large variability in fuels. The PAnG test incorporates dilatometry and sinter strength test by means of image analysis. It is believed that lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose {{play a significant role in}} determining the characteristics of biomass. Results have shown that the data of raw biomass, biomass char and biomass ash correlate well with that of lignocellulosic composition. The major components of biomass, particularly cellulose and/or lignin, reflect the various behaviours of biomass in different ways, and hence can be used as a potential predictive tool. Depending on the original unblended fuel, the blending of biomass and coal at different weight percentages can have favourable effects on fuel properties.

G-C 3 N 4 was prepared by the thermal polycondensation of melamine [26]. Typically, 5.0  g of melamine in a covered alumina crucible was put into a <b>muffle</b> furnace and <b>heated</b> to 550  °C for 2  h with a heating rate of 10  °C/min. The resulted yellow product was collected and ground into powders. In order to combine Sr 4 Al 14 O 25 :(Eu,Dy) with g-C 3 N 4, 0.1  g of g-C 3 N 4 powders were, firstly, dispersed into 10  mL of ammonia solution (25  wt%) via stirring at room temperature for 5  h [26]. The final product was collected by centrifugation and dried at 60  °C under vacuum overnight. Before combination, Sr 4 Al 14 O 25 :(Eu,Dy) and g-C 3 N 4 were firstly modified by ammonia solution treatment, respectively [26]. Then, Sr 4 Al 14 O 25 :(Eu,Dy)/g-C 3 N 4 composites were achieved by a simple method [26, 32]. In a typical procedure, 0.12  g of g-C 3 N 4 powders and 0.08  g of Sr 4 Al 14 O 25 :(Eu,Dy) powders were separately added into 50  mL of methanol and sonicated for 30  min.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{parameters}} {{that have to be}} considered when estimating and evaluating the quality of a high-value dental restoration is the optimal fitting accuracy of the die. This however, represents a huge challenge for dental technicians who have to regard many key features of technical casting, {{especially when it comes to}} aspects of fluidity and casting capacity. In order to analyze the impact of the process parameters preheating – and casting temperature on the outflow characteristics of three EMF – alloys for partial dentures (WIRONIT, WIRONIT LA, WIRONIUM PLUS; BEGO company) as well as of three PFM alloys (WIROBOND C, WIROBOND LFC, WIRON 99; BEGO company) this work applied a test specimen according to HÄßELBARTH (modified wax retention grid). In the context of the casting experiments with the non precious alloys mentioned above, a series of experiments has been conducted with a set of 6 test – specimen to produce a total of 180 testing meshes. During theses tests the <b>heating</b> <b>muffles</b> have been preheated on the one hand intensely at + 100 °C and on the other hand lowly at - 100 °C. Furthermore, the casting temperature has been risen to + 100 °C as well as lowered to a minimum of - 100 °C. The tests conducted were compared to results that were made according to manufacturer instructions. Concluding the analysis of the results: - The reference block according to HÄßELBARTH allows the quantitative comparison of the used non precious alloys with varying process parameters such as preheating – and casting temperatures. Within the experiments intermediate form – filling rates between 16 % – 86 % have been achieved. No test mesh poured out to either 0 % or 100 %! - The experiments revealed a typical grouping of the alloys according to their formation. At a temperature of + 100 °C the EMF – alloys for partial dentures WIRONIT, WIRONIT LA, WIRONIUM PLUS showed significantly higher form – filling rates than the analyzed PFM alloys. - The configuration of the casting temperature is by far more important to the form filling process than the variation of the muffle temperature. This can be proven mathematically by the formula for the calculation of the cooling time. The results gained from this work show that the construction materials used in the EMF – alloys have a huge potential that can be further exploited in terms of better form fillings through the optimization of preheating and casting temperatures during the casting process. That is why dental precision castings can be improved dramatically. However, other factors that affect the quality of the component parts such as the mechanical characteristic hardness or elastic limit of 0, 2 % should not be neglected. The question remains open whether there is a way to estimate the optimal marginal value or proportion that manages to avoid affecting the texture and degrading mechanical parameters of the component parts while casting and preheating temperatures are changed. First and foremost the here gathered information confirm and imply that dental technicians should always stick to the specifications of manufacturers...|$|R
