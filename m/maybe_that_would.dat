60|$|Of course I {{had been}} expecting such news every day for many days; but no matter, the shock of it almost took my breath away and set me {{trembling}} like a leaf. I suppose that without knowing it I had been half imagining that {{at the last moment}} something <b>would</b> happen, something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> stop this fatal trial; <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> La Hire <b>would</b> burst in at the gates with his hellions at his back; <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> God <b>would</b> have pity and stretch forth His mighty hand.

6000|$|... "Well, I say {{a little}} dinner because the idea of that seems to cover the case, even if we vary the plan a little. I had thought of a reception, <b>maybe,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> include the lady {{contributors}} and artists, and the wives and daughters of the other contributors. That would give us the chance to ring {{in a lot of}} society correspondents and get the thing written up in first-class shape. By-the-way!" [...] cried Fulkerson, slapping himself on the leg, [...] "why not have the dinner and the reception both?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's most unfortunate, too," [...] {{continued}} the captain, knitting up his visage, [...] "that Sinton should be away just at this time, without rudder, chart, or compass, an' bound for no port {{that any one}} knows of. Why, the fellow may be {{deep in the heart}} o' the Rocky Mountains, for all I can tell. I might start off at once without him, but <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be of no use. What can it be that old Thompson's so anxious about? Why didn't the old figur'-head use his pen more freely--his tongue goes fast enough to drive the engines of a seventy-four.

50|$|In 2007, {{the provincial}} {{government}} began looking to sell the Dundarave Golf course, {{along with the other}} three courses it owns. The reasoning behind the decision was the large expenditure of taxpayer money on course maintenance, losses from the four courses totaled $858,900 in the 2014-2015 golf season. Tourism Minister Robert Henderson was quoted saying “Obviously, when you’re {{on the floor of the}} estimates committee … and you’re saying you invested in this stuff, sometimes comments get made that <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have been better spent on an X-ray machine or books,” in relation to the government's decision to sell the courses. As of the 2015 golf season no sale had been completed and the course is still maintained by {{the provincial government}}.|$|E
5000|$|Recording {{sessions}} commenced in mid-1966 as the Remains {{prepared for}} their tour alongside the Beatles. The recording {{time in the}} studio saw the group explore different musical textures, including a guitar raveup on the opening track [...] "Heart", Jagger-like sneer in [...] "Lonely Weekend", and the band's early R&B influenced regional hits [...] "Why Do I Cry?" [...] and [...] "Diddy Wah Diddy". Tashian states the reason the Remains covered {{a fair amount of}} songs was to look [...] "for a big national hit, and since we didn't seem to be connecting with the original songs we decided to put out some covers and see if <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> do the trick". Arguably, the band's most accomplished piece on The Remains is [...] "Don't Look Back", the tune's regional popularity apparent by the Rising Storm's own rendition of the song in 1968. The hard-edged rocker later resurfaced on Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968.|$|E

60|$|The top of {{the wall}} was pointed like a house roof, and {{immediately}} below him was covered by a thick growth of green moss, and it flashed through his mind as he hung there <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> it <b>would</b> offer a very slippery foothold for one dropping upon the steep slopes of the top.

6000|$|... "Who {{can tell}} what I think? Perhaps {{something}} {{like what you}} say has gone through my mind. Why, Nancy, if you would listen once, I could convince you of it, too. Come, now, {{look at it in}} this light! If God lets a man say and do what the man pleases--and He has to do it every now and then according to what the Book tells--why ain't the man equal with God? You believe, <b>maybe,</b> <b>that</b> you <b>would</b> be struck dead if you said the things that I do; but why ain't I struck dead? Why, either because it ain't so, at all, or because I'm God. It stands to reason, don't it? What is God, anyway? If He was so mighty and terrible, wouldn't He have ways of showing it in these times just as much as in those old times that we read about in the Book? ...|$|R
5000|$|Three {{rounds of}} Knockout Qualifying took place, the first {{instance}} that the new qualifying format {{was used in the}} Sprint Cup Series on a super speedway. Brian Scott captured his first career pole with a time of 48.293 and a speed of 198.290 mph. Paul Menard, A. J. Allmendinger, Casey Mears and Austin Dillon rounded out the top five. The drivers had a wide range of opinions on the new format. [...] "I don't know if anybody can really quite capture how intense that is. I'm telling you, it's just nerve-racking. You're trying to make all the right decisions as well as not wreck. It wasn't too crazy, but it was crazy enough to be fun," [...] said Jeff Gordon. [...] "It's hard because everybody wants to lag and nobody wants to go because the speed is at the back and not the front," [...] said Brad Keselowski. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. did not like the new format at Talladega. [...] "It just wasn't much fun. I'd like to do some heat races or something <b>maybe.</b> <b>That</b> <b>would</b> be a little funner than this." [...] Kasey Kahne and Truex, Jr. started {{at the rear of the}} field after failing post-qualifying inspection. Kahne's car was too light and Truex's car failed to meet height requirements. [...] "Basically we had a malfunction with a ballast container," [...] Kahne's crew chief Kenny Francis said in a manufacturer release. [...] "The cap that holds the ballast in came out. It could be mechanical or human error we are not really sure what happened. At the end of the day 25 pounds of ballast came out and we were 25 pounds light at the scales. The time was disallowed and we will have to start at the back." [...] Dave Blaney, Eric McClure, Joe Nemechek and J. J. Yeley failed to qualify for the race.|$|E
6000|$|There was one man, of <b>maybe</b> forty, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{sit on my}} berth-side {{for hours}} and tell me {{of his wife and}} child. He was a fisher that had lost his boat, and thus been driven to the deep-sea voyaging. Well, it is years ago now: but I have never {{forgotten}} him. His wife (who was [...] "young by him," [...] as he often told me) waited in vain to see her man return: he would never again make the fire for her in the morning, nor yet keep the bairn when she was sick. Indeed, many of these poor fellows (as the event proved) were upon their last cruise; the deep seas and cannibal fish received them; and it is a thankless business to speak ill of the dead.|$|R
50|$|He {{considered}} {{where he}} could get such experience. There was the Musashi Flex, a loosely-organized band of modern ronins who travelled around challenging each other; he could try that. Or, there was The Maze. Such a thing was risky, but it offered a real test. Injury was likely, death a possibility in the game known as The Maze; if he could survive <b>that,</b> <b>maybe</b> he <b>would</b> be ready....|$|R
5000|$|... "The post-Ant Farm {{period was}} a {{difficult}} transition for me because {{of the loss of}} the support structure that the group provided, both creatively and financially, but this eventually led me to teaching. I thought <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> teaching <b>would</b> be a similar collaborative process, and in some ways it is. Since I'm still doing it 25 years later, I have to say that university affiliation has worked for me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{liked the}} film's direction, and wrote [...] "Bill Forsyth's Gregory's Girl is a charming, innocent, very funny little {{movie about the}} weird kid. ... The movie {{contains}} so much wisdom about being alive and teenage and vulnerable <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> it <b>would</b> even be painful for a teenager to see it. ... Maybe only grown-ups should see this movie. You know, people who have gotten over the pains of unrequited love (hollow laugh)." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you please, sir," [...] {{said the}} ex-corporal, {{speaking}} in a whining voice, and touching his moleskin cap with a humility which contrasted strangely with the previous rough independence of his bearing, [...] "I'm an old gunner in the Queen's service, sir, and knowing your name by hearing it in India I thought <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> you <b>would</b> take me as your groom or gardener, or give me any other place as happened to be vacant." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{tried to}} write about my friend. I knew he really loved 'That's What Friends Are For.' I know <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> he <b>would</b> have liked me to do a song like that. Instead I wrote about him personally. I don't know that my lyrics were good enough, I don't know that {{anything}} was good enough. Maybe it was too personal. I don't know. But I wrote it for him. It was because of him that I keep trying to do stuff. And other friends. So many talented people, {{so many of our}} friends and so many gifted people have passed on. Or struggle everyday. Just to live. And it was because of my friends and others that I do this. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> song wasn't good enough, I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have ridden hither," [...] one said, with {{a strong}} nasal twang, [...] "Zachariah Stebbings, having letters of {{introduction}} {{to you from the}} governor.

5000|$|In 2013, the bassist in {{the group}} Moostop {{announced}} his desire to leave the group. Vocalist Don Matsuo stated that [...] "I wasn’t really surprised, and knew <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> this <b>would</b> happen one day, but I still wasn’t happy about his decision." [...] The group did a tour and recorded a tour-only EP together. During this tour, the groups' drummer Pitt also announced his departure. Don Matuso and his wife Matta began focus on a new group called The Randolf after this tour.|$|R
6000|$|It {{occurred}} to me <b>that,</b> <b>maybe,</b> she <b>would</b> like to hear {{a few of them}} there and then, but before I had got well started a hollow Society man came up and suggested supper, and she was compelled to leave me. As she disappeared, however, in the throng, she looked back over her shoulder with a glance half pathetic, half comic, that I understood. It said, [...] "Pity me, I've got to be bored by this vapid, shallow creature," [...] and I did.|$|R
6000|$|Another pause {{of silence}} followed, and Myles began to pluck up some heart <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> all <b>would</b> yet be well. The Earl's next speech dashed that hope into a {{thousand}} fragments. [...] "Well thou knowest," [...] said he, [...] "that it is forbid for any to come here. Well thou knowest that twice have men been punished for {{this thing that}} thou hast done, and yet thou camest in spite of all. Now dost thou know what thou wilt suffer?" ...|$|R
30|$|Even the G-O Road {{has become}} an {{illustration}} of bio-cultural sovereignty that is accepted, acknowledged, and respected. The day that my aunt took me gathering up the G-O Road a U.S. Forest Service car pulled alongside us and a man {{stepped out of the}} vehicle. We cautiously walked over to him, half expecting <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> have numerous questions about what we were doing or <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> challenge our gathering on federal land. Instead, he smiled and said, “You all must be here to gather beargrass. If you head up the road, there is a whole mess of it. And it’s some pretty good stuff too. I was just checking it out the other day”. It was a surprise and relief to me that he had some awareness of what we were doing. It seemed to illustrate what happens when people are educated about the continuing traditional knowledge and practices of Native peoples. While he did not specifically tell me if this was an official policy of the Forest Service in our area, he did mention that he was glad to see us out gathering that day. “It’s good that somebody is going to get some use out of this stuff,” he said.|$|R
50|$|A new nurse by {{the name}} of Annie Flynn (Rebecca Hobbs) turned up in Ferndale, having {{previously}} dated Guy. Chris attempted to start a relationship with Annie, not knowing that she had left Guy for a woman and was a lesbian. When Meredith Fleming (Stephanie Wilkin) made a brief return to town, Chris hoped <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> they <b>would</b> finally be able to get together. Unfortunately in the end, Meredith realised that she was actually more attracted to Annie, and the two decided to make a go of their relationship in Dunedin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} written late in 2015 in Sydney while Elliphant was touring for the Falls Festival. The song was redone by the trio {{several times over}} the year. Elliphant is {{grateful}} the duo ignored her request [...] "to give it to another artist", saying [...] "I told them <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> there <b>would</b> be a better person to do 'Stranger' because they weren't satisfied, I wasn't {{coming up with the}} vocal they wanted.

50|$|In 179 BC, {{after some}} {{hesitation}} (during which he, apparently {{influenced by the}} theory of chanrang (禪讓), thought <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> it <b>would</b> be more proper for him to find the wisest person in the empire and offer the throne to him, or that he should consider offering the throne to his uncle Liu Jiao (劉交), the Prince of Chu; his cousin Liu Pi (劉濞), the Prince of Wu; or his younger brother Liu Chang (劉長), the Prince of Huainan), he made his oldest son Liu Qi the Crown Prince and Prince Qi's mother, Consort Dou, Empress.|$|R
500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates. [...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that {{you had a chance to}} play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> Michigan <b>would</b> take a chance on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had chosen}} {{this part of}} the country, and, after a time, I became uneasy in my mind, as to whether I was doing right; and whether, for the child's sake, I ought not to tell you that she was alive, and offer to give her up, if you were willing to take her. I heard how your son's death had changed you, and thought <b>that,</b> <b>maybe,</b> you <b>would</b> like to take his daughter; but, before {{bringing}} her to you, I thought she should have a better education than I had time to give her, and that she should be placed with a lady, so that, if you took her, you need not be ashamed of her manners.|$|R
