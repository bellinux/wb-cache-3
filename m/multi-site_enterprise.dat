It explains the increased importance of ERP systems in practice. The paper also addresses the difficulties encountered in implementing ERP systems in real life. Modern ERP systems are very flexible, and can be tuned to many different business environments. This flexibility leads to increased complexity. The paper explains {{the nature of the}} flexibility and the complexity. It discusses promising ways to master complexity such as enterprise modeling. Modern ERP systems are well suited for support of a <b>multi-site</b> <b>enterprise.</b> However, smooth cooperation of such systems in a supply chain of independent partners {{is still a long way}} to go...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a generic scalable simulation {{model for the}} redesign and the global optimization of the supply chain of <b>multi-site</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Our model {{makes it possible to}} reproduce the dynamics of the supply chain and the information and material flows between its various entities. In particular, we concentrate on the modeling of the activities which take place both in and between the production and distribution centers. The model is designed to provide an in-depth evaluation of the effectiveness and the robustness of a certain number of network designs and to settle various management policies...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{heuristic}} approach for the supply chain design problem {{in the case of}} <b>multi-site</b> <b>enterprises.</b> The proposed approach decomposes the problem into subproblems and solves these ones with various techniques like neighbourhood search and simplex algorithm. At each iteration, our algorithm sets the state of production and distribution centres for each time period, distributes the necessary capacity amongst the opened facilities and determine the material flows in and between the entities belonging to the supply chain. We apply the heuristic approach to several supply chain design problem. The obtained numerical results show that the algorithm finds a "good" feasible solution in a reasonable amount of computation time...|$|R

These two models are derived from the same modelling of the supply network. First, we briefly describe the two models constituting the decision aid approach. Then, {{on the basis of the}} experiments carried out for a strategic network redesign problem based on industrial cases, we present the adopted integration methodology.

40|$|MBA - WBSOne of the {{greatest}} challenges facing companies today is to achieve a differential advantage over their competition. The benefits achieved through the implementation and extension of manufacturing execution systems (MESs) holds great promise for meeting this challenge. Failure to recognise the significant internal dependencies of the most value-adding functions on the capability of underlying functions can result in a dysfunctional MES implementation. The dilemma faced by management is frequently not whether to invest in an MES but rather where to invest. This decision becomes increasingly complex when dealing with a <b>multi-site</b> <b>enterprise</b> such {{as is the case in}} the steel industry. This study defined a process-maturity model for MES implementation and used case study data from a steel enterprise to evaluate it. The model was shown to be valid and can be applied in the identification and prioritisation for MES developments within the steel industry...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a hybrid decision aid approach for supply networks redesign and planning int {{the context of}} multi-site enterprises. This approach is iterative and integrates a mixed integer programming model and a simulation model being at different decisional levels : the mathematical model is a strategic/tactical model and the simulation model is a tactical/operational model. These two models {{are based on the}} same modelling of the supply network. First, we describe the elements constituting the decision aid approach. We present two generic mixed integer programming models, multi-product, multi-echelon and multi-period, which search to maximize the profit of the <b>multi-site</b> <b>enterprise.</b> We propose a heuristic approach to solve one of these programs. We describe the developed simulation model. It reproduces the behaviour of the whole supply chain and takes into account the management policies. then, we present the adopted integration methodology. For a problem based on industrial cases, we show that the two models have their role in the decision aid approach and that they contribute both in the search of a good quality network design.

40|$|Abstract – Virtual Private Networks have rapidly {{emerged as}} a leading {{solution}} for <b>multi-site</b> <b>enterprise</b> communication needs. Provider-managed solutions modeled on RFC 2547 serve as a popular choice for layer- 3 VPNs and the Hose Model has {{emerged as a}} common and simple service specification. It offers a “hose ” of a certain contracted bandwidth to customers. With the growth in size and number of VPNs and the uncertainties in traffic patterns offered by customers, providers are faced with new challenges in efficiently provisioning and capacity planning for these networks while satisfying customer service level agreements (SLAs). We suggest that a set of techniques can be used to help the provider build an adaptively provisioned network. These techniques involve continually processing measurement information, building inferences regarding VPN characteristics and leveraging them for adaptive resource provisioning. We have developed scalable techniques to infer VPN characteristics that are important for provisioning tasks and demonstrated the feasibility of such provisioning with existing SNMP-based measurement infrastructure from a large IP/VPN service provider. Our examination of measurement data yielded interesting new insights into VPN structure and properties. Building on our experience with analyzing VPN characteristics, in this paper we articulate an adaptive provisioning architecture that allows providers to effectively deal with the dynamic nature of customer traffic. Index terms – IP VPNs, measurement, traffic matrix, provisioning. I...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present a meta-heuristically {{approach}} of the spatial assignment problem of human resources in <b>multi-sites</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Usually, this problem consists to move employees from one site to another based on one or more criteria. Our goal in this new approach {{is to improve the}} quality of service and performance of all sites with maximizing an objective function under some managers imposed constraints. The formulation presented here of this problem coincides perfectly with a Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP) which is in the most cases NPhard to solve optimally. To avoid this difficulty, we have opted to use a meta-heuristic popular method, which is the genetic algorithm, to solve this problem in concrete cases. The results obtained have shown the effectiveness of our approach, which remains until now very costly in time. But the reduction of the time can be obtained by different ways that we plan to do in the next work...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Virtual Enterprise (VE), a special {{organization}} of manufacturing units and enterprises, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Unlike traditional enterprise, VE is most suitable in production environments that experience frequent changes in product mix. To complete a complex task composed of some sub-tasks, traditional control architecture is not versatile enough to coordinate and schedule multi-site and multi-type resources, especially in resolving resource conflicts during operations. Using hybrid control architecture, VE can execute the effective control on <b>multi-site</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{to support the}} rapid response to customer demands. Coordination mechanism running through the total life cycle of VE is applied to coordinating and scheduling the requests from different tasks and resources, which make VE flexible, adaptive and robust. In this paper, the hybrid control architecture based on multi-agent technology that supports the cooperation of enterprises is presented. Coordination mechanism and the corresponding optimal models are discussed. Finally a case study is used as an illustration to present the detailed coordination mechanism. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|We {{focus on}} the problem of {{strategic}} network design in the context of <b>multi-site</b> <b>enterprises.</b> We develop a simulation model for various supply network designs evaluation. The suggested model is generic in the sense that only input data modifications are needed to adapt the model to a given supply network structure, while the model's procedural logic stays unchanged. The model reproduces the dynamics of the totality of the supply chain activities. It takes into account control policies related to the inventory management and to the scheduling of production activities. It also carries out local optimisations by dynamically allocating the customers’ demands to the appropriate distribution site and the replenishment orders expressed by the distribution and production sites of the enterprise so as to minimise a global cost function. Simulation execution permits to compute various performance measures. These indicators inform the decision-maker about the profit of the enterprise and about its customer's service level. In this paper, we propose to detail the simulation model. Then, for a fictitious problem of supply network design based on two real life applications, we highlight the influence of the control policies on the performance of the studied enterprise...|$|R
40|$|Sharing e-documents are {{important}} components of any enterprise workflow. Keeping these e-documents secure {{is fundamental to}} enterprise security, especially in <b>multi-site</b> <b>enterprises</b> or when sharing e-documents with third party. For that purpose, enterprises use document management software. However, document leakage is the most challenging security issue. These leaks are mainly caused by internal attack wither intentional or due to accident and employee ignorance. After exploring {{the landscape of the}} current e-document sharing security issues, this chapter proposes a framework to address these issues. The proposed framework is adapting current technologies in new novel approach to deliver a secure environment to share e-documents and track them. The confirmed framework secures documents not only inside the enterprise, but also when they leave the enterprise boundaries via networks or portable devices. As the author’s knowledge extends, there is no other work similar to what this paper provide regarding proposing such a framework. The framework provides a persistent and secure environment through the e-document life cycle and ability to track the document. The framework components design is based on analysing the literature of the current issues and available solutions. These components were confirmed after surveying security professionals and interviewing fourteen security experts. The framework includes components utilising active document concept, digital right management concept, context awareness, and a central certification authority service...|$|R
