The <b>framework</b> <b>method</b> has seven stages of analysis which can be summarised as: Transcription, Familiarisation, Coding, Development of the analytical framework, Applying the analytical framework, Charting data and Interpreting data (Gale et al. 2013).

40|$|Background: The <b>Framework</b> <b>Method</b> is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular approach to the management and analysis of qualitative data in health research. However, there is confusion about its potential application and limitations. Discussion. The article discusses when {{it is appropriate to}} adopt the <b>Framework</b> <b>Method</b> and explains the procedure for using it in multi-disciplinary health research teams, or those that involve clinicians, patients and lay people. The stages of the method are illustrated using examples from a published study. Summary. Used effectively, with the leadership of an experienced qualitative researcher, the <b>Framework</b> <b>Method</b> is a systematic and flexible approach to analysing qualitative data and is appropriate for use in research teams even where not all members have previous experience of conducting qualitative research...|$|R

Since almost all learners and teachers now have access to mobile technologies the new <b>framework</b> and <b>method</b> provide great potential for learning through interactions in these face to face situations.

40|$|To {{promote the}} {{development}} of Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA), we conducted {{a comprehensive review of}} recently developed <b>frameworks,</b> <b>methods,</b> and characterization models for impact assessment for future method developers and SLCA practitioners. Two previous reviews served as our foundations for this review. We updated the review by including a comprehensive list of recently-developed SLCA <b>frameworks,</b> <b>methods</b> and characterization models. While a brief discussion from goal, data, and indicator perspectives is provided in Sections 2 to 4 for different frameworks/methods, the focus of this review is Section 5 where discussion on characterization models for impact assessment of different methods is provided. The characterization models are categorized into two types following the UNEP/SETAC guidelines: type I models without impact pathways and type II models with impact pathways. Different from methods incorporating type I/II characterization models, another LCA modeling approach, Life Cycle Attribute Assessment (LCAA), is also discussed in this review. We concluded that methods incorporating either type I or type II models have limitations. For type I models, the challenge lies in the systematic identification of relevant stakeholders and materiality issues; while for type II models, identification of impact pathways that most closely and accurately represent the real-world causal relationships is the key. LCAA may avoid these problems, but the ultimate questions differ from those asked by the methods using type I and II models...|$|R
