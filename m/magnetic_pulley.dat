40|$|Abstract- This {{project is}} {{focuses on a}} {{conceptual}} design of a conveyor system {{that can be used}} to differentiate between metallic and non-metallic materials, as well as to perform transferring of the mentioned materials. The project should be started by means of research on metallic waste sorting machines in the market like magnetic conveyor system. A conveyor system is mechanical handling equipment that moves materials from one location to another and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pulley</b> has been used to separate metal and non-metal waste. Standard design process flow is to be followed e. g. conceptual design and detailed design to be produced prior to the fabrication. Design of the conveyor is using Solidworks Software and analysis is using Ansys Software. Analysis equipment has been done by doing calculation such as calculation of gear and motor torque prior to fabrication. The expected result the fully automated conveyor system that can be used for metallic waste management application is described in detail in this paper.
