50|$|In 1949, Kluckhohn {{began to}} work among five {{adjacent}} communities in the Southwest: Zuni, Navajo, Mormon (LDS), Spanish-American (Mexican-American), and Texas Homesteaders A key methodological approach that he developed together with his wife Florence Rockwood Kluckhohn and colleagues Evon Z. Vogt and Ethel M. Albert, among others, was the Values Orientation Theory. They believed that cross-cultural understanding and communication could be facilitated by analyzing a given culture's orientation to five key aspects of human life: Human Nature (people seen as intrinsically good, evil, or mixed); <b>Man-Nature</b> <b>Relationship</b> (the view that humans should be subordinate to nature, dominant over nature, or live in harmony with nature); Time (primary value placed on past/tradition, present/enjoyment, or future/posterity/delayed gratification); Activity (being, becoming/inner development, or doing/striving/industriousness); and Social Relations (hierarchical, collateral/collective-egalitarian, or individualistic). The Values Orientation Method was developed furthest by Florence Kluckhohn and her colleagues and students in later years.|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} {{recovery of}} quarried areas is increasingly a landscaping first-order issue {{in many countries}} and relevant lessons {{can be learned from}} each case history, depending upon factors such as the terrain nature and landscape consolidation over time. The case of the Tivoli travertine quarries near Rome (Acque Albule Basin, Italy) is addressed with a multidisciplinary approach and analytic data indicating sustainable and resilient future solutions. Geological data are analyzed to know the resources and natural hazards of this territory. Historical landscape analyses are next accomplished to know the cultural heritage and evolution of man-nature interactions. Eventually, the present land use and 3 D landscape are considered to know the current setting. This territory is characterized by natural hazards including earthquakes, degassing, subsidence, and river flooding, and by resources such as abundant thermal waters. Historical analyses show the occurrence of a significant cultural heritage including two UNESCO world heritage sites. The present landscape is characterized by deep quarries and unplanned urbanization. The integration of geological data with historical information provides a new knowledge forming a geocultural database that must be taken into consideration for future planning. Based on these results, general landscape and urban guidelines are proposed for the future recovery of this intensively-quarried and -urbanized territory. The main lesson learned from the Tivoli case history is twofold: (1) the integration and feedback between multiple disciplines and professionals (architects and geologists) working together on environmental improvements and (2) the careful view of the past territory and meticulous analysis of existing buildings and urban landscapes are the key to sustainably interpret the future landscape. The main novelty of this lesson is the improvement of the concept of cultural landscape (UNESCO: [URL] and its expansion toward geological issues and man-geology/nature interactions. In an urban-saturated territory that is also geologically-worn by human activities (e. g., Acque Albule Basin), restoring guidelines must comply with the partly-new concept of geocultural landscaping, which consists of a sustainable and resilient planning based on the study and understanding of natural-geological hazards, natural and cultural resources, and <b>man-nature</b> <b>relationships</b> over large spaces and long terms (4 D).

40|$|Among a {{minority}} of Longfellow’s studies in China and abroad, there has even scarcely been one made {{from the perspective of}} eco-criticism. Eco-criticism aims at exploring the relation between literature and natural environment to find out the ecological wisdom in literary works so as to awaken the ecological consciousness of the contemporaries. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a poet concerning much about nature, in his nature poems, shows the value of nature by evoking people’s love and care for nature, and makes them reconsider the <b>Man-Nature</b> <b>relationship</b> so as to seek the ecological balance on earth, including that from within the human world.

The <b>man-nature</b> <b>relationship</b> has always been ambiguous, nature being seen as both a provider and an enemy. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, man is set apart from nature and called to dominate it, although this attitude has been revised to become one of stewardship. Oriental religions, on the other hand, have a more holistic view and consider humans {{as an integral part of}} nature. Modern philosophers have views ranging from anthropocentrism to biocentrism and egocentrism. It is suggested to take a pragmatic approach by which primary human needs are met first and foremost whereas the needs of other living organisms and ecosystems are allowed to prevail over secondary human needs.

Recent studies on citizens' perceptions and behaviour toward urban green areas have shown the complexity and the multidimensional character of the <b>man-nature</b> <b>relationship</b> in the city; inhabitants' use of green spaces appears to be motivated by the need for psychological health with relevant social implications. In this paper, we describe two empirical {{studies that have been}} independently conducted and recently published by Italian urban foresters and environmental psychologists. By comparing the two studies in terms of approach, materials, methods and results, we seek to find out if urban foresters and environmental psychologists in Italy approach and interpret the psychological and social (P&S) dimensions of urban green spaces differently. Results show that urban foresters have applied substantially different approaches and research methods than environmental psychologists. This can be explained from their different backgrounds and perspectives. We conclude by discussing some basic hints and implications for enhancing the P&S benefits of urban forests through collaborative projects and scientific co-operation between urban foresters and environmental psychologists. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

This paper discusses the creation of capitalist frontiers in the colonial agricultural enclaves of Cameroon’s Littoral region where three multinational plantation companies hold sway.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Ciências do Mar, da Terra e do Ambiente, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2016 Sesimbra is a {{community}} established in the largest valley of the Arrábida coast. It is deeply connected to the sea through fishing, shipbuilding, sailors which contributed to the Portuguese expansion (XV and XVI centuries), {{as well as being}} an important maritime route and a trade point. More recently tourism became an important activity. During the 40 ’s (XX century) the pressures for development {{led to the creation of}} a legal framework aimed at the protection of the Arrábida coast. The Arrábida Reserve was created in 1971 (became Arrábida Natural Park in 1976). In 1998 the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), the marine section of the Arrábida Natural Park, was created, and in 2005, Marine Protected Area was implemented. The restrictions imposed to fishing and the top-down approached used, generated many protests and opposition within the Sesimbra fishing community. In response to these conflicts, in 2009, the Project MARGov - Collaborative Governance for Marine Protected Areas, started its activity to create platforms to involve the population in a participatory process aiming at community empowerment. To achieve this objective, the procedure followed was: (1) identification of the fishing community perception about the LSMP, (2) analyze of the information obtained through cross checking with the existence data, and (3) integration of all these components in the participatory process (PP) of the MARGov Project to create Empowerment. Through the methodology of the PP, it was possible to deconstruct the conflict and find common interests to achieve collaborative solutions and build intellectual, social and political capital while increasing community knowledge. The importance of all types of knowledge (empirical/traditional as well as scientific) was demonstrated to be valuable in building of the PP.

40|$|Agriculture {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} human activities, one closely asociated with nature. Thus, the <b>man-nature</b> <b>relationship,</b> shich is guided by a worldview, plays a significant role here in determining the methods for using nature to human ends. The dominance of industrialism (a utilitarian, materialistic and mechanistic approach) as a worldview in agriculture has led to man´s operating as an exploiter of natural resources through use of technical aids. Such an approach has produced a rapid decline both in social systems and in the natural environment. Due to problems of this sort, as well as the growing scepticism regarding the ability of technology to increase productivity sufficiently to meet future demands, modern agriculture can be considered unsustainable. Understanding existing traditional farming systems that have their roots in the more distant past, having emerged and developed in quite different social and cultural contexts than those dominating most of agriculture today, could help highlight issues of sustainability. The traditional farming system in the Ghouta, which has been an integral part of the social life and has contributed to the food supply of Damascus for millenia, was selected for this purpose. The objective was to re-examine the potential that traditional agriculture of this type has for contributing to sustainability of agricultural systems and for redirecting modern agriculture towards a sustainable path. Four key terms best summarize the major features of the methodology adopted in the research project: a system orientation, an interdisciplinary, a participatory approach and the use of quantitative methods in a qualitative context. Elderly farmers in the Ghouta using on the one hand, human knowledge and experience, so-called tradition and, on the other hand, divine guidance, are able to keep their farming system alive, both biophysically and economically. Their worldview plays a significant role in setting an overall objective, that of maintaining the existecne of their system and in adopting an altruistic approach, that of their being nurturers of the farm components including non-agricultural living vessels. Agriculture is thus carried on in a productive rather than an extractive way that is both meaningful and sustainable. The integration of diversity and the socio-cultural context with a high level of market orientation that stimulate diversity, all of them driven by a spiritual orientation, form the pillars of the sustainability of this system, which might justifiably be called the original farming system...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between Man and Nature {{can be divided}} into three ‘eras. ’ The first era refers to a time when Man was dominated by Nature, governed by her fluctuating seasons and at the mercy of her erratic moods. Man’s advancement brought into being the Machine, which enabled Man to move into a second era. This era brought about a brief state of equilibrium between Nature and Man, before Man advanced even further and faster into a third era in which Man and Machine dominated Nature. Man’s appropriation of Nature’s resources is his most intimate experience of the Natural world. However, in this third phase of development, Man has negated the ‘natural’ source of Nature’s resources and has thus disconnected himself from her. As a result of this disconnection, the third era is characterised by an imbalance which is leading towards the possibility of Man tipping off the scales entirely. This thesis explores the possibility of a fourth era in which Man and Nature once again achieve an equilibrium of mutually beneficial symbiosis. A fourth era would be the setting of a mend in the severed <b>Man-Nature</b> <b>relationship.</b> A ‘reconnection’ could be achieved through a renewed understanding of the systems, both natural and technological, that supply Man with Nature’s resources. The ‘Machine’ that is the Vaal Dam Wall and its surrounds was chosen as a locus for the theoretical application of a form of inhabited resource infrastructure that takes steps towards a fused Man-Nature entity. The dam wall is a significant piece of existing infrastructure that {{plays a major role in}} the capture, storage, and distribution of water to people in Gauteng, South Africa’s economic powerhouse. A legible, multi-use intervention sensitively placed on this site could reconnect the water-users to the natural water resource that is so vital to their livelihoods. The intervention is in the form of a visitor centre which incorporates water purification and hydroelectric power generation as well as a management facility for the Department of Water Affairs, the entity with jurisdiction over the Vaal water system and dam wall site. The Vaal Dam Visitor Centre could provide much-needed infrastructure to the chosen site in its un-realised capacity as a locus for tourism, education, research and management. In doing so, the Centre could be the ‘Machine’ that reconnects Man to Nature through responsible use and understanding of her resources...|$|E
40|$|Several commentaries {{have been}} written about the role that Nature has played in the {{literature}} of early America, including books by Wilson Ober Clough,Hans Huth and Norman Foerster. Each of these studies, however has virtually ignored a vital aspect of the <b>Man-Nature</b> <b>relationship</b> as it was conceived and as it matured in the young nation. From the beginning, the American view of Nature was influenced and often dictated by the American view of God and a complete picture of the role of Nature in this nation's literature cannot be gained without a consideration also of the role of God in those same writings. The thrust of this study is a consideration of the inter-relationships between God,Man,and nature as they were perceived and recorded by Jonathan Edwards, Philip Morin Freneau, William Cullen Bryant and Ralph Waldo Emerson. These four writers of the 18 th and 19 th centuries represent not only the essayists and poets of their respective centuries, but also some of the foremost religious, political and philosophical movements of their day. Edwards, like many Puritans before him, viewed Nature with a critical eye, recording the intricacies of her minutest forms with scientific interest. But more than this, he reveled in her beauties, finding in them a muted reflection of the ineffable beauty and majesty of God. Seeing in the workings of Nature shadows of Divine percepts, he began to compile a catalogue of those lessons which god had revealed for the edification of the Saints. Puritan doctrine imposed rigid controls upon the acquisition of these teachings, however. As Edwards taught these lessons, which were not new revelations of God, but rather illustrations of Biblical truths, could only be perceived by God’s Elect and then only when God chose to reveal them. Freneau’s view of Nature as teacher placed her in a role of greater importance. As a Deist, he believed that nature did not simply illustrate Biblical truths but was herself Man’s Bible. Like a book of ready answers about life and death, nature had been prepared in advance by a new remote God, who having fashioned a perfect universe to function in faultless rhythm, then sat back to simply watch it work. Rejecting the Puritan doctrine of the Elect, Freneau argued furthermore that Nature’s lessons were available to any individual who in earnestness sought them. Like Freneau, Bryant rejected any suggestion that nature’s secrets could be understood only by a chosen few. He found instead in the forests and mountains a vast and majestic cathedral in which an individual could reach upward with nature in earnest and loving worship of the creator. But he saw in nature, as well, an eager and sympathetic confidant, a comforter and a guide whose voice spoke freely to any who sought communion with her. Emerson, the Transcendentalist believed that through the very act of creation the Spirit of God flowed into and through every aspect of nature, making every particle in existence from the mightiest king to the smallest grain of sand partakers of his divinity. Man and nature were therefore one, sharing being within the over-soul. And since in the beginning god had thought each rock and tree and mountain into being, they existed as corporeal symbols of spiritual realities. Nature thus became the symbol of the spirit and as Emerson chose not to recognize the Bible as god’s guideline for mankind, nature became also an individual’s only avenue to God. Each of these four men Edwards, Freneau, Bryant and Emerson viewed nature from a slightly different perspective, their views influenced, in part at least by their understanding of God’s relationship to his creation. Yet what are most striking are not the differences in their beliefs, but rather the consistencies. Nature was for each of them, as indeed for most Americans to be admired for her majestic beauty preserved in her innocence and looked to her insight into the workings of God among Men. Jane E.

40|$|Nowadays {{territory}} and climate {{are recognized as}} factors that unquestionably affect social relationships. Many scholars (Crespi, 1992, p. 196) such as Aristotle, Jean Bodin, Charles Tocqueville and the Baron of Montesquieu (1973, p. 97), just to mention a few, have been concerned {{with this kind of}} conditioning influence. In particular, Montesquieu claims that there is a straight connection between democratic, republican and despotic forms of government and the spatiality of territory. Tocqueville (1973, p. 97) had attributed the affirmation of American spirit of equality to the wideness of USA territories compared to the extension of smaller nations. One can claim that cultural mediations are bound to the environment because the environment itself is mostly the result of transformations pursued directly by men or through their technological methodologies. This would justify the intersection between sociology and human geography studies that aims at contributing to the study of socialization dynamics based on the analysis of essential elements {{in the development of the}} environment. As Mautone (2002, p. 17) states, one of the key questions posed by human geography is establishing whether an individual is passively subjected to the influence of nature or, on the contrary, the individual has a crucial function. The author observes that under the influence of Darwinian theories, a large part of geographers have conceived the <b>man-nature</b> <b>relationship</b> in an univocal way: the physical element prevails on the human element. The turning point was the contribution of Paul Vidal de la Blache 1, who claimed that an individual is no longer subjected to nature but he is able to interfere with it through exact decisions that come from culture, technology and history. Lucien Febvre (1966, p. 578) embraces the circular scheme of influences in socio-environmental processes, and he states that: "transformed, adapted and modified by man, the humanized earth undoubtedly reacts on man afterwards; but first of all it is the individual who will wield his power of transformation and adaptation on the earth". Even though Febvre seems to highlight human primateship, it is now self-evident that the relationship between nature and socialized man is not unidirectional. The natural environment to Febvre is a set of possibilities: social actors act towards it selecting it. “Nothing is given nice and ready from nature to man, nothing is imposed to politics from geography: there is simply the adaptation of man to certain possibilities"; however, the sensibility towards the environmental balance is a given fact. An issue of considerable interest is the distinction between complex and simple structures, and the analysis of the environmental factors that give birth to a certain kind of structure, being a structure a relational and diversified set of elements, where every element has a significance that is related to its role in the general context. In the light of this premise, it is necessary to consider environment conditions as something external, whose existence is a given fact, independently from social actors' actions, even if these are interpreted and represented through cultural categories which they belong to. These conditions are in close connection with social forms and at the same time they can be considered as structures: the featuring elements of such structures are the relationships that bind the different factors that constitute it and that acquire a meaning only if they are valued according to their position within the structure. An appropriate distinction is the one existing between natural and social environment conditions and system structures. The latter are born from the will of the social actor on the basis of historical experience; instead, environmental conditions are obviously a fact that is external to the social group it interacts with. Specifically, this paper will analyze how and to what extent the environment and most of the factors that constitute it affect the analysis of social processes and modify the identity of the individual. The entire argumentation will pivot on the crucial relationship of mutual exchange between human geography and sociology; in particular, the discussion will focus on environmental impact and social relationship, and it will aim at giving a possible interpretation to the close bond that links identity problems with globalization: the growing need of identification (localism) and, in extreme situations, the consequent birth of forms of narcissism. Through the observation of a case study on a very small area in Southern Italy, the present study will pinpoint how demographic impoverishment can bring about an identity crisis and even lead to a possible extinction of small communities. As mentioned above, some specific dimensions have a particular position among the environmental structures that act and affect social relationships: Mineral resources are linked to the natural environment because they are produced by the environment and they represent a pivotal element for social organizations. Moreover, the environment becomes at the same time a possibility and a limit for the exploitation of its resources. Environment’s exploitation (Vallega, 1998, p. 66 ff.) for the use of natural resources depends on manifold social factors. As a matter of fact, the demand for a particular resource by a given social group will affect both the appearance that such exploitation would cause and the supply of the resource itself that will tend to drain away more cautiously than others. Indeed, the question of mineral resources involves such elements as the demographic aspect, the social stratification, and the distribution of the population on the territory by sex ad age: this points out that the shortage of a resource determines the result of human intervention on the natural environment. Natural gas, for instance, acquires economic significance when man discovers its potentiality as a resource; but above all, natural gas acquires significance as the object of a change in behavior with respect to reality, as it is linked both to social experience and to the forms of symbolic mediation. The concept of shortage allows a double interpretation: it can be considered as unwanted, i. e. as the result of control problems and imbalance; or it can be regarded as intentional, i. e. caused by political and economic elements. Shortage lacks an absolute and objective principle, therefore it will necessarily have to be related to the problems of labor organization and production cycle. Temporality features all social relationships and the connection of social relationships with material and institutional elements. The concept of time gets different functions and meanings according to the cultural environment that it expresses to the extent that time can become a constitutive factor of the entire social reality to which it makes reference. The notion of time is changeable as it varies according to historical moments and circumstances. Development has certainly accelerated the pace of life that has become faster and faster through the centuries. A time component that seems essential for the creation of a social organization is predictability, which compels to the analysis of both past and future times. The analysis of time structures requires a clarification first of all: man follows given times, which are related to the degree of technological and cultural advance that the human group has achieved; on the other hand, nature itself has its own times, either brief or extremely long, which effectively represent a physical element that cannot be ignored by human structures. Nature and communities may seem to follow two separate histories, each one with a different rhythm, which try to cross one another involving different areas, now a small one, then a very wide area, until they get to involve the whole planet. Temporality can be considered as the result of socially codified expectations. Sociologist Durkheim (1971, p. 628) has coined the concept of 'social time', which he defines as "the pace of social life which lays at the heart of time category". According to the kind of relationship that social actors establish with their environment, time can be conceived as a reversible 157 circular dimension, as in traditional agriculture-based society whose production was bound to the cycle of seasons; or it can be regarded as an irreversible dimension, as in industrial societies whose production is not bound to seasons and it is oriented towards a basically infinite development. Also the theory expressed by Merton (1984, p. 263) is interesting in this respect. Merton's theory on socially expected durations is based on those expectations that feature a wide range of social structures. A simple and immediate example is the amount of time that is necessary for an individual to reach a social status within a group. The position held by any individual within the social structure is linked to the movement in time. As a matter of fact, populations change, the relationship between men and women, between the young and the elderly evolve, and as a consequence an individual's position on the imaginary social ladder changes. In order to tackle the question of time, one should observe how natural factors, even in this case, appear to be connected to the structure of social forms and to cultural expressions, with an intent of mediation towards the experience of temporality itself. How does time actually work on human structures affecting their organization? The following example may explain the question: according to the time in which the different lithosphere layers of a territory were formed, a given type of mineral will be found. At the time in which a social group settles down in an area, it will create the means and the workmanship that can exploit that mineral. Therefore, this will affect the organization of several aspects in the life of that social group, as well as the landscape. In addition to this, the study carried out by Belloni (1986, pp. 72 - 73) on “time budget” highlights the ways in which time is used in everyday life. Space acquires significance by virtue of the interaction between itself and human activity. Durkheimian concept of social morphology is described by the author in the following way: space is an element that is closely linked to the study of social morphology, and it is also a subject of reflection for social morphology. (Durkheim, 1922, v. II, pp. 541 ff). Within this scope, the role of natural environment in the formation of different kinds of societies is unquestioned. Though, it is difficult to separate the natural elements from the artificial elements that result from the action of social actors. As a matter of fact, the former are perceived within the society, but they are produced by the society as well. The contribution of historical experience is crucial for reaching a result as the analysis cannot ignore past experience. In this respect, the study carried out by Toynbee (1950, pp. 31 ff.) gives a great contribution: the author summarizes man-environment relationship into a sort of challengeresponse relationship. This is based on the situation portrayed by Febvre (1966, p. 578) who suggests a 'possibilist' theory: social actors who face bonds and opportunities offered by the environment choose according their own culture and technology. Therefore, one can state that cultural models condition the structure of spaces. 'Space' in most cases means to man urban space, and surely this is even truer today than in the past. Current studies in the field of urban sociology claim that [Guidicini] it cannot be represented any longer as the prototype of Enlightenment town that considered these as key features: beauty, justice, efficiency and truth. The concept of beauty is limited within well defined spaces and times, while efficiency and justice acquire a merely economic significance with respect to the allocation of resources; truth hands over to science and technology, which rise to absolute values. The discussion will now move on to the observation of the crossing between the birth of an environment such as the urban structure and the actions that social actors perform within the structure. When a town is born it respects the functional necessities that produce social behaviors; within the town a sort of hierarchical order arranges the artificial environmental structures and affects movement, integration and actors' social space. Buildings and their symbolic character represent and strengthen the collective identity and they weigh upon the social structure, therefore they become a dominance structure. Simmel (1995, p. 94) has underlined the ambivalent character of these structures: if on one hand the town offers an increased number of choices and chances of interactions between individuals, on the other hand, the town fosters such human relationship that may provoke loneliness and alienation...|$|E
