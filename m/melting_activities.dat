30|$|Warrego Valles is {{a channel}} located in Thaumasia {{quadrangle}} (center {{latitude and longitude}} of this area is 42 °S and 270 °E respectively) and across 188 km in the highland. Judging from the network of branching valleys, its fluvial origin is quite clear. Gulick (1998, 2001) firstly noted the similarity with hydrological channel alongside of Hawaiian Kohala volcanoes but valleys have not formed all along the plateau boundary {{as might be expected}} from rainfall. The proof of hydrothermal and snow <b>melting</b> <b>activities</b> in this area might exist. Ansan and Mangold (2006) proposed the possibility of precipitation and surface runoff to cut off the fluvial channel in this area using THEMIS and MRO-NA images. Rossi et al. (2008) proposed the existence of periglacial landforms especially rock glacier. Recent HiRISE images showed complicated textures which may be evidence of the sublimation proposed by Mangold (2003). Therefore it is now very clear there was once a large amount of ice and molten water in the valley networks. The newly established CTX and HiRISE DTMs could provide powerful tools to model fluvial activities in Warrego Valles. For example, the fine resolution stereo DTM could give a clue of the extents of rock glacier activities and the amount of sublimated ice. To this end, the high-resolution stereo DTMs were updated in the proposed system.|$|E
40|$|The malaria {{parasite}} Plasmodium falciparum has two translationally active organelles - the apicoplast and mitochondrion, which import nuclear-encoded translation {{factors to}} mediate protein synthesis. Initiation of translation {{is a complex}} step wherein initiation factors (IFs) act in a regulated manner to form an initiation complex. We identified putative organellar IFs and investigated the targeting, structure and function of IF 1, IF 2 and IF 3 homologues encoded by the parasite nuclear genome. A single PfIF 1 is targeted to the apicoplast. Apart from its critical ribosomal interactions, PfIF 1 also exhibited nucleic-acid binding and <b>melting</b> <b>activities</b> and mediated transcription anti-termination. This suggests a prominent ancillary function for PfIF 1 in destabilisation of DNA and RNA hairpin loops encountered during transcription and translation of the A+T rich apicoplast genome. Of the three putative IF 2 homologues, only one (PfIF 2 a) was an organellar protein with mitochondrial localisation. We additionally identified an IF 3 (PfIF 3 a) that localised exclusively to the mitochondrion and another protein, PfIF 3 b, that was apicoplast targeted. PfIF 3 a exhibited ribosome anti-association activity, and monosome splitting by PfIF 3 a was enhanced by ribosome recycling factor (PfRRF 2) and PfEF-G(Mit). These results fill a gap {{in our understanding of}} organellar translation in Plasmodium, which is the site of action of several anti-malarial compounds. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|XPB helicase is {{the largest}} subunit of {{transcription}} factor IIH (TFIIH), a ten-subunit protein complex essential for transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER) in Eukarya. Two XPB homologues (XPBI and XPBII) {{are present in the}} genome of most crenarchaeota, one of the two major phyla of archaea; however, the biochemical properties have not been fully characterized and their cellular roles have not been clearly defined. Here, we report that XPBI from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus tokodaii (StoXPBI) is able to destabilize double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) helix independent of ATP (designated as dsDNA <b>melting</b> <b>activity).</b> This activity is inhibited by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and relies on the unique N-terminal domain of StoXPBI, which is also likely responsible for the intrinsic strong ssDNA binding activity of StoXPBI as revealed by deletion analysis.

To date, the <b>melting</b> <b>activity</b> of Csp proteins was studied using partially doublestranded model nucleic acids substrates forming stem–loop structures. Here, we studied the mechanism of nucleic acid melting by CspE. We show that CspE melts the stem region in two directions, that CspE-induced melting does not require the continuity of the substrate’s loop region, and CspE can efficiently melt model substrates with single-stranded overhangs as short as 4 nt. We further show that preferential binding of CspE at the stem–loop junction site initiates melting; binding of additional CspE molecules that fully cover the single-stranded region of a melting substrate leads to complete melting of the stem...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that cold shock domain {{proteins}} (CSDPs) and glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (GRPs) have been implicated {{to play a role}} during the cold adaptation process, their importance and function in eukaryotes, including plants, are largely unknown. To understand the functional role of plant CSDPs and GRPs in the cold response, two CSDPs (CSDP 1 and CSDP 2) and three GRPs (GRP 2, GRP 4 and GRP 7) from Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated. Heterologous expression of CSDP 1 or GRP 7 complemented the cold sensitivity of BX 04 mutant Escherichia coli that lack four cold shock proteins (CSPs) and is highly sensitive to cold stress, and resulted in better survival rate than control cells during incubation at low temperature. In contrast, CSDP 2 and GRP 4 had very little ability. Selective evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment (SELEX) revealed that GRP 7 does not recognize specific RNAs but binds preferentially to G-rich RNA sequences. CSDP 1 and GRP 7 had DNA <b>melting</b> <b>activity,</b> and enhanced RNase activity. In contrast, CSDP 2 and GRP 4 had no DNA <b>melting</b> <b>activity</b> and did not enhance RNAase activity. Together, these results indicate that CSDPs and GRPs help E. coli grow and survive better during cold shock, and strongly imply that CSDP 1 and GRP 7 exhibit RNA chaperone activity during the cold adaptation process...|$|R

Workers in the foundries are exposed to several compounds; therefore, {{it is important to}} assess the levels of injury that may reflect an additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effect caused by these compounds. The mean values of the environmental evaluation of the facilities range from 16. 65 to 40. 31 mg m 3 for Pb, 0. 99 to 1. 73 mg m 3 for Cd, and 0. 91 to 1. 70 mg m 3 for Mn.

40|$|Overbank sediments {{as a tool}} to {{reconstruct}} the pollution history of river catchments During inundation of a floodplain, suspended sediments are disposed on land. Throughout time, a sequence of fine-grained sediment layers is accumulating on the riverbank, each layer representing a single flood event. In theory, the uppermost sediment layer consist of the most recently deposited sediment, while the bottom layer of an overbank sediment profile is composed of older sediments. As a consequence, the geochemical signature found in the sequence of these layers represents the evolution of geochemical characteristics of river sediments through time. Sampling of overbank sediments at depth, in combination with information on sedimentological history and age of samples may even allow {{to reconstruct}} the pollution history of the river basin. Overbank sediment profiles taken downstream from mining or melting places in the Harz mountains (Germany, Matschullat et al. 1997) and along the Geul river (Belgium, Swennen et al., 1994) yielded detailed signatures of human activities in the respective drainage basins. Overbank sediments may also be interesting from an archaeological point of view. The geochemical and mineralogical analysis of sedimentary profiles of the Ouse River (UK) gave evidence that contamination by lead mining began in the Roman period (Hudson-Edwards et al., 1999). Analogously, dating of cores originating from the Rio Tinto alluvial plain indicated that mining of sulfide deposits go back to 3000 years BP (Davis et al., 2000). From an environmental point of view the use of overbank sediments is interesting because background concentrations found in overbank sediments are an essential reference point to evaluate the pollution status of soils and sediments. In this paper possibilities and limitations of the use of overbank sediments to reconstruct the environmental history of river catchments are illustrated and discussed. References Davis R.

First, it is the tool used by the E 1 double trimer (DT) to pry open and melt double-stranded DNA. Second, it is required for the unwinding activity of the hexameric E 1 helicase. The fact that the same structural element, but not the same residues, contacts both dsDNA in the DT for melting and ssDNA in the double hexamer (DH) for helicase activity provides a link between local origin melting and DNA helicase activity and suggests how the transition between these two states comes about...|$|R

DNA-melting activity of proteins was evaluated using molecular beacon assay in two ways: by measuring Tm parameter (the temperature at which half of the DNA beacon molecules is fully melted) and the beacon fluorescence at 4  °C. As the ratio protein/beacon was increased, a decrease in Tm was observed. Besides DNA-melting activity of full proteins, activity was measured for three isolated cold shock domains EsCSD 1 - 3, C-terminal domain of EsCSDP 1 (EsZnF 1), as well as a mixture of EsCSD 1 and EsZnF 1. The Tm reduction efficiency of proteins formed the following sequence: EsCSDP 3 ≈EsCSDP 1 >(EsCSD 1 +EsZnF 1) >EsZnF 1 >EsCSDP 2. Only full proteins EsCSDP 3 and EsCSDP 1 demonstrated DNA-melting activity at 4  °C.

40|$|Hfq {{protein is}} vital for the {{function}} of many non-coding small (s) RNAs in bacteria but the mechanism by which Hfq facilitates the function of sRNA is still debated. We developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay to probe how Hfq modulates the interaction between a sRNA, DsrA, and its regulatory target mRNA, rpoS. The relevant RNA fragments were labelled so that changes in intra- and intermolecular RNA structures can be monitored in real time. Our data show that Hfq promotes the strand exchange reaction in which the internal structure of rpoS is replaced by pairing with DsrA such that the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the mRNA becomes exposed. Hfq appears to carry out strand exchange by inducing rapid association of DsrA and a premelted rpoS and by aiding in the slow disruption of the rpoS secondary structure. Unexpectedly, Hfq also disrupts a preformed complex between rpoS and DsrA. While {{it may not be}} a frequent event in vivo, this <b>melting</b> <b>activity</b> may have implications in the reversal of sRNA-based regulation. Overall, our data suggests that Hfq not only promotes strand exchange by binding rapidly to both DsrA and rpoS but also possesses RNA chaperoning properties that facilitates dynamic RNA–RNA interactions...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis cold shock domain protein 3 (AtCSP 3), which shares a cold shock domain with bacterial CSPs, {{is involved in}} the acquisition of freezing tolerance in plants. AtCSP 3 complemented a cold-sensitive phenotype of the E. coli CSP quadruple mutant and displayed nucleic acid duplex <b>melting</b> <b>activity,</b> suggesting that AtCSP 3 also functions as an RNA chaperone. Promoter-GUS transgenic plants revealed tissue-specific expression of AtCSP 3 in shoot and root apical regions.

In transgenic plants expressing an AtCSP 3 -GFP fusion, GFP signals were detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. An AtCSP 3 knock-out mutant (atcsp 3 - 2) was sensitive to freezing compared with wild-type plants under non-acclimated and cold-acclimated conditions, whereas expression of C-repeat-binding factors and their downstream genes during cold acclimation was not altered in the atcsp 3 - 2 mutant. Overexpression of AtCSP 3 in transgenic plants conferred enhanced freezing tolerance over wild-type plants.

Dna 2 nuclease/helicase and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN 1) are proposed to cleave the flap. The single-stranded DNA-binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), governs cleavage activity. Flap-bound RPA inhibits FEN 1. This necessitates cleavage by Dna 2, which is stimulated by RPA. FEN 1 then cuts the remaining RPA-free flap {{to create a}} nick for ligation. Cleavage by Dna 2 requires that it enter the 5 ′-end and track down the flap. Because Dna 2 cleaves the RPA-bound flap, we investigated the mechanism by which Dna 2 accesses the protein-coated flap for cleavage. Using a nuclease-defective Dna 2 mutant, we showed that just binding of Dna 2 dissociates the flap-bound RPA. Facile dissociation is specific to substrates with a genuine flap, and will not occur with an RPA-coated single strand. We also compared the cleavage patterns of Dna 2 with and without RPA to better define RPA stimulation of Dna 2. Stimulation derived from removal of DNA folding in the flap. Apparently, coordinated with its dissociation, RPA relinquishes the flap to Dna 2 for tracking {{in a way that}} does not allow flap structure to reform.

This situation {{can be found in the}} Altay mountains in Southern Siberia, where the recent glacierization of > 700 km 2 is subject to continuous mass loss, even though the shrinking is comparably slow. The glacier retreat is accompanied by an extension of supra-glacial moraine, which itself strongly influences ablation rates. To quantify these effects, the spatial evolution of debris cover since 1952 was analysed for three glaciers in the North Chuya Ridge using satellite and airborne imagery. In summer 2007, an ablation experiment was carried out on debris covered parts of Maliy Aktru glacier. Thermistors in different depths within the moraine provided data to calculate thermal resistance of the debris. A set of ablation stakes was installed at locations with differing debris thickness and observed regularly throughout the entire melt season. Air temperature from an AWS was used to calculate degree day factors in dependence of the debris thickness. To take into account the shading effect of surrounding walls and peaks, the potential solar radiation and its evolution throughout the summer was determined from a digital elevation model. This allows us to extrapolate our measurements from Maliy Aktru to the other two glaciers of the Aktru basin and to estimate basin melt rates.

The far-UV CD-spectral analysis revealed all variants, except R 39 A, to have structures similar to that of HPR. The catalytic activity of all HPR variants on single stranded RNA substrate was similar to that of HPR, whereas on dsRNA, the catalytic efficiency of all single residue variants, except for the Q 28 L, was significantly reduced.

40|$|SummaryThe insulin/PI 3 K {{signaling}} pathway controls both tissue growth and metabolism. Here, we identify Melted {{as a new}} modulator of this pathway in Drosophila. Melted interacts with both Tsc 1 and FOXO and can recruit these proteins to the cell membrane. We provide evidence that in the <b>melted</b> mutant, TOR <b>activity</b> is reduced and FOXO is activated. The melted mutant condition mimics the effects of nutrient deprivation in a normal animal, producing an animal with 40 % less fat than normal...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe rifting between Arabia and Somalia, {{which started}} around 35 Ma, was {{followed}} by oceanic accretion from at least 17. 6 Ma leading {{to the formation of}} the present-day Gulf of Aden. Bathymetric, gravity and magnetic data from the Encens-Sheba cruise are used to constrain the structure and segmentation of the oceanic basin separating the conjugate continental margins {{in the eastern part of}} the Gulf of Aden between 51 degrees E and 55. 5 degrees E. Data analysis reveals that the oceanic domain along this ridge section is divided into two distinct areas. The Eastern area is characterized by a shorter wavelength variation of the axial segmentation and an extremely thin oceanic crust. In the western segment, a thicker oceanic crust suggests a high melt supply. This supply is probably due to an off-axis melting anomaly located below the southern flank of the Sheba ridge, 75 km east of the major Alula-Fartak transform fault. This suggests that the axial morphology is produced by a combination of factors, including spreading rate, melt supply and the edge effect of the Alula-Fartak transform fault, as well as the proximity of the continental margin. The oceanic domains have undergone two distinct phases of accretion since the onset of seafloor spreading, with a shift around 11 Ma. At that time, the ridge jumped southwards, in response to the melting anomaly. Propagating ridges were triggered by the <b>melting</b> <b>activity,</b> and propagated both eastward and westward. The influence of the melting anomaly on the ridges decreased, stopping their propagation since less than 9 Ma. From that time up to the present, the N 025 degrees E-trending Socotra transform fault developed in association with the formation of the N 115 degrees E-trending segment # 2. In recent times, a counter-clockwise rotation of the stress field associated with kinematic changes could explain the structural morphology of the Alula-Fartak and Socotra-Hadbeen fracture zones...|$|R

40|$|The {{dismantling}} of the BR 3 -PWR reactor leads {{to the production of}} large masses of contaminated metallic pieces, including structural materials, primary pipings, tanks and heat exchangers. One of our main objectives is to demonstrate that we can minimize the volume of radioactive waste in an economical way, by the use of alternative waste routes, such as the clearance of materials after thorough decontamination. The SCKoCEN uses its own developed chemical decontamination process, so-called MEDOC (Metal Decontamination by Oxidation with Cerium), based on the use of cerium IV as strong oxidant in sulphuric acid with continuous regeneration using ozone. An industrial installation has been designed and constructed in close collaboration with Framatome-ANP (France). This installation started operation in September 1999 for the treatment of the metallic pieces arising from the {{dismantling of}} the BR 3 reactor. Since then, more than 25 tons of contaminated material including primary pipes have been treated batchwise with success. 75 % of material could be directly cleared after treatment (Activity lower than 0. 1 Bq/g for 60 Co) and the other 25 % free released after <b>melting</b> <b>activity.</b> The SCKoCEN performed in April 2002 the closed loop decontamination of the BR 3 Steam Generator by connection of the MEDOC plant after few adaptations. The decontamination was done within 30 cycles in 3 weeks with consecutive steps like decontamination steps (injection of the solution into the SG) and regeneration steps with ozone. In total, 60 hours of decontamination at 70 C and 130 hours of regeneration were needed to reach the objectives. The tube bundle (600 m 2) was attacked and about 10 {micro}m representing more than 41 kg of stainless steel and 2. 06 GBq of 60 Co was dissolved into the solution. The residual contamination measurements made directly into the water box are still going on, however it seems that the objective to reach the free release criteria after melting is achieved. The next decontamination operations of large components concern the primary pumps (* 2) and the pressurizer and are foreseen in October 2002. The decontamination studies of large components take into account the technical aspects, the radiological and classical safety aspects, as well as the financial aspect...|$|R
40|$|The {{pyroxene}} saturation {{surface in}} the system diopside-albite-anorthite may be calculated to + or - 10 C from thermochemical data over most of its composition range. The thermochemical data used are the experimentally determined enthalpies of mixing of the ternary liquids and the enthalpy of fusion of diopside. These are combined with a mixing model for the configurational entropy in the <b>melt</b> and the <b>activity</b> of CaMgSi 2 O 6 in the clinopyroxene, which is less than unity due to departures from CaMgSi 2 O 6 stoichiometry.

In our work the aO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -"Nb 2 O 5 " melts were equilibrated with a reference metal Cu in a CO/CO 2 /Ar atmosphere at 1873 K. The equilibrated slag {{was detected by}} wet-chemical analysis, and the niobium oxide in slag {{was assumed to be}} Nb 02. To calculate the activity of NbO 2 in the <b>melts,</b> the <b>activity</b> coefficient of Nb in the reference metal Cu was measured by a chemical equilibrium method and could be expressed by the following equation: logγ 0 Nb(s) = 7292. 832 /T- 2. 520 The activity coefficient of NbO 2 in slags relative to pure solid increased as the basicity (CaO/SiO 2) increased. When the oxygen pressure increased from 1. 78 × 10 - 6 Pa to 4. 36 x 10 - 5 Pa, the activity coefficients of NbO 2 in slags increased 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.

40|$|For decades, the Earth Science (ES) {{community}} has launched missions to monitor vital phenomena {{of our planet}} and, through measurements, obtain data for improving their models. Indeed the proper characterisation of phenomena, such as desertification, Arctic sea ice <b>melting,</b> volcanic <b>activities</b> or earthquakes effects, requires the analysis of data acquired in a long period and the validation of correctness of scientific models. This means that digital data, especially in the ES domain, represents an important asset to be preserved over time. Despite each single ES mission’s cost being quantified and supported by well documented evidence, ES organisations {{are not able to}} assess the value of data generated by those missions over time. This paper describes the rationale for and an approach to modelling the value of data/information to be preserved over long term in digital archive. This is the result of experience in the SCIDIP-ES project [16] which has considered the: i) definition of models for describing the value of digital data and related information; ii) characterisation of data/information value model through core set of key parameters and iii) identification of long term digital preservation activities that may potentially impact on key parameters and consequently on the value of digital assets. This model is being assessed in ES scenarios with data curators and archive managers...|$|R

A unique high-temperature cavitometer sensor, placed at various locations in the liquid <b>melt,</b> measured cavitation <b>activity</b> at various acoustic power levels and different temperature ranges. The highest cavitation intensity in the liquid bulk is achieved {{below the surface of}} the sonotrode, at the lowest temperature and with an applied power of 3. 5 kW. This two-fold mechanism is related to (a) acoustic shielding and (b) the tendency of liquid aluminium to release hydrogen when the temperature drops, thus promoting multiple cavitation events. Understanding these mechanisms in liquid metals can result in a major breakthrough for the optimization of ultrasound applications to liquid metal processing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of the cation's central atom {{in the behavior of}} pairs of ammonium- and phosphonium-based ionic liquids was investigated through the measurement of densities, viscosities, <b>melting</b> temperatures, <b>activity</b> coefficients at infinite dilution, refractive indices, and toxicity against Vibrio fischeri. All the properties investigated are affected by the cation's central atom nature, with ammonium-based ionic liquids presenting higher densities, viscosities, melting temperatures, and enthalpies. Activity coefficients at infinite dilution show the ammonium-based ionic liquids to present slightly higher infinite dilution activity coefficients for non-polar solvents, becoming slightly lower for polar solvents, suggesting that the ammonium-based ionic liquids present somewhat higher polarities. In good agreement these compounds present lower toxicities than the phosphonium congeners. To explain this behavior quantum chemical gas phase DFT calculations were performed on isolated ion pairs at the BP-TZVP level of theory. Electronic density results were used to derive electrostatic potentials of the identified minimum conformers. Electrostatic potential-derived CHelpG and Natural Population Analysis charges show the P atom of the tetraalkylphosphonium-based ionic liquids cation to be more positively charged than the N atom in the tetraalkylammonium-based analogous IL cation, and a noticeable charge delocalization occurring in the tetraalkylammonium cation, when compared with the respective phosphonium congener. It is argued that this charge delocalization is responsible for the enhanced polarity observed on the ammonium based ionic liquids explaining the changes in the thermophysical properties observed...|$|R
