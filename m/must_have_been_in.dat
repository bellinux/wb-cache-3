5|$|Musical {{instruments}} {{used by the}} Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking {{similarity to}} those of Mesopotamia, leading historians {{to conclude that the}} civilizations <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> contact with one another. Sachs notes that Egypt did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess. However, by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated; the lyre, a prominent ceremonial instrument in Sumer, did not appear in Egypt for another 800 years. Clappers and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 3000 BC. The civilization also made use of sistra, vertical flutes, double clarinets, arched and angular harps, and various drums.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} date of Yoga Yajnavalkya is unclear. Prahlad Divanji, an Indologist and Sanskrit scholar, {{states that}} the text was composed between the second century BCE and fourth century CE, because Yoga Upanishads and Hatha Yoga texts contain verses from Yoga Yajnavalkya. Divanji cites Tantra texts, Ayurveda tradition texts, and literature of Advaita Vedanta from the 4th century CE, which mention the Yoga Yajnavalkya, thereafter concluding that the text or some version of the Yoga Yajnavalkya text <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> existence by the 4th century CE. However, adds Divanji, the text {{is likely to have}} been composed after Patanjali's Yogasutra, which itself is variously estimated to have composed sometime between 500 BCE and 400 CE. Divanji premises his dating proposal from the observation that Yoga Yajnavalkya expands on ideas in Patanjali's text, such as its list of Yamas, which includes the Patanjali's five plus five additional ones.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{archaeological site}} is the imperial palace complex which Roman emperor Galerius, located at Navarinou Square, commissioned {{when he made}} Thessaloniki the capital of his portion of the Roman Empire. The large octagonal portion of the complex, most of which survives to this day, {{is believed to have}} been an imperial throne room. Various mosaics from the palatial complex have also survived.

25|$|The last {{well-known}} use of {{the tomb}} itself was in the Claudio-Neronian period, when the daughter and the grandchild of Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus were buried here. These burials may {{be an attempt to}} emphasize for ideological reasons his descent from the Scipios; on the other hand, the latter speculation seems a harsh view of a man who, on the presumption that he was emotionally normal, <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> grief at the death of his child. Repairs on the tomb continued until the 4th century. After then the mainly Christian Romans (who did not have the same loyalties to the traditions of pagan Rome) apparently stopped maintaining it and lost track of it.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} qualify for the office of Chief Judge, a judge <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not {{previously}} served as Chief Judge. A vacancy in the office of Chief Judge is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The Chief Judge serves for a term of seven years or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position. Unlike the Chief Justice of the United States, a Chief Judge returns to active service after the expiration of his or her term and does not create a vacancy on the bench by the fact of his or her promotion.

25|$|The other Nubian {{languages}} are found hundreds of kilometers to the southwest, in Darfur {{and in the}} Nuba Mountains of Kordofan. For a long time {{it was assumed that}} the Nubian peoples dispersed from the Nile Valley to the south, probably {{at the time of the}} downfall of the Christian kingdoms. However, comparative lexicostatistic research in the second half of the twentieth century has shown that the spread <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction. Greenberg (as cited in Thelwall 1982) calculated that a split between Hill Nubian and the two Nile-Nubian languages occurred at least 2,500years ago. This is corroborated by the fact that the oral tradition of the Shaiqiya tribe of the Jaali group of arabized Nile-Nubians tells of coming from the southwest long ago. The speakers of Nobiin are thought to have come to the area before the speakers of the related Kenzi-Dongolawi languages (see classification below).|$|E
25|$|While the Mongolian {{language}} was undoubtedly in general {{use at the}} court of Batu, few Mongol texts written in {{the territory of the}} Golden Horde have survived, perhaps because of the prevalent general illiteracy. According to Grigor'ev, yarliq, or decrees of the Khans, were written in Mongol, then translated into the Cuman language. The existence of Arabic-Mongol and Persian-Mongol dictionaries dating {{from the middle of the}} 14th century and prepared for the use of the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate suggests that there was a practical need for such works in the chancelleries handling correspondence with the Golden Horde. It is thus reasonable to conclude that letters received by the Mamluks – if not also written by them – <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Mongol. Indeed, the linguistic and even socio-linguistic impacts were great, as the Russians borrowed thousands of words, phrases, and other significant linguistic features from the Mongol and Turkic languages that were united under the Mongol Empire.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} all notice of Heraclea during the {{subsequent}} century, and {{the wars of}} Dionysius I of Syracuse with the Carthaginians, suggests that either it did not then exist, or <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a very reduced condition. However the territory of Heraclea Minoa fell under Carthaginian control {{as a result of}} the treaty of 405BC. The next mention of it (under the name of Minoa), when Dion landed there in 357BC, represents it as a small town in the Agrigentine territory, but still subject to Carthage. Hence it is probable that the treaty between Dionysius and the Carthaginians which had fixed the Halycus as the boundary of the latter, had left Heraclea, though on its southeast bank, still in their hands: and, in accordance with this, we find it stipulated by the similar treaty concluded with them by Agathocles (314BC), that Heraclea, Selinus, and Himera should continue subject to Carthage, as they had been before.|$|E

25|$|Fornebu Air Traffic Control {{noticed that}} the {{aircraft}} disappeared from their radar and notified Asker and Bærum Police District at 16:36 {{that there was a}} potential crash. Fornebu contacted Drammen Police District at 16:57 and asked for a search in the area around the farm at Solli. The air traffic control estimated the area in which they believed the aircraft <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in.</b> Despite that their estimate for the crash site was accurate, they gave the police an incorrect sector to search in. Asker and Bærum Police District dispatched two patrols at 17:00, one from Asker to Solli and from Sandvika to Nikebatteriet. The patrol from Asker passed almost right by the crash site, stopped to investigate, but found no indications of the wreckage. At 17:13 the police requested that crew be allocated to Nikebatteriet to conduct a search and rescue operation. The overall coordination is carried out by the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway (JRCC SN).|$|E
25|$|By December 18, Gacy was {{beginning}} to show visible signs of strain {{as a result of}} the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 civil suit against the Des Plaines police, demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to a Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the parka pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor. This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11: the presence of the receipt indicated that Gacy <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> contact with Robert Piest after the youth had left the Nisson Pharmacy on December 11.|$|E
25|$|John Stuart Mill, the English thinker and politician, began a {{formative}} year visiting France {{at the age}} of 14 with {{a two-week}} stay at Pompignan in June 1820. In long letters to his father (who financed the educational trip), the precocious Mill details his extensive reading in the library of the chateau, including almost one work per day by Voltaire, Lefranc's main enemy, without once referring to the marquis' own works. Even by then something of a connoisseur of gardens, he walked in what he called the 'pleasure grounds' of the chateau almost every day, and sometimes to the plateau above (whose views he was to recall later, in other works), without ever giving any detail on the park itself. Mills was in Pompignan as a guest of Samuel Bentham, who was renting a property in the grounds, giving weight to the belief that the marquis (the second) was impecunious at that point. But we can take it that the garden <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> good order during Mill's visit, or he would have remarked on it.|$|E
