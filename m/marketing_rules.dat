If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IESO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant <b>market</b> <b>rules.</b> Background The <b>market</b> <b>rules</b> (sections 6. 3, 6. 4, 6. 5 of Chapter 3) provide for the suspension and termination of a market participant and disconnection of a facility for financial events of default and for persistent breaches of the <b>market</b> <b>rules.</b> The recent insolvencies of two market participants exposed gaps in the <b>market</b> <b>rules</b> relating to suspension, termination and disconnection for events of default. Among other things, these gaps create a risk that the market may be required to “carry ” a defaulting market participant for an extended period of time. The IESO is seeking to reduce this risk by streamlining the process and limiting or removing measures that duplicate legal protections available to a defaulting market participant outside of the <b>market</b> <b>rules.</b> At its meeting on June 28, 2007 the IESO Board reviewed these issues and provided a preliminary policy direction that the IESO undertake stakeholder consultation on amendments to the <b>market</b> <b>rules</b> to address these gaps identified and bring forward these amendments to the IESO Board for its review and consideration later in 2007. The IESO Board also directed the IESO to establish predetermined criteria for those instances in which the IESO seeks to convert an existing <b>market</b> <b>rule</b> obligation (shall) into a <b>market</b> <b>rules</b> permission (may).

In addition, the limited definition of permitted investments for UCITS weakened the marketing possibilities of a UCITS. Accordingly, {{in the early}} 1990s proposals were developed to amend the 1985 Directive and more successfully harmonise laws throughout Europe. These discussions, although leading to a draft UCITS II directive, were subsequently abandoned as being too ambitious when the Council of Ministers could not reach a common position.|$|E
50|$|After {{this big}} success, no new album {{appeared}} until 1980, when Bennato surprised fans, critics {{and the whole}} music biz with a very unconventional move: two albums {{in less than a}} month: Uffa!

The two albums together sold more than a million copies, against all <b>marketing</b> <b>rules</b> and expectations. Bennato was clearly at the apex of his creativity. Uffa! Uffa!, the most experimental of the two records, is an album where Bennato blatantly disregarded all commercial concerns and let his creativity free to indulge in all kinds of directions, from medieval ecclesiastical chants to punk rock. The album also contained big hits but was generally overshadowed by the hugely successful Sono solo canzonette, a concept album based on the Pater Pan fairy tale and affirming the value of fantasy and imagination over reason and logic.|$|E

If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IMO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant <b>market</b> <b>rules.</b> Section 12. 3. 1 of Chapter 5 provides a listing of the real-time functions supported by the energy management system (EMS) including the monitoring of the IMO-controlled grid, the scheduling of generation facilities, the monitoring of compliance with dispatch instructions; and dispatch messages. The distinction between the terms dispatch instruction and dispatch message is that a dispatch message is the medium by which a dispatch instruction is given as described in the Participant Technical Reference Manual, Part 6. 2 : Dispatch Information. The definition of dispatch instructions is in respect of a registered facility other than a boundary entity, a physical operating instruction issued by the IMO in the real-time dispatch process, and, in respect of a registered facility that is a boundary entity, the interchange schedule pertaining to that registered facility. However, using the term “dispatch instruction ” and “dispatch message ” in the <b>Market</b> <b>Rules</b> is a potential source of confusion since the distinction between the two terms is not clear within the <b>Market</b> <b>Rules.</b> The <b>Market</b> <b>Rules</b> refer to “dispatch message ” in section 12. 3. 1. 6 and the term is not defined in the <b>Market</b> <b>Rules.</b> The IMO is of the view that the term dispatch message is unnecessary within the <b>Market</b> <b>Rules</b> since the term dispatch message is more appropriately described in the Participant Technical Reference Manual.

Methods and Findings We conducted structured reviews of rulings by the UK self-regulatory authority, the Pre-scription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA), between 2003 and 2012. There were 74 off-label promotion rulings involving 43 companies and 65 drugs. Nineteen compa-nies were ruled in breach more than once, and ten companies were ruled in breach three or more times over the 10 -y period.

40|$|Comments welcome Pricing and <b>marketing</b> <b>rules</b> with brand loyalty* Salvador Valdés-Prieto** Many firms face {{a dynamic}} trade-off: if price is reduced, the firm attracts new {{customers}} who will yield {{profits in the}} future, but it also forgoes the opportunity to squeeze profits now from loyal customers. This paper identifies a rule that represents the optimal resolution of this trade-off, {{in terms of an}} intuitive modification to the static Lerner rule. We find that the “effective ” price elasticity depends on the discount rate used by the firm, on the rate of depreciation of the clientele through exit from the stock of repeat purchasers, and on a weighted sum of the price elasticities of the flow of entries into the stock of repeat-purchasers and the flow of exits from the stock of repeat-purchasers. None of these factors enter the optimal pricing strategy for a firm facing a conventional demand function with instantaneous adjustment, i. e. where consumers are “fast switchers”, rather tha...|$|E
40|$|This paper synthesizes recent {{research}} and new empirical findings {{to build a}} more comprehensive understanding of developments in China's dairy sector. China's tremendous rise in dairy demand {{has been driven by}} several mutually reinforcing factors: including rapid income growth, promotion by the government and dairy industry, changes in urban lifestyles, and the development of new, more sophisticated marketing channels. Domestic milk output has grown to satisfy rising demand largely by increasing the dairy herd. Substantial increases in productivity have been achieved through technology adoption, but there is evidence that the torrid growth has created inefficiencies because adaptations to <b>marketing</b> <b>rules,</b> infrastructure, and institutions have not kept pace with the changing environment. These results suggest there is ample room for future growth in both domestic milk production and dairy demand, but multinational firms and imported products will likely play and increasing role as China's dairy market continues to develop.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{association}} rule mining {{has been used}} by marketers for many years to extract <b>marketing</b> <b>rules</b> from purchase transactions. Marketers and managers employ these rules in order to predict customer needs for future sales. Extracting effective rules {{is one of the major}} problems of marketers. Effective rules can help them to make better marketing decisions. On the other hand, the Recency, Frequency, Monetary value and Duration (RFMD) method is one of the popular methods used in market segmentation that indicate profitable groups of customers. In this paper, a novel method is proposed that takes advantage of the RFMD method to extract effective association rules from profitable segments of purchase transactions. In other words, in the first step, raw data are classified based on the RFMD technique; and in the second step, effective association rules are extracted from sections with high RFMD values. The proposed method employs a new Maximum Frequent Itemset Extractor (MFIE) algorithm that outperforms the classic algorithm (Apriori) in extracting frequent itemsets from a large number of transactions. In addition, unlike most of the previous central methods, the proposed method is designed for extracting association rules from distributed databases. association rules; recency frequency monetary value duration; RFMD; maximum frequent itemset; data analysis; data mining; marketing rules; purchase transactions; market segmentation. ...|$|E
