5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of <b>mechanical</b> <b>complexity</b> and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century.

All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its <b>mechanical</b> <b>complexity</b> and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in legged robotics {{have found that}} constant stiffness passive compliant legs are an effective mechanism for enabling dynamic locomotion. In spite of its success, one {{of the limitations of}} this approach is reduced adaptability. The final leg mechanism usually performs optimally for a small range of conditions such as the desired speed, payload, and terrain. For many situations in which a small locomotion system experiences a change in any of these conditions, it is desirable to have a tunable stiffness leg for effective gait control. ^ To date, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>complexities</b> of designing usefully robust tunable passive compliance into legs has precluded their implementation on practical running robots. In this thesis we present an overview of tunable stiffness legs, and introduce a simple leg model that captures the spatial compliance of our tunable leg.

Finally we discuss design objectives, material considerations, and manufacturing methods that lead to robust passive compliant legs. ...|$|R

In fact, the excitation strongly modifies the topology of the safe basins, and a dynamical integrity perspective accounting for the magnitude of the solely compact part of the safe basin must be considered. By means of extensive numerical simulations, robustness/erosion profiles of dynamic solutions/basins for varying axial load and dynamic amplitude are built, respectively. These curves permit to appreciate the practical reduction of system load carrying capacity and, upon choosing the value of residual integrity admissible for engineering design, the Thompson practical stability.

40|$|Considerable {{effort was}} devoted to the {{development}} of two-dimensional adaptive wall test sections. The development of fully three-dimensional test sections, however, has not had this same level of effort expended. The limitations on three-dimensional research are the result of the complexity of both the mechanical design and operational aspects. Typical of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>complexities</b> are lack of readily available model and flow visualization access, and problems of sealing between adjacent walls for multi-wall types of test sections. The operational aspects are complicated by the necessity for many measurements of the boundary conditions which can be very time consuming. In three-dimensional testing, it is impossible to remove all of the boundary interference. It will be necessary, therefore, to apply residual corrections to the data. The more complex the test section shape, the more complex the calculation of the residual corrections becomes. From both the viewpoint of test section complexity and of ease of residual corrections, a simplified test section geometry is desirable. To aid in the design of simplified test sections, several researchers investigated the capability of using two-dimensional adaptive wall test sections to perform three-dimensional testing. By use of this type of design, the inherent complications and limitations of the fully three-dimensional design are avoided. Strategies of adaptation used for this application are described, as well as, sample results and a discussion of some limitations of the technique...|$|R

2500|$|The moving-belt {{interface}} (MBI) {{was developed}} in 1977. This interface [...] consisted of an endless moving belt receiving the LC column effluent. On the belt, the solvent was evaporated by gently heating and efficiently exhausting [...] the solvent vapors under reduced pressure in two vacuum chambers. After removing the liquid phase, the analytes would desorb from the belt and migrate to the MS ion source to be analysed. MBI was successfully used for LC-MS applications between 1978 and 1990 because it allowed coupling of LC to MS devices using EI, CI, and fast-atom bombardment (FAB) ion sources. The most common MS systems connected by MBI interfaces to LC columns were magnetic sector and quadropole instruments. MBI interfaces for LC-MS allowed MS to be widely applied {{in the analysis of}} drugs, pesticides, steroids, alkaloids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

2500|$|On the {{practical}} side, Torres built {{a whole series}} of analogue calculating machines, all mechanical. These machines used certain elements known as arithmophores which consisted of a moving part and an index that made it possible to read the quantity according to the position shown thereon. The aforesaid moving part was a graduated disk or a drum turning on an axis. The angular movements were proportional to the logarithms of the magnitudes to be represented. Using a number of such elements, Torres developed a machine that could solve algebraic equations, even one with eight terms, finding the roots, including the complex ones, with a precision down to thousandths. One part of this machine, called an [...] "endless spindle" [...] ("fusee sans fin") and consisting of great <b>mechanical</b> <b>complexity,</b> allowed the mechanical expression of the relation y=log(10^x+1), with the aim of extracting the logarithm of a sum as a sum of logarithms, the same technique which is the basis of the modern electronic Logarithmic Number System. Since an analogical machine was being used, the variable could be of any value (not only discrete prefixed values). With a polynomial equation, the wheels representing the unknown spin round, and the result gives the values of the sum of the variables. When this sum coincides with the value of the second member, the wheel of the unknown shows a root.|$|E

40|$|Simulating the {{deformation}} of active volcanoes is challenging due to inherent <b>mechanical</b> <b>complexities</b> associated with heterogeneous distributions of rheologic properties and irregular geometries {{associated with the}} topography and bathymetry. From geologic and tomographic studies we know that geologic bodies naturally have complex 3 D shapes. Finite element models (FEMs) are capable of simulating the pressurization of magma intrusions into mechanical domains with arbitrary geometric and geologic complexity. We construct FEMs comprising pressurization (due to magma intrusion) within an assemblage of 3 D parts having common mechanical properties for Rabaul Caldera, Papua New Guinea. We use information of material properties distributed on discrete points mainly deduced from topography, geology, seismicity, and tomography of Rabaul Caldera to first create contours of each part and successively to generate each 3 D part shape by lofting the volume through the contours. The implementation of Abaqus CAE with Python scripts allows for automated execution of hundreds of commands necessary {{for the construction of}} the parts having substantial geometric complexity. The lofted solids are then assembled to form the composite model of Rabaul Caldera, having a geometrically complex loading configuration and distribution of rheologic properties.

2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD.

An EVF image has lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and <b>mechanical</b> <b>complexity</b> than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system.

2500|$|The thermospray (TSP) {{interface}} {{was developed}} in 1983 by Vestal laboratories at the University of Houston. The interface resulted from a long term research project intended to find a LC-MS interface capable of handling high flow rates (1 ml/min) and avoiding the flow split in DLI interfaces.The TSP interface was composed by a heated probe, a desolvation chamber, and an ion exchange skimmer. The LC effluent passed through the heated probe and emerged as a jet of vapor and small droplets flowing into the desolvation chamber at low pressure. The ionization of solutes occurred by direct evaporation or ion-molecule reactions induced by the solvent. This interface was able to handle up to 2 ml/min of eluate from the LC column and would efficiently introduce it into the MS vacuum system. TSP was also more suitable for LC-MS applications involving reversed phase liquid chromatography (RT-LC). The TSP system had a dual function acting as an interface and a solvent-mediated chemical ionization source. With time, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>complexity</b> of TSP was simplified, and this interface became popular as the first ideal LC-MS interface for pharmaceutical applications comprising the [...] analysis of drugs, metabolites, conjugates, nucleosides, peptides, natural products, and pesticides.

Different elements control the nature {{and the extent of}} the coseismic and post-seismic ruptures, including the geometry of faults, the nature of faulted rocks, and the stress changes caused by the mainshocks. In May–June 2012 a severe seismic sequence struck a portion of the Po Plain (Northern Italy), where a thick blanket of Plio-Quaternary sediments hides a number of seismogenic sources corresponding to the external thrust systems of the Northern Apennines. We used deep seismic reflection data to reconstruct the geometry of the faults responsible for the sequence. These faults exhibit significant non-planarity due to tectono-stratigraphic heterogeneities inherited froma complex pre-thrusting extensional tectonic phase. A comparison of the fault parameters derived from our geological analysis and the evidence supplied by seismological (aftershock distributions) and geodetic data (InSAR) allowed to identify the causative fault segments of the two mainshocks. We thenmodeled the Coulomb stress changes produced by two mainshocks to analyze on- and offfault seismicity. Discrepancies between themagnitude of the earthquakes and the extent of active faults suggest that the mainshocks did not rupture the entire thrust planes. We contend that seismogenic ruptures were confined in the Mesozoic carbonates and were stopped by lithological changes and/or <b>mechanical</b> <b>complexities</b> of the fault planes, both along dip and along strike.
