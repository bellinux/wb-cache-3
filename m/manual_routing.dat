In this paper, we introduce the design of a novel TRNG based on the coherent sampling (CS) phenomenon. Contrarily to most designs based on this phenomenon, ours uses self-timed rings (STR) instead of the commonly employed ring oscillators (RO). Our design has two key advantages over existing proposals based on CS: it does not depend on the FPGA vendor used and does not need <b>manual</b> placement and <b>routing</b> in the manufacturing process, resulting in a highly portable generator.

For this problem, we propose an algorithm to route nets on x-y layer pairs. However, for some board designs, buried vias are forbidden due to high manufacturing costs.

40|$|International audiencePhase-locked loop (PLL) based true {{random number}} {{generator}} (TRNG) is very well suited for security applications using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) because most of FPGAs feature hardwired PLL blocks. PLL based TRNGs (PLL-TRNGs) are easy to implement and do not require <b>manual</b> placement or <b>routing.</b> The design of such TRNGs is also highly portable within the same device family. This {{is not the case}} in many other TRNG designs. However, the design of a PLL-TRNGs is not a trivial task. Due to many PLL parameters, which need to be fine tuned to achieve required security and speed requirements, an exhaustive design space exploration is practically not feasible. Thus, the designers are required to go through many trial and error cycles of manual parameter tweaking and the results are still not guaranteed to be optimal. In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization to generate a suitable configuration of the PLL-TRNG, such that it is secure and reaches high output bit rate. GA optimization allows to take into account physical limits of the PLL, such as input/output frequency, and maximum voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) frequency, which avoids invalid configurations and reduces the development time. The method has proven to be very efficient and it significantly reduces the design time without compromising the security.

Proper route selection will minimize economic loss and negative socio-environmental impacts while a poorly selected route could have severe consequences including pipe explosions and loss of lives in extreme cases. In the past, the traditional (<b>manual)</b> <b>routing</b> processes were preferred however the advent of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offering superior analytical capabilities has facilitated the automation of the hitherto tedious and time consuming manual route selection process. In spite of the effectiveness and increasing acceptability of GIS, many pipeline operators are still reluctant to utilize it for route selection. There seems to be a continuous battle between proponents of the traditional methods and those of GIS in route selection projects. Concerns are being raised regarding the limitations of GIS too.

40|$|Up to the present, {{the wave}} union method can achieve the best timing {{performance}} in FPGA based TDC designs. However, {{it should be}} guaranteed in such a structure that the non-thermometer code to binary code (NTH 2 B) encoding process should be finished within just one system clock cycle. So {{the implementation of the}} NTH 2 B encoder is quite challenging considering the high speed requirement. Besides, the high resolution wave union TDC also demands the encoder to convert an ultra-wide input code to a binary code. We present a fast improved fat tree encoder (IFTE) to fulfill such requirements, in which bubble error suppression is also integrated. With this encoder scheme, a wave union TDC with 7. 7 ps RMS and 3. 8 ps effective bin size was implemented in an FPGA from Xilinx Virtex 5 family. An encoding time of 8. 33 ns was achieved for a 276 -bit non-thermometer code to a 9 -bit binary code conversion. We conducted a series of tests on the oscillating period of the wave union launcher, as well as the overall performance of the TDC; test results indicate that the IFTE works well.

40|$|Modern {{isolated}} {{switched mode}} power supplies (SMPSs) commonly utilise digital control methods over their classical analogue counterparts. These methods are now preferred {{for ease of}} programmability and implementation, scalability and they also accommodate advanced control techniques such as adaptive control. However in most digital implementations, inexpensive opto-couplers are still used to transmit analogue signals across the isolation barrier. It {{is well known that}} these types of opto-couplers suffer many drawbacks including variable gain due to ageing effects. The main research contribution in this thesis focuses on developing and implementing a full bi-directional digital data-link between both sides of the isolation barrier, i. e. all signals (feedback and auxiliary) are digitalised and transmitted as a single encoded data stream across the isolation barrier. A key advantage of this scheme is that only a single set of digital couplers is required to achieve bi-directional communication, when compared with its analogue counterpart which would require multiple opto-couplers. This proposed scheme is therefore a more cost-effective and efficient solution and does not suffer from performance degradation due to ageing effects. To reduce the size and improve power efficiency and loop response, switching frequencies are continually increasing. Higher switching frequencies reduce the transmission window and therefore the number of bits to be transmitted across the isolation barrier per switching cycle needs to be minimised. To achieve this objective for the bi-directional data-link proposed, a new state-dependent encoding scheme for the required analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) has been specifically designed. This state-dependent encoding scheme ensures a high resolution during the steady-state operation of the SMPS while still providing adequate accuracy during transients. Along with the state-dependent ADC, two digital pulse width modulators (DPWMs) for single- and multi-phase SMPSs have been designed for use with the proposed communication system. These DPWMs were implemented using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), but are also suitable for application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The DPWM designs only require a small number of logic elements while achieving high speed and high resolution, temperature independence and good scalability. This has been achieved using a hybrid approach which uses a novel fine-resolution block along with a coarse resolution block. This approach takes advantage of digital clock manager (DCM) blocks available on most commercial FPGAs available today. <b>Manual</b> placing and <b>routing</b> techniques result in high linearity and monotonic behaviour. For test purposes, the bi-directional communication scheme has been implemented on FPGAs and verified using a custom-built SMPS board...|$|R

Volunteer testing was performed with 37 subjects on 16 different vehicles using 2 forward-facing child restraints (Britax Marathon 70 or the Evenflo Triumph), with each subject performing 8 child restraint installations {{on a set}} of four vehicles. Vehicles were selected to provide a variety of general tether locations (filler panel, upper seatback, lower seatback, floor, or roof), as well as a variety of recommended tether routings with respect to the head restraint: under, over, around. Simple instruction regarding the LATCH system was provided after the fourth trial. Subjects used the tether in 89 % of the 294 forward-facing trials and attached the tether correctly in 57 % of installations. Subjects were more likely to use the tether if they were less than age 40, had previous tether experience, if the tether was located on a filler panel, and if the vehicle did not have any potentially confusing hardware. In addition, tether use was 83 % in the first four trials and increased to 95 % in the last four trials after instruction was provided. Subjects had the greatest difficulty in the pickup truck, which use loops of webbing as a router for the installed position and the tether anchor for the adjacent position; the tether was attached correctly in only 11 percent of installations. Tethers {{were more likely to be}} used when the tether anchor was located on the filler panel of sedans, which had a use rate of 95 percent, compared to when the anchor was located on the floor, roof, or seatback, which had use rates ranging from 79 to 89 percent. Tethers were less likely to be attached correctly when there was potentially confusing hardware present, 47 percent, compared to 70 percent. In addition, tether anchors located on the filler panel or mid seatback had higher rates of correct attachment, 60 and 69 percent, respectively, than those on the floor, roof, or lower seatback, which all had correct attachment rates lower than 50 percent. No vehicle tether hardware characteristics or vehicle manual directions were associated specifically with correct tether routing and head restraint position. Installations involving the single tether strap were 10 times as likely to have the tether attached correctly and 1. 7 times as likely to be routed correctly and have the head restraint positioned correctly, compared with installations with the v-shaped tether. Lack of instruction in most vehicle owner’s <b>manuals</b> regarding the <b>routing</b> of a V-style tether more challenging to use. With the single strap-style tether, it was more straightforward to have the tether strap flat and pull it tight, as well as to route it as directed. With the V-style tether, the adjustment hardware was often located underneath or close to the head restraint when installed in the vehicle, making it difficult to tighten. Recommendations to reduce tether misuse include labeling tether anchors, eliminating confusing hardware, allowing any head restraint position (including removal), providing instruction for routing V-style tethers, allowing options in tether routing, and redesigning tether anchors/routers found in pickup trucks...|$|R
40|$|This project {{included}} two parts. First, a reconfigurable cell {{was designed as}} the DataPath Unit (DPU) of a Dynamically Reconfigurable Resource Array (DRRA). In this cell, hardware resources were shared to be reused in different configurations. Consequently, the area was reduced by 68 % {{in comparison with the}} previous DPU with the same functionality. It also demonstrated better performance at 1 GHz. Second, we implemented a DRRA fabric consisting of 150 coarse grain blocks using an improved hierarchical design flow presented in this project. We reused pre-synthesized sub-modules to eliminate the top-level synthesis thereby decreasing the logic synthesis process run-time by 92 %. Also the pre-placed and routed sub-modules were reused as hard macros during the physical synthesis to reduce the design complexity which resulted in speeding up the design procedure significantly. During the routing process, a regular <b>manual</b> <b>routing</b> approach was used. In order to exploit net regularity while routing, we developed a package to extract top-level fabric interconnection regularity, recognize the representative design unit to be routed manually, and propagate the routing to the entire chip. The representative design unit was routed by employing a two-stage approach, global routing followed by detailed routing while considering the congestion overflow and design rules. By enabling reusability and exploiting regularity in the proposed hierarchical design flow, the design complexity becomes more manageable and designer can improve the design quality by focusing on only a small and critical part of the design instead of the whole system. Furthermore, using this routing methodology a pattern is replicated across the chip. Therefore, the cost of mask design during fabrication process is decreased. Also it results in timing uniformity and predictability across the chip. Although the total wire-length increased by 5 %, a considerable decrease in number of wire segments and vias was observed which results in less parasitic capacitance and better manufacturability...|$|E
