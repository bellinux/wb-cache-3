5|$|Conversely, his 1980s musical {{repertoire}} {{presented an}} increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, {{as well as}} the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album Acoustic was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had to walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1900 hurricane, Galveston {{adopted a}} {{commission}} government (in 1960 {{the city would}} switch to council-manager system). At the beginning of Prohibition the city council originally opposed gambling and vice; though the council members were tolerant of small-scale activities which {{had always been a}} part of the city, they were more concerned about organized crime. As the Maceos reorganized vice in the city and made these businesses more respectable, the council became far <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> the criminal enterprises, particularly as they became linchpins of the local economy. According to some reports this was because the Maceos bought the cooperation of the council members, taking advantage of easily corruptible structure of the commission.|$|E

25|$|With growing prosperity, many homosexuals, {{especially}} the English-educated middle class were exposed, via travel {{and the mass}} media, to the social liberalism of the West and the nascent gay movements there. This exposure introduced the idea that local society could evolve similarly. The growing popularity of travel to Thailand and Japan in the late 1970s also introduced Singaporeans to traditional Asian societies that were <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> homosexuals.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} for individuals to be targeted based on sexual orientation or gender-exhibiting behavior.

25|$|There {{are five}} vices (habitual desires) {{outlined}} in the Guru Granth Sahib that one should try to control. One of these vices is lust, and some Sikhs believe that homosexual thoughts and behaviour are just manifestations of lust.

25|$|American Muslims - in {{line with}} general public attitudes in the United States - have become much <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> {{homosexuality}} over recent years. In a 2007 poll conducted by Pew Research Center, only 27% of American Muslims believed that homosexuality should be accepted. In a 2011 poll, that rose to 39%. In a July 2017 poll, Muslims who say homosexuality should be accepted by society clearly outnumber those who say it should be discouraged (52% versus 33%).|$|E
25|$|While {{atypical}} {{gender role}} development may be heritable, {{this does not}} mean that it is independent. However, environmental effects can differ largely for different genders. Because society is <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> male traits (girls playing soccer) than female traits (boys doing ballet), society’s negativity typically forces males to try to stay within the stereotypic norms. That being said however, male influence accounted by environmental factors that lead to atypical development is also stronger for boys than girls in terms of atypical development.|$|E

25|$|The modern LDS Church {{does not}} use the cross or {{crucifix}} {{as a symbol of}} faith.

The early LDS Church was <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> the symbol of the cross, but {{after the turn of the}} 20th century, an aversion to it developed in Mormon culture. However, there are individual Mormons who tolerate (or even embrace) the use of a cross as a personal symbol of faith.|$|E
25|$|South Koreans {{have become}} {{significantly}} <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality and LGBT rights in 2010 and the onward decade, even if conservative attitudes remain dominant. A 2013 Gallup {{poll found that}} 39% of people believe that homosexuality should be accepted by society, compared to only 18% who held this view in 2007. South Korea recorded the most significant shift towards greater acceptance of homosexuality among the 39 countries surveyed worldwide. Significantly, {{there is a very}} large age gap on this issue: in 2013, 71% of South Koreans aged between 18 and 29 believed that homosexuality should be accepted, compared to only 16% of South Koreans aged 50 and over.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} the Cold War had {{important}} implications for Canadian foreign policy. Significantly, Canadian officials saw Latin America as a region particularly vulnerable {{to the spread of}} communism because of vast underdevelopment and socio-economic disparities. More importantly for Canada, however, was the immense propagation of American economic and political dominance and Americanization throughout the world. While Canada, like the United States during the early cold war years, could be viewed as a liberal-democracy devoted to the spread of capitalism and free market ideals, the Canadian form of the ideology was inherently <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> socialist facets. Effectively, Canada grew closer to many Latin American states and often acted as a mediator between the United States and Latin America.|$|E

25|$|Lebed did not {{consider}} Ukraine and Belarus to be separate countries from Russia, nor did he consider the Ukrainian and Belarusian separate from Russian. In 1995 he believed both countries would {{become part of a}} new state, on a confederal basis with the Russian Federation, {{at the end of the}} 20th century. General Lebed was also strongly against the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe initially, but by 1997 had changed his attitude to be <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> the idea. However, in March 1997 Lebed stated that he believed its expansion would destabilize the alliance and that it was the result of Cold War thinking, which would cause Russia to become authoritarian in response.|$|E
25|$|Four new sibyllae join Chor Tempest, {{one of them}} an {{excellent}} pilot with an unshakeable morale named Aer. Aer immediately decides to partner with Neviril, however despite her persistent attempts, Neviril remains too mired in her grief over Amuria's death to accept her. After continued battles with Chor Tempest, the Plumbish government eventually sues for peace. Neviril's father orders two sibyllae to join Chor Tempest bringing it back to full strength and assigns one to be Neviril's partner in attempt to jar his daughter out of her depression; however Neviril, becoming <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> Aer, rejects her. A Plumbish suicide bomber sabotages the peace talks jarring Neviril out of her funk and she agrees to pair with Aer.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck's {{eight years}} in Frankfurt were marked by changes in his {{political}} opinions, detailed in the numerous lengthy memoranda, which he sent to his ministerial superiors in Berlin. No longer {{under the influence of}} his ultraconservative Prussian friends, Bismarck became less reactionary and more pragmatic. He became convinced that to countervail Austria's newly restored influence, Prussia would have to ally herself with other German states. As a result, he grew to be <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> the notion of a united German nation. He gradually came to believe that he and his fellow conservatives had {{to take the lead in}} the drive toward creating a unified nation in order to keep from being eclipsed. He also believed that the middle-class liberals wanted a unified Germany more than they wanted to break the grip of the traditional forces over society.|$|E

50|$|About ninety {{thousand}} Jews {{from the}} former Eastern Bloc, mostly from ex-Soviet Union countries, settled in Germany {{since the fall of}} the Berlin wall. This is mainly due to a German government policy which effectively grants an immigration opportunity to anyone from the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic states with Jewish heritage, and the fact that today's Germans are seen as <b>more</b> significantly <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> Jews than many people in the ex-Soviet realm.|$|R

25|$|In 1740, {{the colonial}} {{government}} decided to exterminate indigenous resistance here to secure trade routes to Guanajuato and Zacatecas. This {{was accomplished by}} José de Escandón, whose expedition culminated in the Battle of Media Luna, defeating the Jonaz and Ximpeces. The military pacification of the area by José de Escandón in the 1740s allowed for the building of permanent missions {{in the heart of}} the Sierra Gorda. However, the five Franciscans missions accredited to Junípero Serra were built in Pame territory, as these people were <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> Spanish domination. The Spanish decided to burn original Pame villages and resettle the population around missions for better control. Those who did not submit either committed suicide or went to live in the mountains. The placement of the missions had the purpose of dividing the heart of the Sierra Gorda and to open roads into San Luis Potosí.|$|E
25|$|Feminism in Mexico {{is often}} divided {{chronologically}} into peak periods followed by lulls: the Revolutionary period (1915-1925), the Second Wave (1968-1990, peaking in 1975-1985), and the post-1990 period. While feminism {{may be defined}} as a set of organized philosophy and activity aimed at creating, defining, and protecting political, economic, cultural, and social equality in women’s rights and opportunity, Marta Lamas and other feminists caution that the women's movement in Mexico can not be equated with the feminist movement. Lamas, a leading Mexican feminist, laments that the Mexican feminist movement has always been weak and has struggled in the modern era to move beyond Mexico City's middle class to working-class and rural women. In the Revolutionary period where a broader spectrum of women from throughout Mexico were seeking suffrage, the movement lacked sophistication and focus, evident in the fact that Mexican women did not gain the vote until 1953. Women's equality demands, per Lamas, stem from a situation where women are juggling between household commitments and underpaid jobs. As most Mexican women in the upper and middle classes are provided with domestic help, women are <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> traditional gender roles. For many Mexican women, assisting other women through benevolent organizations and charitable works is in-line with their traditional view of womanhood, whereas a radical approach might meet with disdain or even violence.|$|E
500|$|The trobairitz {{may also}} have arisen due the power women held in {{southern}} France during the 12th and 13th centuries. Women had far more control over land ownership, and Occitan society was far <b>more</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> women than were most other societies of the time. During the Crusades many men were away, which left women with more administrative responsibility, and thus, power. Nevertheless, this society was not [...] "feminist", nor was fin' amor, which exalted women {{while at the same}} time circumscribing many aspects of their lives and behavior.|$|E
