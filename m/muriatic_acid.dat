5|$|Common {{chemical}} theory {{at that time}} held that an acid {{is a compound that}} contains oxygen (remnants of this survive in the German and Dutch names of oxygen: sauerstoff or zuurstof, both translating into English as acid substance), so a number of chemists, including Claude Berthollet, suggested that Scheele's dephlogisticated <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> air must be a combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, muriaticum.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid was {{historically}} called acidum salis, <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{and spirits}} of salt {{because it was}} produced from rock salt and green vitriol (by Basilius Valentinus in the 15th century) and later from the chemically similar common salt and sulfuric acid (by Johann Rudolph Glauber in the 17th century).

In response to the protest, James Brock, the manager of the hotel and the president of the Florida Hotel & Motel Association, poured what he claimed to be <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> into the pool to burn the protesters.

Another explanation might be the use of agents sensitive to light (which was not mentioned in either Jordán's or Perera's repertoire of forgery hypotheses): silver nitrate which, when subjected to ultraviolet sunlight, darkens.|$|R

500|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{produced}} in solutions up to 38% HCl (concentrated grade). Higher concentrations up to just over 40% are chemically possible, but the evaporation rate is then so high that storage and handling require extra precautions, such as pressurization and cooling.

In the United States, solutions of between 20% and 32% are sold as <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid.</b> Solutions for household purposes in the US, mostly cleaning, are typically 10% to 12%, with strong recommendations to dilute before use.

60|$|Colour and Structure of Valves.--The {{external}} {{surfaces of the}} scuta and terga are yellow along the middle, plainly marked by zones of growth, and finely ribbed longitudinally: the internal surfaces and sides of the horns of the two valves, are coloured fine blue or purple; in the terga, however, the internal surface is mottled with yellow. In some specimens, especially in one from Tavoy, each zone of growth was only very narrowly edged with blue. When a thin layer is removed {{from one of the}} valves, the dark blue or rather purple appears by transmitted light a beautiful pale blue; and it is a very singular fact, that this blue portion is permanently turned by very gentle into a fiery red; the same singular effect is produced by <b>muriatic</b> and acetic <b>acids.</b> This blue part is much harder than the yellow; the latter exhibits, under a high power, a folded structure, and is penetrated by a few tubuli, whereas the harder blue portion has a cellular or scaled appearance. The spines of the peduncle exhibit, in a smaller degree, similar phenomena.|$|R

2500|$|Lavoisier, {{together}} with Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude-Louis Berthollet, and Antoine François de Fourcroy, submitted {{a new program}} for the reforms of chemical nomenclature to the Academy in 1787, for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time. This work, titled Méthode de nomenclature chimique (Method of Chemical Nomenclature, 1787), introduced a new system which was tied inextricably to Lavoisier's new oxygen theory of chemistry. The Classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water were discarded, and instead some 55 substances {{which could not be}} decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements. The elements included light; caloric (matter of heat); the principles of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote (nitrogen); carbon; sulfur; phosphorus; the yet unknown [...] "radicals" [...] of <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> (hydrochloric acid), boric acid, and [...] "fluoric" [...] acid; 17 metals; 5 earths (mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as magnesia, barite, and strontia); three alkalies (potash, soda, and ammonia); and the [...] "radicals" [...] of 19 organic acids. The acids, regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen, were given names which indicated the element involved {{together with}} the degree of oxygenation of that element, for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids, phosphoric and phosphorous acids, nitric and nitrous acids, the [...] "ic" [...] termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the [...] "ous" [...] ending. Similarly, salts of the [...] "ic" [...] acids were given the terminal letters [...] "ate," [...] as in copper sulfate, whereas the salts of the [...] "ous" [...] acids terminated with the suffix [...] "ite," [...] as in copper sulfite. The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name [...] "copper sulfate" [...] with the old term [...] "vitriol of Venus." [...] Lavoisier's new nomenclature spread throughout Europe and to the United States and became common use in the field of chemistry. This {{marked the beginning of the}} anti-phlogistic approach to the field.|$|E

So also, {{when the}} {{conductor}} n was connected {{only with the}} <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> gas apparatus, {{it was found that}} the discharge was more facile when the small ball s was negative than when positive; for in the latter case, much of the electricity passed off as brush discharge through the air from the connecting wire p but in the former case, it all seemed to go through the <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 1555. On {{introducing}} more <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> gas, {{until the}} pressure was 29.97 inches, the same terminations gave bright sparks within at small distances; but when they were about an inch or more apart, the discharge was generally with very small brushes and glow, and frequently with no light at all, though electricity had passed through the gas. Whenever the bright spark did pass through the <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> gas at this pressure, it was bright throughout, presenting no dark or dull space.|$|E

6000|$|... 1023. When dilute <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> was used, it {{produced}} and transmitted a current {{more easily than}} pure dilute sulphuric acid, but not so readily as dilute nitric acid. As <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> appears to be decomposed more freely than water (765.), and as the affinity of zinc for chlorine is very powerful, it {{might be expected to}} produce a current more intense than that from the use of dilute sulphuric acid; and also to transmit it more freely by undergoing decomposition at a lower intensity (912.).|$|E

6000|$|... 1399. Other {{specific}} differences {{amongst the}} gases may {{be drawn from}} the preceding series of experiments, rough and hasty as they are. Thus the positive and negative series of mean intervals do not give the same differences. It has been already noticed that the negative numbers are lower than the positive (1393.), but, besides that, the order of the positive and negative results is not the same. Thus, on comparing the mean numbers (which represent for the present insulating tension,) it appears that in air, hydrogen, carbonic acid, olefiant gas and <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid,</b> the tension rose higher when the smaller ball was made positive than when rendered negative, whilst in oxygen, nitrogen, and coal gas, the reverse was the case. Now though the numbers cannot be trusted as exact, and though air, oxygen, and nitrogen should probably be on the same side, yet some of the results, as, for instance, those with <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid,</b> fully show a peculiar relation and difference amongst gases in this respect. This was further proved by making the interval in air 0.8 of an inch whilst <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> gas was in the vessel a; for on charging the small balls s and S positively, all the discharge took place through the air; but on charging them negatively, all the discharge took place through the <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> gas.|$|E
6000|$|... 764. From all the experiments, {{combined}} with these considerations, I conclude that <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> is decomposed by the direct {{influence of the}} electric current, and that the quantities evolved are, and therefore the chemical action is, definite for a definite quantity of electricity. For though I have not collected and measured the chlorine, in its separate state, at the anode, there can exist no doubt as to its being proportional to the hydrogen at the cathode; {{and the results are}} therefore sufficient to establish the general law of constant electro-chemical action in the case of <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 786. In {{the next}} place, I also {{consider}} the law as established with respect to <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> by the experiments and reasoning already advanced, when speaking of that substance, in the subdivision respecting primary and secondary results (758. &c.).|$|E

6000|$|... 1463. In all the gases, the {{different}} forms of disruptive discharge may be linked together and gradually traced from one extreme to the other, i.e. from the spark to the glow (1405. 1526.), or, it may be, to a still further condition to be called dark discharge (1544-1560.); but it is, nevertheless, very surprising {{to see what a}} specific character each keeps whilst under the predominance of the general law. Thus, in <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid,</b> the brush is very difficult to obtain, and there comes in its place almost a dark discharge, partaking of the readiness of the spark action. Moreover, in <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid,</b> I have never observed the spark with any dark interval in it. In nitrogen, the spark readily changes its character into that of brush. In carbonic acid gas, {{there seems to be a}} facility to occasion spark discharge, whilst yet that gas is unlike nitrogen in the facility of the latter to form brushes, and unlike <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> in its own facility to continue the spark. These differences add further force, first to the observations already made respecting the spark in various gases (1422. 1423.), and then, to the proofs deducible from it, of the relation of the electrical forces to the particles of matter.|$|E
6000|$|... 1446. The further a brush extends in a gas, {{the further}} no doubt is the charge or {{discharge}} carried forward; {{but this may}} vary between different gases, and yet the intensity required for the first moment of discharge not vary in the same, but in some other proportion. Thus with respect to nitrogen and <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> gases, the former, {{as far as my}} experiments have proceeded, produces far finer and larger brushes than the latter (1458. 1462.), but the intensity required to commence discharge is much higher for the <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> than the nitrogen (1395.). Here again, therefore, as in many other qualities, specific differences are presented by different gaseous dielectrics, and so prove the special relation of the latter to the act and the phenomena of induction.|$|E
6000|$|... 920. Again, if zinc, platina, and <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> are used, the {{electricity}} {{appears to be}} dependent upon the affinity of the zinc for the chlorine, and to be circulated in exact proportion {{to the number of}} particles of zinc and chlorine which unite, being in fact an equivalent to them.|$|E
6000|$|... 1534. The glow {{occurs in}} all gases in which I have looked for it. These are air, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, coal gas, {{carbonic}} acid, <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid,</b> sulphurous acid and ammonia. I thought also that I obtained it in oil of turpentine, but if {{so it was}} very dull and small.|$|E
6000|$|... 763. This {{constancy}} {{does not}} {{decide whether the}} <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> is electrolyzed or not, although it proves that if so, it must be in definite proportions to the quantity of electricity used. Other considerations may, however, be allowed to decide the point. The analogy between chlorine and oxygen, in their relations to hydrogen, is so strong, as to lead almost to the certainty, that, when combined with that element, they would perform similar parts {{in the process of}} electro-decomposition. They both unite with it in single proportional or equivalent quantities; and the number of proportionals appearing to have an intimate and important relation to the decomposability of a body (697.), those in <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid,</b> as well as in water, are the most favourable, or those perhaps even necessary, to decomposition. In other binary compounds of chlorine also, where nothing equivocal depending on the simultaneous presence of it and oxygen is involved, the chlorine is directly eliminated at the anode by the electric current. Such is the case with the chloride of lead (395.), which may be justly compared with protoxide of lead (402.), and stands in the same relation to it as <b>muriatic</b> <b>acid</b> to water. The chlorides of potassium, sodium, barium, &c., are in the same relation to the protoxides of the same metals and present the same results {{under the influence of the}} electric current (402.).|$|E
