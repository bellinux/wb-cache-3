40|$|Off-highway tire costs {{represent}} {{a significant portion}} of the total mining costs in openpit, truck-shovel operations. To extend the lives of tires, the site-specific factors influencing tire life should be investigated. Valuable data can be obtained by combining historical operational data captured by a mine dispatch system with detailed tire and <b>maintenance</b> <b>histories.</b> Assuming that failure counts satisfy a Poisson distribution, F-tests can be applied to determine significant deviations from desired or target counts. The methodology developed in this paper can be used to identify the haul routes and loading and dumping zones that have significantly higher incidences of tire failure. Corrective action can then be targeted at these zones by modifying the shovel or truck operator practices; changing the haul route maintenance and clean up practices; or altering the bench, ramp or waste dump design parameters. An example is given of the correlation of tire separation and tire impact failures with haul routes for a fleet of nine Caterpillar 793 C trucks in operation at the Chuquicamata Mine in northern Chile. A high incidence of impact failures was observed for the 2 ̆ 7 ex-pit ore crusher and for tires installed in the left outer rear position on the trucks. The latter was postulated to be due to a preference for drivers to execute right-hand turns prior to dumping. Recommendations were made to revise crusher and dump cleanup practices and investigate the feasibility of super-elevating the surface of dumping zones to reduce ground pressure on the left rear tires...|$|R

An ultimate goal of Propulsion Health Management (PHM) is to maximize the amount of meaningful information that can be extracted from disparate data sources to obtain comprehensive diagnostic and prognostic knowledge regarding the health of the engine. Data Fusion is the integration of data or information from multiple sources, to achieve improved accuracy and more specific inferences than can be obtained from the use of a single sensor alone. The basic tenet underlying the data/information fusion concept is to leverage all available information to enhance diagnostic visibility, increase diagnostic reliability and reduce the number of diagnostic false alarms. This paper describes a basic PHM Data Fusion architecture being developed in alignment with the NASA C 17 Propulsion Health Management (PHM) Flight Test program. The challenge of how to maximize the meaningful information extracted from disparate data sources to obtain enhanced diagnostic and prognostic information regarding the health and condition of the engine is the primary goal of this endeavor. To address this challenge, NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC), NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) and Pratt & Whitney (P&W) have formed a team with several small innovative technology companies to plan and conduct a research project in the area of data fusion as applied to PHM. Methodologies being developed and evaluated have been drawn from a wide range of areas including artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistical estimation, and fuzzy logic.
