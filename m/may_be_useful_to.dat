5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following a seizure <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is {{important}} to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A lumbar puncture <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E
5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
5|$|Stieger, Voracek, and Formann {{recommend}} that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness. They suggest it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation. The Letter Preference Task {{has been used to}} measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as depression, physical health, social acceptance, unrealistic optimism, feedback sensitivity, self-regulation, and defensiveness.|$|E

5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks {{can be used to}} determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
