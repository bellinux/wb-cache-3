The view pleased <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> I can express; the river Avon tumbled down a cascade {{at the foot}} of it. It is well laid out by one Brown who has set up on a few ideas of Kent and Mr Southcote." ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{the three}} top WSOP {{bracelet}} winners, only Johnny Chan still has them all. He keeps them {{locked in a}} vault because they are worth, according to him, [...] "millions." [...] Brunson did not pick up two of his. Fourteen-time bracelet winner Phil Hellmuth gave away ten of his. [...] "To me," [...] Hellmuth said, [...] "the bracelets {{have always been a}} really huge deal, to <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the other guys, because I knew that they represented history." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1903 to 1906 Walpole studied {{history at}} Emmanuel College, Cambridge. While there {{he had his}} first work published, the {{critical}} essay [...] "Two Meredithian Heroes", which was printed in the college magazine in autumn 1905. As an undergraduate he met and fell {{under the spell of}} A. C. Benson, formerly a greatly loved master at Eton, and by this time a don at Magdalene College. Walpole's religious beliefs, hitherto an unquestioned part of his life, were fading, and Benson helped him through that personal crisis. Walpole was also attempting to cope with his homosexual feelings, which for a while focused on Benson, who recorded in his diary in 1906 an unexpected outburst by his young admirer: [...] "e broke out rather eagerly into protestations – He cared for <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anyone in the world. I could not believe it... It is extraordinarily touching.... It is quite right that he should believe all this passionately; it is quite right that I should know that it will not last... I tried to say this as tenderly as I could..." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout a lot of my work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> something else. There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
500|$|Lin {{sent his}} résumé and a DVD of {{highlights}} {{of his high}} school basketball career to all of the Ivy League schools; the University of California, Berkeley; and his dream schools, Stanford University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The Pac-10 schools wanted him to walk-on, rather than be actively recruited or offered a sports scholarship. Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances. [...] "Most colleges start recruiting a guy in the first five minutes they see him because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate," [...] Walters said. Lin added, [...] "I just think in order for someone to understand my game, they have to watch <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once, because I'm {{not going to do anything}} that's extra flashy or freakishly athletic." ...|$|E
500|$|When Nelson {{returned}} to the Mediterranean St Vincent wrote to Earl Spencer, First Lord of the Admiralty: [...] "I do assure your Lordship that the arrival of Admiral Nelson has given me new life; you could not have gratified <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> in sending him. His presence in the Mediterranean is so very essential." [...] St Vincent detached Nelson to pursue Napoleon in his invasion of Egypt Rear-Admiral Sir John Orde who was senior to Nelson complained publicly and bitterly about what he considered a personal slight. Jervis ordered Orde home. Orde requested that he be court-martialled in order {{that he might have}} the opportunity to clear his name. The Board refused. Orde then requested that St Vincent be brought before a court-martial. Again, the Board refused. The Board censured Jervis for not having supported his subordinates. Orde later challenged the ageing admiral to a duel. The challenge became public knowledge and the king ordered Jervis to decline. Before the challenge was formally declined, Orde wrote to the Board to inform them that he had withdrawn it.|$|E

500|$|In March 2005 Glickenhaus, stock {{exchange}} magnate and car collector, {{was approached by}} Pininfarina who {{asked if he was}} interested in commissioning a one-off car. Andrea Pininfarina, grandson of the company’s founder later said [...] "The Ferrari 612 Kappa and this P4/5 are the first. But we want to grow this business." [...] indicating that Pininfarina is interested in producing other unique cars. Glickenhaus replied that he would like a modern Ferrari P, and in June of that year he signed a contract with Pininfarina to produce the car including the price, approximately US$4 million though in an interview he said [...] "I feel they gave <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> I expected". Glickenhaus purchased the last unsold Enzo Ferrari and upon receipt of the car he took it to Pininfarina to be redesigned similar to his David Piper P4 replica (Click link here: [...] ) [...] which he also delivered to Pininfarina. Pininfarina's styling team leader, Ken Okuyama said that [...] "Pininfarina wanted to stay away from retro design and move towards a more forward thinking supercar" [...] as they were excited by the opportunity to build the car, not just design it.|$|E
500|$|Jimi Hendrix {{began his}} career as a rhythm and blues guitarist and {{performed}} and recorded with several popular R artists, including the Isley Brothers, Don Covay, and Little Richard. He learned from other R guitarists, including Curtis Mayfield, who was known for his understated rhythmic fills and chording. [...] Hendrix toured as a support act with Mayfield in 1963. [...] He described the experience: [...] "The best gig was with Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions. [...] Curtis was a really good guitarist... I learned a lot in that short time. [...] He probably influenced <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anyone I'd ever played with up to that time, that sweet sound of his, you know". [...] In 1966, Hendrix recorded a song titled [...] "(My Girl) She's a Fox" [...] with the Icemen, an R duo. Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro has described it as [...] "paced and phrased in the style of Curtis Mayfield, [...] is virtually a blueprint for 'Little Wing'". [...] Later Hendrix producer John McDermott called his contribution to [...] "She's a Fox" [...] (included on the 2010 [...] ) [...] "perhaps the strongest of his pre-Experience career. [...] Hendrix's Curtis Mayfield-influenced guitar styling is the song's strongest attribute".|$|E
500|$|With 54,288 total entries and a {{combined}} prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP {{was the largest}} series of poker tournaments ever. [...] For many, winning {{a share of the}} prize pool was all that mattered, while others sought the glory associated with winning a bracelet. [...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. [...] After winning $8.25million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. [...] "My winning today also means a lot to me, because I know that I can use this money {{to do a lot of}} good for other people out there," [...] Yang said before donating over a million dollars to charity. [...] Upon winning his record eleventh bracelet, Phil Hellmuth said, [...] "the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the other guys, because I knew that they represented history." ...|$|E
