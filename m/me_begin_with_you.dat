40|$|I am {{indebted to}} so many people for their unending patience, as well their countless words of advice and encouragement. I am indebted to the University of Ottawa, and {{especially}} to my brilliant thesis committee (obviously brilliance attracts brilliance, tisk tisk). Drs Christian Blanchette, Christine Suurtamm, and David Trumpower—without you, this dissertation would not have been possible. I am a better researcher, a better writer, and more importantly, a better person because of your presence during this process. Let <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Christian. When I first visited uOttawa to find a thesis advisor and had many doors (figuratively) slammed in my face, you saw some potential in that young(ish) teacher from the Ottawa Valley. With your background in physics and mine in journalism, you were always flexible and ready to adapt. You introduced me to the great thinkers in diffusion research, whose thinking became the foundation for this study. You had unwavering commitment to my success, were an unabashed cheerleader, and wrote the most flattering reference letters any student could ever hope to receive. Christian, je n'oublierai jamais ce que tu as fait pour moi! Chris, the first time I met you in Qualitative Research I, I knew I would be in good hands...|$|E

I have brought evil on all who have been good to <b>me,</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You had better cast me off, or I shall bring yet worse!' ...|$|R

I {{met him at}} dinner, at your mother's, three weeks ago, and he brought me home here that night, when, as knowing you so differently, we took the liberty of talking you all over. It naturally {{had the effect of}} making <b>me</b> want to <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> afresh--only that seemed difficult too without further help. This he good-naturedly offered me; he said"--and Mr. Longdon recovered his spirits to repeat it--"'Hang it, I'll have 'em here for you!'" ...|$|R

[...] But after a time, callers would {{regularly}} try to elicit this response, so he's stopped replying this way routinely. Hartmann ends each show with the phrase, [...] "Activism <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> democracy <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Get out there, get active! Tag, you're it!" ...|$|R

Let <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> a very brief answer to these questions. The theory of motives is a branch of algebraic geometry dealing with algebraic varieties over a fixed field k.

They are fictional, but they are created from the variety of wildlife-human conflicts that occur in California. Thus, they represent the reality of human attempts to deal with wildlife damage...|$|R
