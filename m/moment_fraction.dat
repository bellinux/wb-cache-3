40|$|The {{need for}} {{upgrading}} {{a large number}} of understrength bridges in the United States has been well documented in the literature. This manual presents two methods for strengthening continuous-span composite bridges: post-tensioning of the positive moment regions of the bridge stringers and the addition of superimposed trusses at the piers. The use of these two systems is an efficient method of reducing flexural overstresses in undercapacity bridges. Before strengthening a given bridge however, other deficiencies (inadequate shear connection, fatigue problems, extensive corrosion) should be addressed. Since continuous-span composite bridges are indeterminant structures, there is longitudinal and transverse distribution of the strengthening axial forces and moments. This manual basically provides the engineer with a procedure for determining the distribution of strengthening forces and moments throughout the bridge. As a result of the longitudinal and transverse force distribution, the design methodology presented in this manual for continuous-span composite bridges is extremely complex. To simplify the procedure, a spreadsheet has been developed for use by practicing engineers. This design aid greatly simplifies the design of a strengthening system for a given bridge in that it eliminates numerous tedious hand calculations, computes the required force and <b>moment</b> <b>fractions,</b> and performs the necessary iterations for determining the required strengthening forces. The force and <b>moment</b> distribution <b>fraction</b> formulas developed in this manual are primarily for the Iowa DOT V 12 and V 14 three-span four-stringer bridges. These formulas may be used on other bridges if they are within the limits stated in this manual. Use of the distribution fraction formulas for bridges not within the stated limits is not recommended...|$|R

The bridges, designed {{in accordance with}} then-current AASHO bridge design specifications, had exterior beams smaller than interior beams. Because of changes in AASHO wheel load distribution fractions in 1957, which increased the design live load for exterior beams, and because of increases in Iowa legal loads in 1980, the bridges are currently understrength. The Iowa bridges can be strengthened economically by post-tensioning only the small exterior beams, providing that the design accounts for the distribution of {{a significant portion of}} the post-tensioning to the interior beams;In order to determine the post-tensioning distribution, a research program was initiated which involved construction and testing of a half-scale model bridge, strengthening of two Iowa bridges, and development of a design methodology. A SAP IV finite element model for a post-tensioned composite bridge was developed and verified with the experimental results from the half-scale model bridge. The finite element model was utilized separately, with simple support and with fixed support conditions, to bracket field test data for the two Iowa bridges strengthened by post-tensioning. The bridges tested in the field behaved as if partially restrained due to construction details at supports and attached steel guard rails;Results from the SAP IV composite bridge model were used to determine post-tensioning distribution for both axial forces and moments. Relatively simple formulas were developed for force <b>fractions</b> and <b>moment</b> <b>fractions</b> at midspin, by separate multiple linear regression analyses, for typical Iowa three-beam bridges and four-beam bridges;A design procedure for use with the AASHTO Service Load Design Method was developed and applied to a typical Iowa composite bridge.

40|$|The unifying {{objective}} of Phases I and II {{of this study}} was to determine the feasibility of the post-tensioning strengthening method and to implement the technique on two composite bridges in Iowa. Following completion of these two phases, Phase III was undertaken and is documented in this report. The basic objectives of Phase III were further monitoring bridge behavior (both during and after post-tensioning) and developing a practical design methodology for designing the strengthening system under investigation. Specific objectives were: to develop strain and force transducers to facilitate the collection of field data; to investigate further the existence and effects of the end restraint on the post-tensioning process; to determine the amount of post-tensioning force loss that occurred during the time between the initial testing and the retesting of the existing bridges; to determine the significance of any temporary temperature-induced post-tensioning force change; and to develop a simplified design methodology that would incorporate various variables such as span length, angle-of-skew, beam spacing, and concrete strength. Experimental field results obtained during Phases II and III were compared to the theoretical results and to each other. Conclusions from this research are as follows: (1) Strengthening single-span composite bridges by post-tensioning is a viable, economical strengthening technique. (2) Behavior of both bridges was similar to the behavior observed from the bridges during field tests conducted under Phase II. (3) The strain transducers were very accurate at measuring mid-span strain. (4) The force transducers gave excellent results under laboratory conditions, but were found to be less effective when used in actual bridge tests. (5) Loss of post-tensioning force due to temperature effects in any particular steel beam post-tensioning tendon system were found to be small. (6) Loss of post-tensioning force over a two-year period was minimal. (7) Significant end restraint was measured in both bridges, caused primarily by reinforcing steel being continuous from the deck into the abutments. This end restraint reduced the effectiveness of the post-tensioning but also reduced midspan strains due to truck loadings. (8) The SAP IV finite element model is capable of accurately modeling the behavior of a post-tensioned bridge, if guardrails and end restraints are included in the model. (9) Post-tensioning distribution should be separated into distributions for the axial force and moment components of an eccentric post-tensioning force. (10) Skews of 45 deg or less have a minor influence on post-tensioning distribution. (11) For typical Iowa three-beam and four-beam composite bridges, simple regression-derived formulas for force and <b>moment</b> <b>fractions</b> can be used to estimate post-tensioning distribution at midspan. At other locations, a simple linear interpolation gives approximately correct results.

At the <b>moment</b> this <b>fraction</b> is a not desired by-product: it has high contaminant content, it has to be separated from the coarse fraction, because of its high water absorption which can affect the properties of the concrete. In fact, in some countries the use of fines recycled aggregates is highly restricted or even banned. This work is placed inside the European project C 2 CA (from Concrete to Cement and Clean Aggregates) and it has been held in the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences of the Technical University of Delft, in particular, in the laboratory of Resources And Recycling. This research proposes some procedures in order to close the loop of the entire recycling process. After the classification done by ADR (Advanced Dry Recovery) the two fractions "airknife" and "rotor" (that together constitute the fraction 0 - 4 mm) are inserted in a new machine that works at high temperatures. The temperatures analysed in this research are 600 °C and 750 °C, cause at that temperature it is supposed that the cement bounds become very weak. The final goal is "to clean" the coarse fraction (0, 250 - 4 mm) from the cement still attached to the sand and try to concentrate the cement paste in the fraction 0 - 0, 250 mm. This new set-up is able to dry the material in very few seconds, divide it into two fractions (the coarse one and the fine one) thanks to the air and increase the amount of fines (0 - 0, 250 mm) promoting the attrition between the particles through a vibration device.

Recent measurements of the emissivity profiles of accretion discs as well as reverberation time lags between the primary X-ray continuum and the reflection suggest that this corona is situated at a low height above the disc and extends radially, tens of gravitational radii over the disc surface, hence should also Compton scatter the reflected X-rays. We find that the detection of blurred reflection from as close in as the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of maximally rotating black holes is consistent with such coronae, but requires that the corona be patchy, consisting perhaps of a number of isolated flares throughout the region. Considering only the requirement that it be possible to detect reflection from the ISCO, we find that at any given <b>moment,</b> the covering <b>fraction</b> of the inner part of the accretion disc by the corona needs to be less than 85 per cent, though allowing for the detection of 'reflection-dominated' spectra in which the total reflected flux exceeds that seen in the continuum requires covering fractions as low as 50 or 25 per cent.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} reevaluation of {{eight of the}} nine glitches observed to date from the Vela pulsar, and the postglitch relaxation following each glitch. All glitch data sets {{can be described in}} terms of three distinct components of short and intermediate time scale exponential relaxation, followed by a long-term recovery of the glitch-induced change in the spin-down rate that is linear in t, ΔΩ̇ c(t) ∝ t. We interpret the short and the intermediate time scale exponential relaxation, characterized by relaxation times of 10 hr, 3 d. 2, and 32 d as the linear response of vortex creep in those regions of the pinned superfluid in the neutron star crust through which no sudden vortex motion occurred {{at the time of the}} glitch. The long-term recovery is interpreted as the nonlinear response of vortex creep regions. In addition, there are regions of the crustal superfluid which cannot sustain a vortex density or vortex creep current, but which play a significant role in determining the angular momentum balance. The tendency of glitches to leave permanent spin-up remnants is explained as a discrete internal torque which in glitches, couples part of the crustal superfluid to the observed crust. We find that, on average, the theoretically expected interglitch intervals agree quite well with the observed intervals. The same set of short and intermediate relaxation times, with similar values of moments of inertia for the various components of the crustal superfluid, yield good fits for all postglitch data sets. Furthermore, these relaxation times and moments of inertia are compatible with previous theoretical estimates. A <b>moment</b> of inertia <b>fraction</b> of at least 0. 024 is implied for the crustal superfluid.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that postseismic {{relaxation}} following the 2004 Mw 6. 0 Parkfield, CA, earthquake is dominated by afterslip. However, we show that some fraction of the afterslip inferred from kinematic inversion to have occurred immediately below the seismically ruptured area may in fact be a substitute for viscous postseismic deformation of the lower crust. Using continuous GPS and synthetic aperture radar interferometry, we estimate the relative contribution of shallow afterslip (at depth less than 20 km) and deeper seated deformation required to account for observed postseismic surface displacements. Exploiting the possible separation in space and time of the time series of displacements predicted from viscoelastic relaxation, we devise a linear inversion scheme that allows inverting jointly for the contribution of afterslip and viscoelastic flow as a function of time. We find that a wide range of models involving variable amounts of viscoelastic deformation can fit the observations equally well provided that they allow some fraction of deep-seated deformation (at depth larger than ∼ 20 km). These models require that the moment released by postseismic relaxation over 5 years following the earthquake reached nearly as much as 200 % of the coseismic moment. All the models show a remarkable complementarity of coseismic and shallow afterslip distributions. Some significant deformation at lower crustal depth (20 – 26 km) is required to fit the geodetic data. The condition that postseismic deformation cannot exceed complete relaxation places a constraint on the amount of deep seated deformation. The analysis requires an effective viscosity of at least ~ 10 ^(18) Pa s of the lower crust (assuming a semi-infinite homogeneous viscous domain). This deep-seated deformation is consistent with the depth range of tremors which also show a transient postseismic response and could explain as much as 50 % of the total postseismic geodetic <b>moment</b> (the remaining <b>fraction</b> being due to afterslip at depth shallower than 20 km).

Treatments included crop management variations and/or nitrogen (N) fertilization rates, initiated on previously cropped soils. Effects on SOC levels only were examined on a 75 -yr continuous corn site, with N, phosphorus, and potassium fertilization treatments established in 1952. Soils were primarily Typic and Aquic Hapludolls and Typic Haplaquolls. Composite samples were collected from all sites for the SOC analysis. Near-surface core samples were collected from the rotation studies at several times for analysis of bulk density, pore size <b>fractions,</b> <b>moment</b> analysis of pore size distribution, water retention characteristic, and hydraulic conductivity.

Fertilizer N, initial SOC, residue additions, and previous management practices significantly affected SOC levels. Increases in SOC levels under N fertilization were a function of increased biomass production under those systems. Data from the continuous corn experiment were used to test the predictive ability of an SOC dynamics model. Cropping altered physical properties from those found in adjacent fence rows. Significant treatment differences occurred with all methods of soil physical property analysis.

(1993) designed a special conductivity cell, consisted of concentric cylinders capable of being used for medium to high conductivity ranges by changing the space between the electrodes or electrode area. The electrodes were covered with a gold layer. During the test, a mixture of oil and a precipitant was injected from a dilution flask to the cell. A magnetic stirrer was used for mixing the solution. The setup was mounted in an air bath for isothermal testing. The conductivity and capacitance were measured using an impedance meter (Figs.  22, 23). The normalized conductivity was defined as conductivity per mass fraction of oil in the injected solution. The change of trends for both conductivity and normalized conductivity at a particular precipitant concentration was attributed to the onset of asphaltene precipitation. Comparing the upper and lower curves in Figs.  22 and 23 reveals that the onset of asphaltene precipitation is more clear in the normalized plot (i.e., upper curve). As the precipitant was added to the oil sample in the dilution flask, the fluid mixture’s viscosity was reduced. The viscosity reduction caused an increase in mobility of the conducting entities (i.e., asphaltenes). This trend continues up to a maximum point after which both graphs began a downward trend until they reached the conductivity of a 100 % precipitant phase. Using this method, one can also estimate the amount of precipitated asphaltenes by extrapolating the data before precipitation to the point of pure precipitant. The detailed algorithm for this estimation is provided in the paper by Fotland et al. (1993).|$|R
40|$|Acceptance {{sampling}} plans by variables are a basic quality control technique. These plans provide economical procedures {{to determine the}} acceptability of batches of product. Most of these plans {{are based on a}} single quality characteristic and are of the classical type. This work concentrates on Bayesian variable acceptance {{sampling plans}} for fraction defective. Both destructive and non-destructive sampling procedures are considered. A set of decision points are estimated and employed to make decisions about the inspected lots. Techniques to dispose of the rejected lots are provided. Components of the expected total cost relative to various decisions are estimated. The sample size required to obtain the expected optimum cost is found. An untrue assumption implicit in the measurement of the quality characteristic of items sampled is that the observed dimensions are error free. The distributions, means, and variances of a set of parameters for error free and error prone sampling is listed. Computer programs written in FORTRAN 77 are developed to compute the decision points and the costs for both destructive and nondestructive testing. Precise Bays estimate of the costs and other economic parameters involve the <b>moments</b> of the <b>fraction</b> defective p raised to the kᵗʰ power. Mathematical expressions for the conditional expectations of p|x and p|ẋ are derived and a computer program to estimate these moments is provided. Producing quality items with minimum cost requires keeping a production process under control. The quality characteristic X of each item produced is determined and the sample means are plotted on an Ẋ-control chart. A production process is assumed to start in control at time t = 0 with specific values of the mean and standard deviation. The occurrence of a single or multiple cause-failures shift the process mean outside the control limits. During the search for the causes of failure, the process is either allowed to continue in operation or shut down until the assignable cause or causes are discovered. The expected duration of time during which the process is shut down and the additional time to be taken to repair the process are considered. Computer programs are provided to estimate the optimal sample size, the interval between successive samples, the control limits, the probability of type I error, the power of the chart, and the average time the process operates in the presence of an assignable cause. The parameters estimated are employed to estimate the optimal loss-cost. The economic design of Ẋ -charts assumes one quality characteristic of interest. However a product quality in most industrial products and processes is characterized by more than one quality characteristic where the application of a Ẋ -control chart for each variable is inappropriate. In this work a Hotellings T² control chart is employed to handle cases of where products are tested relative to several quality characteristics...|$|R
6000|$|A {{wall and}} hedge bounded his front garden on one side, {{and this was}} now entirely covered by an immense snowdrift, sloping up to a height of about seven feet. It was only when he paused {{to look at this}} vast snow heap in his garden that he caught sight of a goose, a very big snow-white bird without a grey spot in its plumage, {{standing}} within a few yards of him, about four feet from the ground. Its entire snowy whiteness with snow for a background had prevented him from seeing it until he looked directly at it. He stood still gazing in astonishment and admiration at this noble bird, standing so motionless with its head raised high that it was like the figure of a goose carved out of some crystalline white stone and set up at that spot on the glittering snowdrift. But it was no statue; it had living eyes which without the least turning of the head watched him and every motion he made. Then all at once the thought came into his head that here was something, very good succulent food in fact, sent, he almost thought providentially, to provision his house; for how easy it would be for him as he passed the bird to throw himself suddenly upon and capture it! It had belonged to some one, no doubt, but that great snowstorm and the furious north-east wind had blown it far far from its native place and it was lost to its owner for ever. Practically it was now a wild bird free for him to take without any qualms and to nourish himself on its flesh while the snow siege lasted. Standing there, jug in hand, he thought it out, and then took a few steps towards the bird in order {{to see if there was}} any sign of suspicion in it; but there was none, only he could see that the goose without turning its head was all the time regarding him out of the corner of one eye. Finally he came to the conclusion that his best plan was to go for the milk and on his return to set the jug down by the gate when coming in, then to walk in a careless, unconcerned manner towards the door, taking no notice of the goose until he got abreast of it, and then turn suddenly and hurl himself upon it. Nothing could be easier; so away he went and in about twenty minutes was back again with the milk, to find the bird in the same place standing as before motionless in the same attitude. It was not disturbed at his coming in at the gate, nor did it show the slightest disposition to move when he walked towards it in his studied careless manner. Then, when within three yards of it, came the supreme moment, and wheeling suddenly round he hurled himself with violence upon his victim, throwing out his arms to capture it, and so great was the impulse he had given himself that he was buried to the ankles in the drift. But before going into it, in that brief <b>moment,</b> the <b>fraction</b> of a second, he saw what happened; just as his hands were about to touch it the wings opened and the bird was lifted from its stand and out of his reach as if by a miracle. In the drift he was like a drowning man, swallowing snow into his lungs for water. For a few dreadful moments he thought it was all over with him; then he succeeded in struggling out and stood trembling and gasping and choking, blinded with snow. By-and-bye he recovered and had a look round, and lo! there stood his goose on the summit of the snow bank about three yards from the spot where it had been! It was standing as before, perfectly motionless, its long neck and head raised, and was still in appearance the snow-white figure of a carved bird, only it was more conspicuous and impressive now, being outlined against the blue sky, and as before it was regarding him out of the corner of one eye. He had never, he said, felt so ashamed of himself in his life! If the bird had screamed and fled from him it would not have been so bad, but there it had chosen to remain, as if despising his attempt at harming it too much even to feel resentment. A most uncanny bird! it seemed to him that it had divined his intention from the first and had been prepared for his every movement; and now it appeared to him to be saying mentally: [...] "Have you got no more plans to capture me in your clever brain, or have you quite given it up?" ...|$|R
