The highest CF and ash content were found in cassava leaf <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> shrimp head <b>meal,</b> whilst the highest NDF content was found in sweet potato leaf <b>meal,</b> groundnut cake <b>and</b> cassava leaf <b>meal.</b> The gross energy content varied between feed ingredients within the range 12.3 – 19.5  MJ/kg, with the lowest value in golden apple snail <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> the highest in groundnut cake. The essential amino acid (EAA) profile varied between feed ingredients (Table  2).

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} canola <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> oil in quail diet on productive performance, egg quality and bone characteristics. Quails (n = 84) with 150 -days-of-age and average weight of 234 ± 17 g were used in this experiment that lasted 84 days. The experiment consisted of a completely randomized design with 4 treatments, 7 replications with 3 birds each. Four diets were formulated: SM+SO - control diet with soybean <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> oil; MC+SO - 25 % replacement of soybean meal with canola meal; MC+CO - 25 % replacement of soybean meal with canola <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> complete replacement of canola oil with soybean oil; SM+OC - control diet with soybean <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> canola oil. Productive performance, internal and external egg quality and bone characteristics were evaluated. The diet with canola <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> oil (MC+CO) decreased (p < 0. 05) feed conversion. Albumen height was lower (p < 0. 05) for treatments with canola <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> oil (MC+CO). Regardless of the oil used, the dietary canola <b>meal</b> (MC+SO <b>and</b> MC+CO) reduced the weight and length of tibia (p < 0. 05), but increased its ash content (p < 0. 05). The mixture of canola oil <b>and</b> <b>meal</b> decreases feed conversion, and negatively affects internal egg quality and bone characteristics of quails. ...|$|R

40|$|Mixed {{calf starter}} feed and crude fiber source {{comprising}} {{neutral detergent fiber}} (NDF) as complete calf starter feed (CCS) can enhance the development of reticulo rumen, that can be knwon from indicators i. e. total microbia, volatile fatty acid (VFA) and NH 3 rumen. The aimed {{of this research was}} to find CCS formulation which gave the most effective enhancement to reticulo rumen development indicators. The materials used were ground corn, rice bran, soybean meal, fish meal, vitamin, mineral, rice and corn straws and 7 - 14 days old FH calves with 45 ± 5. 5 kg body weight. Completely Randomized Design with 2 x 2 factorial pattern was used in this research.

This research took about 9 weeks. The results indicated that there was a significant effect of the combination of protein source and NDF source on total bacteria and NH 3, but there was no significant effect of those on feed intake, dry matter digestibility, avarage daily gain and VFA content. Total rumen bacteria population of the calves fed bya combination of soybean <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> corn straw was the highest (1. 08 x 1011 CFU/ml) compared to those fed with other combinations (P< 0. 05), i. e. fish <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> rice straw 1. 1 x 1010, fish <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> corn straw 4. 1 x 109 <b>and</b> soybean <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> rice straw 8. 8 x 109 CFU/ml.
