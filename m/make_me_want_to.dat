[...] The song also makes direct references to The Ballad of East and West, a poem by Rudyard Kipling, with the line: [...] "East is east and west is west, and mine was you and mine was best", which is a partial quote from the poem.|$|E

She praised the interaction between Megan and Peter, highlighting their conversation over Peter's girlfriend. Orlando said that she could not understand Megan's facial expressions to Peter's girlfriend, whether it was one of jealousy or tease. She said, [...] "Megan was certainly giving Peter a lot of ribbing about his new girlfriend. Was Megan just having fun with him or did it bother her a little? I couldn't quite tell". She finished in saying, [...] "A [...] "Hunting Party" [...] led to a tragic death and a merry go round of suspects on Body of Proof this week".|$|E

The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Pet Sounds, Wilson {{desired to}} make [...] "a {{complete}} statement", {{similar to what}} he believed the Beatles had done with their newest album Rubber Soul, released in December 1965. Wilson was immediately enamored with the album, given the impression {{that it had no}} filler tracks, a feature that was mostly unheard of at a time when 45rpm singles were considered more noteworthy than full-length LPs. Many albums up until the mid-1960s lacked a cohesive artistic goal and were largely used to sell singles at a higher price point. Wilson found that Rubber Soul subverted this by having a wholly consistent thread of music. Inspired, he rushed to his wife and proclaimed, [...] "Marilyn, I'm gonna make the greatest album! The greatest rock album ever made!" [...] He would say of his reaction to Rubber Soul: [...] "I liked the way it all went together, the way it was all one thing. It was a challenge to me...

2500|$|Most of the negativity {{focused on}} the overuse of special effects, {{thinness}} of plot, and excessive use of clichés. Roger Ebert {{went so far as}} to say, [...] "The movie Ed Wood, about the worst director of all time, was made to prepare us for Stargate". Ebert awarded the film one out of four stars; and, even over ten years later, Stargate remained on his list of most hated films. Mike DiBella from Allmovie said, [...] "There simply isn't enough spectacle in Stargate to make up for its many flaws." [...] The film peaked at number one on the Billboard chart Top Video Rentals on April 29, 1995. However, the positive reviews stated that it was an [...] "instant camp classic" [...] and praised the film for its special effects and entertainment value, with Chris Hicks of the Deseret News calling it [...] "Star Wars meets Ben Hur". Scott McKenzie from DVDactive said, [...] "It's a shame because the world created around the Stargate is compelling and detailed. It's almost enough to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> watch the TV series, but not quite." [...] After the release of the movie, Emmerich and Devlin were sued by an Egyptology student, claiming he had written the story and given them the idea. The suit was later settled out of court.|$|E

It didn't <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> copy them but {{to be as good as}} them. I didn't want to do the same kind of music, but on the same level." [...] Carl elaborated: [...] " [...] was Brian's favorite kind of rock; he liked [...] better than the early Beatles stuff. He loved the Beatles' later music when they evolved and started making intelligent, masterful music, but before that Phil was it." [...] According to Mike Love, Carl followed the Beatles more closely than anyone else in the group, but Brian was the most [...] "rattled" [...] by the Beatles, feeling tremendous pressure to [...] "keep pace" [...] with them. Brian once characterized himself as [...] "fucked up" [...] and [...] "jealous" [...] of Spector and the Beatles, saying; [...] "i was flipping out. I couldn't understand how [...] could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but they just screamed at it." [...] On another occasion, he's said that he was overwhelmed by the [...] "electricity" [...] of their voices on the song ("It really turned me on"). He recalled that he and Love immediately felt threatened by the Beatles and added that he knew the Beach Boys could never match the excitement created by the Beatles as performers, and that this realization led him to concentrate his efforts on trying to outdo them in the recording studio.|$|E
