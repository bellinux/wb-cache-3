The inlet was designed to satisfy the airflow requirements of the TF 30 -P- 3 turbofan engine.

In this research, a new yielding steel prop with high <b>stable</b> load <b>capacity</b> was introduced, which features sustaining large deformation in the field. Based on principle stress method and elastic-plastic theory, a mathematical model of load capacity was proposed for the new prop. The results show that the <b>stable</b> load <b>capacity</b> of the prop increases linearly with the increase of the effective number of the steel balls. Meanwhile, the <b>stable</b> load <b>capacity</b> of the prop increases initially and decreases afterwards with the increase of the radius of the steel ball.

Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid.

Because of increased sophistication and severity of these attacks, the system administrator of a victim site needs to quickly and accurately identify the probable attackers and eliminate the attack traffic. Our work {{is based on a}} probabilistic marking algorithm in which an attack graph can be constructed by a victim site. We extend the basic concept such that one can quickly and efficiently deduce the intensity of the "local traffic" generated at each router in the attack graph based on the volume of received marked packets at the victim site. Given the intensities of these local traffic rates, we can rank the local traffic and identify the network domains generating most of the attack traffic.
