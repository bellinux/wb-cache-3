The addition of bile salts and crystal violet to the agar inhibits the growth of most Gram-positive bacteria, making <b>MacConkey</b> <b>agar</b> selective. Lactose and neutral red are added to differentiate the lactose fermenters, which form pink colonies, from lactose nonfermenters that form clear colonies.

2500|$|In stool samples, {{microscopy}} {{will show}} gram-negative rods, with no particular cell arrangement. Then, either <b>MacConkey</b> <b>agar</b> or EMB agar (or both) are inoculated with the stool. On <b>MacConkey</b> <b>agar,</b> deep red colonies are produced, as the organism is lactose-positive, and fermentation of this sugar {{will cause the}} medium's pH to drop, leading to darkening of the medium. Growth on EMB agar produces black colonies with a greenish-black metallic sheen. This is diagnostic of E. coli. The organism is also lysine positive, and grows on TSI slant with a (A/A/g+/H2S-) profile. Also, IMViC is [...] {+ + – -} for E. coli; as it is indole-positive (red ring) and methyl red-positive (bright red), but VP-negative (no change-colourless) and citrate-negative (no change-green colour). Tests for toxin production can use mammalian cells in tissue culture, which are rapidly killed by shiga toxin. Although sensitive and very specific, this method is slow and expensive.|$|E

5000|$|Alfred Theodore MacConkey (1861-1931) was the British {{bacteriologist}} {{who developed}} <b>MacConkey's</b> <b>agar,</b> a selective medium {{that is used}} in the diagnosis of enteric pathogens.

2500|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of infection, an {{appropriate}} specimen is collected and sent to a bacteriology laboratory for identification. As with most bacteriological specimens, a Gram stain is performed, which may show Gram-negative rods and/or white blood cells. P. aeruginosa produces colonies with a characteristic [...] "grape-like" [...] or [...] "fresh-tortilla" [...] odor on bacteriological media. In mixed cultures, it can be isolated as clear colonies on <b>MacConkey</b> <b>agar</b> (as it does not ferment lactose) which will test positive for oxidase. Confirmatory tests include production of the blue-green pigment pyocyanin on cetrimide agar and growth at 42°C. A TSI slant is often used to distinguish nonfermenting Pseudomonas species from enteric pathogens in faecal specimens.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to isolate and identify the aerobic bacteria associated with diarrhea in children below five years of age presented at Khartoum Pediatric Hospital. Fifty stool specimens were collected (negative for protozoa and helminthes) and cultured on <b>MacConkey’s</b> <b>agar,</b> selenite-F-broth and Salmonella-Shigella agar media and incubated aerobically for 24 h at 37 °C. Bacterial growth was shown by all of the test specimens and a total of 77 isolates were obtained; some specimenswere of mixed bacterial types. The pure isolates were identified according to their microscopic, cultural and biochemical characteristics to the following bacterial species: Escherichia coli(n= 48, 62. 3 %),Klebsiella pneumoniae(n= 10, 13 %), Proteus mirabilis(n= 6, 7. 8 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa(n= 4, 5. 2 %), Shigella spp. (n= 4, 5. 2 %), Citrobacter freundii(n= 3, 3. 9 %), Enterobacter aerogenes(n= 1, 1. 3 %) and Serratia marcescens(n= 1, 1. 3 %).

Sorbitol <b>MacConkey’s</b> <b>agar</b> medium was used to differentiate between isolates of E. coliserotype O 157 :H 7 and the other isolates of E. coli. Ten (20. 8 %) of the E. coliisolates were sorbitol non-fermenters and hence they were considered as E. coliserotype O 157 :H 7. Different patterns of distribution of bacterial types according to age have been observed. E. coliisolates were found mostly before two years of age and rarely in older children.

40|$|Objective The {{extensive}} {{pollution of}} natural ecosystems has occurred by organophosphorus pesticides, {{being used for}} improvement of crop production in agriculture. Biodegradation is interested in application of multifunctional bacteria containing genetical elements which specially degrade organophosphorus compounds. In this paper the detection of two bacteria species, Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium, which harbouring organophosphorus degrading elements from environmental samples is reported. Materials and Methods Several resistant strains isolated from different cultures that previously were cultivated with related sources such as soils and waters. These bacteria had been isolated from organophosphorus enriched mineral solutions, and following inoculation, visible colonies were observed on mineral and <b>MacConkey’s</b> <b>agar</b> medium. The resistant bacteria were identified by conventional procedures and monitored with certain properties like stability, tolerance, resistance to organophosphorus compounds and different antibiotics.
