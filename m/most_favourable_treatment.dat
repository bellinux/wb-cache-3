40|$|Alzheimer’s disease {{also known}} as {{dementia}} {{is one of the}} widely affective neurodegenerative disorder only after Parkinsonism. The patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease has increased dramatically over a period of time. This has propelled the interest of neuroscientists to develop new drug therapies to combat this disease. The drugs available are not effective in permanently curing the disease, but effective in mostly reducing the symptoms of the disease and delaying its progression. This review has been produced by probing relevant publications, PubMed and Medline articles. The Pharmacotherapy revolves around two drugs, Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors which are most effective in treating mild, moderate and severe form of Alzheimer’s disease. The other drug being Memantine, NMDA receptor antagonist which has been effective in combination with Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors in moderate to severe form of Alzheimer’s disease.

40|$|International audienceTo {{guarantee}} sustainable {{and dynamic}} waste management, the dynamic waste management approach (DWM) suggests an evolutionary new approach that maintains a constant flow towards the <b>most</b> <b>favourable</b> waste <b>treatment</b> processes (facilities) within a system. To that end, DWM {{is based on}} the law of conservation of energy, which allows the balancing of a network, while considering the constraints of incoming (h 1) and outgoing (h 2) loads, as well as the distribution network (ΔH) characteristics. The developed approach lies on the identification of the prioritization index (PI) for waste generators (analogy to h 1), a global allocation index for each of the treatment processes (analogy to h 2) and the linear index load loss (ΔH) associated with waste transport. To demonstrate the scope of DWM, we outline this approach, and then present an example of its application. The case study shows that the variable monthly waste from the three considered sources is dynamically distributed in priority to the more favourable processes. Moreover, the reserve (stock) helps temporarily store waste in order to ease the global load of the network and favour a constant feeding of the treatment processes. The DWM approach serves as a decision-making tool by evaluating new waste treatment processes, as well as their location and new means of transport for waste...|$|R
40|$|Due to the social, {{economical}} {{and environmental}} impacts associated with waste management, {{it is necessary}} to move towards decision-making approaches which integrate each one of these aspects. Currently, the recommended approaches are rather static and linear in their application; furthermore, they do not allow an optimal use of the available materials. Consequently, the choice for a waste management process is often based on fixed parameters, while the systems are in constant evolution. But actually, the validity of the prioritization of a waste treatment process {{is directly related to the}} impacts associated with the length of paths, means of transport and characteristics of the road chosen. The available tools however neglect this dynamic aspect, which is critical to reduce the load of the studied system.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{effectiveness and}} cost-effectiveness over a one-year time horizon of pharmacological {{first line treatment}} in primary care for patients with moderate to severe depression. DESIGN: A multiple treatment comparison meta-analysis was employed to determine the relative efficacy in terms of remission of 10 antidepressants (citalopram, duloxetine escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline and venlafaxine). The estimated remission rates were then applied in a decision-analytic model in order to estimate costs {{and quality of life}} with different treatments at one year. DATA SOURCES: Meta-analyses of remission rates from randomised controlled trials, and cost and quality-of-life data from published sources. RESULTS: The <b>most</b> <b>favourable</b> pharmacological <b>treatment</b> in terms of remission was escitalopram with an 8 - to 12 -week probability of remission of 0. 47. Despite a high acquisition cost, this clinical effectiveness translated into escitalopram being both more effective and having a lower total cost than all other comparators from a societal perspective. From a healthcare perspective, the cost per QALY of escitalopram was € 3732 compared with venlafaxine. CONCLUSION: Of the investigated antidepressants, escitalopram has the highest probability of remission and is the most effective and cost-effective pharmacological treatment in a primary care setting, when evaluated over a one year time-horizon. Small differences in remission rates may be important when assessing costs and cost-effectiveness of antidepressants...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{our study}} {{suggests}} that, outside the clinical trials setting, IL 28 B testing genotype CC at rs 12979860 remains predictive of SVR 12 to telaprevir- and boceprevir-based triple therapy. Similar to the retrospective analyses of phase- 3 clinical trials, the predictive value of rs 12979860 -CC was observed only in {{patients in the}} <b>most</b> <b>favourable</b> previous HCV <b>treatment</b> categories, such as naïve patients, subjects that interrupted PEG-IFN/RBV therapy due to adverse events, prior viral breakthrough and relapsers. More efficacious and better-tolerated DAAs are now available. Although preliminary data suggest that patients with a favourable IL 28 B genotype seem to have slightly better chances of cure even with some interferon-free combinations, the influence of IL 28 B is likely to fade away when SVR rates approaches > 90 % in all patients (Holmes et al. 2012). In countries where this new wave of DAAs is already replacing telaprevir and boceprevir, testing for IL 28 B may be considered futile. However, in those settings where {{the use of the}} newer DAAs will be restrained for some time due to limited economic resources, testing for IL 28 B genotype may still be used, in addition to other baseline predictors, to identify patients that can be successfully treated with the telaprevir- and boceprevir-based treatment regimens.|$|R

30|$|It {{is evident}} from the {{previous}} data that the highest values for the various growth and yield attributing parameters were recorded for T 6. Thus, this treatment (T 6) appeared to be the <b>most</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>treatment</b> combination compared to other integration ratios. The superiority of the treatment {{may be due to the}} fact that it might have taken advantage of the merits conferred by both vermicompost and chemical fertilizer in a most poised condition. As suggested by Srivastava et al. (2012), the integrated application of vermicompost and mineral fertilizer in appropriate ratio resulted in more balanced nutrient contents, microbial population and OM. This might have led to increased uptake of essential nutrients which in turn resulted in increased vegetative growth of the plant to help for better carbohydrate build up that subsequently contributed to higher fruit yield and quality components (Suge et al. 2011). Moreover, as Namazi et al. (2015) elaborated, adding vermicompost to the soil not only increased the nutritious elements needed for the plant but also improved the soil environment, encouraging the proliferation of roots to draw more water and nutrients from larger areas, finally resulting in improved biological function of the plant.|$|E

Eighteen patients presented with fever and an acute encephalitic syndrome: diffuse brain dysfunction, focal neurological signs, seizures and cranial nerve palsies. Three patients presented with either ventricular or subdural haemorrhage, one with myelitis, and one with asymptomatic stenosis of the middle cerebral artery. The imaging was either normal or revealed non-specific abnormalities such as cortical atrophy but no evidence of stroke.

30|$|Orthopaedic {{disorders}} are very frequent, globally found and often partially unresolved despite the substantial advances {{in science and}} medicine. Their surgical intervention is multifarious and the <b>most</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>treatment</b> is chosen by the orthopaedic surgeon {{on a case-by-case basis}} depending on a number of factors related with the patient and the lesion. Numerous regenerative tissue engineering strategies have been developed and studied extensively in laboratory through in vitro experiments and preclinical in vivo trials with various established animal models, while a small proportion of them reached the operating room. However, based on the available literature, the current strategies have not yet achieved to fully solve the clinical problems. Thus, the gold standards, if existing, remain unchanged in the clinics, notwithstanding the known limitations and drawbacks. Herein, the involvement of regenerative tissue engineering in the clinical orthopaedics is reviewed. The current challenges are indicated and discussed in order to describe the current disequilibrium between the needs and solutions made available in the operating room. Regenerative tissue engineering is a very dynamic field that has a high growth rate and a great openness and ability to incorporate new technologies with passion to edge towards the Holy Grail that is functional tissue regeneration. Thus, the future of clinical solutions making use of regenerative tissue engineering principles for the management of orthopaedic disorders is firmly supported by the clinical need.|$|E

A total of 1031 children were born between 1964 and 1980 and started treatment before they were 4 months of age, and 808 of them were followed up prospectively. In 263 children born between 1964 and 1971 (cohort 1), the mean intelligence quotient (IQ) at 4 years rose with year of birth from 24 points below revised IQ norms to 10 points below; in 545 born between 1972 and 1980 (cohort 2) there was no further rise in IQ and the mean remained eight points below the norms. IQ fell progressively by roughly four points for each four weeks' delay in starting treatment, for each 300 mumol/l rise in mean phenylalanine concentrations during treatment, and for each five months {{during the first two}} years during which phenylalanine concentrations were below 120 mumol/l. Forty six children in cohort 2 had the <b>most</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>treatment</b> characteristics.

40|$|Objective: Conflicting {{recommendations}} {{have been}} made on whom to treat with antibacterials to eradicate Helicobacter pylori. The present analysis aims to explain the basis of such discrepancies. Design and Setting: The decision in favour of or against antibacterial therapy in patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms is modelled as a threshold analysis. The threshold is the lowest probability for a given diagnosis at which the decision in favour of antibacterial therapy yields a higher expected outcome than the decision against it. A strong indication for antibacterial therapy is shown by a low threshold value. Main Outcome Measures and Results: In patients with suspected peptic ulcer disease, both the high success rate of antibacterial therapy and its low cost make it the <b>most</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>treatment</b> option, its threshold being less than 35 %. In ulcer patients receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the threshold is 73 % if based on success rates of different treatment modalities, but only 7 % if treatment costs are considered. The relatively poor success rate of antibacterial therapy in non-ulcer dyspepsia raises the diagnostic threshold for antibacterial therapy to 76 % if based on therapeutic success rates. The small marginal cost of antibacterial therapy lowers the diagnostic threshold to 16 %. Conclusion: If therapeutic success is the primary concern, patients with vague abdominal symptoms should not be given antibacterial therapy, unless H. pylori has been established as a probable cause of their symptoms. If healthcare costs are the driving force for choosing one type of therapy over another, a trial of antibacterials appears indicated irrespective of any firm validation of H. pylori {{playing a role in}} the patient's disease.

40|$|Aleppo pine is {{the most}} {{widespread}} pine species around the Mediterranean Basin. Its post-fire recruitment has been studied in depth, but regeneration of mature stands in fire-free conditions has received considerably less attention. This study examines the impact of different site preparation treatments on pine recruitment using three experimental mature stands along a gradient of site fertility in southeastern France. The stands were partially felled and subjected to the following treatments replicated four times on each site: mechanical chopping (all sites), chopping followed by single soil scarification (all sites) or double scarification (2 sites), controlled fire of low intensity (2 sites) or of high intensity (1 site) and control (all sites). In addition, the influence of slash, either left on the soil or removed before treatments, was tested for the single scarification treatment {{on two of the}} sites. Pine regeneration was counted and soil cover conditions described at different time intervals: 1 to 6 {{years after the end of}} the treatments for two sites and 1 to 16 years for one site. Seedling dimensions were determined during the last count. Mean seedling densities after 6 – 9 years (0. 57 – 1. 06 pines/m 2) were comparable to those found in post-fire conditions, although with a narrower range. Pine density was negligible in the control, while chopping followed by a single soil scarification emerged as the <b>most</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>treatment</b> tested in the three sites on seedling density (0. 74 – 1. 54 pines/m 2 after 6 – 9 years) and seedling growth. For this treatment, the amount of slash had a contrasting influence on pine density according to site conditions. Double scarification did not affect pine density. Controlled high intensity fire, due to slash presence, was very favourable for pine regeneration (2. 35 pines/m 2), although this treatment was only tested at one site. Lastly, we found low pine densities in the chopping and low-intensity controlled fire treatments (0. 20 to 0. 56 pines/m 2). Variation in herb cover was a major factor influencing pine recruitment. This study emphasises the need for adapted site preparation treatments to regenerate mature pine stands in southern Europe...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} the effect of Spinal Manipulative Therapy (SMT) to the cervico-thoracic junction on {{the activity of the}} ipsilateral latissimus dorsi with regards to muscle activity measured by electromyography and activity of the trigger points measured by the algometer. STUDY DESIGN: Fourty subjects with lower cervical spine pain and dysfunction underwent six spinal manipulative treatments on alternative days over a 3 week period (excluding weekends) to test the changes in activity of the ipsi-lateral Latissimus Dorsi muscle. SETTING: Chiropractic Day Clinic at the University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa. SUBJECTS: Forty subjects with lower cervical spine pain participated in this study. Each of the subjects was {{randomly assigned to one of}} two groups. Group A consisted of 20 subjects receiving SMT to the cervico thoracic junction. Group B consisted of 20 subjects receiving de-tuned ultra-sound to the area of cervical spine pain. METHODS: Latissimus Dorsi muscle activity and its trigger point activity were tested before and after the first consultation using electromyography and the algometer respectively. After consultations two, four and six readings were taken. For the electromyography readings subjects were asked to lie down in a prone position with their arms next to their sides. They were then instructed to lie as still as possible for three minutes. The mean, peak and minimum values from the surface electromyographic meter were recorded, analysed and compared for reference. For the algometer readings, the researcher grasped the Latissimus Dorsi muscle along the free border at the posterior axillary fold of the midscapular level. The algometer was then pushed into this point and candidates had to indicate when they started to feel pain. This measurement was then recorded. RESULTS: Data was analysed using the T-test for independent samples to compare the two individual groups. Repeated measures ANOVA was useful to investigate changes over time. If one considers Group A as the superior group, no statistical significant difference were noted between Group A and Group B regarding the electromyographic readings. With regards to the algometer readings no statistically significant differences were identified between the two groups except for the last consultation (treatment 4) of Group A where the p-value = 0. 035 < 0. 05. CONCLUSION: In light of these findings, it can be concluded that there were no statistically significant differences between Group A and Group B, regarding the electromyographic readings. Group A showed the <b>most</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>treatment</b> efficacy in terms of the algometer readings.

STUDY DESIGN: Thirty subjects with chronic lower back pain underwent 5 spinal manipulative treatments on alternative days over a 2 week period (excluding weekends) to test the electromyographic effect on the lumbar spinal muscles. SETTING: Technikon Witwatersrand Chiropractic Clinic, Johannesburg, South Africa SUBJECTS: Thirty subjects with chronic lower back pain participated in this study. Each of the subjects was {{assigned to one of}} three groups using age-matched sampling methods. Group 1 consisted of 10 subjects (mean age of 25 years) receiving lumbar spine and pelvis adjustments (L 1 - L 5, including Sacroiliac joints); Group 2 consisted of 10 subjects (mean age of 26 years) receiving cervical spine adjustments (Occiput - C 7); and Group 3 consisted of 10 subjects (mean age of 26 years) receiving adjustments to the cervical spine, lumbar spine and pelvis. METHODS: Lumbar paraspinal muscle electrical activity was tested before and after the treatment one, three and five using surface electromyography (sEMG). One pair of bipolar electrodes was placed bilaterally over the paraspinal muscles at the level of L 3. Subjects were asked to lie down in a prone position with their arms next to their sides. They were then instructed to perform a single voluntary lower back extension exercise by lifting their chests and shoulders as high as possible off the plinth. Each contraction lasted five seconds. The baseline and peak values from the surface electromyographic meter were recorded, analyzed and compared for reference. Information regarding the intensity and quality of the pain experienced by the subjects were also collected at the start of treatment one, three and five using approved research measurements, i. e. the Oswestry Questionnaire and the Visual Analogue Pain Scale. iv RESULTS: Comparison of the results indicated no statistically significant difference between the three groups and their responses to the treatments. Subjectively, all three groups showed trends of improvement, with group 2 showing the greatest percentage of improvement in pain. Objectively, group 2 also showed the greatest percentage of improvement in the resting rate of the paraspinal muscles, assuming that ideal sEMG resting rate is the lowest one possible. Comparing the results of the contraction ability of the paraspinal muscles, both prior to and after spinal manipulative treatment (SMT), group 1 demonstrated the greatest percentage in improvement followed by group 3. Group 3 also demonstrated the most balanced paraspinal muscles {{at the end of the}} study. CONCLUSION: In light of these findings it can be concluded that the treatment protocol as represented by group 2 showed the <b>most</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>treatment</b> efficacy in terms of subjective results and resting rate of the paraspinal muscles. The trends shown in this study should be used and tested in future similar research studies incorporating larger sample groups. Ms. M. Jansen van Rensburg Dr. M. Buchholt...|$|E
