40|$|Although positrve social {{relationships}} can enrich {{the lives of}} animals, aggression, intimidation and socially induced stress can cause serious welfare problems. It is therefore important {{to try to understand}} how animals remember other individuals, and past social encounters. The main aim of the experimental research was to determine whether pigs and rats can discriminate between conspecifics using social categories such as 'familiar/unfamiliar' and 'group-mate/non-group-mate'. Once a reliable technique had been established, it could then be used to investigate their social memory, specifically how long it takes for an animal to move from one category to another and how long a memory of an animal as 'familiar' lasts. Methods were first developed to assess whether rats could discriminate between group- mate and non-group-mate stimuli. In Experiment One, an operant lever-pressing task was used to determine if rats could discriminate between group-mates and non-group-mates. In Experiment Two their spontaneous behavioural response to home-cage and non-home-cage odours was assessed. An operant digging task was then employed to assess the rats' ability to discriminate between odours collected from individual group-mate and non-group-mate animals (Experiment Three) and investigate the duration of social memory for previous group-mates (Experiment Four). Operant techniques were then developed to assess whether pigs were able to discriminate between individual group-mate and non-group-mate animals, first using a symmetrical reinforcement paradigm (Experiment Five) similar to Experiment One, and then using a Y- <b>maze</b> <b>approach</b> (Experiment Six). Overall, operant tasks employing responses in the animals' natural behavioural repertoire (Experiments Three, Four and Six) proved more successful than the more abstract methods used in Experiments One and Five. Both species were able to successfully discriminate between 'group-mate' and 'non-group-mate' stimuli and showed evidence of developing cognitive categories. However, {{more research is needed to}} determine the processes involved in social discrimination and how long a memory may last. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Learning to {{navigate}} in complex environments with dynamic elements {{is an important}} milestone in developing AI agents. In this work we formulate the navigation question as a reinforcement learning problem and show that data efficiency and task performance can be dramatically improved by relying on additional auxiliary tasks leveraging multimodal sensory inputs. In particular we consider jointly learning the goal-driven reinforcement learning problem with auxiliary depth prediction and loop closure classification tasks. This approach can learn {{to navigate}} from raw sensory input in complicated 3 D <b>mazes,</b> <b>approaching</b> human-level performance even under conditions where the goal location changes frequently. We provide {{detailed analysis of the}} agent behaviour, its ability to localise, and its network activity dynamics, showing that the agent implicitly learns key navigation abilities.

40|$|Abstract — In today’s VLSI designs, {{there can}} be many {{blockages}} in a routing region. The obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (OARSMT) problem has become an important problem in the physical design stage of VLSI circuits. This problem has attracted a lot of attentions in research and several approaches have been proposed {{to solve this problem}} effectively. In this paper, we will present a heuristic <b>maze</b> routing based <b>approach</b> to solve this OARSMT problem. It is commonly believed that <b>maze</b> routing based <b>approaches</b> can only handle small scale problems and {{there is a lack of}} an effective multi-terminal variant to handle multi-pin nets in practice. We will show in this paper that <b>maze</b> routing based <b>approaches</b> can also handle large scale OARSMT problems effectively. Our approach is based on the searching process as in maze routing and can handle multi-pin nets very well in both solution quality, running time and memory space usage. We have compared our results with those of the previous works and can show that we can out-perform the best previous results on this problem [15] by giving an OARSMT with 2. 01 % less wire length on average and can make a 27. 04 % improvement in wire length in comparison with a lower bound of the optimal solution on average, while the running times are all very short and comparable to those in [15]. Besides, due to the flexibility of maze routing, we can handle different kinds of obstacles with different convex or concave rectilinear shapes directly without a need to partition each blockage into a set of rectangular sub-blockages, which will increase the size of the problem.

40|$|The hippocampal {{formation}} {{is believed to}} be critical for the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of episodic memories. Yet, how these processes are supported by the anatomically diverse hippocampal networks is still unknown. To examine this issue, we tested rats in a hippocampus-dependent delayed spatial alternation task on a modified T maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials from dendritic and somatic layers of the dentate gyrus, CA 3, and CA 1 regions by using high-density, 96 -site silicon probes. Both the power and coherence of gamma oscillations exhibited layer-specific changes during task performance. Peak increases in the gamma power and coherence were found in the CA 3 –CA 1 interface on the <b>maze</b> segment <b>approaching</b> the T junction, independent of motor aspects of task performance. These results show that hippocampal networks can be dynamically coupled by gamma oscillations according to specific behavioral demands. Based on these findings, we propose that gamma oscillations may serve as a physiological mechanism by which CA 3 output can coordinate CA 1 activity to support retrieval of hippocampus-dependent memories...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a view [...] based approach to map learning and navigation in mazes. By means of graph theory {{we have shown}} that the view [...] graph is a sufficient representation for map behaviour such as path planning. A neural network for unsupervised learning of the view [...] graph from sequences of views is constructed. We use a modified Kohonen (1988) learning rule that transforms temporal sequence (rather than featural similarity) into connectedness. In {{the main part of the}} paper, we present a robot implementation of the scheme. The results show that the proposed network is able to support map behaviour in simple environments. 1 Introduction: The view [...] graph representation A cognitive map is a neural mechanism supporting navigation and orientation tasks much as a real map of the environment.

40|$|Recent work on novelty and {{behavioral}} diversity in evolutionary computation has highlighted the potential disadvantage of driving search purely through objective means. This paper suggests that leveraging human insight during search can complement such nov-elty-driven approaches. In particular, {{a new approach}} called novelty-assisted interactive evolutionary computation (NA-IEC) combines human intuition with novelty search to facilitate the serendipitous discovery of agent behaviors in a deceptive <b>maze.</b> In this <b>approach,</b> the human user directs evolution by selecting what is interesting from the on-screen population of behaviors. However, unlike in typical IEC, the user can now request that the next generation be filled with novel descendants. The experimental results demon-strate that combining human insight with novelty search not only finds solutions significantly faster and at lower genomic complex-ities than fully-automated processes guided purely by fitness or novelty, but it also finds solutions faster than the traditional IEC approach. Such results add to the evidence that combining human users and automated processes creates a synergistic effect {{in the search for}} solutions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{previous}} experience with flowers, how do bees distinguish between possible food sources and non-rewarding objects? Unrewarding stimuli (colours in Experiment 1 and patterns in Experiment 2) were presented in a radial arm <b>maze.</b> The unlearned <b>approach</b> responses of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) were recorded and significant preferences were obtained: the bees chose yellow and blue over other colours, and radial patterns over concentric patterns or unpatterned discs. Habituation was demonstrated when choices proportions for the same pattern by the same bees decreased over two test sessions. When an attractive novel pattern was presented in the third session the trend was reversed. These data confirm both that truly naive bees have unlearned colour and pattern preferences and that learning not to approach these stimuli occurs in {{the absence of}} reward. Two further experiments tested the length of time that habituation is maintained by bumble bees {{and the degree to which}} contextual cues contribute to maintaining habituation. In Experiment 3 once bees habituated to a radial pattern response decrement was maintained after a stimulus presentation delay of two hours. After a 24 hour delay, however, the preference was restored. In Experiment 4 exposure to the context without stimulus presentation did not affect the retention of the habituated response. These findings confirm bumble bees' ability to habituate to a stimulus and delineate its time course as lasting in the range of minutes and hours but not days. They call into question the associative role of contextual cues in habituation for bumble bees...|$|R
40|$|A body of {{evidence}} is being accumulated on consistent individual differences in behaviour for several animal taxa. Individuals of these species exhibit different levels of risk during competition over limited resources, and the resultant behavioural types perform better under different social and physical environmental conditions. We used approach distance to {{a model of a}} piscivore predator the pike cichlid (Crenicichla saxatilis) to categorize male pentamorphic livebearing fish or pentas (Poecilia parae) as bold, intermediate, and shy, and then tested the hypothesis that when behaviours are correlated, individuals express different behaviour types under different contexts. Our results for the most part corroborated the six predictions generated by the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) bold pentas explored a T-maze in the shortest time, and initially approached the chamber with a living pike cichlid instead of the one with the conspecific male; (2) intermediate pentas spent more time exploring the maze and exhibited no initial interest in the predator chamber nor the conspecific one; (3) shy individuals spent the most time exploring the <b>maze,</b> and initially <b>approached</b> the predator chamber, providing only partial support for this prediction because shy males did not initially approach the conspecific chamber; (4) approach distance from the pike cichlid predator model and time to explore the maze was positively correlated; (5) bold pentas exhibit highest levels of aggression toward conspecifics; and (6) bold individuals ingested the most conspecific fry. Our results lead to the conclusion that pentas exhibited a behavioural syndrome with bold fish being more aggressive, faster explorers of novel situations, and more cannibalistic than intermediate and shy individuals of the same population. Thus, penta males fall into a behavioural syndrome formally known as the proactive-reactive axis...|$|R
40|$|Training {{animals in}} spatial mazes {{have always been}} preceded by prior {{habituation}} to the test apparatus and testing conditions with the main goal to reduce fear and anxiety from exposure to the unfamiliar <b>maze</b> environment. This <b>approach</b> makes assumptions about the baseline level of emotionality in animals without actual objective measurements. It also ignores that genetic factors and experimental manipulations can reduce or prolong fear and anxiety from novelty, hence affecting the acquisition of a memory task. In the present study, C 57, CD- 1 and Balb/c mice were introduced to a working memory task in a radial-arm maze without habituation. Fear-induced anxiety from exposure to the novelty in this maze is demonstrated by a very low number of arm entries. Animals have to climb onto a bridge {{in order to reach}} an arm of the maze. In the first session block, Bab/c mice made very few arm entries and made more arm repeats than CD- 1 and C 57 mice, and CD- 1 made few arm entries and made more arm repeats than C 57 /BL 6 J mice. In the second session block, all three strains of mice did make 8 arm entries. Balb/c mice seem to perform better than C 57 and CD- 1 mice as shown by a low number of arm repeats in the second session block, a high number of correct choices before first errors in the third session block, and low number of errors and sessions to criterion. In the present case, a high baseline level of emotionality did not prevent Balb/c mice to perform better than C 57 and CD- 1 mice...|$|R
