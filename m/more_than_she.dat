5|$|Mather & Co. sold Prince of Wales to Clayton Tarleton in 1793. Tarleton armed {{her with}} twenty 6-pounder guns and placed her {{under the command}} of William Scales. Scales {{received}} a letter of marque on 1 March 1793. The letter indicated that Prince of Wales had a crew of 100 men, many <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> needed to sail her, suggesting that Tarleton intended her to sail as a privateer.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Tahsi is {{approached}} by a thief (Danielle Burgio), who has fled to Guam with a stolen rare jade dragon and wants to pawn it, promising to return in 24 hours. Tahsi agrees, but does not promise not to sell it. Indeed, Jane Goody, who {{turns out to be}} a friend of his, visits his shop and buys the dragon, despite Tahsi's reluctance. She later has it appraised, learning it is worth many times <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> paid for it, heightening her hopes of paying the tuition for her sister's medical degree. Later, an enforcer (Arnold Chon) for the yakuza group Black Dragons, the original owners of the jade dragon, appears in Tahsi's shop with the thief in a headlock, demanding the figurine's return. Tahsi refuses to reveal Jane's identity and is killed along with the thief.|$|E
5|$|Peggy {{demands that}} Stacey leave the pub and Stacey pleads with {{her not to}} call the police for Lily's sake. She {{attempts}} to tell Ryan that he is Lily's father, but is interrupted by Pat, who thinks Stacey is trying to seduce him and slaps her. Phil smashes through the door using a crowbar that was left in the room. He starts taking cash and drinking alcohol, and interrupts Peggy before she can call the police about Stacey. They argue, with Phil accusing Peggy of loving the pub <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> loves him and throwing a match to the alcohol-soaked floor to start a fire. It spreads quickly, causing an explosion. The customers flee the pub, Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) is knocked to the ground and trampled in the process but is rescued by his father Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and brother Tamwar (Himesh Patel).|$|E

25|$|Kim Delaney as Megan Donner; Horatio's first {{partner and}} a {{respected}} MDPD Police Lieutenant. She {{was the director}} of the MDPD Crime Lab prior to taking indefinite leave due to the death of her husband, who was killed in the line of duty. She believes in following the evidence, and as such is often seen as adversarial to Horatio's go-with-the-gut detective style. As a result of this, Megan resigns, finding the pressure of the job to now be <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> could handle. (season 1).|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{her adult}} life, except during World War II, Lawrence spent far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> earned. Philip Astley had persuaded her to place £1,000 in {{a trust fund}} for her daughter, but aside from {{that she had no}} savings of her own. During her {{engagement}} to Bert Taylor he managed her finances and encouraged her to invest in the productions in which she starred, but although she earned a considerable amount of money from Private Lives, she still was deeply in debt, at one point owing fashion entrepreneur Hattie Carnegie more than $10,000. She opened accounts with dozens of shop owners but assumed she had unlimited credit and paid little attention to the invoices they sent.|$|E
25|$|Early in the {{investigation}} of Taunja Bennett's murder, Laverne Pavlinac read the news reports surrounding Taunja Bennett's death and saw it as an opportunity to force an end to the long-term abusive relationship she had been in with her live-in boyfriend, John Sosnovske. She set up a meeting with the investigating detectives and gave a false confession, using the details she had read in reports to give a detailed story of how Sosnovske forced her to help him rape, murder, and dispose of Bennett's body. Pavlinac and Sosnovske were convicted of the murder in February 1991. To avoid the possibility of facing the death penalty, Sosnovske pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to life in prison, while Pavlinac was sentenced to no less than 10 years, much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> had anticipated.|$|E

25|$|In 1931 Courtneidge and Hulbert {{suffered}} a serious setback when {{they discovered that}} their financial manager had been speculating with their money, suffering heavy losses and putting their business into liquidation. Hulbert accepted responsibility for all the business's debts and undertook to repay every creditor. To achieve this, he and Courtneidge temporarily went their separate professional ways, reasoning that they could earn more as individual stars than as a double act. A boom in the film industry enabled both to earn large sums; Courtneidge appeared in 11 British films and one Hollywood film in the 1930s. She was amused to find that in eight weeks in a film studio she could earn <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> could in {{a year in the}} theatre. She and Hulbert managed to work together on several films, including The Ghost Train (1931) and Jack's the Boy (1932).|$|E
25|$|Cinderpaw {{falls from}} the Sky Oak, {{breaking}} her back leg. As Leafpool's determination to heal her begins to border on an obsession, Jaypaw begins to wonder why. One night, he falls asleep by Cinderpaw and wakes up in a strange forest. There he meets Cinderpaw, unhurt, who leads him to a camp filled with familiar smells; ThunderClan's previous home in the forest. Cinderpaw describes how she once lived there before the Great Journey and asks Jaypaw to tell Leafpool that she is proud of her, and that she has learned far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> could have ever taught her. By then Jaypaw is confused, but upon looking into Cinderpaw's eyes, he sees a series of flashbacks from her previous life. Jaypaw realizes that when Cinderpelt, the former ThunderClan medicine cat, died in Twilight she was reincarnated as Cinderpaw, without Cinderpaw herself knowing it. However, when Cinderpaw wakes she does not remember the dream, only that Jaypaw {{had been able to}} see in it.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss quickly {{recognized}} Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie {{had with}} strangers during that time. By this time Genie could name {{most of the}} things around her and had an estimated vocabulary of at least a few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which she wanted to know the word, and if Curtiss could not figure out exactly what Genie was looking for Genie refused to let go until she learned at least one new word. Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> was producing.|$|E

25|$|The success led Irving Thalberg, head of {{production}} at MGM, to cast {{her in a}} similar role in The Temptress (1926), based on another Ibáñez novel. After only one film, she was given top billing, playing opposite Antonio Moreno. Her mentor Stiller, who had persuaded her to take the part, was assigned to direct. For both Garbo (who {{did not want to}} play another vamp and did not like the script any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> did the first one) and Stiller, The Temptress was a harrowing experience. Stiller, who spoke little English, had difficulty adapting to the studio system and did not get on with Moreno, was fired by Thalberg and replaced by Fred Niblo. Reshooting The Temptress was expensive and even though it became one of the top-grossing films of the 1926–27 season, it was the only Garbo film of the period to lose money. However, Garbo received rave reviews and MGM had a new star.|$|E
25|$|A pure SR {{analysis}} {{would be}} as follows: Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she fires her rockets for the turnaround, she experiences a pseudo force which resembles a gravitational force. Figs.2‑6 and 2‑11 illustrate the concept of lines (planes) of simultaneity: Lines parallel to the observer's x-axis (xy-plane) represent sets of events that are simultaneous in the observer frame. In Fig.2‑11, the blue lines connect events on Terence's world line which, from Stella's point of view, are simultaneous with events on her world line. (Terence, in turn, would observe a set of horizontal lines of simultaneity.) Throughout both the outbound and the inbound legs of Stella's journey, she measures Terence's clocks as running slower than her own. But during the turnaround (i.e. between the bold blue lines in the figure), a shift {{takes place in the}} angle of her lines of simultaneity, corresponding to a rapid skip-over of the events in Terence's world line that Stella considers to be simultaneous with her own. Therefore, {{at the end of her}} trip, Stella finds that Terence has aged <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> has.|$|E
25|$|Edwards {{made her}} senior debut for Victoria mid-way through the 2000–01 season soon after turning 19. At {{this stage of}} her career, Edwards was a {{specialist}} batsman and did not bowl her first ball in senior cricket until six years later. She was not productive with the bat in her first two seasons, and was dropped after making a duck in her only innings of the third season. Up to this point, she had made only 165 runs at 11.00. She regained {{her place in the}} 2003–04 season but averaged less than 10. Nevertheless, she was selected for the Australian Under-23 team and made 51 and 97 in matches against the Sri Lankan national team. Edwards made her breakthrough in the 2004–05 WNCL, scoring 281 runs, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> had made in her first four seasons combined. She was selected for the 2005 tour of England, but was not selected in the Tests; she made her One Day International (ODI) debut in the last match but neither batted or bowled. Edwards was then dropped from the national team and did not play for Australia again until a solitary ODI {{at the start of the}} 2006–07 season. After scoring 332 runs in the WNCL season, she was given a consistent run in the national team for the first time, playing in just over half the matches during the year. She made only 37 runs at 7.40 and spent most of the following season's international fixtures watching from the sidelines as a reserve, playing in only two ODIs.|$|E

500|$|Historians {{have offered}} varied interpretations of Jennings's life and {{impact on the}} {{development}} of Indiana. Early state historians, Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. and William Wesley Woollen, gave Jennings high praise and credited him with the defeat of the pro-slavery forces in Indiana and with laying the foundation of the state. More critical historians during the prohibition era, such as Logan Eseray, described Jennings as a crafty and self-promoting politician and focused on his alcoholism. Among the modern historians, Randy Mills places Jennings's importance between the two extremes, but agreed with Woolen's assessment that the state [...] "owes him <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> can compute." ...|$|E
