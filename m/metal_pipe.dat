Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{assumption}} that the aether is not carried in the vicinity, but only within matter, was very problematic as shown by the Hammar experiment (1935). Hammar directed one leg of his interferometer through a heavy <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> plugged with lead. If aether were dragged by mass, it was theorized that the mass of the sealed <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> would have been enough to cause a visible effect. Once again, no effect was seen, so aether-drag theories are considered to be disproven.|$|E

The monkey bar designation was for the resemblance that playing children had to the rambunctious, climbing play of monkeys, though the term nowadays often refers specifically to a single row of overhead bars designed to be swung across. The jungle gym was invented and patented by Sebastian Hinton of Chicago in 1920.|$|E

25|$|A {{traditional}} samovar {{consists of}} a large metal container with a tap near the bottom and a <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> running vertically through the middle. The pipe is filled with solid fuel which is ignited to heat {{the water in the}} surrounding container. A small (6 to 8inch) smoke-stack is put on the top to ensure draft. After the water boils and the fire is extinguished, the smoke-stack can be removed and a teapot placed on top to be heated by the rising hot air. The teapot is used to brew a strong concentrate of tea known as заварка (zavarka). The tea is served by diluting this concentrate with кипяток (kipyatok) (boiled water) from the main container, usually at a water:tea ratio of 10:1, although tastes vary.|$|E
25|$|Soon, the Train was put {{in charge}} of the landing's water supply, {{something}} that had been neglected during the early stage of the campaign. As there was no supply available, water had to be brought by sea, often in petrol tins. This responsibility was given to the Train on 12 August, they were able to source three fire engines and some hoses, which, with the Train's pontoons were used to pump supplies brought from transport ships to tanks on the beach. The fire hoses were kept under guard, and eventually replaced with <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> as soldiers would constantly make holes in it to get at the water inside. This was just some of the work that saw the Train removed from the 11th Division and directly attached to the IX Corps Engineers, becoming responsible for all work afloat or on the beach up to the high-water mark that the Navy might require.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we extend {{the theory of}} Radio Frequency (RF) {{propagation}} {{as it relates to}} propagation within <b>metal</b> circular <b>pipes.</b> This work is motivated by a need to understand the operation of UHF Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems when the tags are placed within the pipes. These circular pipes are shown to be similar to metal tube waveguides which are hollow. We derive the Bessel function that is used to identify the propagation constants, the different transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes, cut-off frequencies and the multimode attenuation. These parameters are used within the theory to identify operating limitations of passive RFID systems in hollow <b>metal</b> <b>pipes.</b> A comprehensive general theory is developed to enumerate the workings of passive RFID systems in circular <b>metal</b> <b>pipes.</b> Analytical evaluations are used to visualise the tags within the <b>metal</b> <b>pipes</b> and to validate the theory presented in this paper...|$|R

Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) covered hoses and Nitrile rubber (NBR) covered hoses {{have a lot of}} advantages compared to <b>metal</b> <b>pipes.</b> It is easy to deliver, assemble and disassemble hoses and long sections of NBR- and TPU-covered hoses reduce the possibility of leakage in connecting parts. These large-diameter NBR- and TPU-covered hoses are called fracking hoses.|$|R
25|$|Despite the structure, {{interference}} {{has become}} common inside the Elimination Chamber. At New Year's Revolution 2005, Ric Flair distracted guest referee Shawn Michaels allowing Batista {{who had been}} eliminated to attack Randy Orton so Triple H could win the match. At No Way Out 2009, Edge attacked Kofi Kingston during his entrance and locked himself {{in one of the}} pods becoming a participant in the match for the World Heavyweight Championship after losing the WWE Championship earlier in the night. At Elimination Chamber 2010, Cody Rhodes passed Ted DiBiase Jr. a <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> which he used to eliminate Randy Orton in the match for the WWE Championship. Later in the night, Shawn Michaels broke into the Chamber match to cost The Undertaker his World Heavyweight Championship to Chris Jericho. At the 2013 Elimination Chamber event, Mark Henry took out the remaining participants in the Chamber match for a World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania 29 after being eliminated until SmackDown GM Booker T broke it up. At the 2014 Elimination Chamber for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, The Wyatt Family interfered by attacking John Cena, which would lead to his eventual elimination. Kane would come out to help escort The Wyatt Family out of the Chamber match, but would then interfere costing Daniel Bryan the match to Randy Orton.|$|E

500|$|The primary {{component}} was {{a length of}} <b>metal</b> <b>pipe,</b> about [...] in diameter and [...] long, containing smokeless explosive powder. The box and the plugs sealing the pipe's ends were handcrafted from wood. Most pipe bombs use threaded metal ends easily obtained by consumers; the wooden ends lacked the strength for significant pressure to build within the pipe, weakening the blast. The trigger was primitive: a nail, tensioned by rubber bands, which would strike six common match heads when the box was opened; the match heads would ignite and initiate combustion of the powder. Kaczynski later used batteries and heat filament wire to ignite the powder more effectively.|$|E

His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland.

40|$|Surface cracks {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as a major cause for potential failures of <b>metal</b> <b>pipes.</b> In fracture analysis, the widely used method is based on linear elastic fracture mechanics. However, for ductile <b>metal</b> <b>pipes,</b> it has been known {{that the existence of}} plasticity results in easing of stress concentration at the crack front. This will ultimately increase the total fracture toughness. Therefore, when using linear elastic fracture mechanics to predict fracture failure of ductile <b>metal</b> <b>pipes,</b> the plastic portion of fracture toughness should be excluded. Otherwise, the value of fracture toughness will be overestimated, resulting in an under-estimated probability of failure. This paper intends to derive a model of elastic fracture toughness for steel pipes with a circumferential crack. The derived elastic fracture toughness is a function of crack geometry and material properties of the cracked pipe. The significance of the derived model is that the well-established linear elastic fracture mechanics can be used for ductile materials in predicting the fracture failur...|$|R
