5|$|In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia {{set up a}} {{commission}} tasked with determining the border, but in its first ten years it convened only once or twice. Since 2010, the issue has gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries. Plans for construction of a port in Apatin, {{on a piece of}} territory claimed by Croatia, added fuel to the dispute. After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that there was a difference of opinions on the matter. Later that month, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) proposed a National Assembly resolution which would require that Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanović, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the Croatia–Slovenia border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanović said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia—which would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU.|$|E

Having in mind our possible future situation, when we <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> economic impasse, the solution could be to contract a life insurance, which could basically provide protection, but on a long term, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a means of saving...|$|R

25|$|In the cytoplasm, {{ferrous iron}} {{is found in}} a soluble, chelatable state which {{constitutes}} the labile iron pool (~0.001 mM). In this pool, iron {{is thought to be}} bound to low-mass compounds such as peptides, carboxylates and phosphates, although some <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> free, hydrated form (aqua ions). Alternatively, iron ions might be bound to specialized proteins known as metallochaperones. Specifically, poly-r(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs) appear to mediate transfer of free iron to ferritin (for storage) and non-heme iron enzymes (for use in catalysis). The labile iron pool is potentially toxic due to iron's ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Iron from this pool can be taken up by mitochondria via mitoferrin to synthesize Fe-S clusters and heme groups.|$|E

[...] Decoration was often tilework, and could include parchin kari inlays in semi-precious stone, painting, and decorative carving. [...] No animals would be represented, but geometric patterns and written inscriptions were common. [...] The sarcophagus <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room. [...] Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the Qur'an in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The Mausoleum of Khomeini, still under construction in a Tehran cemetery, and intended to be the centre of a huge complex, continues these traditions.|$|E

By default, everything that follows a percent sign on a line is a comment, ignored by TeX. Running TeX on this file (for example, by typing texmyfile.tex in a command-line interpreter, or by calling it from a graphical user interface) will create an output file called myfile.dvi, representing {{the content of the}} page in a device independent format (DVI). A DVI file could then either be viewed on screen or converted to a suitable format for any of the various printers for which a device driver existed (printer support was generally not an operating system feature at the time that TeX was created). Knuth has said that there is nothing inherent in TeX that requires DVI as the output format, and later versions of TeX, notably pdfTeX, XeTeX and LuaTeX, all support output directly to PDF.|$|E
