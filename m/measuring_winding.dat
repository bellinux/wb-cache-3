50|$|Controllers {{that sense}} rotor {{position}} based on back-EMF have extra challenges in initiating motion because no back-EMF is produced when the rotor is stationary. This is usually accomplished by beginning rotation from an arbitrary phase, and then skipping {{to the correct}} phase if it {{is found to be}} wrong. This can cause the motor to run briefly backwards, adding even more complexity to the startup sequence. Other sensorless controllers are capable of <b>measuring</b> <b>winding</b> saturation caused by the position of the magnets to infer the rotor position.|$|E

That is why, in addition to commonly used testing methods, electromagnetic methods (i. e. eddy current and magnetic) are widely used in the process of metal products fabrication. Most widely are used the flaw detectors with encircling eddy current transducers (ECT). Continuously increasing quality requirements towards testing procedures and equipment explain necessity to develop new examination methods and instruments. In the paper will be presented two methods on enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio (К=Udefect/Unoise) as well new design of combined transducer (encircling type exciting winding and rotating <b>measuring</b> <b>winding</b> of attached type) providing reliable detection of long longitudinal defects.

40|$|Purpose of this {{dissertation}} is {{to explore}} control techniques of PMSM motors and {{the design of a}} complex solution of sensorless control across a wide range of speed and torque. The proposed solution supports industrial implementation of different types of end equipment which use a PMSM motor. The work covers a thorough analysis of position and speed estimation. The Control structure is based on field oriented control technique, processes estimated quantities, and optimizes motor conditions to achieve maximum efficiency, start-up torque, and speed. The work discusses how the solution complies with the latest IEC standards. Compliance with these standards requires adapting the sensorless control technique and field oriented control structure. The elimination of a rotor position sensor and a temperature sensor <b>measuring</b> <b>winding</b> temperature requires development of techniques in software for blocked rotor detection and overload detection. The proposed solutions, which have been granted US patents, are explained in this work and utilize the unique features of an NXP microcontroller optimized for motor control applications.

40|$|Generation of a {{turbulent}} wind field based on prescribed turbulence characteristics {{is required for}} physical model-based condition monitoring of wind turbines. Kaimal's and Mann's models are specified in the IEC 61400 - 1 standard and {{have been widely used}} for the design of wind turbines. However, these models cannot directly be used for wind generation for monitoring purposes. Kaimal's model lacks a theoretical background and is incomplete in terms of cross-correlations between different components of wind. Mann's model is derived from von Karman's theoretical model, but it cannot be easily linked to measured time series of wind. The aim {{of this study is to}} propose a set of turbulence models and investigate the applicability of the proposed model to dynamic simulation of wind turbines for monitoring. First, von Karman's model is modified to satisfy <b>measured</b> <b>wind</b> data characteristics and the IEC requirements, and a model for Reynolds stress components is proposed. Von Karman's model has expressions in both frequency and time domain. The consistency of the proposed model with IEC requirements is validated in the frequency domain. Implementation in the wind generation method is carried out in the time domain, based on an adaptation of Iwatani's autoregressive method for wind generation. The generation algorithm can be linked to any number of <b>measured</b> <b>wind</b> speed data at any number of points. The turbulent wind fields generated in this study satisfy the IEC requirements and the proposed turbulence model, and are consistent with measured time series of wind speed. Then, three wind fields are generated based on the proposed method, and the response of a wind turbine to each wind field is calculated. The first wind field satisfies the turbulence description but is not linked with any <b>measured</b> <b>wind</b> speed. The second and third wind fields are respectively linked to one and three components of <b>measured</b> <b>wind</b> speed. When one component of <b>measured</b> <b>wind</b> speed is included, the estimated maximum base moment shows a closer value to measurements and shows smaller variations over several random seeds realizations. Including three components of <b>measured</b> <b>wind</b> speed further increases the stability both in the fore-aft tower base bending moment and side-by-side tower base bending moment. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士（工学）; 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科社会基盤学専...|$|R
