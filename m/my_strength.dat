During his reign, he signed a constitution that established a Danish parliament and made the country a constitutional monarchy. Frederick's motto was The people's love, <b>my</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write.

40|$|This {{paper will}} retrace, from a {{reflective}} viewpoint, a forty year journey through {{professional and personal}} challenges as part of ongoing efforts to discover and utilise <b>my</b> <b>strengths</b> {{as an integral part}} of social work practice. It will cover terrain in which forces such as internalised dominance threaten to undermine or disrupt <b>my</b> <b>strengths</b> and capacity to reach professional maturity. It will describe the journey inherent to exploring the implications of applying principles of social justice, self determination, uniqueness of the individual, and respect for difference. It will attempt to take readers through the dark, lonely, often terrifying realm of fears and prejudices – country we must travel if we are to break free of those forces to encounter our humanity – the cornerstone of good social work practice. It will chart the trials, challenges and triumphs resulting in confidence in myself as a social work professional, the future, and a sense of belonging to the global struggle to achieve just and equitable societies, as well as being part of the social work profession’s contribution to that collective effort. The paper will conclude by describing a vision for the future and the likely challenges facing those people who attempt to achieve that vision. The reader will firstly be taken through the narrative of key influences shaping my thinking and hence responses to social work thought and practice leading to the identification and analysis of <b>my</b> emerging <b>strengths</b> base...|$|R

She accompanies Trisha on film shoots, events, and functions, and they have appeared together only in a commercial advertisement. About her relationship with her mother, Trisha remarks, [...] "She has been the pillar of <b>my</b> <b>strength</b> and has stood by me like a rock through thick and thin.

[...] This loyalty was immediately put to the test. By September, the Imperial forces under the Duke of Lorraine, together with a powerful Polish army under King John III Sobieski, were poised to strike the Sultan's army. On the morning of 12 September, the Christian forces drew up in line of battle on the south-eastern slopes of the Vienna Woods, looking down on the massed enemy camp. The day-long Battle of Vienna resulted in the lifting of the 60-day siege, and the Sultan's forces were routed and in retreat. Serving under Baden, Eugene distinguished himself in the battle, earning commendation from Lorraine and the Emperor; he later received the nomination for the colonelcy of the Dragoon Regiment Kufstein.|$|E
2500|$|Josephine wrote {{much later}} that [...] "The {{fear and the}} excitement, the weeks of {{exhausting}} travel, chagrin over my own foolishness, all together proved too much for <b>my</b> <b>strength.</b> I developed St. Vitus Dance {{and was unable to}} attend school very much again. After a time however I very much improved in health so that within two years after my experience I was once more a normal healthy girl." [...] If Josephine, as she said, left San Francisco at age 18, it's unclear why she would still be attending school upon her return two years later. Like cerebral meningitis, St. Vitus Dance is a form of a streptococcus infection. The symptoms of St. Vitus Dance and meningitis are somewhat different, but both can be contracted from the same strain of bacteria through saliva. Both of Behan's children, Henrietta and Albert, were ill with meningitis around 1877, and in July of that year, Henrietta died from the disease.|$|E
