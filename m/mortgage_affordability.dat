40|$|By {{virtue of}} {{creating}} asset-liability mismatch, conventional long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans inherently introduce excess interest {{risk to the}} financial systems. Considering that inflation is in part {{the reason for this}} excess interest risk, it seems natural to redesign mortgages {{in such a way that}} over time mortgage payments could, at least in part, reflect inflation. In this paper, I show that by allowing payments to adjust to inflation, particularly that of wages, by incorporating a prespecified growth rate into mortgage payments, mortgage loans become more affordable while bank interest spreads become less volatile, making the banking system less unstable. <b>Mortgage</b> design <b>Affordability</b> Wages Inflation...|$|R

It employs a statistical measure for improving regression efficiency with conditioning information in the form of lagged instrument to unravel the pattern of association evident from the data. Based on the data, the study investigates what level of income multiples is optimum – that is the income multiple that minimises home repossession. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to show how home repossession responds to changes in income multiples. For each of the analytical tasks, the study compares the aggregate market, first-time-buyers, and home movers. <b>Mortgage,</b> Repossession, <b>Affordability,</b> Income Multiples, Lagged Instrument...|$|R
40|$|After {{a number}} of warning signs, the U. S. "subprime {{mortgage}} crisis" became a headline issue in February 2007. Notwithstanding the bankruptcy of numerous mortgage companies, historically high delinquencies and foreclosures, and a significant tightening in subprime lending standards, the impact thus far on core U. S. financial institutions has been limited. This paper reviews the history {{and structure of the}} subprime market. The results suggest that new origination and funding technology appear to have made the financial system more stable at the expense of undermining the effectiveness of consumer protection regulation. Potential solutions to the management of this trade-off are then explored.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the <b>mortgage</b> <b>affordability</b> problem in Ghana, an issue that has been {{associated}} inter alia with high mortgage rates, which results from the high cost of capital, an unstable macroeconomy and unfavourable borrowers’ characteristics. Concurrent improvements in both the macroeconomy and borrowers’ characteristics have rendered the identification of the most problematic mortgage pricing determinant difficult, consequently making the targeting of policy interventions problematic. Design/methodology/approach This research sought to resolve this aforementioned difficulty by providing empirical evidence on the relative importance of mortgage pricing determinants. A data set of mortgage rates of selected Ghanaian banking financial institutions from 2003 to 2013 was examined and analysed by applying Fisher’s model of interest rates and an ex post analysis of the standard regression coefficients. Findings The risk premium factor emerged as the most important determinant in Ghana compared with the inflation premium and the real risk-free rate, although all are statistically significant and strongly correlated with mortgage rates. Originality/value This study provides an insight on the relative importance of mortgage pricing determinates and subsequent macro-economic guidance to support policy interventions which could reduce mortgage rates/enhance <b>mortgage</b> <b>affordability.</b> The paper specifically aims to engender wider debate and provide guidance to the Ghanaian Government and/or private enterprises that seek to provide affordable mortgages. Further research is proposed which could explore ways of reducing mortgage rates as a means of engendering social equality and adopt innovative international best practice that has already been tried and tested in countries such as South Africa and the USA...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{mortgage loan}} demand in Argentina {{using a new}} survey administered in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. It finds that recurring macro volatility and violation of financial property rights have increased demand for real estate as an investment, which in turn boosts housing prices and {{makes it more difficult}} for consumer households to meet minimum income requirements for obtaining a <b>mortgage.</b> <b>Affordability</b> thus seems to offer a better explanation than standard supply side constraints for the small size of the mortgage market in Argentina. Overall, the shallow mortgage market has not posed a major impediment to home ownership in Argentina and the small (and shrinking) mortgage market {{has more to do with}} lack of demand than credit supply constraints. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{meltdown}} {{in residential}} real-estate prices that commenced in 2006 resulted in unprecedented mortgage delinquency rates. Until mid- 2009, lenders and servicers pursued {{their own individual}} loss mitigation practices without being significantly influenced by government intervention. Using a unique dataset that precisely identifies loss mitigation actions, we study these methods - liquidation, repayment plans, loan modification, and refinancing - and analyze their effectiveness. We show {{that the majority of}} delinquent mortgages do not enter any loss mitigation program or become a part of foreclosure proceedings within 6 months of becoming distressed. We also find that it takes longer to complete foreclosures over time, potentially due to congestion. We further document large heterogeneity in practices across servicers, which is not accounted for by differences in borrower population. Consistent with the idea that securitization induces agency conflicts, we confirm that the likelihood of modification of securitized loans is up to 70 % lower relative to portfolio loans. Finally, we find evidence that affordability (as opposed to strategic default due to negative equity) is the prime reason for redefault following modifications. While modification terms are more favorable for weaker borrowers, greater reductions in mortgage payments and/or interest rates are associated with lower redefault rates. Our regression estimates suggest that a 1 percentage point decline in mortgage interest rate is associated with a nearly 4 percentage point decline in default probability. This finding is consistent with the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) focus on improving <b>mortgage</b> <b>affordability...</b>|$|E
40|$|This Selected Issues {{paper on}} the United States {{examines}} {{the effect of the}} structure of the mortgage market on real housing activity and housing prices. The market-based financial structure has reduced the volatility of mortgage lending. Changes in the structure of the mortgage market have coincided with lower volatility of real housing activity.

40|$|Why are housing markets so {{prone to}} boom-bust cycles? The {{mortgage}} market structure {{prior to the}} Savings and Loan crisis contributed to the volatility in real housing activity which, in turn, amplified the volatility in housing prices. The subsequent development of a national, market-based system of securitized mortgage finance has damped this boom-bust cycle. We test whether deviations of actual housing prices from values forecast by a model based on economic fundamentals {{have responded to the}} change in financial structure, and find that pricing errors have fallen significantly since the mid- 1980 s. Tests of the relative importance of the change in financial market structure versus the reduction of inflation over this period indicate a primary role for market structure in improving pricing efficiency.

40|$|Introduction: The Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey rates housing {{affordability}} {{using the}} “Median Multiple” {{in the analysis}} of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Median Multiple is widely used for evaluating urban markets, and has been recommended by the World Bank and the United Nations and is used by the Harvard University Joint Center on Housing. Average multiple data (average house price divided by average household income) is used in Japan, where data for estimating medians is not readily available. More elaborate indicators, which mix housing affordability and <b>mortgage</b> <b>affordability</b> can mask the structural elements of house pricing are often not well understood outside the financial sector. Moreover, they provide only a "snapshot," because interest rates can vary over the term of a mortgage; however the price paid for the house does not. The reality is that, if house prices double or triple relative to incomes, as has occurred in many severely unaffordable markets, the sum total of mortgage payments will also rise substantially. Historically, the Median Multiple has been remarkably similar in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, with median house prices having generally been from 2. 0 to 3. 0 times median household incomes. The Average Multiple reached as low 3. 5 and 3. 9 in the major metropolitan areas of Japan within the last decade, though further historical data has not been identified. The historic affordability relationship continues in many housing markets of the United States and Canada. However, housing affordability has deteriorated sharply in the past decade in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom and in some markets of Canada and the United States (evidenced by sharply higher. Median Multiples). In every market where there has been a sustained and significant increase in the Median Multiple, more restrictive land use policies have been implemented. These policies are referred to in this Survey as "urban containment" (also called as "smart growth," "urban consolidation," "compact city policy," "growth management," "densification policy," etc.). Regrettably, virtually no government administering urban containment policy effectively monitors housing affordability. However, encouraging developments have been implemented at higher levels of government in New Zealand and Florida, and there are signs of potential reform elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Sharp {{increase}} in house prices in Hong Kong SAR in 2009 - 2010 {{has led to}} concerns of an emerging real estate bubble. According to our measure of price deviation from fundamentals, which should be taken as an early warning indicator of market exuberance, {{the current level of}} house prices in Hong Kong SAR {{does not seem to be}} significantly higher than would be justified by underlying fundamentals. Moreover, unlike advanced economies before 2007 - 8, deviation from fundamentals has not been persistent in Hong Kong. Going forward, low interest rate and improving growth prospects, as well as a tight supply, particularly in the mass market, means that house price growth will continue to be strong. This is the period in which vulnerability may be accumulating, and tight prudential standards and fiscal measures will be required to tame price inflation.

The average coefficients that measure the agents'' ability to self-insure against income shocks {{are similar to those}} of a SIM model without housing but housing increases the values of these coefficients for younger agents. The response of consumption to house price shocks is minimal. The introduction of minimum down payments or income garnishment benefits a majority of the population.

40|$|Limited Equity Cooperatives (LECs) are {{a form of}} {{cooperative}} housing that is price restricted, often created initially through government construction or <b>mortgage</b> interest subsidies. <b>Affordability</b> is maintained in perpetuity by capping the transfer value {{of cooperative}} shares to limit the equity that owners can extract from their units. As a type of collective ownership, LECs enable homeownership without the risk of debt financing or the responsibility of maintenance. Cooperative members receive the same tax advantages as traditional homeowners, assessed on shares of the cooperative rather than a single unit. The restriction on share resale values keeps LECs affordable to multiple generations of purchasers and enables renters to become homeowners without having to qualify for traditional financing. LECs provide these benefits while spreading the risk and cost of homeownership across many shareholders (Saegert and Benitez 2003). Nearly 16 million U. S. households are severely cost burdened (spending more than 50 {{percent of their income}} on housing), a number that increased by two million between 2001 and 2004 (Joint Center for Housing Studies 2006). Neither the federal government nor the private sector has implemented an effective solution to the affordability crisis. By incorporating LECs into federal housing policy, an opportunity exists to ease the cost-burden of homeownership for low- and moderate-income households, promote mixed-income housing, and increase community engagement and civic capacity. LECs offer an alternative to market rate and subsidized housing, but are not appropriate for every population or every location...|$|R
