40|$|This thesis reports {{investigations}} on {{applying the}} Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) {{approach in the}} engineering of multi-platform and <b>multi-devices</b> user interfaces. This study has three goals: (1) analyze the present frameworks for developing multi-platform and <b>multi-devices</b> applications, (2) extend the principles of SOA for implementing a multi-platform and <b>multi-devices</b> architectural framework (SOA-MDUI), (3) applying and validating the proposed framework {{in the context of}} a specific application. One of the problems addressed in this ongoing research is the large amount of combinations for possible implementations of applications on different types of devices. Usually it is necessary to take into account the operating system (OS), user interface (UI) including the appearance, programming language (PL) and architectural style (AS). Our proposed approach extended the principles of SOA using patterns-oriented design and model-driven engineering approaches. Synthesizing the present work done in these domains, this research built and tested an engineering framework linking Model-driven Architecture (MDA) and SOA approaches to developing of UI. This study advances general understanding of engineering, deploying and managing multi-platform and <b>multi-devices</b> user interfaces as a service...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As {{smart device}} {{hardware}} and software technologies have advanced, performance of devices has improved and their types and categories have diversified. In addition, as smart devices have become popular, the number of <b>multi-devices</b> held by a single person has increased. Following this trend, data production and management through <b>multi-devices</b> of a single user have increased, and various data sharing services have emerged to meet the need for data sharing across <b>multi-devices.</b> Much {{attention has been given}} to data sharing services utilizing a cloud computing environment. Cloud computing is a computing technology to provide IT resources (e. g., software, storage, and server) with internet technology. Data sharing services are provided by virtualizing unlimited storage space and computing resources utilizable via the cloud computing environment. Users have access to unlimited storage space for their devices and can share the same data regardless of which device is used. There are a number of pay or free cloud storage services available, but cloud service providers have their own proprietary interfaces so that users may have to install a specific application program for the use of a cloud or data management service in order to access multiple cloud storage services. In the present paper we define and propose the Meta-Cloud, which is an integrated platform for the use of multiple cloud storage services...|$|R

40|$|A {{web service}} is a {{programmable}} web application accessible using standard Internet protocols. A three-layer architecture has been suggested for web services: service providers, service brokers, and service requesters. We propose in this paper a SOAP-oriented component-based framework to support device-independent multimedia web services. Two intelligent agents are introduced and embedded into proxy server and service provider server, respectively. Separating metadata from multimedia content leads to enhance SOAP flexibility. Composite Capability / Preference Profiles-based user profile management provides an easy and flexible way to split and adapt multimedia services to appropriate composite devices as well as increases the flexibility for users to manage <b>multi-devices.</b> Together with XML/XSL strategy, we ensure the device independency of the system.

40|$|Today, it is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} for physicians to own multiple mobile devices such as smart-phones and tablets in order to seamlessly access the Electronic Health Record (EHR). But, the over reliance on wireless communication channels by mobile devices limits the user expectation since consistent connectivity cannot be guaranteed due to the intermittent connectivity losses in mobile ecosystems. What is even challenging is the presence of the CAP theorem which states that though the following three properties are desired in a distributed environment: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance, only two of the properties can be guaranteed simultaneously. In this paper, we deployed a reliable mHealth architecture that enables healthcare practitioners to employ their multi-mobile devices to access the EHR. We proposed a middleware platform that synchronizes the medical data on the <b>multi-devices</b> of a single user with careful consideration to the CAP theorem. The archi-tecture is based on mainstream technologies such as: the publish/subscribe technique for real-time data access, medical data encryption for security, and mobile-side caching...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{heterogeneous}} networks {{such as new}} multi-domain and multi-technology mobile networks, handover requests {{could be}} driven by other needs such as cost reduction criteria, network resource optimization, service related requirements, etc. Thus, handover could become a critical issue if not done in an optimized way. The main objective is therefore to define concepts and functions with the aim to realize handovers characterized by new multi-dimensions (multi-domain mobile networks, multi-technologies, multi-services, <b>multi-devices,</b> multi-hops, multi-accesses, any-cast, etc). Furthermore {{it is necessary to}} be able to support novel requirements that have emerged due to the proliferation of mobile communication services. In {{the first part of this}} work are shown conception, definitions, concepts and functions for mobility management, in particular for handover management within "beyond- 3 G" Ambient Networks scenarios and architecture.

40|$|Problem statement: Although the {{traditional}} metering system and method for controlling flow is generally safe, reliable and robust, it does suffer certain drawbacks, such as limited accuracy {{and the ability}} to implement complex reactive rate designs. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a circuit and method of increasing metering accuracy, as well as the position control accuracy for variable flow rates, without further reliance on mechanical tolerances. An essential component for an electronic meter is a database and method of communication to obtain the required measurements and to program the meter for any additional needed values. Flexibility is added to such meters by using wireless communication circuits and protocols, which will enable reading of <b>multi-devices</b> from the same source point. Approach: To collect data, critical quality of service and carry out analysis, wireless flow meter reading system is designed, tested and implemented. The hardware and software in the designed system work together, to wirelessly receive readings from meters and then process it in order to obtain an accurate reading for the measured flow. The system makes use of modern communication algorithms and techniques. Also, the system allows for history tracing and analysis. The interfacing hardware uses two-way wireless optical interface to flow meter device. Results: The Hardware and Communication Protocol tested successfully and provided sufficient and accurate data for flow measurements analysis, presented in this research. Conclusion: Such hardware-software arrangement is considered a core for mobile meter reading and control with possibility to add intelligent security algorithms...|$|R
