With exceptions, such as Proton in Europe and Octopus in Asia,a lot of <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets</b> are likely to disappear in the next fewyears. Yet the key factors of success are known by banks which oftenchoose to ignore them. However, the strategic change taken by some inorder to bring a fresh start to <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets</b> like Moneo couldreverse the tendency.

40|$|Abstract—Many recent {{initiatives}} {{indicate an}} evolution to-wards an <b>electronic</b> <b>wallet</b> to perform {{all sorts of}} electronic transactions, such as for example micro payments, loyalty, and transport ticketing. Furthermore, the smartphone is emerging as an indispensable tool for many, containing more and more personal information. Hence, {{it seems like the}} ideal medium for carrying the <b>electronic</b> <b>wallet</b> as well. The fast and intuitive touch-and-go philosophy and the integration in mobile devices, makes Near Field Communication (NFC) the perfect technology for contactless electronic transactions. However, the complex ecosystem is holding back the world-wide integration of this technology in mobile handsets, resulting in a low market penetration of NFC smartphones. In our work, we investigated how an NFC-enabled smartphone can be used as an <b>electronic</b> <b>wallet</b> in an existing solution that originally relied on DESFire tags. We implemented a Java Card applet that is compatible with the DESFire specification and explored how this applet can be deployed on the different possible solutions for the Secure Element (SE), such as an active Bluetooth sticker, a SIM card, and a secure microSD card. Finally, the user-wallet interface was examined carefully, more specifically in terms of accessibility of the wallet content for the different smartphone platforms. Based on the overall experiences and results the final conclusions upon the vision towards an open <b>electronic</b> <b>wallet</b> of the future were drawn.

40|$|CAFE ("Conditional Access for Europe") is {{an ongoing}} project in the European Community's ESPRIT program. The goal of CAFE is to develop {{innovative}} systems for conditional access, and in particular, digital payment systems. An important aspect of CAFE is high security of all parties concerned, with the least possible requirements that {{they are forced to}} trust other parties (so-called multi-party security). This should give legal certainty to everybody at all times. Moreover, both the electronic money issuer and the individual users are less dependent on the tamper-resistance of devices than in usual digital payment systems. Since CAFE aims at the market of small everyday payments that is currently dominated by cash, payments are offline, and privacy is an important issue. The basic devices used in CAFE are so-called <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets,</b> whose outlook is quite similar to pocket calculators or PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant).

Within this new model you can leave most of the content of your <b>electronic</b> <b>wallet</b> (credentials, keys and passwords) at the security of your residential keeper, while roaming with your favourite mobile terminals. The main aim for this work has been to design a software architecture based on PersonalJava [2] (portable code) with emerging web technology through the Apache project and SOAP, the new RPC paradigm based on XML (portable data) for web services. The experiments were carried out using WLAN and demonstrating that the SOAP protocol shows a great feasibility to implement this architecture for real e-commerce websites compared to other middleware options (RMI, CORBA). Finally, an authentication protocol developed in a parallel thesis work [3] was implemented in the software architecture.
