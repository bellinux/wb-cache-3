5|$|According to {{his later}} accounts, Smith was visited by an angel named <b>Moroni,</b> while praying {{one night in}} 1823. Smith said that this angel {{revealed}} {{the location of a}} buried book made of golden plates, as well as other artifacts, including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame, which had been hidden in a hill near his home. Smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning, but was unsuccessful because the angel returned and prevented him. Smith reported that during the next four years, he made annual visits to the hill, but each time returned without the plates.|$|E

5|$|Although Smith had {{previously}} refused {{to show the}} plates to anyone, he told Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer {{that they would be}} allowed to see them. These men, known collectively as the Three Witnesses, signed a statement stating that they had been shown the golden plates by an angel, and that the voice of God had confirmed the truth of their translation. Later, a group of Eight Witnesses — composed of male members of the Whitmer and Smith families — issued a statement that they had been shown the golden plates by Smith. According to Smith, the angel <b>Moroni</b> took back the plates once Smith finished using them.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rains and}} storm surge caused {{significant}} damage {{on all three}} islands of the Comoros, with the worst occurring on Anjouan. There, 901houses were damaged, of which about 20% were destroyed. Flooding displaced 389people in Salamani where 33mud-built homes were destroyed. Landslides isolated the villages of Chiconi, Hamaba, Koni-Djodjo, Miringoni, and Nioumachioi, and damaged a road between Ngandzalé and Domoni. On the island, 7,879people had to evacuate their houses due {{to the risk of}} further landslides, some of whom went to schools set up as shelters while others stayed with family or friends. Storm surge on Mohéli flooded parts of Tsamia, Walla, and Zirindani, resulting in one fatality. Several houses were damaged on the island, and Djandro lost power due to a damaged power line. The Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport in <b>Moroni</b> on Grande Comore was closed for about 24hours due to the storm. Also on the island, a road was damaged, and one house was flooded. Shortly after the storm, workers began repairing roads and distributing aid.|$|E
25|$|According to the Book of Mormon, <b>Moroni</b> {{was the son}} of Mormon, {{the prophet}} for whom the Book of Mormon is named. <b>Moroni</b> may have been named after Captain <b>Moroni,</b> an earlier Book of Mormon figure. Before Mormon's death in battle, he passed the golden plates to <b>Moroni.</b> <b>Moroni</b> then {{finished}} writing on the plates and concluded the record, presumably burying them in the hill Cumorah in western New York.|$|E

25|$|<b>Moroni</b> {{is thought}} by Latter Day Saints {{to be the}} same person as a Book of Mormon prophet-warrior named <b>Moroni,</b> who was the last to write in the golden plates. The book states that <b>Moroni</b> buried them before he died after a great battle between two pre-Columbian civilizations. After he died, he became an angel who was tasked with {{guarding}} the golden plates and directing Smith to their location in the 1820s. According to Smith, he returned the golden plates to <b>Moroni</b> after they were translated and, as of 1838, <b>Moroni</b> still had the plates in his possession.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moroni</b> and Pahoran retake {{the city}} of Nephihah. Many Lamanite prisoners join the people of Ammon. <b>Moroni,</b> Lehi and Teancum pursue the Lamanite armies. Teancum steals into the Lamanite camp and slays Ammoron, but is slain in turn. The Nephite armies, under <b>Moroni</b> and Teancum, defeat the Lamanites and drive them {{from the land of}} Zarahemla.|$|E
25|$|Henze {{lived with}} his partner Fausto <b>Moroni</b> from the early sixties, and <b>Moroni</b> planned and planted the {{hillside}} garden around La Leprara. <b>Moroni</b> cared for the composer when he suffered a spectacular emotional collapse during which he barely spoke {{and had to be}} encouraged to eat, living as though in a coma. In 2007, shortly after Henze's sudden recovery, <b>Moroni</b> died after a lengthy battle with cancer. Elogium Musicum (2008), for large orchestra and chorus singing Henze's own Latin text, is a memorial to his partner of more than forty years.|$|E
25|$|Pahoran replies {{that the}} king-men have rebelled {{and he has}} been {{compelled}} to flee to the land of Gideon. The king-men hold the city of Zarahemla and are in league with the Lamanites. Pahoran requests <b>Moroni's</b> aid in defeating the dissenters.|$|R

25|$|Karl Quilter sculpted {{his first}} Angel <b>Moroni</b> in 1978. Two sizes were made, one three meters high, the other {{just over two}} meters. These statues were {{designed}} {{to reduce the cost}} and weight of the previous Angel <b>Moroni</b> statues, in order to become a standard part of the temple architecture. The Quilter angels are made of fiberglass and covered with gold leaf. In 1998, with the construction of many new smaller temples, Quilter was commissioned to create a new angel. This angel was similar in design to his previous angels, but he gave <b>Moroni</b> a slightly larger build, with his left hand opened and his body turned slightly to show more action. The Bern Switzerland Temple's Angel <b>Moroni</b> is patterned after Quilter's 1998 design. Quilter's Angel <b>Moroni</b> is now on over one hundred temples around the world.|$|E
25|$|After fortifying the Nephites' lands, <b>Moroni</b> {{transferred}} {{command of}} his armies {{to his son}} Moronihah and permanently retired to his own home. Four years later, in the 36th year {{of the reign of}} the judges (or approximately 56 B.C.), <b>Moroni</b> died. According to the chronology of years, listing the time from when <b>Moroni</b> took command of the armies at age 25, he would have been approximately 45 years old when he died.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moroni</b> marches to Zarahemla, raising {{assistance}} en route. <b>Moroni</b> and Pahoran {{defeat the}} king-men in Zarahemla and slay Pachus, their leader. The dissenters {{are once again}} compelled to defend their country or be put to death.|$|E
500|$|Christian themes {{permeate}} the work; for instance, Nephite prophets in the Book of Mormon teach of Christ's coming, and {{talk of the}} star that will appear at his birth. After the crucifixion and resurrection in Jerusalem, Jesus appears in the Americas, repeats the Sermon on the Mount, blesses children, and appoints twelve disciples. The book ends with <b>Moroni's</b> exhortation to [...] "come unto Christ".|$|R
6000|$|The {{dinner at}} <b>Moroni's</b> had been eaten, and Phineas had given {{an account of}} the {{entertainment}} to Lord Chiltern's sister. There had been only two other guests, and both of them had been men on the turf. [...] "I was the first there," [...] said Phineas, [...] "and he surprised me ever so much by telling me that you had spoken to him of me before." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{quality of}} each different plan proposal {{would be much}} higher, because {{they would be the}} result of specific decentralised knowledge gathering efforts, thus relying on the mobilisation of situated, tacit and dynamic knowledge (to use <b>Moroni’s</b> criteria), and because they would propose solutions consistent with the underlying value systems of different actors, so that goals would be connected explicitly to the means employed to reach them.|$|R
25|$|The Zoramites become Lamanites. The {{army of the}} Lamanites, led by Zerahemnah, come {{to battle}} against the Nephites. <b>Moroni,</b> chief captain of the Nephites, asks Alma to inquire of the Lord how to direct his armies. <b>Moroni</b> and Lehi lead the Nephites to victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{image of}} the angel <b>Moroni</b> blowing a trumpet is {{commonly}} used as an unofficial symbol of the LDS Church. <b>Moroni</b> appears {{on the cover of}} some editions of the Book of Mormon. Statues of the angel stand atop many LDS temples, with most statues facing eastward.|$|E

In {{the spring of}} 1860 he created the title role of Luigi <b>Moroni's</b> Amleto at the teatro Apollo in Rome, singing with the aging Filippo Coletti as Cladio. A year later, again with Coletti, he created the role of Icilio in Petrella's Virginia in Naples.|$|R
5000|$|Some have {{interpreted}} [...] "the earth was divided" [...] {{to mean the}} covenant line was divided into two groups, one of which went to America. They note that one of Joktan's sons is named [...] "Jerah," [...] {{which is similar to}} Jared. They propose that <b>Moroni's</b> genealogy of Ether begins where Genesis 10 leaves off. Some have further hypothesized that the word Yucatán is derived from Joktan. (See Smith and Sjodahl's commentary, or a summary.) ...|$|R
60|$|Phineas {{was engaged}} to dine {{with one of the}} Vice-Chancellors on the day named. He had never before dined at the house of this great law luminary, whose {{acquaintance}} he had made through Mr. Low, and he had thought {{a great deal of the}} occasion. Mrs. Freemantle had sent him the invitation nearly a fortnight ago, and he understood there was to be an elaborate dinner party. He did not know it for a fact, but he was in hopes of meeting the expiring Lord Chancellor. He considered it to be his duty never to throw away such a chance. He would in all respects have preferred Mr. Freemantle's dinner in Eaton Place, dull and heavy though it might probably be, to the chance of Lord Chiltern's companions at <b>Moroni's.</b> Whatever might be the faults of our hero, he was not given to what is generally called dissipation by the world at large,--by which the world means self-indulgence. He cared not a brass farthing for <b>Moroni's</b> Château Yquem, nor for the wondrously studied repast which he would doubtless find prepared for him at that celebrated establishment in St. James's Street;--not a farthing as compared with the chance of meeting so great a man as Lord Moles. And Lord Chiltern's friends might probably be just the men whom he would not desire to know. But Lady Laura's request overrode everything with him. She had asked him to oblige her, and of course he would do so. Had he been going to dine with the incoming Prime Minister, he would have put off his engagement at her request. He was not quick enough to make an answer without hesitation; but after a moment's pause he said he should be most happy to dine with Lord Chiltern at <b>Moroni's.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Moroni</b> goes {{forth with}} the title of liberty and raises an army to defeat the Amalickiahites.

5000|$|Portraits were a {{specialty}} of Giovanni Battista <b>Moroni’s,</b> and were influence by his teacher, Moretto de Brescia, and by Tiziano and Lorenzo Lotto. His portraits are {{of those of}} people of nobility of the provinces, but also, {{as it is the}} case with [...] "The Tailor" [...] the portrait is that of an artisan presumably in any common day. The person depicted is from the Fenaroli family. It is interpreted that the work has a psychological dimension to it.|$|R
5000|$|The National Gallery (London) {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{collections}} of his work, including the celebrated portrait known as Il sarto (The Tailor). Other portraits are found in the Uffizi (the Nobleman Pointing to Flame inscribed [...] "Et quid volo nisi ut ardeat?"), Berlin Gallery, the Canon Ludovico de' Terzi and <b>Moroni's</b> self-portrait; and in the National Gallery, Washington, the seated half-figure of the Jesuit Ercole Tasso, traditionally called [...] "Titian's Schoolmaster", although there is no real connection with Titian.|$|R
5000|$|TV <b>Moroni's</b> two songs, [...] "Moja borba" [...] ("My Struggle") and [...] "Pada noć" [...] ("The Night Is Falling"), {{were the}} closing tracks of the [...] "Artistička radna akcija" [...] (Artistic Work Action) various artist compilation, {{featuring}} {{the second generation}} of the Belgrade new wave and punk rock bands. The band also appeared on the first Ventilator Demo Top 10 show in February 1983 with the song [...] "Tebi dajem sve" [...] ("I Give Everything to You"), {{but it was never}} released. After the compilation release, the band disbanded.|$|R
