40|$|Abstract. Tube {{expansion}} {{is the last}} forming operation of the UOE process {{for the production of}} welded pipes. This process is carried out by pressing a steel plate into a U and then O shape prior to welding. Then a radial {{expansion is}} applied in order to obtain a final circumferential shape. The expander is composed of a truncated pyramid, which acts as a bar parallel to the tube axis, covered with several <b>expanding</b> <b>tools</b> (usually 8 to 12) which looks like truncated circular sectors. They are placed such that an axial displacement of the central bar produces the tube expansion. In order to improve the expander design, in particular to optimize the contact pressure distribution between the <b>expanding</b> <b>tools</b> and the central bar, a complex three dimensional numerical model of this process was developed considering frictional contact in the interactions between the different parts of the model (central bar, <b>expanding</b> <b>tools</b> and tube). Material non-linearity is also present since the tube is plastically deformed. Model results were useful to understand the impact of the <b>expanding</b> <b>tool</b> longitudinal profile on the contact pressure distribution and on the total horizontal force required to expand the tube...|$|R

40|$|The {{segmented}} <b>expanding</b> <b>mandrel</b> test is modified {{and improved}} to yield more quantitative {{information on the}} local stress and strain concentrations in Zircaloy tubing samples. The experimental apparatus has undergone changes in segment design, end restraint fixture design and the method of sample heating. These changes result in localization of stress and strain concentrations to known locations in the tubing, {{the introduction of a}} small degree of biaxiality and a more uniform sample temperature, respectively. A chamfered specimen design has been introduced for the purpose of producing a near plane-strain condition. Finite-element analysis has been added to provide information on the magnitude of localized stresses and strains given the sample geometry, test procedure and measured diametral strains.

The test specimen ‘in the form a tube was made of austenitic stainless steel 17 240 (1. 4301, X 5 CrNi 18 - 10). During the experiment, the radial <b>expanding</b> <b>tool</b> was quasi-statically charged by the internal fluid pressure. In the introductory part, the thesis focuses on the stress-strain description of the method of tube bulging and possible ways of detecting the strain of material during forming. The experimental part is primarily focused on the analysis of the test sample that was obtained from the experiment. Theoretical approaches were used to analyze the real test sample to detect strain and stress in material, numerical simulation of the bulge process and 3 D ATOS scanning device, which helped clarify behavior tube during bulging process. At the end of the thesis is proposed possible design of the tool.
