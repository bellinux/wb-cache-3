5|$|The company {{failed to}} gain a <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> the burial industry, and the scheme was not as {{successful}} as its promoters had hoped. While they had planned to carry between 10,000 and 50,000 bodies per year, in 1941 after 87 years of operation, only slightly over 200,000 burials had been conducted in Brookwood Cemetery, equalling roughly 2,300 bodies per year.|$|E
5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production of diamonds. This occurred when the <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} century BC, Theophrastus {{mentioned}} komakon, including it with cinnamon and cassia as an ingredient in aromatic confections. Guillaume Budé and Claudius Salmasius have identified komakon with cubeb, {{probably due to the}} resemblance which the word bears to the Javanese name of cubeb, kumukus. This is seen as a curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus. It is unlikely Greeks acquired them from somewhere else, since Javanese growers protected their <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> the trade by sterilizing the berries by scalding, ensuring that the vines were unable to be cultivated elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{economic}} foundations of Byzantium was trade, fostered by the maritime character of the Empire. Textiles must have been {{by far the most}} important item of export; silks were certainly imported into Egypt, and appeared also in Bulgaria, and the West. The state strictly controlled both the internal and the international trade, and retained the <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> issuing coinage, maintaining a durable and flexible monetary system adaptable to trade needs.|$|E
5|$|Though {{based on}} a technicality, the Blyew case set a {{precedent}} {{in state and federal}} courts that led to the erosion of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment powers. The Supreme Court continued along this path in the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), which upheld a state-sanctioned <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> white butchers. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the Colfax massacre and invalidate the Enforcement Act of 1870.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support his struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were critical to the defense of Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E

A case study of the pharmaceutical safety advocacy group, PharrnaWatch is presented to explain why and how they, along with other advocacy groups employ epistemological and political strategies to resist the dominance of pharmaceutical knowledge systems...|$|R
5|$|Beginning in the 1820s, a fur trading route {{developed}} between the Red River Colony (in modern Manitoba) and the trading posts in Minnesota, first primarily at Mendota and later at Saint Paul. The system of ox cart trails {{came to be}} known as the Red River Trails and was used principally by the Métis as a way to avoid the fur trade <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> the Hudson's Bay Company (which had absorbed the North West Company). Though this cross-border trade was entirely illegal and violated the policies of the Hudson's Bay Company, enforcement against the trade by American and British authorities was virtually non-existent. The trail system would reach its peak usage in the mid-19th century. The Hudson's Bay Company continued to expand its presence north of the U.S. border establishing new posts such as Fort Alexander and Rat Portage.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. By the fifteenth century, beginning in northern Italy, universities had become strongly influenced by Humanist thinking. This put an emphasis on classical authors, questioned some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifested itself in the teaching of new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language. In the fifteenth century university colleges had been founded at St John's College, St Andrews (1418) and St Salvator's College was added in 1450. Glasgow was founded in 1451 and King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. St Leonard's College was added at St. Andrews in 1511. Initially, they were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> administrative posts in government and law.|$|E

Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if only he had a <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E

5|$|In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{passed by}} the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, {{including}} Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about 20miles (30km) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabanné's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park {{in the area in}} 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development in the future.|$|E
5|$|Kiwi was {{acquired}} by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987. The Federal Trade Commission ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 {{to prevent it from}} becoming a monopoly. Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> Sara Lee in the shoe care industry. By the end of 2010, Sara Lee's Household & Body Care division (which included KIWI) {{was acquired}} by S.C.Johnson & Son.|$|E
5|$|Schools and {{hospitals}} are mentioned in records {{and these were}} built in the vicinity of temples. Marketplaces served as open air town halls where people gathered to discuss and ponder local issues. Choirs, whose main function was to sing devotional hymns, were maintained at temple expense. Young men were trained to sing in choirs in schools attached to monasteries such as Hindu Matha, Jain Palli and Buddhist Vihara. These institutions provided advanced education in religion and ethics and were well equipped with libraries (Saraswati Bhandara). Learning was imparted in the local language and in Sanskrit. Schools of higher learning were called Brahmapuri (or Ghatika or Agrahara). Teaching Sanskrit was a near <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> Brahmins who received royal endowments for their cause. Inscriptions record that the number of subjects taught varied from four to eighteen. The four most popular subjects with royal students were Economics (Vartta), Political Science (Dandaniti), Veda (trayi) and Philosophy (Anvikshiki), subjects that are mentioned as early as Kautilyas Arthashastra.|$|E
5000|$|Innis placed special {{emphasis}} on <b>monopolies</b> <b>of</b> knowledge {{that are based on}} the control of written media. [...] "We can conveniently divide the history of the West into the writing and printing periods," [...] he writes in Empire and Communications.|$|R
5000|$|When {{discussing}} the <b>monopolies</b> <b>of</b> knowledge, Innis focuses {{much of his}} concern on the United States, where he feared that mass-circulation newspapers and magazines along with privately owned broadcasting networks had undermined independent thought and local cultures and rendered audiences passive {{in the face of}} what he calls the [...] "vast <b>monopolies</b> <b>of</b> communication". James W. Carey notes that Innis worried about the centralized control of information and entertainment by advertising-driven media. [...] "The very existence of a commodity such as 'information' and an institution called 'media' make each other necessary," [...] Carey writes. [...] "More people spend more time dependent on the journalist, the publisher, and the program director. Every week they wait for Time magazine." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} plan under Naoki Hoshino and other Army planners envisioned a syndicalist economy, {{with the military}} allocating <b>monopolies</b> <b>of</b> one firm per industry.

5|$|The {{failure to}} renew the Licensing Act led to {{confusion}} and {{both positive and negative}} outcomes; while the government no longer played a part in censoring publications, and the <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> the Company over printing was broken, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} copyright was a binding legal concept without the legislation. Economic chaos also resulted; with the Company now unable to enforce any monopoly, provincial towns began establishing printing presses, producing cheaper books than the London booksellers. The absence of the censorship provisions also opened Britain up as a market for internationally printed books, which were similarly cheaper than those British printers could produce.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of its economy was sugar, grown on cane plantations worked by slaves. The {{sale of the}} crop in Britain enjoyed preferential terms. There were 2,571 declared slaves working on 68 plantations in Essequibo, and 1,648 slaves in Demerara in 1762. These numbers {{were known to be}} much understated, as the slave headcount was the basis of taxation. By 1769, there were 3,986 declared slaves for Essequibo's 92 plantations and 5,967 for Demerara's 206 plantations. The slave labour was in short supply and expensive due to the trading <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> the DWIC, and smuggling from Barbados was rife. Dutch colonists ensured white dominance over their growing slave population through the collaboration of indigenous natives, who strongly resisted white domination but could also be relied upon to take up arms against any Spanish incursions. When slaves rose up in Berbice in 1763, natives blocked the border to prevent the disruption from spreading into Demerara.|$|E
5|$|The socio-religious {{movements}} of the previous centuries, such as Lingayatism, provided momentum for flexible social norms to which women were expected to abide. By this time South Indian women had crossed most barriers and were actively involved in matters hitherto considered the <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> men, such as administration, business and trade, and involvement in the fine arts. Tirumalamba Devi who wrote Varadambika Parinayam and Gangadevi who wrote Madhuravijayam were among the notable women poets of the era. Early Telugu women poets like Tallapaka Timmakka and Atukuri Molla became popular during this period. The court of the Nayaks of Tanjore {{is known to have}} patronised several women poets. The Devadasi system existed, as well as legalised prostitution relegated to a few streets in each city. The popularity of harems amongst men of the royalty is well known from records.|$|E
