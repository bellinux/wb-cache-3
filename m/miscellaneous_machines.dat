40|$|Based on the {{specific}} demands from die- and toolmaking industries, 5 axis milling strategies ensuring high manufacturing accuracies must be realized. The machine development of the hexapod prototype is focused on homogenous inclination of the HSC spindle inside the workspace, suitable strut load characteristics, joints free of clearance and a special HSC control providing the necessary accuracies at high feed rates by compensation algorithms. Due to suitable tool positioning to the part and higher path speed values when milling sculptured surfaces, the hexapod prototype {{has a lot of}} advantages against <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|E

40|$|Coach 2 project {{investigated}} usability {{and effectiveness}} of Learning Analytics {{in a group of}} Bachelor courses in the area of Computer Science. An advanced architecture was developed and implemented, including a standalone Learning Record Store for data storage and easy access to <b>miscellaneous</b> data, <b>Machine</b> Learning techniques for determining relevant predictors, and a dashboard for informing learners. The overall approach was based on mirroring, the idea that learners see themselves operating {{in the context of their}} peers. The results were informative in terms of pro’s and con’s regarding the design and approach. The treatment showed tendencies, but finding statistical significant results turned out difficult. This paper reports on the Coach 2 project...|$|R
30|$|Tavakkoli-Moghaddam et al. (2012) {{presented}} a DCMS model {{to identify the}} family cell parts and machine cell. The purpose was to minimize the inter-cell movement and other <b>miscellaneous</b> costs. <b>Machine</b> replication, cell’s size, sequence of operations, and reconfiguration are considered as constraints of the model. Mehdizadeh and Rahimi (2016) proposed an integrated mathematical model to tackle the dynamic cell formation problem by simultaneous consideration of inter-/intra-cell layout problems with machine duplication and operator assignment. The presented mathematical formulation consists of three main objectives in which the first one aims to minimize the inter-/intra-cell part movements, the second objective minimizes machine and operator costs, {{and the last one}} increases consecutive forward flow ratio. Rabbania et al. (2017) {{presented a}} new dynamic cell formation problem, where some new concepts such as lucky parts were introduced. Lucky parts are parts which are allowed to be produced in a specific period. Moreover, purchasing and selling of machines taking into account their book values were taken into consideration.|$|R
5000|$|... the Messier {{industrial}} foundry, {{a subsidiary}} of Ventana Aerospace Group, employs approximately 200 people. The foundry produces alloys of magnesium-thorium intended for the aviation industry. The machining of these materials {{has resulted in the}} production of waste containing thorium. 13.3 tonnes of the residue of thorium-magnesium alloys (Grime from the foundry, shavings from <b>machining,</b> <b>miscellaneous</b> scrap, etc.) are stored in a special location with a radioactivity of 1.9 GBq from thorium-232. The company faces economic difficulties and has been placed in a Judicial Recovery procedure by the Commercial Court on the 1 April 2010. The Commercial Court of Pau approved exit from the Judicial recovery safeguard procedure proposed by management and the court administrators of the Messier foundry in July 2011. Messier Foundry is a prime contractor in the CARAIBE collaborative project approved by the Aerospace Valley Pôle de compétitivité group and funded by the Fonds unique interministériel (Unique inter-miniterial funds) programme.|$|R
