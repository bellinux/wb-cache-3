2500|$|For example, if a user had a $1,000 {{transaction}} and repaid it in full {{within this}} grace period, {{there would be}} no interest charged. If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, interest would be charged on the $1,000 from the date of purchase until the payment is received. The precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized {{on the back of the}} <b>monthly</b> <b>statement.</b> The general calculation formula most financial institutions use to determine the amount of interest to be charged is (APR/100 x ADB)/365 x number of days revolved. Take the annual percentage rate (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB). [...] Divide the result by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to interest charged back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as a residual retail finance charge (RRFC). Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive interest charges on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a charge for interest that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).|$|E

Before threatening to turn her into the police, Denise Hemphill (Niecy Nash) arrives before Hester appears where Grace announces that she is the Red Devil killer but she denies the allegations when her fake parents Clark and Delight (Steven Culp and Jean Louisa Kelly) arrive and prove that Hester was not adopted. Then, Libby's parents Mr and Mrs Putney (Wallace Langham and Lara Grice) appear and state that they are not Chanel #5's parents and that Libby was handed over to them by Gigi who encouraged them to enroll Libby into Wallace and encourage her to pledge Kappa House. It is revealed that Hester had a secret meeting with Chanel #5's parents. Chanel #5 is arrested before Hester stops Denise and states that she needs to arrest Chanel #3.
