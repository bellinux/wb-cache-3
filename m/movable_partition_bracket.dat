50|$|The game {{consists}} of a board, a <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> and <b>movable</b> pieces. Each player has eighteen men, three cannons, and one captain or king. The game board {{is divided into two}} parts by the <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> that is placed across the middle of the board. On each side of the partition, the board is divided into nine spaces, each of which corresponds to a similar space on the other side. The game is played by two persons; although three or four may participate.|$|R
50|$|The SACI Gallery was {{designed}} by Architect Paolo Bulletti and its renovation was made possible in part through a generous donation by artist Roger Phillips. The SACI Gallery is approximately 675 sq ft, has high vaulted ceilings, <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> walls, and is adjacent to our interior courtyard garden.|$|R
500|$|The {{so-called}} Akron Plan {{was adopted}} by Protestant churches throughout the United States and the world.

2500|$|In 1985 Innovative Electronic Designs (IED) {{introduced}} the circuit card frame-based auto mic mixing system featuring combine-separate function and programmable gain control (PGC) modules. Combine-separate functionality {{is useful for}} ballroom applications with <b>movable</b> <b>partitions</b> that permit portions or all of a room {{to be used for}} one program or multiple programs. PGC modules compensate individual mic channel gain for soft-spoken or loud presenters, by slightly boosting or cutting channel gain, respectively.|$|R
50|$|In a move {{to cater}} {{specifically}} to the business traveler, Braniff, Inc., created the Braniff Business Cabin concept that called for a <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> to be installed in the aircraft to divide up the two sections that would be installed on its aircraft. Business Cabin {{was placed in the}} front portion of the aircraft where all full Coach paying passenger will be seated. Braniff noted that it was not uncommon for a full Coach fare passenger to be seated next to a leisure passenger who might have paid 50 percent less or more for his fare. The leisure traveler was {{able to take advantage of}} 7 day advance fares or stay over a Saturday night which lowered their fare considerably. Braniff's Business Cabin eliminated this disenfranchisement of the full Coach fare paying passenger. Business Cabin service reflected the higher Coach fare that was paid by business travelers. With the <b>movable</b> <b>partition,</b> which was the first use of a movable bulkhead in the airline industry, allowed Braniff to adjust the sections of the aircraft to passenger loads and fare types.|$|R
50|$|The meeting {{house was}} built in 1760 from local {{sandstone}} and expanded in 1798. It is the second oldest extent Quaker meeting house in Burlington County. The original meeting house on the site was built in 1698 behind the current building. A <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> divides the older, eastern section from the newer section. During the Orthodox-Hicksite split, adherents of the Orthodox view met in the older section, while the Hicksites met in the newer section.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} built to a design from an {{architectural}} plan book with a single main room that could be divided by a <b>movable</b> <b>partition.</b> The one story building features a hipped roof and is entered from a closed porch that is topped by a bell tower. The original bell remains in place. The school housed about twenty students. The original privies remain, one each for boys and girls, about 15 ft from the main building.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{served as}} the town hall until 1946, after which it was used by New England College as a classroom facility. Inadequacies in its heating system precluded it from more than incidental uses, however. In the 1970s the town voted to restore the building for use as its town hall. The first floor meeting space was converted to office areas for municipal and court functions, but with <b>movable</b> <b>partitions</b> {{so as not to}} harm the historic fabric of the building.|$|R

We compute the Casimir force on the piston in the limit L -> infinity. Regardless the value of a/b, the piston is attracted to the nearest end of the box. Asymptotic expressions for the Casimir force on the piston are derived for a b and a b...|$|R
25|$|Another ongoing major {{development}} is the change from a ward-based system (where patients are accommodated in communal rooms, separated by <b>movable</b> <b>partitions)</b> to one {{in which they are}} accommodated in individual rooms. The ward-based system has been described as very efficient, especially for the medical staff, but is considered to be more stressful for patients and detrimental to their privacy. A major constraint on providing all patients with their own rooms is however found in the higher cost of building and operating such a hospital; this causes some hospitals to charge for private rooms.|$|R
50|$|The school's {{original}} architecture was unique: {{the building}} was circular, and class areas were divided by <b>movable</b> <b>partitions,</b> {{an attempt to make}} the school easily adaptable to changing needs. More recently, some classrooms have been reconstructed with permanent walls and closing doors. Westmont High School did not have windows in its classrooms until they were recently installed before the 2012-2013 school year. Some of the adaptable rooms do not have walls. Sound echoes very well throughout the building, so the faculty has great control of the student body.|$|R

50|$|The north {{wing of the}} {{building}} complex holds administrative offices, a custodian’s apartment, and originally a library which was intended {{at the time of}} the church consecration and has since been converted into a museum organized by the St. Sava Historical Society. The lower level of the north wing houses the Sunday School classrooms. The south wing was originally designed to house classrooms with <b>movable</b> <b>partitions</b> when the church was built, but has since been converted into a small hall with built-in kitchen and bar facilities available for rental known as the South Wing Social Center.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} school year, 1966-1967, {{first and}} second year education was offered but still St. William’s remained as an annex of Saint Theresita’s School Tabuk. A <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> was put up in the chapel {{so that it could}} accommodate the first and the second years. It was during this school year when a four-room building was constructed in preparation for the incoming school year. Meanwhile, negotiations were being made with the Department of Education for the release of a permit to offer first to third year education {{and at the same time}} for the school to stand as an independent school.|$|R
5000|$|The Cliff May Experimental House {{was built}} by Cliff May in the early 1950s as his family's fourth house and {{developed}} to push his ideas of [...] "bringing the outdoors in" [...] and open interior planning. The one-story, 1800-sf house is a simple rectangle in plan with a 288-square foot open skylight in the center. May's family of five created different rooms by using <b>movable</b> <b>partitions.</b> The family resided in the home for two years, while May determined how the sizeable skylight and open plan functioned for the residents there. From this experience, the home [...] "Mandalay" [...] was designed by May, which became the last home for his family.|$|R
2500|$|The {{so-called}} Akron Plan {{was adopted}} by Protestant churches throughout the United States and the world, particularly after 1872, when the Fifth National Sunday-School Convention adopted the Uniform Lesson Plan. [...] A 1911 American publication stated that [...] "This plan for the Sunday-school building has been almost universally adopted in this country", and a 1914 publication stated that of the churches built in the preceding fifty years, three-quarters of those that made provisions for Sunday schools had used some version of the Akron Plan. [...] Many of these churches modified the design {{with the addition of}} a <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> between the sanctuary and the Sunday-school spaces, allowing the Sunday-school classes and the main body of congregants to be separated or united.|$|R
50|$|Valk {{designed}} the structure in a Bungalow/Craftsman and Rustic style that was {{popular in the}} early twentieth century. The structure is 35 × 72 ft (11 × 22 m) and constructed of local field stone with timber accents. It sits on a sloped site with the sanctuary on the main level above a basement. A gabled vestibule dominates the center of the south façade and houses the primary entry. The tower rises from the roof of the vestiblue and is capped with a stepped parapet. Three large stained glass windows with arched tops dominate the east wall of the sanctuary which features a post and beam ceiling. When constructed, the main level contained a <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> allowing the space to accommodate worship services and Sunday school.|$|R

50|$|The Amesbury Friends Meetinghouse {{is located}} west of {{downtown}} Amesbury, {{on the south}} side of Friend Street, at the southwest corner of its junction with Greenleaf Street. It is a simple 1-1/2 story wood frame building, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows flanking a center entrance, and a smaller window in the gable above. The building sides each have three windows. The interior has a vestibule spanning the building width, leading to the main chamber, with a gallery above. The main chamber has <b>movable</b> <b>partitions,</b> which can be raised and lowered by means of pulleys. These facilitate both the conduct of services by the entire congregation, and the conduct of business meetings, which were historically segregated by sex.|$|R
500|$|The {{building}} {{is considered a}} fine example of traditional Quaker architecture because it contains all of the elements found in the typical meeting house. However, the building does have one major difference on its interior when compared with most meeting houses. Traditionally, Quaker meeting houses had two rooms, divided by a <b>movable</b> <b>partition,</b> termed [...] "shutters," [...] meant to separate men from women during meetings; these shutters are noticeably absent on the Benjaminville Meeting House. The members of the meeting at the Benjaminville Meeting House were among [...] "pioneers" [...] within the Society of Friends in that they were one of the first seven groups to allow men and women to meet as one group of Friends. The room inside the Benjaminville building was simply divided with a waist-high partition as opposed to the movable wall.|$|R
2500|$|... "Theseus", {{created in}} 1950, was a {{magnetic}} mouse controlled by an electromechanical relay circuit that enabled it {{to move around}} a labyrinth of 25 squares. Its dimensions {{were the same as}} those of an average mouse. The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging <b>movable</b> <b>partitions.</b> The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior. Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.|$|R
50|$|The Main Terminal {{is divided}} in two sections: the Domestic Terminal and the International Terminal. The {{majority}} of flights operate at the Main Terminal. The two sections are connected both pre-security and post-security; however, the US border preclearance area is separated off using <b>movable</b> glass <b>partitions</b> {{which can be}} adjusted based on the arrangement of swing gates between concourses D and E.|$|R
2500|$|The current synagogue {{building}} at 53 Lois Street {{was completed in}} 2003.

50|$|In 1852, a new indoor gym (link=no) {{was opened}} for use classes {{of boys and}} girls from various schools. It {{contained}} a hall one hundred by sixty feet which could be changed into two rooms by means of a <b>movable</b> <b>partition.</b> It was surrounded by a double Turnplatz and was the first building of the kind in Germany. Public exhibitions the next year and again in 1855 acquainted parents, teachers, the grand ducal family, and the state and city authorities with the nature of his work. In the summer of 1855, failing health compelled Spiess to interrupt his hitherto unceasing activity. Tuberculosis had developed in a lung wounded by a sword thrust during his student days as a second to a duel. Attempts to stop its progress by residence in the Taunus and for two years at Vevey, on Lake Geneva, proved unavailing. He returned to Darmstadt, visiting the Turnhaus there for the last time in the fall of 1857, and died the following year.|$|R
5000|$|A {{plot of land}} on South 12th Street - 142 ft by 134 ft (43.3 m by 40.8 m) - was {{purchased}} in 1810 for $11,000. Carpenter John D. Smith dismantled the old building. Its roof trusses, which dictated {{the width of the}} new building, were unpegged and transported in pieces. Other architectural elements such as windows, doors and columns were salvaged and reused. The new building was longer than the old - 91 ft (27.6 m), rather than 57 ft (17.4 m). Smith built two additional roof trusses of tulip poplar, and increased the spacing between all of them. The two-story main meeting room replicated the dimensions of the Great Meeting House's interior, and {{at least some of the}} old benches were reused. [...] The building's extension contained a one-story women's meeting room, separated by a <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> from the main meeting room, and a second floor room. Construction of the Twelfth Street Meeting House was completed in April 1813, at a cost of $21,410.46.|$|R
