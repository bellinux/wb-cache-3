5|$|If {{a player}} <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> pawn to its eighth rank, it cannot be {{substituted}} for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it. However, the move is not complete until the promoted piece is released on that square.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, Britain and France {{declared}} war on Germany following the German invasion of Poland. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council decided {{to stay on the}} defensive along the border, relying on the Maginot Line in helping counter an anticipated German offensive across the German-French border. As neither side made any offensive <b>moves,</b> <b>a</b> Drôle de Guerre (Phoney War) developed as both sides stood-off along the border.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} a tension gauge, {{increasing}} when a character causes damage or moves toward an adversary and decreasing when a character moves backwards or is {{stopped for a}} long time. When the gauge is half-charged a player can use specials called Overdrive Attacks, which cause more damage than regular <b>moves.</b> <b>A</b> full gauge allows a player to make an Instant Kill, defeating an opponent regardless of health; if an Instant Kill is unsuccessful, the tension gauge will not charge {{for the remainder of}} that round.|$|E

5|$|Most of the ATP {{synthesized}} in the mitochondria will be {{used for}} cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains an antiporter, the ADP/ATP translocase, which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space. This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|On this planet, {{magic and}} {{witchcraft}} are quite normal. The Megans are an ageless species that had, at one time, lived on Earth, and {{were responsible for}} the legends about witches. During this time, the Enterprise crew begin to experiment with magic: Lt. Hikaru Sulu (voiced by George Takei) conjures up a beautiful woman while Science Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) telepathically <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> Vulcan chess piece. Lucien, their guide, warns the crew that their experiments would draw unwanted attention, but it is too late. The Enterprise splits into two halves and disappears, and the crew are transported to a location on the planet that appears to be Salem during the middle of a witch trial in 1691.|$|E
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5000|$|When part of <b>a</b> {{group is}} <b>moved</b> (<b>a</b> subgroup), it must move {{along the line}} which defines it. It may <b>move</b> <b>a</b> number of spaces equal {{to the number of}} pieces in the subgroup.|$|R

5|$|A {{paramedic}} is let into a {{house to}} the sounds of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a party for the 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat—a practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)—by hiding under the cake. Maggie, Carol and Pat—the latter wearing a wolf mask—arrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge—something Jim had asked Angela to prevent—and secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a sunscreen bottle while ostensibly unblocking the toilet after her mother could not flush it. Angela is proud that the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the food on the table, and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake—under which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out the candles. The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{original}} Rome: Total War, Europa Barbarorums strategic campaign sees the player take control of a particular faction and then compete for territory and resources against all the other factions, which are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The player is presented with a map of Europe, North Africa and the Near East in which territory is divided into 200 provinces, each of which contains a province capital, which will at any given point be controlled either by the player's faction, a rival playable faction, or the non-playable Eleutheroi faction, which represents the world's minor kingdoms, regional powers and rebel states. If a faction should at any point find itself not in control of any provinces, it is eliminated from the game. Gameplay is turn-based, each turn representing the passage of three months on the campaign map (unlike the six months of {{the original}} Rome: Total War) and alternating between the player managing their empire and the artificial intelligence making all the other factions' <b>moves.</b> <b>A</b> key game mechanic of the campaign map is the annexation of territory, which is done province-by-province, either by successfully besieging the province capital, or by acquiring it from another faction through diplomacy. Once a faction has acquired a province, they may construct buildings in the province capital which either enable the recruitment of certain military units or grant various bonuses to the city such as greater resilience during a siege or a decreased likelihood of the province rebelling. Provided the city contains the appropriate buildings, the player may recruit military units in the city {{at the same time as}} undertaking construction projects. The aim of the game is to acquire a specified number of provinces and/or eliminate specified rival factions (in Europa Barbarorum particular victory conditions differ for each faction), whilst avoiding being eliminated by the other factions.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Heather Brooks dies in {{the premier}} of season ten. She goes {{to search for}} Dr. Webber and finds him lying in the {{basement}} of the hospital. Trying to save Dr. Webber, she accidentally steps into a puddle and electrocutes herself while hitting her head as she falls. Bailey <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> cancer patient in Webber's room to force some perspective and make him take the treatment. Also introduced in the tenth season was Dr. Karev's estranged father Jimmy Evans (James Remar) who tries to form a relationship with his son but fails repeatedly and ultimately dies in a botched surgery. The conclusion of season 10 has Cristina leaving Grey Sloan for Dr. Burke's job overseas while Dr. Ross makes a last-minute decision to follow her in order to study under her. Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) unknowingly drops a bombshell that she is the adopted love child of Dr. Webber and the late Dr. Grey, which makes for yet another half sister of Dr. Meredith Grey. Also, Dr. Yang leaves her seat on the board to Dr. Karev while Dr. Webber all but promises the seat to Dr. Bailey. Introduced in season eleven is Dr. Nicole Herman (Geena Davis), who is Chief of Fetal Surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial. Dr. Herman mentors Arizona Robbins in a fetal surgery fellowship, and plays in a twelve episode arc before departing after episode fourteen.|$|E

25|$|The Pensions Act 2008 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The {{principal}} change {{brought about}} by the Act is that all workers will have to opt out of an occupational pension plan of their employer, rather than opt in.

25|$|BITS {{includes}} a built-in mechanism for error handling and recovery attempts. Errors {{can be either}} fatal or transient; either <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> job to the respective state. A transient error is a temporary error that resolves itself after some time. For a transient error, BITS waits {{for some time and}} then retries. For fatal errors, BITS transfers control of the job to the creating application, with as much information regarding the error as it can provide.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{sieve shakers}} {{work with an}} {{electro-magnetic}} drive which <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> spring-mass system and transfers the resulting oscillation to the sieve stack. Amplitude and sieving time are set digitally and are continuously observed by an integrated control-unit. Therefore, sieving results are reproducible and precise (an important precondition for a significant analysis). Adjustment of parameters like amplitude and sieving time serves to optimize the sieving for different types of material. This method {{is the most common}} in the laboratory sector.|$|E
5000|$|To {{keep the}} game from ending in a draw due to copycat <b>moves,</b> there is <b>an</b> {{additional}} rule: no player may <b>move</b> <b>a</b> piece onto their opponent's home row if that <b>move</b> creates <b>a</b> pattern of left-to-right symmetry on the board.|$|R

However, in the first generation games, the game does not reduce the PP of Pokémon controlled by non-player trainers, enabling those trainers to use powerful <b>moves</b> <b>an</b> abnormal number of times.|$|R
25|$|The {{length of}} a vacancy chain {{is the number of}} <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> vacancy makes after its {{entrance}} into a system, and this includes the terminal move to the absorbing state. Longer chains and more costly resource units generate greater benefits,while shorter chains and less costly units generate smaller benefits, for the individuals and institutions involved. Vacancy chains have patterned effects upon other individuals and, in the human case, institutions connected to the primary individuals actually getting resources in the chains.|$|E
25|$|Hohmann {{transfer}} orbit: An orbit that <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> spacecraft {{from one}} approximately circular orbit, usually {{the orbit of}} a planet, to another, using two engine impulses. The perihelion of the transfer orbit {{is at the same}} distance from the Sun as the radius of one planet's orbit, and the aphelion is at the other. The two rocket burns change the spacecraft's path from one circular orbit to the transfer orbit, and later to the other circular orbit. This maneuver was named after Walter Hohmann.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{following}} mostly linear paths inside predefined missions as in Star Fox 1, the player <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> team of two ships freely around a map screen {{that represents the}} Lylat system. When the player's ships make contact with enemy forces, the game switches to an action perspective, piloting the Arwing ship directly with controls and game play similar to the first Star Fox.
