50|$|Despite these ontological and {{epistemological}} differences, Shaw and Hesse (2010, 207) {{have argued}} that <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> geography represent points on a continuum rather than incompatible extremes. Indeed, traditional transport geography has not been wholly quantitative any more than mobilities is wholly qualitative. Sociological explorations of mobility can incorporate empirical techniques, while model-based inquiries can be tempered with richer understandings of the meanings, representations and assumptions inherently embedded in models.|$|R

40|$|Time-geography has by some feminist {{scholars}} {{been accused}} not taking gender relation, domination or power in consideration when analyzing {{the use of}} time and space. In this paper we argue that time-geography provides a useful set of analytical tools which successfully collaborate with social science theory as feminist studies. In a project called “Re-reading time-geography from a feminist perspective”, labour force mobility is, specially commuting, one important issue, for analysing women’s time-space use and identify what constraints might be found in organizing every-day life. We put emphasis on that time-geography might provide feminist studies with a close, empathic and micro-levelled interventional approach {{in order to make}} obstacles and constraint visible and thereby changeable. This paper is based on previous and ongoing research on commuting <b>and</b> <b>transport.</b> We hope to prove why time-geography should be reconsidered as an approach with several sets of useful methods to describe and analyse women’s every-day life’s struggles and possibilities in times when <b>mobility</b> <b>and</b> <b>transports</b> has become an undisputed factor of everyday life...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original investigation method {{to highlight the}} differences of <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> mechanisms of charge carriers in organic materials solar cells. Two types of polymer: fullerene solar cells were investigated: ITO/ PEDOT:PSS/P 3 HT:PCBM /Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PCBM/Al. The I–V characteristics were done under standard illumination (1000  W/m 2) using a mask placed at different distances from the collecting cathode position. The influence of {{the distance between the}} irradiation area and the position of the collecting electrode on the performances of solar cells was studied. It has been observed that the short-circuit current and the open-circuit voltage considerably increase with the decrease of the distance between the cathode and the irradiation area. This study method gives also the opportunity to find the suitable collecting grid layout (distance between electrodes) depending {{on the nature of the}} organic materials. Moreover it can also explain the differences observed between the reported values in literature for the conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells...|$|R
