I argue that, {{as a result of these}} problems, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> should be rejected and replaced with an alternative account, which also analyses intrinsicality in terms of perfect naturalness, but which avoids these problems...|$|R

40|$|Galen Strawson has {{articulated}} {{a spectrum}} of 2 ̆ 7 temporal temperaments 2 ̆ 7 populated at one end by 2 ̆ 7 Diachronics, 2 ̆ 7 who experience their selves (understood as a 2 ̆ 7 present mental entity 2 ̆ 7) as persisting across time, and {{at the other end}} by 2 ̆ 7 Episodics 2 ̆ 7, who lack this sense of temporal extension. Strawson provides lucid descriptions of Episodic self-experience, and further argues that nothing normatively significant depends upon Diachronicity. Thus, neither temperament is inherently preferable. However, this last claim requires a non-reductive phenomenology of Diachronicity that Strawson does not supply. I offer Kierkegaard 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> of 2 ̆ 7 contemporaneity 2 ̆ 7 as a candidate for this missing phenomenology of Diachronic self-experience. Kierkegaard offers a compelling description of Diachronic self-experience that offers more parsimonious explanations for certain puzzling features of Episodicity than Strawson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> does. Yet Kierkegaard 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> is irreducibly normative in character; if Strawsonians reject this account of Diachronicity, they must either provide another, normatively-neutral one, or abandon neutrality between Episodicity and Diachronicity...|$|R

U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals</b> were placed in each federal judicial district and were given broad authority to support the federal courts and to carry out all lawful orders issued by judges, Congress, and the President. Early duties of U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals</b> included taking the census, distributing presidential proclamations, protecting the borders, and making arrests. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, some responsibilities of U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals</b> were transferred to newly created federal agencies, including the U. S. Census Bureau, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and Federal Bureau of Investigation. Today, the primary responsibilities of U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals</b> include protecting federal judges and witnesses, transporting federal prisoners, apprehending federal fugitives, and managing assets seized from criminal enterprises. We obtained information on the (1) U. S. Marshals' appointment process and, for comparison, the processes used by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF); Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) to select senior field supervisors; (2) experience, education and diversity of U.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Federal law does not mandate specific qualifications for individuals appointed as U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals.</b> However, Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 states that U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals</b> should possess certain minimum characteristics in order to serve. The suggested characteristics are (1) a minimum of 4 years of command-level law enforcement management duties, including personnel, budget, and accountable property issues, in a police department, sheriff's office, or federal law enforcement agency; (2) experience in coordinating with other law enforcement agencies, particularly {{at the state and}} local levels; (3) college-level academic experience; and (4) experience in or with county, state, and federal court systems or experience with protection of court personnel, jurors, and witnesses. In contrast to the appointment process for U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals,</b> the senior field supervisors of other federal law enforcement agencies with comparable duties and responsibilities are selected under competitive, merit-based promotion criteria outlined in Title 5 of the U. S. Code. These individuals are required to apply and compete for these positions and meet any identified minimum standards. Minimum qualifications used to select senior field supervisors at some of the federal law enforcement agencies vary, but all require prior supervisory law enforcement experience. In April 2003, we reported on the appointment and qualifications of U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals</b> at which time there were no statutory provisions on the suggested minimum characteristics of U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals.</b> We also reported that while the average length of overall law enforcement experience of U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals</b> was not significantly different than that of senior field supervisors at the three selected federal law enforcement agencies, the level of government (federal, state, local, or county level) from which the experience was obtained differed. With passage of the act, Congress requested that we address the following questions (1) To what extent do the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Marshals</b> possess the four suggested minimum characteristics included in Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 ? (2) To what extent are the U. S. Marshals' experience, education, race, and gender comparable to those of senior field supervisors in other federal law enforcement agencies?...|$|R
