50|$|In 1827, the French chemists Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Colin began {{producing}} garancine, the concentrated {{version of}} natural <b>madder.</b> They then found that <b>madder</b> lake contained two colorants, the red alizarin {{and the more}} rapidly fading purpurin.

Purpurin fluoresces yellow to red under ultraviolet light, while synthetic alizarin slightly shows violet.
