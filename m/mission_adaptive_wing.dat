Also analyzed the possibility of using <b>adaptive</b> <b>wing</b> of this type in the construction of small UAVs.

A 2 -D airfoil analysis approach was adopted, associated with an idealized variable camber mechanism based on elastic deformation and surface extension. Using a direct function optimization program coupled to a viscous-inviscid airfoil analysis routine, optimized variable camber configurations were obtained for several weight conditions of a typical transport aircraft along a sub-critical cruise mission leg. Independent runs were executed considering only trailing and both leading and trailing-edge camber variation and, for each of them, an integrated range parameter has been obtained, proportional to the maximum possible aircraft range. Results indicate that the range increases up to 7. 03 % over the base airfoil that could be reached with camber variation in the trailing edge region only, and up to 24. 6 % when leading edge adaptation was considered simultaneously. However, pressure distribution results indicate that the high leading-edge curvatures required for that would probably decrease cruise critical Mach.

40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{conducted}} using the advanced fighter technology integration F- 111 (AFTI/F- 111) aircraft modified with a variable-sweep supercritical <b>mission</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>wing</b> (MAW). The MAW leading- and trailing-edge variable-camber surfaces were deflected in flight to provide a near-ideal wing camber shape for the flight condition. The MAW features smooth, flexible upper surfaces and fully enclosed lower surfaces, which distinguishes it from conventional flaps that have discontinuous surfaces and exposed or semi-exposed mechanisms. Upper and lower surface wing pressure distributions were measured along four streamwise rows on the right wing for cruise, maneuvering, and landing configurations. Boundary-layer measurements were obtained near the trailing edge {{for one of the}} rows. Cruise and maneuvering wing leading-edge sweeps were 26 deg for Mach numbers less than 1 and 45 deg or 58 deg for Mach numbers greater than 1. The landing wing sweep was 9 deg or 16 deg.

40|$|With {{stronger}} {{requirements on}} ecological and economical aircraft, improvements in highly competitive areas like operational flexibility and costs, flight performance, development potential for stretched aircraft variants and environmental attributes {{are getting more}} importance. From take-off to touch-down an aircraft is exposed to changing flight conditions by variations in flight altitude, speed and aircraft weight. For maintaining the optimum lift-over-drag ratio, {{which is the most}} important aerodynamic wing characteristic for cruise conditions, the wing profile has to be adapted accordingly. Methods to achieve this are variable camber by increased flap functionality and shock reduction by an adaptive contour (bump) in the shock area. Therefore the object-in-view of the DLR <b>ADAPTIVE</b> <b>WING</b> PROJECT is the realization of a high grade <b>adaptive</b> <b>wing</b> concept for minimization of wing drag and -load with the milestones: - Development and test of methods for influencing subsonic/transonic flows by shock/boundary layer control and variable airfoil shape. - Quantification of aerodynamic/aeroelastic effects of adaptive flaps and profile contour ("bump") for transonic profiles. - Realization of adaptive flaps for variable camber and adaptive bump for shock control by use of multifunctional materials, lightweight structures, integrated actuators/sensors and active/adaptive control. The conclusive test of the aerodynamic, aeroelastic and structural concepts being developed will be the functional concepts capabilities verification on a flight demonstrator at around the year 2005 / 2006.

An <b>adaptive</b> <b>wing</b> was constructed with a base profile of a NACA 4415 airfoil to house an array of unimorph piezoelectric actuators, wrapped with a layer of smooth rubber latex. This flow control method has been investigated across a range of steady and actuation frequencies of order f+ = O(1), angle of attack between α = 0 ◦ and α = 24 ◦, and at Re of 2. 5 · 104, 5. 0 · 104, 7. 5 · 104, and 1. 0 · 105. Several experimental and computational techniques have been used for investigation. First, a laser displacement sensor system is used to characterize the oscillation of the upper surface. There is a phase lag between the input signal and the surface response of 15 ◦ to 90 ◦ for the frequencies that are investigated. Then, flow field data is obtained using PIV. Next, lift and drag are measured using a force balance. Lastly, numerical simulation is performed. Phase-locked PIV reveals that a cross-stream vortex is formed by the upward motion of the surface, and the vortex advects downstream.
