5000|$|With {{regard to}} the {{occurrence}} of the mineralizations in W and Sn in Portugal, the [...] "Província metalogenética estano-tungstífera Ibérica”(Iberian tin-tungsten-metallographic province) extends {{to the east of}} the shear Porto-Coimbra-Tomar and to the northeast of the Juromenha thrust. With the exception of the deposits linked to the granite of St.ª Eulália (ZOM - Zona de Ossa Morena - Ossa Morena Zone), the remainder are located in the Zona Centro-Iberica (Central-Iberian Zone) (ZCI), Zona Galiza Média-Trás-os-Montes (ZGMTM) and Zona Asútrico-Ocidental-Leonesa (Astúrico-occidental-leonesa zone) (ZAOL). The Portuguese tin-tungsten <b>metallographic</b> <b>province</b> develops throughout the central and northern region of Portugal where the vein deposits are undoubtedly of greater economic importance.The ZGMTM and ZCI are essentially differentiated by the occurrence of thrust of allochthonous and parauthoctone character in the ZGMTM. Most of the outcropping rocks are granite and schist of the Schist Greywacke Complex http://repositorio.lneg.pt/bitstream/10400.9/2616/1/30538.pdf. To a lesser extent are Pre-Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian rocks.The distribution of hydrothermal mineralization hydrothermal mineralization of tin and wolfram is extensive and follows, in addition to the parallel alignments of the Variscan Variscan structuring, to the location of Variscan granitic outcrops or generally found in contact metamorphism halo reflecting the presence of granites at small depth (Panasqueira, Argemela, Gois, Borralha, Vale das Gatas, Ribeira, Argozelo, amongst others).Mineralization occurs both in the contact zone of intrusive granites and metasediments, as over the contact zone of intrusive granites in other older granites.The main occurrences of W and Sn are conditioned by structures inherited from early and late Variscan shears or fractures related to the installation of post-tectonic granites.|$|E

But little study of ore-forming {{material}} source {{has been made in}} Jilongshan Au-Cu deposit. Therefore, we discussed the ore-forming material source by analyzing 15 lead geochemistry samples collected in Jilongshan deposit. The ranges of the Pb isotopic compositions are from 17. 358 to 18. 589 fo...|$|E
