25|$|Suddenly the {{character}} of a Savior was vividly impressed upon my mind. It seemed {{that there might be a}} Being so good and compassionate as to Himself atone for our transgressions, and thereby save us from suffering the penalty of sin. I immediately felt how lovely such a Being must be; and imagined that I could cast <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> arms of, and trust in the mercy of, such a One.|$|E
500|$|Corey Burton as Gaëtan [...] "Mole" [...] Molière, a French {{geologist}} who {{acts like}} a mole. Burton mentioned that finding his performance as Mole was by allowing the character to [...] "leap out" [...] of him while making funny voices. To get into character during his recording sessions, he stated that he would [...] "throw <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> scene and feel like I'm in this make-believe world".|$|E
500|$|Almost a {{year after}} filming her final scenes, Lister {{explained}} that she felt her exit was the right choice, saying: [...] "It felt {{it was time to}} go so I just ran with my instincts. Looking back, I was nervous but now I know I've done the right thing. I love theatre work. It gives me such a buzz. [...] was the break I'd been praying for. I threw <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> part and enjoyed every minute of it. I had three superb years and it was brilliant." ...|$|E

60|$|This from George, and I found <b>myself</b> looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> muzzle of his {{revolver}}--of {{the revolver}} he dared {{to use on}} me, but was too cowardly to use on the prisoners.|$|R
500|$|Kills {{discussed}} Perfectionist during 2013 interviews. She {{revealed that}} after having lived a deplorable life in London, her ambitions and dreams influenced the album's lyrics. [...] "I {{was not as}} aware of... how I was", she stated. [...] "I almost {{had a bit of}} fear where everybody wants to be loved, everybody wants to be understood in a way that's not full of judgment or blame. So I put all of <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> album and then [...] bits out." [...] That year, Corner hailed Perfectionist as [...] "one of the most underrated pop collections in recent memory", and Idolator's Sam Lansky opined that although it had [...] "killer" [...] choruses, the album suffered from excessive similarities to other artists.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1919, while {{recovering}} from a serious pulmonary condition, Cardus took up a suggestion from his news editor, William Percival Crozier, that he should watch some cricket at Old Trafford and, if he felt able, write reports on a few matches. On 19 May 1919 Cardus went to {{the first day of}} Lancashire's match with Derbyshire. His first published cricket report, on the following day, showed little sign of his later characteristic style: [...] "I simply had no intention of writing on cricket for any length of time; this was a spare-time affair... and I fitted <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> idioms and procedures of the sporting writers of 1919". Scott nonetheless saw a potential, and from the beginning of 1920 Cardus became the paper's regular cricket correspondent, under the by-line [...] "Cricketer", a position he held for 20 years.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was filmed in Los Angeles and {{directed}} by Wendy Morgan, who Roberts described as [...] "focused and passionate". The singer continued to say that because of this, she felt comfortable with her immediately. The music video and production was featured on the Through Nicola's Eyes webisodes, in which Roberts stated that she found {{the production of the}} music video very stressful. Talking about the experience in an interview with MTV News, Roberts stated that [...] "I'm nervous and I'm dreading the night before... I know I'm going to be like losing half a stone in weight overnight, so I'm {{going to have to get}} <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> zone." [...] Roberts attributed her stress on the set of the video to her time with Girls Aloud, as she had always recorded music videos with four other members; this was the first time she had performed on her own. This meant that critical responses would only be aimed only at her. During the video shoot, Roberts further discussed the anxiety of a solo career claiming pressure from Morgan was making her feel uncomfortable. During the production, Roberts feared that feeling uncomfortable whilst shooting could have an overall negative effect on the video, explaining [...] "You've got to be strong and be professional and get through it, obviously enjoy it, but if you feel uncomfortable, you can't look uncomfortable otherwise it's not going to work".|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a touch at my elbow. I turned, and found <b>myself</b> looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> humorous, masterful eyes of the tall, thin man who had volunteered to be my {{companion}} on this strange quest.|$|R
60|$|I put <b>myself</b> unreservedly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{hands of}} one of the white chappies. He was a {{friendly}} soul, and I told him the whole state of affairs. I asked him what he thought would meet the case.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Croydon," [...] I said, [...] "I am {{now about}} to {{ascertain}} our longitude. To do this I must lower <b>myself</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea. Pray {{do not be}} alarmed or anxious. I shall soon be back." ...|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, Binchy told The Irish Times: [...] "I don't {{have any regrets}} about any roads I didn't take. Everything went well, and I think that's been a help because I can look back, and I do get great {{pleasure}} out of looking back... I've been very lucky and I have a happy old age with good family and friends still around." [...] Just before dying, she read her latest short story at the Dalkey Book Festival. She once said {{she would like to}} die [...] "...on my 100th birthday, piloting Gordon and <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> side of a mountain".|$|E
60|$|Then I {{squeezed}} <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> closet, crouching {{down into}} one corner, behind several canes and umbrellas.|$|E
60|$|I ran hurriedly, excitedly, {{into the}} cabin, {{throwing}} <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> old fellow's arms much as though welcoming {{him from the}} grave.|$|E

[...] "I would prefer paying <b>the</b> port-charges <b>myself,</b> run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> handiest French port, {{and let the}} honest fellow escape!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It must be all {{happiness}} here, Ponto,' said I, flinging <b>myself</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> snug BERGERE, and inhaling such {{a delicious}} draught of country air {{as all the}} MILLEFLEURS of Mr. Atkinson's shop cannot impart to any the most expensive pocket-handkerchief.|$|R
5000|$|French mash-up bootlegging artist ToToM used Dylan's {{original}} version with the <b>The</b> Rapture's Get <b>Myself</b> <b>Into</b> It in <b>the</b> mash-up song Rapture (Let Me Follow You Down) for his 2009 album, Dylan Mashed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I put it <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pillar letter-box." [...] Then Lady Cantrip {{felt that}} she had to deal with a very self-willed young lady indeed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never," [...] cried Suzanne. [...] "Together we {{will live}} or die. Mount, I say--mount. Nay, if you refuse I will throw <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water before your eyes." ...|$|E
60|$|SHEMUS. And {{if there}} is, I'd rather trust <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hands That can pay money down {{than to the}} hands That have but shaken famine from the bag.|$|E
60|$|A servant held my stirrup, and I swung <b>myself</b> up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> saddle, {{with which}} I was but indifferently acquainted. Then Arcolano mounted too, puffing over the effort, {{for he was}} a corpulent, rubicund man with the fattest hands I have ever seen.|$|R
60|$|The {{letter was}} written and given into my hands. I <b>myself</b> put it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> post-box {{in the village}} that evening.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, as to system," [...] I observed, [...] "I {{could never}} bring <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> {{anything}} of <b>the</b> kind. I {{thought it best}} to let my genius take it own course, as it always acted the most vigorously when stimulated by inclination." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes,--there's a brother; but Wharton {{has enough}} for two; {{and if he}} were to put either out of his will it wouldn't be my wife.

60|$|On {{entering}} the room I had retired into a corner, fearing that I should find none there whom I knew; but someone plucked at my arm, and turning round I found <b>myself</b> looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> yellow inscrutable face of my uncle Bernac.
