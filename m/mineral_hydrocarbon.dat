40|$|Mineral {{hydrocarbons}} {{consist of}} two fractions, mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH) and mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH). MOAH {{is a potential}} public health hazard because it may include carcinogenic polycyclic compounds. In the present study, 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was introduced, {{in the context of}} official controls, to measure MOSH and MOAH in raw materials or pure <b>mineral</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> final products (cosmetics and medicinal products). Quantitative determination (qNMR) has been established using the ERETIC methodology (electronic reference to access in vivo concentrations) based on the PULCON principle (pulse length based concentration determination). Various mineral hydrocarbons (e. g., white oils, paraffins or petroleum jelly) were dissolved in deuterated chloroform. The ERETIC factor was established using a quantification reference sample containing ethylbenzene and tetrachloronitrobenzene. The following spectral regions were integrated: MOSH δ 3. 0 – 0. 2 ppm and MOAH δ 9. 2 - 6. 5, excluding solvent signals. Validation showed a sufficient precision of the method with a coefficient of variation < 6 % and a limit of detection < 0. 1 g/ 100 g. The applicability of the method was proven by analysing 27 authentic samples with MOSH and MOAH contents in the range of 90 - 109 g/ 100 g and 0. 02 - 1. 10 g/ 100  g, respectively. It is important to distinguish this new NMR-approach from the hyphenated liquid chromatography-gas chromatography methodology previously used to characterize MOSH/MOAH amounts in cosmetic products. For <b>mineral</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> raw materials or pure mineral hydrocarbon-based cosmetic products, NMR delivers higher specificity without any sample preparation besides dilution. Our sample survey shows that previous methods may have overestimated the MOAH amount in mineral oil products and opens new paths to characterize this fraction. Therefore, the developed method can be applied for routine monitoring of consumer products aiming to minimize public health risks...|$|E

40|$|Recycled {{cellulosic}} paperboards {{may include}} mineral oils after the recycle process, which {{together with their}} poor water resistance limit their use as food packaging materials. In this work, we demonstrate that a proper functionalization of the recycled paper with two successive polymer treatments, imposes a mineral oil migration barrier and simultaneously renders it waterproof and grease resistant, making it an ideal material for food contact. The first poly (methyl methacrylate) treatment penetrates the paper network and creates a protective layer around every fiber, permitting thus {{the transformation of the}} paperboard to a hydrophobic material throughout its thickness, reducing {{at the same time the}} mineral oil migration.

The lubricants were based on <b>mineral</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fractions. The cans were of aluminium two-piece construction (two sizes) and tin-plate steel three-piece construction (two sizes) and of four representative types. Gas chromatographic {{analysis was used to}} distinguish the two press lubricants from one another by their n-alkane profiles. Analysis of solvent extracts of the cans indicated that one of the two press lubricants had been used in the manufacture of the three-piece cans and the other lubricant for the two-piece cans. Residual levels of hydrocarbons were between 0. 05 and 1. 1 mg per can. Based on the capacity of the cans and assuming all the <b>mineral</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> transferred to the contents, maximum levels in foods and beverages could be between 0. 1 and 4. 4 mg/kg. A limited number of retail products were also analysed. For the 35 samples covering 18 retail brands of canned foods and beverages, press lubricants were considered to be present in 50 % of the products at levels ranging from 0. 05 to 1. 0 mg per can, equivalent to 0. 1 to 3. 6 mg/kg of food. Additionally mineral oil of unknown origin was detected in 10 of the retail products at levels of 0. 1 to 4. 7 mg/kg.

This product is highly flexible and can be applied undiluted through Ultra Low Volume (ULV) sprayers, o r can be diluted with water for use in mist generators, thermal foggers or compression sprayers for surface applications. One of the major advantages of this formulation over existing pyrethrin containing products is the extremely low <b>mineral</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> content which makes it ideally suited for use in food handling areas and in commodity stores, such as tobacco bonds. When applied indoors as a ULV in large scale trials against a wide range of stored product and hygiene insects, the biological performance of this water-based formulation was at least equivalent and often superior to comparable oil based products. Field trials were also conducted against infestations of Bluttellu gerrnunicu. Application of water diluted product as a surface spray gave good flushout and knockdown, and rapidly achieved control, with insect numbers falling by 97 % within one day. However, due to the short persistence of pyrethrins cockroach numbers had increased to 33 %) of pre-treatment levels after 54 days.

This study was set out to provide information on the status of contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons in Tympanotonus fuscatus var. radula and sediments from Qua Iboe Estuary, Nigeria. Analyses for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) were performed on Tympanotonus fuscatus var. radula and sediment extracts using gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Seventy-two samples each of mangrove epipellic (intertidal) and benthic (subtidal) sediments, and T. fuscatus var. radula were analysed monthly between June 2003 and February 2004, covering peak periods of the wet and dry seasons. Results revealed that the TPHs level in sediments and T. fuscatus were highly variable. It ranged between 18. 01 ± 0. 04 and 210. 23 ± 1. 18 μg g– 1 dry wt of epipellic sediment, 5. 00 ± 0. 82 and 232. 00 ± 3. 23 μg g– 1 dry wt of benthic sediment and 9. 40 ± 1. 0 and 23. 27 ± 1. 0 μg g– 1 dry wt of T. fuscatus.

There were no significant adverse clinical observations or unscheduled deaths. In the F- 344 rats, occasional treatment-related changes were seen in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters. At necropsy, mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged, and there was an increase in absolute and relative liver, mesenteric lymph node, and spleen weights as compared to controls. Histopathologic effects included hepatic and mesenteric lymph node microgranulomas and mesenteric lymph node histiocytosis. In CRL:CD rats, the only effects noted were accumulations of chronic inflammatory cells in the liver at the high dose only, without the formation of discrete microgranulomas. A dose-related increase in <b>mineral</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (MHC) material in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes was observed in both F- 344 and CRL:CD rats. Although increased, liver MHC content was significantly less (approximately 50 %) in CRL:CD rats than the levels detected in the F- 344 rats. Mesenteric lymph node MHC levels did not differ significantly between the strains. This study demonstrated strain differences among rats in histopathologic effects of white oil, with the CRL:CD rat essentially showing no response compared to the F- 344 rat. The differences in the pathologic responses between the 2 strains appears to result from the higher MHC tissue content and a greater sensitivity of the F- 344 rat to the presence of the MHC material...|$|E

This paper presents {{data on the}} development of reed plants (Phragmites australis Cav. Trin.), on the effectiveness of runoff purification and on the accumulation of contaminants in the pond sediment and the reed bed for the years 1993 – 1995. P. australis was well established and grew according to normal development. The measured length and biomass values of P. australis were larger on sand than on gravel and coarse materials. Toxic levels of heavy metals in the plants were not reached. Harvested plants can be composted. The purification system is effective within the following ranges: The rate of retention of suspended solids and heavy metals varies between 16 % and 91 %. For chemical oxygen demand the average values is 25 %. Poor retention rates usually occur along with very low input concentrations. Generally retention within the reed bed is higher than in the pond. Between 1993 and 1995 the concentration of contaminants within the organic layer of the reed bed increased by 50 % for lead and by 90 % for poly aromatic hydrocarbons. Until 1994 the concentrations of <b>mineral</b> oil <b>hydrocarbons</b> also increased by 60 %.

40|$|Remote sensing {{techniques}} have been extensively {{used to detect}} the structural framework of investigated areas, which includes lineaments, fault zones and fracture patterns. The identification of these features is fundamental in exploration geology, as it allows the definition of suitable sites for the exploitation of different resources (e. g. ore <b>mineral,</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> geothermal energy and groundwater). Remote sensing techniques, typically adopted in fault identification, have been applied to assess the geological and structural framework of the Laguna Blanca area (26 ° 35 ’S- 66 ° 49 ’W). This area represents a sector of the south-central Andes localized in the Argentina region of Catamarca, along the south-eastern margin of the Puna plateau. The study area {{is characterized by a}} Precambrian low-grade metamorphic basement intruded by Ordovician granitoids. These rocks are unconformably covered by a volcano-sedimentary sequence of Miocene age, followed by volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of Upper Miocene to Plio-Pleistocene age. All these units are cut by two systems of major faults, locally characterized by 15 - 20 m wide damage zones. The detection of main tectonic lineaments in the study area was firstly carried out by classical procedures: image sharpening of Landsat 7 ETM+ images, directional filters applied to ASTER images, medium resolution Digital Elevation Models analysis (SRTM and ASTER GDEM) and hill shades interpretation. In addition, a new approach in fault zone identification, based on multispectral satellite images classification, has been tested in the Laguna Blanca area and in other sectors of south-central Andes. In this perspective, several prominent fault zones affecting basement and granitoid rocks have been sampled. The collected fault gouge samples have been analyzed with a Field-Pro spectrophotometer mounted on a goniometer. We acquired bidirectional reflectance spectra, from 0. 35 m to 2. 5 m with 1 nm spectral sampling, of the sampled fault rocks. Subsequently, two different Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifications were applied to ASTER images: the first one based on fault rock spectral signatures resampled at the ASTER sensor resolution; the second one based on spectral signatures retrieved from specific Region of Interest (ROI), which were directly derived from the ASTER image on the analyzed fault zones. The SAM classification based on the spectral signatures of fault rocks gave outstanding results since it was able to classify the analyzed fault zone, both in terms of length and width. Moreover, in some specific cases, this SAM classification identified not only the sampled fault zone, but also other prominent neighboring faults cutting the same host rock. These results define the SAM supervised classification on ASTER images as a tool to identify prominent fault zones directly on the base of fault-rocks spectra...|$|E

The Panel also reviewed mineral oil-induced alterations in tissues of human patients (liver, hepatic lymph node and spleen). The Panel agreed that certain of the <b>mineral</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> produced lesions in the mesenteric lymph nodes and liver of the F 344 rat and these lesions were best described as microgranulomas/granulomas. The lesions were fundamentally similar in both organs, although varying in severity with dose and type of <b>mineral</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The Panel agreed that hepatic lesions with inflammatory cell infiltration, necrosis, and fibrosis were produced only by feeding of LMPW and the lesions were confined to F 344 rats and not found in Sprague-Dawley rats. The most severe granulomatous lesions in the mesenteric lymph nodes were found in high dose LMPWfed F 344 rats. The microgranulomas were similar in subchronic and chronic studies. Also, little difference existed between controls and treated F 344 rats in the incidence and severity of the lesions after 2 years of feeding P 70 H white oil. The Panel agreed that some slight reversibility existed for these lesions, but also agreed that complete resolution was unlikely as regression of the lesions in the rat would likely be slow. The Panel agreed that a minimal severity infiltrate of mononuclear inflammatory cells occurred in the base of the mitral valve in a slightly increased incidence in F 344 rats fed LMPW. The Panel concluded that these mitral valve alterations had little if any toxicologic significance as the focal infiltrate was minimal in severity, occurred in controls, occurred in association with murine cardiomyopathy, and were unlike the responses in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes. The Panel agreed that the lesions observed in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes of F 344 rats exposed to MHCs, especially the LMPW, were different morphologically from changes observed in lymph node, liver, and spleen of humans that were mineral oil-users, These changes in humans are usually found incidentally in tissues taken at biopsy or autopsy. The MHC-induced lesions can be considered incidental and inconsequential in humans. Granulomatous lesions are produced in rats by MHC-feeding, especially in livers of the F 344 rat with certain of the MHCs, but are not found in human tissues. This suggests a heightened and perhaps different type of toxic response in the rat compared to humans. The MHC-associated alterations in humans are ubiquitous, present after a certain age in most, if not all, humans, and consist of intra-and extra-cellular oil droplets with a minimal macrophage (including giant cells) response...|$|R
