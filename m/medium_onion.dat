5|$|Although Wendy's was {{the first}} to have a value menu in 1989, Burger King decided to offer its own value menu in 1998. This menu {{featured}} seven products: the Whopper Jr., a five-piece Chicken Tenders, a bacon cheeseburger, medium-sized French fries, medium soft drink, <b>medium</b> <b>onion</b> rings, and a small milkshake – all priced at 99¢ (USD). In 2002 and 2006, BK revamped its value menu by adding and removing several products such as chili and the Rodeo Cheeseburger. Many of these items, such as Chili, tacos, the Sourdough burger (a product similar to the Whopper Jr., but with sourdough bread), and Chicken Tender sandwiches have since been discontinued, modified, or relegated to regional menu options.|$|E

50|$|It {{differs from}} the popular Greek dish souvlaki, in that meat cuts are much larger and slow cooked for a much longer period at a greater {{distance}} from the hot charcoal. Traditional souvla is made from the neck and shoulder of lamb, pork and chicken. The meat is cut on the bone into chunks {{about the size of}} a <b>medium</b> <b>onion</b> (optional).|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{practical}} cooking measures for both liquid and dry {{ingredients in the}} U.S. (and many other countries) are the teaspoon, tablespoon, and cup, along with halves, thirds, quarters, and eighths of these. [...] Pounds, ounces, fluid ounces, and common sizes are also used, such as can (presumed size varies depending on product), jar, square (e.g., 1 oz of chocolate), stick (e.g., 4 oz butter), or fruit/vegetable (e.g., a half lemon, two <b>medium</b> <b>onions).</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} appeal to as many {{demographic}} groups as possible and better compete with its competitor Wendy's, Burger King added a multi-tiered value menu in 1993 with items priced at 99¢, US$1.99 and $2.99. The additions, part of then CEO James Adamson's back to basics program also called Operation Phoenix, were an attempt to add not only a value menu, but also a line of value meals. The tiered menu was replaced with a more standard value menu in 1998 while the value meals were separated into their own menu segment. This value menu featured seven products: Whopper Jr., five-piece Chicken Tenders, a bacon cheeseburger, medium-sized French fries, medium soft drink, <b>medium</b> <b>onion</b> rings, and small shake. In 2002 and 2006, BK revamped its value menu, adding and removing several different products such as chili and its Rodeo Cheeseburger. Many of these items have since been discontinued, modified or relegated to a regional menu option. To better appeal to a more adult palate and demographic, BK introduced several new products to its menu in 2003, including several new or revamped chicken products, a new salad line and its BK Joe brand of coffee. Some of the new products, including its Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line, brought negative attention due to the large portion size, and amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats. Many of these products featured higher quality ingredients like whole chicken breast, Angus beef, and natural cheeses such as cheddar and pepper jack. Again, not all these products, such as the BK Baguette line, have met corporate sales expectations.|$|E
40|$|Twenty onion {{varieties}} {{were planted}} {{on two different}} dates in March at the Safford Agricultural Center. Yields up to 780 50 -pound sacks per acre were harvested, with the early planting generally yielding slightly more than the later planting. The earlier planting generally had more jumbo and large <b>onions</b> and fewer <b>medium</b> and small <b>onions</b> than the later planting. The highest yielding onions were yellow varieties compared to the two white and one red varieties, but premiums for the non-yellow onions at harvest compensated for the lower yields. Three intermediate-day onions {{were included in the}} test; they were out-yielded by many of the long-day varieties at both planting dates. Spring - planted, long-day onions can be successfully grown in the Safford valley with yields that are economically feasible...|$|R
40|$|Roșie de Făgăraș’ is a {{red onion}} {{landrace}} originating from the old region Făgăraș Country situated in South East Transylvania. It was officially included in the National Official Catalogue for cultivars and hybrids in 1952, for almost 50 years, and erased before 2004 without applying in situ conservation measures. However, food security depends on the appropriate management of all genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA). Thus {{they have to be}} conserved and sustainable used and efforts have to be done for the recognition of this landrace as a PGRFA and therefore to be maintained "under conservation" into the Official Catalogue. The study focused on analysing data from three localities recognized for cultivating ‘Roșie de Făgăraș’, in order to evaluate morphometric characteristics of mature onion bulbs according to the UPOV Standard TG/ 46 / 7, productivity, land cultivation and socio-economic vulnerabilities. The analysis of morphometric measurements results support that ‘Roșie de Făgăraș’ is a <b>medium</b> size red <b>onion</b> that may have the chance to enter the market place, at least at the small scale, according to the current regulatory framework of the European Union regarding the conservation of landraces and provided by: Directive 2008 / 62 /EC, Directive 2009 / 145 /EC and Directive 2010 / 60 /EU. The analysis of productivity, and land cultivation revealed dramatic land use change associated with the decline of cultivated area as following: 76. 27 % in Mândra, 50 % in Recea and 33. 34 % in Beclean. With an increasing aging population, lack of political support for entering the market place, decrease of landowners cultivating ‘Roșie de Făgăraș’ for trade will increase vulnerability of traditional knowledge related to the conservation of this landrace...|$|R
