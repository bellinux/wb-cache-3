40|$|The diet {{of seven}} cichlid fish species of Lake Chivero was {{investigated}} from October 2004 to April 2005. Oreochromis niloticus and O. macrochir were <b>microphages</b> feeding {{on a wide}} range of algae of which Microcystis sp., made up > 50 % of their diet, while the rest of the food items were chlorophytes, diatoms, zooplankton, insects and detritus. Tilapia sparrmanii and T. rendalli were primarily macrophages consuming plant material and filamentous algae, but also fed on diatoms and zooplankton. The small species P. acuticeps and P. philander had a catholic diet comprising of algae, zooplankton, plant material, fish and detritus. Serranochromis robustus was a carnivore and fed mainly on fish. They were no ontogenetic diet shift for all species except for S. robustus and P. acuticeps. Diet shift occurred at 50 mm SL, were the major food item in the diet of small 100 mm). Competition among the small species and the juveniles of the large species may be reduced by abundant food resources, habitat preferences, ontogenetic diet and habitat shifts. Direct competition between O. niloticus and O. macrochir may result in the exclusion of the latter. The cichlid species in the lake were grouped into three major feeding group <b>microphages,</b> macrophages and carnivores and omnivores.

40|$|Necrosis is {{a common}} feature of {{invasive}} carcinoma of the breast and is caused by chronic ischaemia leading to infarction. Although necrosis was previously assumed {{to be due to}} a generally poor blood supply in the tumour, in this study we show that it is present in tumours with focal areas of high vascular density situated away from the actual sites of necrosis. This may account, in part, for the previous observation that necrosis is linked to poor prognosis in this disease. Highly angiogenic tumours often display blood vessel shunting from one tumour area to another, which further exacerbates ischaemia and the formation of tumour necrosis. We have recently demonstrated that high focal <b>microphage</b> infiltration into breast tumours is significantly associated with increased tumour angiogenesis and poor prognosis and that the macrophages accumulate in poorly vascularized, hypoxic areas within breast tumours. In order to investigate the interactions of macrophages with chronic ischaemia (as reflected by the presence of necrosis) and angiogenesis in breast tumours, we quantified the levels of these three biological parameters in a series of 109 consecutive invasive breast carcinomas. We found that the degree of tumour necrosis was correlated with both <b>microphage</b> infiltration (Mann–Whitney U, P-value = 0. 0009; chi-square, P-value = 0. 01) and angiogenesis (Mann–Whitney U P-value = 0. 0008, chi square P-value = 0. 03). It was also observed that necrosis was a feature of tumours possessing an aggressive phenotype, i. e. high tumour grade (chi-square, P-value < 0. 001), larger size (Mann–Whitney U, P-value = 0. 003) and low oestrogen receptor status (Mann–Whitney U, P-value = 0. 008; chi-square, P-value < 0. 008). We suggest, therefore, that aggressive tumours rapidly outgrow their vascular supply in certain areas, leading to areas of prolonged hypoxia within the tumour and, subsequently, to necrosis. This, in turn, may attract macrophages into the tumour, which then contribute to the angiogenic process, giving rise to an association between high levels of angiogenesis and extensive necrosis. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for collecting large numbers of polymorphonuclear leucocytes from peritoneal exudates in rabbits. These cells are obtained essentially free from other cell types and from debris. When <b>microphages</b> so procured are disrupted by physical methods and extracted with aqueous salt solutions, the soluble fraction manifests striking bactericidal activity, especially on Gram-negative enteric bacilli. The susceptible microorganisms are not lysed. This bactericidal substance, which has been called phagocytin, appears to be limited in distribution mainly to the polymorphonuclear leucocyte. No phagocytin is present in extracts of rabbit heart, kidney, or skeletal muscle, and rabbit liver and spleen contain much less than do packed leucocytes. Extracts of human and of guinea pig <b>microphages</b> show less bactericidal activity than rabbit cell preparations. Similar extracts of rat and mouse polymorphonuclear leucocytes contain no demonstrable phagocytin. As indicated by its behavior on dialysis, on exposure to proteolytic enzymes, and on salt fractionation, phagocytin {{appears to be a}} protein with general properties characteristic of a globulin. It is clearly different from lysozyme and from properdin. Although phagocytin is reasonably stable at temperatures of 65 °C. and lower for several hours, solutions of it gradually lose bactericidal activity on standing for prolonged periods at 4 °C. This instability, and also the ease with which phagocytin is inactivated, presumably by adsorption, on exposure to a variety of materials, have thus far rendered fruitless efforts to isolate it...|$|R
40|$|For a {{long time}} the {{biologist}} has been attempting to discover a criterion by which a living cell can be distinguished from a dead cell by simple microscopic examination. The most popular method has been the application of dyes, either {{in the form of}} the so-called vital staining, or in the usual way on dried and fixed smears. 1. METHODS OF "VITAL " STAINING Dilute solutions of dyes were applied to animal or plant cells nearly as far back as a century ago. By this means it was sought to gain an insight into various life processes of the cells, to demon-strate certain cellular structures, or to find out whether the cell were dead or alive. The work started by Ehrlich on nerve cells and blood cells, and the stimulus it gave other workers, have given us a respectable literature on the subject, to which con-tributions are still being made from time to time. The first application of "vital " stains to bacteria was made by Metchnikoff (1887) in his immortal study of phagocytosis.

The ΦCA 82 genome {{is quite different from}} other microviruses as indicated by comparisons of nucleotide similarity, predicted protein similarity, and functional classifications. Only three genes showed significant similarity to microviral proteins as determined by local alignments using BLAST analysis. ORF 1 encoded a predicted phage F capsid protein that was phylogenetically most similar to the Microviridae ΦMH 2 K member's major coat protein. The ΦCA 82 genome also encoded a predicted minor capsid protein (ORF 2) and putative replication initiation protein (ORF 3) most similar to the microviral bacteriophage SpV 4. The distant evolutionary relationship of ΦCA 82 suggests that the divergence of this novel turkey microvirus from other microviruses may reflect unique evolutionary pressures encountered within the turkey gastrointestinal system. </p...|$|E
40|$|Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived {{plasma protein}} {{that has been}} implicated in {{regulating}} angiogenesis, but the role of adiponectin in regulating this process is still controversial. In this study, {{in order to determine}} whether adiponectin affects tumor growth and tumor induced vascularization, we implanted B 16 F 10 melanoma and Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells subcutaneously into adiponectin knockout and wild-type control mice, and found that adiponectin deficiency markedly promoted the growth of both tumors. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that adiponectin deficiency reduced macrophage recruitment to the tumor, but did not affect cancer cell mitosis, apoptosis, or tumor-associated angiogenesis. In addition, treatment with recombinant adiponectin did not affect the proliferation of cultured B 16 F 10 tumor cells. Importantly, the restoration of <b>microphage</b> infiltration at an early stage of tumorigenesis by means of co-injection of B 16 F 10 cells and macrophages reversed the increased tumor growth in adiponectin knockout mice. Thus, we conclude that the enhanced tumor growth observed in adiponectin deficient mice is likely due to the reduction of macrophage infiltratio...|$|E

Virus abundance ranged from 108 to 109 per gram of feces, and virus-to-bacterium ratios were much lower (less than 0. 1) than those observed in aquatic environments (5 to 10). Viral DNA was extracted and randomly amplified using phi 29 polymerase and analyzed through high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing.

30|$|There are {{additionally}} also morphological, {{physiological and}} behavioural factors which strongly influence {{the exposure of}} soil organisms towards GMO [21]. Based on their biology, two groups of soil organisms can be identified which differ strongly in their way to take up chemicals: soft-bodied organisms, i.e. nematodes, enchytraeids, earthworms and hard-bodied organisms, i.e. mainly arthropods such as spiders, mites, collembolans, diplopods, isopods, or chilopods. Arthropods have special organs for water and oxygen uptake, while soft-bodied organisms use the body surface for these purposes. In addition, both groups can take up harmful substances by food. Different feeding types can be differentiated in soil organisms [26 – 28]: saprophages (feeding on dead organic material), <b>microphages</b> (feeding on bacteria), fungiphages (feeding on fungi), phytophages (feeding on living plants) and zoophages (predators) are the most common.

40|$|Additional contributor: Douglas Mashek (faculty mentor). Consumption of {{saturated}} fat {{has been associated with}} the development of obesity, diabetes, hepatic steatosis and related diseases. Additionally, animal studies have shown that consumption of a diet high in saturated fat results in a rapid upregulation of hepatic lipogenic genes. Thus, to determine if saturated fatty acids have a direct effect on hepatic gene expression, rat primary hepatocytes were cultured and treated with various fatty acids. RNA was harvested from the hepatocytes and cDNA was subsequently prepared to analyze for lipogenic gene expression. Lipogenic enzymes included fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC) isoforms alpha and beta, stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD 1) and fatty acid elongase 6 (Elovl 6). Although lipogenic gene expression was altered in response to the presence of insulin and glucose, saturated fatty acids did not appear to significantly upregulate gene expression of lipogenic genes. These data suggest that the effects {{of saturated}} fatty acids on lipogenic gene expression in the liver are not direct. Further experiments will explore whether signals from the adipose tissue or inflammatory signals from <b>microphages</b> are necessary for saturated fatty acids to cause changes in de novo lipogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Microbial food webs, which {{comprise}} phototrophic picoplankton (or ultraplankton), heterotrophic {{bacteria and}} protozoa, are ubiquitous in marine waters. Members of the microbial food web may play various {{roles in the}} export of biogenic carbon. For example, it has been postulated that high bacterial activity may sometimes prevent a significant fraction of the production by large phytoplankton from reaching metazoan consumers. Phototrophic or heterotrophic small plankton cells may be readily exported (i. e. biological CO 2 pump) if incorporated into large particles, through either endosymbiosis with larger cells, or development on material accumulated in hydrodynamic traps, or inclusion into marine snow, or grazing by large planktonic <b>microphages</b> (e. g. salps) and incorporation in their sometimes fast-sinking faecal pellets. Another aspect is the export of carbonate {{by members of the}} microbial food web (e. g. coccolithophores, foraminifera), which influences the carbon dioxide balance of the ocean (i. e. carbonate pump). Finally, carbon bound into refractory dissolved organic matter is chemically sequestered in the upper ocean, before being exported to depth. The activity of microbial food webs may therefore influence in several ways the export (and sequestration) of biogenic carbon in oceans...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTumor {{necrosis}} factor-α is {{a proinflammatory}} mediator {{required for the}} development of experimental lung ischemia-reperfusion injury. The alveolar macrophage is a rich source of tumor necrosis factor-α in multiple models of acute lung injury. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the alveolar macrophage is an important source of tumor necrosis factor-α in lung ischemia-reperfusion injury and whether suppression of its function protects against injury. MethodsLeft lungs of Long-Evans rats underwent normothermic ischemia for 90 minutes and reperfusion for up to 4 hours. Treated animals received gadolinium chloride, a rare earth metal that inhibits macrophage function. Injury was quantitated via lung tissue neutrophil accumulation (myeloperoxidase content), lung vascular permeability, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid leukocyte, cytokine, and chemokine content. Separate samples were generated for immunohistochemistry. ResultsTumor necrosis factor-α secretion occurred at 15 minutes of reperfusion and was localized to the alveolar macrophage by immunohistochemistry. In gadolinium-treated animals, lung vascular permeability was reduced by 66 % at 15 minutes (P <. 03) of reperfusion and by 34 % at 4 hours (P <. 02) of reperfusion. Suppression of macrophage function resulted in a 35 % reduction in lung myeloperoxidase content (P <. 03) and similar reductions in bronchoalveolar lavage leukocyte accumulation. Tumor necrosis factor-α and <b>microphage</b> inflammatory protein- 1 α protein levels were markedly reduced in the bronchoalveolar lavage of gadolinium-treated animals by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ConclusionsThe alveolar macrophage secretes tumor necrosis factor-α protein by 15 minutes of reperfusion, which orchestrates the early events that eventually result in lung ischemia-reperfusion injury at 4 hours. Gadolinium pretreatment markedly reduces tumor necrosis factor-α elaboration, resulting in significant protection against lung ischemia-reperfusion injury...|$|E
40|$|We have {{reported}} that Ganoderma tsugae supplementation alleviates bronchoalveolar inflammation in an airway sensitization and challenge model with female BALB/c mice. However, the effects of G. tsugae supplementation in vivo on serum antibody levels, splenocyte and peritoneal <b>microphage</b> immune responses {{have not yet been}} determined. In this study, serum antibody levels, cytokines and splenocyte chemical mediators and peritoneal macrophage cultures from ovalbumin (OVA) -sensitized and -challenged mice were examined after continuously consuming G. tsugae supplementation diets for 5 weeks. The results showed that OVA sensitization and challenge significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased the spontaneous production of IL- 2 (Th 1) cytokine, but significantly (P < 0. 05) increased spontaneous and OVA-stimulated IL- 4 (Th 2) production in splenocyte cultures from experimental mice. OVA administration significantly decreased both spontaneous and LPS/IFN-gamma-stimulated IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 levels in peritoneal macrophage cultures from experimental mice. However, dietary supplementation with G. tsugae significantly increased spontaneous IL- 2 level, but slightly decreased spontaneous IL- 4 level in cultured splenocyte supernatants in the experimental groups. G. tsugae supplementation enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 production in cultured peritoneal macrophages. However, the nitric oxide level from cultured peritoneal macrophages and serum OVA-specific IgE and IgG(2 a) antibody levels was not significantly affected. These results suggest that OVA sensitization and challenge induced a Th 2 -skewed splenocyte response and decreased peritoneal macrophage cytokine secretion. G. tsugae supplementation in vivo modulated the Th 1 /Th 2 balance and enhanced macrophage immune responses. However, the supplementation diet could not fully reverse the Th 2 -skewed responses to level of Th 1 -skewed responses. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} {{need to develop a}} safe, effective, orally active, and {{inexpensive}} therapy for African trypanosomiasis due to the drawbacks of current drugs. Selective tubulin inhibitors have the potential to be promising drug candidates for the treatment of this disease, which is based on the tubulin protein structural difference between mammalian and trypanosome cells. We propose to identify novel tubulin inhibitors from a compound library developed based on the lead compounds that selectively target trypanosomiasis. We used Trypanosoma brucei brucei as the parasite model, and human normal kidney cells and mouse <b>microphage</b> cells as the host model. Growth rates of both trypanosomes and mammalian cells were determined as a means to screen compounds that selectively inhibit the proliferation of parasites. Furthermore, we examined the cell cycle profile of the parasite and compared tubulin polymerization dynamics before and after the treatment using identified compounds. Last, in vivo anti-parasite activities of these compounds were determined in T. brucei-infected mice. Three compounds were selected that are 100 fold more effective against the growth of T. brucei cells than mammalian cells. These compounds caused cell cycle progression defects in T. brucei cells. Western analyses indicated that these compounds decreased tubulin polymerization in T. brucei cells. The in vivo investigation revealed that these compounds, when admitted orally, inhibited T. brucei cell proliferation in mouse blood. However, they were not potent enough to clear up the infection completely. These compounds are promising lead compounds as orally active agents for drug development of anti-trypanosome agents. A more detail structure activity relationship (SAR) was summarized that will be used to guide future lead optimization to improve the selectivity and potency of the current compounds...|$|E
40|$|Time-course {{changes of}} {{injected}} amyloid fibrils into non-treated and amyloid-laden mice were studied using {{the technique of}} ultrastructural histochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. Light microscopically, a granuloma was formed in the subcutaneous tissue in both group 3 days after the injection of extracted amyloid fobrils. An accumulation {{of a large number}} of <b>microphages,</b> of which cytoplasm conrained several vacuoles and phagocytosed amyloidfibrils, was seen in the granuloma. The Congo red staining became weaker with advance of time after the phagocytosis of the injected amyloid fibrils. Ultrastructurally, a large number of phagosomes and phagolysosomes (acid phosphatase positive) were detected in the cytoplasm of the macrophages throughout the present study. At the early stage, in most of the macrophages, oval to rhomboid-shaped phagpspmes contained clearly recognizable amyloid fibrils, but, at the late stage, phagosomes became smaller and more round in shape without any fibrillar structures in them. However, in the latter phagosomes, several gold particales were still labeled by immunoelectron technique using anti-murine AA antiserum. These findings were similar in both non-treated and amyloid-laden mice when compared with them at the same period after the injection of amyloid fibrils. From the present, it is suggested that the role of the macrophages exists until the formation of amyloid fibrils...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCoral reef {{ecosystems}} are remarkable for their high productivity in nutrient-poor waters. A {{high proportion of}} primary production is consumed by the dominant herbivore assemblage, teleost fishes, {{many of which are}} the product of recent and rapid diversification. Our review and synthesis of the trophodynamics of herbivorous reef fishes suggests that current models underestimate the level of resource partitioning, and thus trophic innovation, in this diverse assemblage. We examine several lines of evidence including feeding observations, trophic anatomy, and biochemical analyses of diet, tissue composition and digestive processes to show that the prevailing view (including explicit models) of parrotfishes as primary consumers of macroscopic algae is incompatible with available data. Instead, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that most parrotfishes are <b>microphages</b> that target cyanobacteria and other protein-rich autotrophic microorganisms that live on (epilithic) or within (endolithic) calcareous substrata, are epiphytic on algae or seagrasses, or endosymbiotic within sessile invertebrates. This novel view of parrotfish feeding biology provides a unified explanation for the apparently disparate range of feeding substrata used by parrotfishes, and integrates parrotfish nutrition with their ecological roles in reef bioerosion and sediment transport. Accelerated evolution in parrotfishes can now be explained as the result of (1) the ability to utilize a novel food resource for reef fishes, i. e. microscopic autotrophs; and (2) the partitioning of this resource by habitat and successional stage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Aim Mining {{activities}} generate countless environmental impacts, including heavy-metal contamination, sorting {{and increased}} turbidity. In aquatic ecosystems these impacts can drastically affect the initial links {{of the food}} chain, such as zooplankton. Methods To evaluate how the different mining activities can influence the structure and functional diversity of zooplankton, we investigated the geochemical characteristics {{of the water and}} sediment in two small impoundments impacted by different mining activities (kaolin and iron extraction). We also explored zooplankton composition, species diversity and functional diversity (feeding guilds taxa). Results As expected, the water and the sediment of both of the reservoirs showed high concentrations of trace elements, particularly Al, Ba, Fe, Mg, Mn, Sr and Zn. Zooplankton biomass and diversity were markedly reduced (< 12 &# 956;g. DW. L- 1 and H&# 8217; < 1. 5, respectively), and negatively correlated with turbidity and total suspended solids. Small <b>microphages</b> dominated the trophic composition of zooplankton, and an alternation of trophic guilds was not observed, since the dynamics of raptorial organisms was essentially linked to the temporal fluctuation of a single species of rotifer (Polyarthra cf. dolichoptera). Conclusions In addition to changes in the aquatic habitat and zooplankton composition, the functional niches were also affected by the mining impacts. The use of the functional diversity analysis can emerge as a valuable approach to understand how zooplankton communities respond to drastic environmental changes...|$|R
