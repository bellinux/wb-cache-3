5|$|The next morning, the {{schooner}} Lioness discovered {{one of the}} cutters, {{and after}} saving the occupants of the second boat <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scene of the disaster.

5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{village of}} Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, {{where she was}} either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken {{to one of the}} bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run {{from the top of the}} masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E

Nakano held the title for approximately five months, until losing it back to Blayze on the April 3, 1995 episode of Raw.

25|$|While {{traversing}} Wildermore {{in search}} of ways to oppose Nurzum, the player and his companions unexpectedly come across Nona. Since her departure in Eaworth, she <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Byre Tor, which has been razed by Nurzum, and cared for the survivors, her hatred for Men of Rohan lessened by the kind actions. Her reunion with Horn is brief and cold, and not having yet resolved her feelings for him, she chooses to leave again. The others follow her to a cave where she hides survivors from the snow, among them Harding's son Leodwig, injured but alive. Seeing wrath of Nurzum firsthand, Corudan the Elf decides to search for aid among the Ents of the nearby Fangorn Forest. He and the player manage to find and wake the Ent Leaflock (Finglas) and relay him Nuzum's story. The Ent cares little for troubles of Men, but defiling of Huorn's remains rouses him to anger and he commands Huorns of the forest to come after the giant. Nurzum fights off the attack, but is weakened and later defeated by the player and Heroes of Wildermore. Meanwhile, Nona and Horn resolve their feelings and finally commit to each other.|$|E
500|$|By 1948 Olivier was on {{the board}} of {{directors}} for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in Richard III and also performed with Leigh in The School for Scandal and The Skin of Our Teeth. The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to [...] "charm the press". Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour. The most dramatic altercation occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without them. An exhausted and exasperated Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and slapped her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had [...] "dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage". By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist, [...] "You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses." [...] Later, he would observe that he [...] "lost Vivien" [...] in Australia.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{informed}} the journalist Margot Adler {{that when he}} was nine years old he encountered a small old woman sitting in the centre of a circle containing brass bowls of herbs. He alleged that he instinctively stripped naked and that she then sexually initiated him into a witchcraft tradition, during which he had a vision of a goddess and a horned god. After the vision, he claimed that they sat in the circle and she instructed him in the magical use of the various herbs, after which he was washed in butter, oil, and salt, before putting his clothes on and returning home. The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described this as being [...] "difficult to accept as a literal account", but suggested that Anderson may have undergone a significant spiritual experience with an older woman in 1926, which was subsequently [...] "embellished into the later tale" [...] that he told Adler. A woman who knew Anderson, Cornelia Benavidez, later stated that [...] "He says that he became friends with a woman in the circus who was a fire dancer and when she got older worked the stands. She somehow joined the circus in South Africa and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US. When he first met her she was 60 years old and he was a nine-year-old boy. He knew her for 15 years". Researcher WIlliam Wallworth provided potential supporting evidence for this claim when he noted that a number of the circuses that performed in Oregon during the 1920s and 1930s had Africans in their travelling retinues.|$|E

He said that on Friday, September 16, she had told him she was going for a walk to a drugstore and see some friends. The police surmised that instead she <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearby southern slope of Mount Lee {{to the foot of the}} Hollywoodland sign, climbed a workman's ladder to the top of the [...] "H" [...] and jumped. The cause of death was listed by the coroner as [...] "multiple fractures of the pelvis." ...|$|E
