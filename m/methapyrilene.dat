50|$|<b>Methapyrilene</b> is an {{antihistamine}} and anticholinergic of the pyridine {{chemical class}} which {{was developed in}} the early 1950s. It was sold under the trade names Co-Pyronil and Histadyl EC. It has relatively strong sedative effects, to the extent that its primary use was as a medication for insomnia rather than for its antihistamine action. Together with scopolamine, it was the main ingredient in Sominex, Nytol, and Sleep-Eze. It also provided the sedative component of Excedrin PM.

Eosinophilic foci of alteredhepatocytes {{were found in}} portal areas after 1 week of treatment, the eosinophilia being caused by proliferation of mitochondria. Eosino-philic neoplastic nodules developed from such lesions after 16 weeks of treatment. Hepatocellular carcinomas developed after 26 weeks of treat-ment. Mitochondrial proliferation, which had been found as a marker for hepatocytes altered by this compound at 1 week of treatment, was still present in the hepatocellular carcinomas, which therefore met the mor-phologic criteria of oncocytomas. -JNCI 1983; 71 : 1021 - 1031.

40|$|IT {{is widely}} {{recognized}} {{that one of}} the important side effects of the anti-histamines as a class is their sedative action; it has also been considered the most characteristic. 1 Controlled studies of their hypnotic (sleep-inducing) effect, however, are lacking. This side effect may be either desirable or objectionable, depending on the situation in which the drug is employed. It was obvious that such a side effect might be used to good advantage as a primary action, i. e., the use of antihistamines as hypnotics. This would seem to be of some value, since the toxicity of this class of compounds is low. Despite the fact that adequate evidence of their value as hypnotics is not available, the antihistamines have been used widely for this purpose. Indeed, some antihistamines, e. g., <b>methapyrilene</b> hydrochloride, are adver-tised extensively to the public and sold in large quantities for their hypnotic effect since, unlike other hypnotics such as the barbiturates, they may be dispensed without prescription. Inasmuch as the sedative effects of dif-ferent members of this large class of compounds are extremely variable, 2 it seemed desirable to perform a controlled study of one of the compounds which is advertised and used for its hypnotic effect. <b>Methapyrilene</b> hydro-chloride (Histadyl, Dormin, Thenylene Hydrochloride) was selected for this purpose. In a study of this compound, by Feinberg and Bernstein, 8 sedation was a common finding, occurring in 48 (or 19 %) of 253 patients, most of whom received 50 mg. doses. The degree of sedation was not so great as that produced by Benadryl, but approximated or perhaps exceeded that ex-perienced with Pyribenzamine. Friedlaender and Friedlaender 4 noted drowsiness in 13 of 117 patients with 100 mg. doses. Kierland and Potter 5 reported that 10 of 126 patients experienced drowsiness with this drug on doses of 100 mg. three to four times daily.

40|$|Genomics {{technologies}} {{are used in}} several disciplines, including toxicology. However, these {{technologies are}} relatively new, and their applications require further investigations. When investigators apply these technologies to in vitro experiments, two major issues need to be clarified: a) can in vitro toxicity studies, in combination with genomics analyses, be used to predict the toxicity of a compound; and b) are the generated toxicogenomics data reproducible between laboratories? These questions were addressed by an interlaboratory study with laboratories of four pharmaceutical companies. We evaluated gene expression patterns from cultured rat primary hepatocytes after a 24 -hr incubation with <b>methapyrilene</b> (MP). Extensive data analysis showed that comparison of genomics data from different sources is complex because both experimental and statistical variability are important confounding factors. However, appropriate statistical tools allowed us to use gene expression profiles to distinguish high-dose–treated cells from vehicle-treated cells. Moreover, we correctly identified MP in an independently generated in vitro database, underlining that in vitro toxicogenomics could be a predictive tool for toxicity. From a mechanistic point of view, despite the observed site-to-site variability, there was good concordance regarding the affected biologic processes. Several subsets of regulated genes were obtained by analyzing the data sets with one method or using different statistical analysis methods. The identified genes are involved in cellular processes that are associated to the exposure of primary hepatocytes to MP. Whether they are specific for MP and are cause or consequence of the toxicity requires further investigations.

40|$|Development of an {{in vitro}} {{system for the}} {{detection}} of substance induced gene expression alterations in primary rat hepatocytes Following the new European legislation for chemicals (REACH) a large amount of chemicals need to be evaluated from the toxicological perspective. With commonly used techniques, the current testing capacities will be overloaded. Therefore, there is a requirement for faster and more reliable test systems for toxicology. In {{the last couple of years}} there has been a lot of progress in the field of toxicogenomics. After exposing animals to toxic substances, it is possible to detect the mode of action based on the substance induced gene expression alterations. This kind of analysis requires animal experiments and is not feasible for high throughput testing. An alternative test method would be the investigation of cultured hepatocytes. Approx. 600 million hepatocytes can be isolated from one rat liver, which would be sufficient for roughly 100 six well plates. At the beginning of this thesis the majority of groups working in this field saw no feasible option to perform gene expression analysis of cultured hepatocytes. This is based on the fact, that cultured hepatocytes undergo a (“spontaneous”) change of more then 1000 genes caused only by the culture conditions. Nonetheless, in this thesis an in vitro system based on primary rat hepatocytes has been established which is able to detect similar substance induced gene expression changes as observed in the in vivo rat model. To achieve this, three commonly used culture systems for the cultivation of primary cells were investigated: (1) the classical collagen monolayer culture, where hepatocytes are cultured on a thin film of collagen, (2) the collagen sandwich culture, where hepatocytes are cultivated between two layers of a collagen gel and (3) Matrigel®-culture, a commercially available smooth extracellular matrix in which the hepatocytes are embedded. The hepatocytes were incubated with <b>methapyrilene</b> as a test substance in a concentration of 100 and 200 μM and the gene expression of four markergenes (Abat, Gsk 3 b, Myd 116 and Sult 1 a 1) was measured. These genes were already known as characteristically up- (Gsk 3 b, Myd 116) and downregulated (Abat, Sult 1 a 1) under the influence of <b>methapyrilene.</b> It could be shown that these characteristic deregulations were the most pronounced and the most reproducible in the collagen sandwich culture. Therefore, the collagen sandwich was used in subsequent experiments. Besides the choice of the collagen sandwich culture as the optimal culture system, it was discovered that there is an advantage to cultivate both control and treated cells on the same six well dish. The variability on the same plate was less then the plate-to-plate variability. When developing a new in vitro system, the choice of the correct concentration of test substances is one critical aspect. This concentration should be in the range of a concentration which can also be obtained in vivo. The results, using the optimized system, show a deregulation at a level of 0. 39 μM and a clear deregulation at a level of 6. 25 μM <b>methapyrilene.</b> It is known from the literature, that an i. p. -injection of 0. 7 mg/kg BW <b>methapyrilene</b> results in a plasma level of approx. 0. 5 μM 10 minutes after injection. This led to the conclusion that this test system is able to detect a substance induced effect on gene expression, even at a level close to in vivo relevant concentrations. This was confirmed by measuring additional genes (Bax, Cdkn 1, Gsta 2, Hsf 1, Mdm 2 und Nqo 1). A concentration dependent effect could also be shown for aflatoxin B 1, piperonylbutoxide and 2 -nitrofluorene as additional liver-carcinogens. Based on these encouraging results, a larger study was performed to investigate if the substance induced gene expression changes in the in vivo rat liver and in vitro primary rat hepatocytes are comparable. Two genotoxic (aflatoxin B 1, 2 -nitrofluorene) and two non-genotoxic (<b>methapyrilene,</b> piperonylbutoxide) compounds were used as test substances. Two gene groups were analyzed: one gene group associated with stress response, DNA-repair and metabolism (gene group 1 : Abcb 1, Ugt 1 a 6, Gsta 5, Gsta 2, Hsf 1, Nqo 1, Apex 1, Bax, Cdkn 1 a, Gadd 45 a, Mt 1 a, Sds, Mdm 2, Myc) and one gene group which is active during cell proliferation (gene group 2 : Mcm 6, Cdc 2, Hdc, 3 -Pgdh, Cdc 20, Igfbp 1, Top 2 a, Map 3 k 1, Atf 3). The in vitro experiments were performed related to this thesis. The results from the in vivo experiments were provided by a cooperation-partner. Interestingly, there was a very good correlation between the in vivoand the in vitro-results when analysing gene group 1 (p< 0. 001). For gene group 2 no significant correlation could be found (p= 0. 286). This could be explained by the fact that stress-response, DNArepair and metabolism are similar processes both in vitro and in vivo. The missing correlation of proliferation-associated genes (gene group 2) could be due to the fact, that there is no replacement proliferation in vitro. Replacement proliferation in organs means that damaged cells are replaced by the proliferation of surrounding healthy cells. With the current state of the art in culturing primary hepatocytes, the effect of replacement-proliferation can not be seen in vitro. The investigation of gene groups, whose substance induced gene expression alterations correlate between in vitro and in vivo systems, will facilitate the development of toxicological test-systems by focusing only on the relevant genes. At present, the use of primary rat hepatocytes is very often criticized. One reason is that hepatocytes produce artificial or false positive results in vitro. For example, the genes Gsk 3 b and Myd 116 were altered by the influence of <b>methapyrilene</b> in vitro only, but not in rat liver in vivo. If this argumentation is correct, a further use of cultivated rat hepatocytes in toxicogenomics would not make any sense. This was the basis for investigating the apparently occurring in vitro/in vivo discrepancy. The result of these investigations showed that this discrepancy is simply based on the different pharmacokinetics in vitro and in vivo. <b>Methapyrilene</b> has a half-life of 2. 8 h. The previous studies focused on 24 h as the earliest time point for sampling, therefore the substance was already completely excreted and the gene expression change had already returned to basal level. By investigation of earlier timepoints, it could be shown, that an induction of Gsk 3 b and Myd 116 also occurred in vivo. Due to this fact, the argument of a discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo is no longer valid. In summary, it has been shown that the culture system described in this thesis, is able to detect substanceinduced gene expression alterations at in vivo relevant concentrations. These changes in gene expression correlate well with the in vivo situation concerning the group of stress-associated genes...|$|E

In this thesis, the role of gut microflora on the mammalian metabolic system was explored with specific focus on the influence on xenobiotic metabolism and toxicity. Systems biology approaches were utilised to examine microfloral-mammalian interactions and mechanisms of drug toxicity. Multi-omic techniques, namely transcriptomics and metabonomics, were employed to characterise animal models used for investigating microfloral-mammalian interactions. These included germ-free, antibiotic-treated, and 'conve-ntional' rats. The utility of applying systems biology approaches to elucidate mechanisms of toxicity was demonstrated in conventional animals administered <b>methapyrilene</b> using metabonomic and protein-analysis techniques. Finally, the influence of the gut microbiota on the metabolism and toxicity of hydrazine was explored using an integrated transcriptomic and metabonomic approach. Microfloral absence modulated host metabolism directly and indirectly at the transcriptome and metabonome level, specifically drug, lipid and energy metabolism. Temporary suppression of the microbiota through antibiotic treatment did not disrupt the biological system greatly but minor disruption was observed upon re-colonisation. <b>Methapyrilene</b> dosing modified the structure and activity of a urea cycle enzyme and by integrating metabonomics and focused assays the potential for these protein modifications to be a mechanism of toxicity were investigated. In germ-free anitn ls the effect of hrdrazine was variable, ith toxicity enhanced in two of the three members compared to conventional animals. This highlights the potential for microbiota to influence host susceptibility towards drug toxicity and shows that toxic responses can be diverse {{in the absence of a}} functional microbiome. These studies demonstrate the use of applying systems biology approaches to investigate complex biological systems and indicate that gut microorganisms can modulate host metabolism and potentially be a factor in idiosyncratic drug responses.

40|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) are a {{major obstacle}} {{for the development of}} new medicines. They are also a leading cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Although ADRs affect many different organs and bodily systems, drug induced liver injury has lead to the withdrawal of several drugs at the post licensing stage, and is a key cause of drug attrition. Many of the drugs that cause liver injury are thought to do so through metabolism to a reactive metabolite, exposure to which can cause modification of cellular proteins, leading to loss of function, and can result in a loss of cellular homoeostasis. It is therefore important to understand the chemistry and the downstream biochemical events associated with bioactivation. Information on the chemistry of metabolism coupled with mechanistic biomarkers reflective of certain pathways of hepatic injury would enable both researchers and physicians to predict and diagnose DILI, leading to the improvement of safe drug design. This thesis focuses firstly on the use of in vitro models and mass spectrometry to provide integrated data on the metabolism and toxicity of xenobiotics, using thiophene containing molecules as a paradigm. The thiophene ring {{has the potential to be}} bioactivated via S-oxidation and epoxidation pathways, and several thiophene containing drugs have been associated with drug induced liver injury. The investigations described intended firstly to elucidate the chemistry of <b>methapyrilene</b> bioactivation using mass spectrometry and hydrogen-deuterium exchange. The following two chapters aimed to establish a link between bioactivation and toxicity of thiophenes and to evaluate two in vitro models as tool for predicting DILI. The final experimental chapter aims to investigate the potential of ophthalmic acid (OA) to act as a serum biomarker reflective of depletion of hepatic levels of the protective tripeptide, glutathione (GSH). Disturbance of GSH levels through quenching of reactive metabolites can lead to disturbance of its anabolism and catabolism pathways. Indeed, serum OA levels, a GSH analog, have been shown to rise following hepatic GSH depletion. This work utilises GSH adduct formation as a marker of bioactivation of thiophenes in several different in vitro models. Rat liver microsomal incubations were analysed using hydrogen deuterium exchange and LC-MS to define the reactive metabolite of <b>methapyrilene</b> as an S-oxide of the thiophene ring. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes or single P 450 expressing THLE cell cultures were exposed to either <b>methapyrilene,</b> tienilic acid, ticlopidine or 2 -phenylthiophene and subsequent LC-MS analysis confirmed GSH adduct formation for all compounds in the isolated rat hepatocyte model, but only for 2 -phenylthiophene in the THLE cell model. Cytotoxicity was also investigated in both models, and all compounds were found to cause a greater degree of toxicity in the isolated rat hepatocyte molecule than in the THLE model. By exposing rodents to depletors of hepatic GSH, such as acetaminophen and diethylmaleate, and monitoring the resultant serum OA levels, it has been determined that OA is not a reliable mechanistic marker of hepatic GSH depletion. Kinetic studies of OA in rat serum have revealed that OA is subject to a similar metabolic and elimination pathway as GSH. The overall scope of this work reveals the usefulness of LC-MS/MS to determine S-oxide and epoxide adducts in in vitro studies. The freshly isolated rat hepatocyte model was a useful tool for providing integrated metabolic and toxicological data of thiophene containing molecules and has the potential to be expanded to include data on covalent binding and levels of DILI biomarkers. The single CYP expressing THLE cell model was not as useful in this case, but has been used in other studies to explore the role of discrete P 450 enzymes in toxicity and metabolism. Whilst it is unfortunate that serum OA did not reflect hepatic OA in such a way that it could be easily exploited as a biomarker, this does help us to understand that the plethora of potential biomarkers uncovered by proteomic, metabolomic and transcriptomic studies need to be investigated in depth in order to understand their applications across different species and systems...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies using}} microarrays {{have shown that}} changes in gene {{expression}} provide information about the mechanism of toxicity induced by xenobiotic agents. Nevertheless, {{the issue of whether}} gene expression profiles are reproducible across different laboratories remains to be determined. To address this question, several members of the Hepatotoxicity Working Group of the International Life Sciences Institute Health and Environmental Sciences Institute evaluated the liver gene expression profiles of rats treated with <b>methapyrilene</b> (MP). Animals were treated at one facility, and RNA was distributed to five different sites for gene expression analysis. A preliminary evaluation of the number of modulated genes uncovered striking differences between the five different sites. However, additional data analysis demonstrated that these differences had an effect on the absolute gene expression results but not on the outcome of the study. For all users, unsupervised algorithms showed that gene expression allows the distinction of the high dose of MP from controls and low dose. In addition, the use of a supervised analysis method (support vector machines) made it possible to correctly classify samples. In conclusion, the results show that, despite some variability, robust gene expression changes were consistent between sites. In addition, key expression changes related to the mechanism of MP-induced hepatotoxicity were identified. These results provide critical information regarding the consistency of microarray results across different laboratories and shed light on the strengths and limitations of expression profiling in drug safety analysis...|$|E

40|$|Bile duct {{ligation}} (BDL) {{is commonly}} {{employed as a}} model for hepatic periportal fibrosis. However, BDL is limited in that it is a severe procedure; is irreversible in practice; the severity of injury cannot be modulated and the procedure is associated with high mortality. <b>Methapyrilene</b> (MP) administration has therefore been investigated as an alternative model. Male rats were subjected to BDL or orally dosed with 150 mg MP per kg body weight 3 times per week for up to 6 weeks. Both procedures resulted in increases in serum alkaline phosphatase enzyme levels and periportal liver injury as judged by marked inflammatory cell recruitment to the periportal regions of the liver lobule. Injury in both models was associated with an accumulation of profibrogenic myofibroblast and fibroblast populations–and to fibrosis –in the periportal regions of the liver lobule. Both procedures also caused an expansion in the number of biliary epithelial cells and a ductular reaction. However, the studies with MP resulted in no rat mortality, in contrast to the BDL procedure. Injury, inflammation, fibrosis and the ductular reaction that occurred in response to MP treatment all reversed within 3 weeks after MP treatment withdrawal. The MP model of periportal fibrosis is therefore a superior –more refined–model of periportal fibrosis than BDL since the degree of injury may be modulated (through alterations in injuring MP dose); the procedure is less severe; is subject to minimal mortality and is reversible (and therefore a more sensitive model to identify effective anti-fibrogenic drugs).

Here, we examined the liver microRNA profile of male Fischer rats exposed through their diet to genotoxic (2 -acetylaminofluorene) and epigenetic (phenobarbital, diethylhexylphthalate, <b>methapyrilene</b> HCL, monuron, and chlorendic acid) chemical hepatocarcinogens, as well as to non-hepatocarcinogenic treatments (benzophenone, and diethylthiourea) for 3 months. The effects of these treatments on liver pathology, plasma clinical parameters, and liver mRNAs were also determined. All hepatocarcinogens affected the expression of liver mRNAs, while the hepatic microRNA profiles were associated with the mode of action of the chemical treatments and corresponded to chemical carcinogenicity. The three nuclear receptor-activating chemicals (phenobarbital, benzophenone, and diethylhexylphthalate) were characterized by the highly correlated induction of the miR- 200 a/ 200 b/ 429, which is involved in protecting the epithelial status of cells and of the miR- 96 / 182 clusters. The four non-nuclear receptor-activating hepatocarcinogens were characterized by the early, persistent induction of miR- 34, which was associated with DNA damage and oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro. Repression of this microRNA in a hepatoma cell line led to increased cell growth; thus, miR- 34 a could act to block abnormal cell proliferation in cells exposed to DNA damage or oxidative stress. This study supports the proposal that hepatic microRNA profiles could assist in the earlier evaluation and identification of hepatocarcinogens, especially those acting by epigenetic mechanisms. © The Author 2012.

Mutat Res 356 : 85 – 127). The SHE assay models the earliest identi able stage in carcinogenicity, morphological cell transformation. In contrast to other short-term in vitro assays, both genotoxic and epigenetic carcinogens are detected. The SHE assay, originally developed by Berwald and Sachs (J Natl Cancer Inst 35 : 641 – 661) and modi ed as described by LeBoeuf and Kerckaert (Carcinogenesis 7 : 1431 – 1440), was included in the International Life Sciences Institute, Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (ILSI/HESI). Alternative Carcinogenicity Testing (ACT) collaboration to provide additional information on the use of short-term in vitro tests in predicting carcinogenic potential. A total of 19 ILSI compounds have been tested in the SHE assay: 15 were tested for this project, whereas clo brate, <b>methapyrilene,</b> reserpine, and Di(2 -ethylhexyl) phalate (DEHP) were tested previously. Of the 3 noncarcinogenic compounds tested, 2 were negative in the SHE assay, whereas ampicillin was tested positive. The remaining 16 compounds tested were either known rodent carcinogens and/or human carcinogens. From this group, 15 tested positive in the SHE assay whereas phenacetin, a genotoxic carcinogen, was tested negative. Therefore, overall concordance between the SHE assay and rodent bioassay was 89 % (17 / 19), whereas concordance with known or predicted human carcinogens was 37 % (7 / 19). Based on these data, it is concluded that the SHE cell-transformation assay has utility for predicting the results of the rodent carcinogenesis bioassay but lacks the selectivity to distinguish between rodent and human carcinogens...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: To reduce {{continuously}} increasing {{costs in}} drug development, {{adverse effects of}} drugs need to be detected {{as early as possible}} in the process. In recent years, compound-induced gene expression profiling methodologies have been developed to assess compound toxicity, including Gene Ontology term and pathway over-representation analyses. The objective {{of this study was to}} introduce an additional approach, in which literature information is used for compound profiling to evaluate compound toxicity and mode of toxicity. Methods: Gene annotations were built by text mining in Medline abstracts for retrieval of co-publications between genes, pathology terms, biological processes and pathways. This literature information was used to generate compound-specific keyword fingerprints, representing over-represented keywords calculated in a set of regulated genes after compound administration. To see whether keyword fingerprints can be used for assessment of compound toxicity, we analyzed microarray data sets of rat liver treated with 11 hepatotoxicants. Results: Analysis of keyword fingerprints of two genotoxic carcinogens, two nongenotoxic carcinogens, two peroxisome proliferators and two randomly generated gene sets, showed that each compound produced a specific keyword fingerprint that correlated with the experimentally observed histopathological events induced by the individual compounds. By contrast, the random sets produced a flat aspecific keyword profile, indicating that the fingerprints induced by the compounds reflect biological events rather than random noise. A more detailed analysis of the keyword profiles of diethylhexylphthalate, dimethylnitrosamine and <b>methapyrilene</b> (MPy) showed that the differences in the keyword fingerprints of these three compounds are based upon known distinct modes of action. Visualization of MPy-linked keywords and MPy-induced genes in a literature network enabled us to construct a mode of toxicity proposal for MPy, which is in agreement with known effects of MPy in literature. Conclusion: Compound keyword fingerprinting based on information retrieved from literature is a powerful approach for compound profiling, allowing evaluation of compound toxicity and analysis of the mode of action...|$|E
40|$|The 500; 0 {{lethal dose}} (LD 50) of {{vancomycin}} for rodents {{was higher than}} that of tobramy-cin but much lower than that of cefamandole nafate. The rodents died in clonic convul-sions immediately after receiving vancomycin. The LD 50 for dogs was similar to that for rodents; however, deaths occurred several days after administration of vancomycin and resulted from renal failure. Rapid intravenous administration of vancomycin to dogs produced a significant decrease in blood pressure that was prevented by pretreatment with the antihistamine <b>methapyrilene.</b> Subchronic administration of vancomycin to laboratory animals in doses of 12. 5 - 400 mg/kg caused no systemic toxicity. Concomi-tant administration of vancomycin and tobramycin to rats resulted in significantly in-creased nephrotoxicity compared to that caused by either agent alone. The nephrotoxic response of rats receiving vancomycin was only partially reversed by large volumes of water given orally before and after the drug. Vancomycin was first available in 1956 and was used mainly as an alternative to penicillin in treat-ment of infections due to penicillinase-producing staphylococci [1 - 4]. With the introduction of methicillin in 1960 and later of other semisynthetic penicillins and cephalosporins, use of vancomycin declined in favor of these potentially less toxic agents [5, 6]. Recent interest in vancomycin has been due to its efficacy against multiply resistant, gram-positive cocci and to some novel applica-tions. Of particular significance is the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis with vancomycin-aminoglycoside combinations in patients who are intolerant of penicillin or ampicillin [7, 8]. Toxicology studies of vancomycin conducted in animal models more than 23 years ago provided adequate data for evaluation of the drug's poten-tial toxicity to humans [9]. This report reviews original published and unpublished studies of toxicology in animals and summarizes recent studies in which new techniques have been used to evaluate the renal toxicity of vancomycin and of vancomycin plus tobramycin in rats [10]...|$|E
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in {{body fluids}} have {{received}} attention as potential biomarkers of organ damage because miRNAs {{that are highly}} or specifically expressed in a given organ are likely released into body fluids {{as a result of}} damage to that organ. We previously determined that the plasma miRNA profile in rats was dramatically changed due to acetaminophen (APAP) -induced pericentral necrosis and <b>methapyrilene</b> (MP) -induced periportal necrosis in the liver. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether the expression of hepatic miRNAs is differentially modulated at different zones due to injury and to examine the relationship of the hepatic miRNA profile with the changes in the plasma miRNA expression profile. Through the laser microdissection of the periportal and periportal regions of the liver and TaqMan microRNA Array analysis, we found that 49 miRNAs are differentially expressed between the pericentral and periportal regions of control rats. In both APAP- and MP-treated rats, the miRNAs that presented decreased expression dominated in both the injured and non-injured areas compared with the miRNAs that exhibited increased expression. The changes in miRNA expression in each region of the liver were compared with those observed in the plasma. Of the 301 plasma miRNAs with expression that was changed as a result of APAP administration, only 21 % were changed in the injured area of the liver. Of the 263 plasma miRNAs with expression that was changed due to MP administration, only 24 % were changed in the injured area of the liver. Thus, the miRNA expression profiles in the plasma do not merely reflect the release of miRNAs from the damaged cells in the liver. This report provides the first demonstration of zonal miRNA expression in the liver and of the relationship of the miRNA expression profile in a tissue with the plasma miRNA profile. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|E
40|$|As legacy {{toxicogenomics}} databases {{have become}} available, improved data mining approaches are now key to extracting and visualizing subtle relationships between toxicants and gene expression. In the present study, a novel “aggregating bundles of clusters” (ABC) procedure {{was applied to}} separate cholestatic from non-cholestatic drugs and model toxicants in the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) rat liver toxicogenomics database [3]. Drug-induced cholestasis is an important issue, particularly when a new compound enters the market with this liability, with standard preclinical models often mispredicting this toxicity. Three well-characterized cholestasis-responsive genes (Cyp 7 a 1, Mrp 3 and Bsep) were chosen from a previous in-house Janssen gene expression signature; these three genes show differing, non-redundant responses across the 90 + paradigm compounds in our database. Using the ABC procedure, extraneous contributions were minimized in comparisons of compound gene responses. All genes were assigned weights proportional to their correlations with Cyp 7 a 1, Mrp 3 and Bsep, and a resampling technique was used to derive a stable measure of compound similarity. The compounds that {{were known to be}} associated with rat cholestasis generally had small values of this measure relative to each other but also had large values of this measure relative to non-cholestatic compounds. Visualization of the data with the ABC-derived signature showed a very tight, essentially identically behaving cluster of robust human cholestatic drugs and experimental cholestatic toxicants (ethinyl estradiol, LPS, ANIT and methylene dianiline, disulfiram, naltrexone, <b>methapyrilene,</b> phenacetin, alpha-methyl dopa, flutamide, the NSAIDs–—indomethacin, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, flufenamic acid, sulindac, and nimesulide, butylated hydroxytoluene, piperonyl butoxide, and bromobenzene), some slightly less active compounds (3 ′-acetamidofluorene, amsacrine, hydralazine, tannic acid), some drugs that behaved very differently, and were distinct from both non-cholestatic and cholestatic drugs (ketoconazole, dipyridamole, cyproheptadine and aniline), and many postulated human cholestatic drugs that in rat showed no evidence of cholestasis (chlorpromazine, erythromycin, niacin, captopril, dapsone, rifampicin, glibenclamide, simvastatin, furosemide, tamoxifen, and sulfamethoxazole). Most of these latter drugs were noted previously by other groups as showing cholestasis only in humans. The results of this work suggest that the ABC procedure and similar statistical approaches can be instrumental in combining data to compare toxicants across toxicogenomics databases, extract similarities among responses and reduce unexplained data varation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} the {{chemical}} reaction between commercially available non-toxic acidic polymers with basic amine drugs was undertaken to study the feasibility of using the interacting products primarily as prolonged release agents, in all types of dosage forms. ^ The mechanism of interaction between the acidic polymers and amine drug bases was studied by potentiometric and viscometric titrations of model polymers, with aliphatic and aromatic amines, and amine drug bases. ^ The interaction products {{of each of the}} polymers, PVM/MA 169 poly(methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride), PVAc- 5 -L (carboxylated polymer of vinyl acetate) and Acr- 525 (acrylic polymer) with dextromethorphan, <b>methapyrilene</b> and phenylpropanolamine bases were prepared. The interaction products of PVM/MA 169 with amphetamine and methaphenilene and PVAc- 5 -L with methaphenilene were also prepared. Viscometric and potentiometric studies and chemical assays of interacted products showed that the acidic groups in the polymers are neutralized by the basic amine drugs to form polymer drug salts, and the neutralization process generally accounted for the total amount of drug combined to the polymers. Other processes, such as adsorption, complexation, etc., do not play the dominant role in the interaction. Drugs with more than one basic functional group tended to react incompletely with polymers containing dicarboxylic comonomer substituents. ^ In vitro release {{study of the}} first nine salts in particulate form, were conducted using a modified U. S. P. dissolution rate method. ^ The dissolution rate of polymer drug salts were unlike simple salts, and after a preliminary induction period, the rate could be best explained by the Higuchi equation for the release of drugs dispersed in solid matrices. The dissolution rate was dependent {{on the nature of the}} polymer as well as the drug. ^ PVAc- 5 -L-dextromethorphan and Acr- 525 -dextromethorphan salts, in suspension form, were found to be stable to leach-out dissolution when suspended in a vehicle of neutral pH and normal storage conditions. ^ A PVAc- 5 -L-dextromethorphan polymer drug salt suspension was evaluated in vivo by the histamine vapor test in guinea pigs, and produced a statistically significant duration of increased action of 5. 83 hours, compared to 2. 25 hours for a free drug suspension....
