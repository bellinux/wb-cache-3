40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} clinical target volume (CTV) shape and size on CTV to planning target volume (PTV) margin expansion. Using numerical integration methods, <b>margins</b> <b>accounting</b> for random errors and systematic errors were calculated for CTVs of different shapes and sizes. We use k(r- 95) and k(s- 95) to represent the coefficients, for random errors and systematic errors, respectively, that ensure that every point of the CTV receives ≥ 95 % of the prescribed dose. The part of the <b>margin</b> <b>accounting</b> for random errors depends on CTV shape and size; generally, a convex part of a CTV would have a larger margin than a concave part. However, {{the part of the}} <b>margin</b> <b>accounting</b> for systematic errors is independent of CTV shape and size. CTV shape and size should be considered when generating a PTV. For a complex CTV, the margins of the various parts of the CTV are different and related to local forms...|$|R
25|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the risk of}} default, the product is marked to market {{on a daily basis}} where the difference between the initial agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is reevaluated daily.

Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the spot value (i.e. the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by marking to market). Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates lots of income for the [...] "caller." ...|$|E

2500|$|A similar issue {{comes up}} with the voting rights {{attached}} to the shorted shares. [...] Unlike a dividend, voting rights cannot legally be synthesized and so the buyer of the shorted share, as the holder of record, controls the voting rights.

2500|$|Borrow cost is the {{fee paid}} to a {{securities}} lender for borrowing the stock or other security. The {{cost of borrowing}} the stock is usually negligible compared to fees paid and interest accrued on the <b>margin</b> <b>account</b> - in 2002, 91% of stocks could be shorted {{for less than a}} 1% fee per annum, generally lower than interest rates earned on the <b>margin</b> <b>account.</b> However, certain stocks become [...] "hard to borrow" [...] as stockholders willing to lend their stock become more difficult to locate. The cost of borrowing these stocks can become significant - in February 2001, the cost to borrow (short) Krispy Kreme stock reached an annualized 55%, indicating that a short seller would need to pay the lender more than half the price of the stock {{over the course of the}} year, essentially as interest for borrowing a stock in limited supply. This has important implications for derivatives pricing and strategy, as the borrow cost itself can become a significant convenience yield for holding the stock (similar to additional dividend) - for instance, put-call parity relationships are broken and the early exercise feature of American call options on non-dividend paying stocks can become rational to exercise early, which otherwise would not be economical.|$|E
2500|$|Because short sellers must {{eventually}} {{deliver the}} shorted securities to their broker, and need {{money to buy}} them, there is a credit risk for the broker. The penalties for failure to deliver on a short selling contract inspired financier Daniel Drew to warn: [...] "He who sells what isn't his'n, Must buy it back or go to pris'n." [...] To manage its own risk, the broker requires the short seller to keep a <b>margin</b> <b>account,</b> and charges interest of between 2% and 8% depending on the amounts involved.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of {{extensive}} and intensive margins of labor adjustment over business cycle in Japan.

40|$|In December 2005, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission {{approved}} margin {{rules for}} complex option spreads with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 legs. Only option spreads with 2, 3 or 4 legs were recognized before. Taking advantage of option spreads {{with a large}} number of legs substantially reduces margin requirements and, at the same time, adequately estimates risk for <b>margin</b> <b>accounts</b> with positions in options. In this paper we present combinatorial models for known and newly discovered option spreads with up to 134 legs. We propose their full characterization in terms of matchings, alternating cycles and chains in graphs with bicolored edges. We show that the combinatorial analysis of option spreads reveals powerful hedging mechanisms in the structure of <b>margin</b> <b>accounts,</b> and that the problem of minimizing the margin requirement for a portfolio of option spreads can be solved in polynomial time using network flow algorithms. We also give recommendations on how to create more efficient margin rules for options...|$|R

As with any fiduciary relationship, <b>margin</b> <b>accounts</b> and short selling of uncovered securities are also prohibited.|$|R
2500|$|Brokerage {{firms can}} also borrow stocks from the {{accounts}} of their own customers. [...] Typical <b>margin</b> <b>account</b> agreements give brokerage firms the right to borrow customer shares without notifying the customer. [...] In general, brokerage accounts are only allowed to lend shares from accounts for which customers have debit balances, meaning they have borrowed from the account. SEC Rule 15c3-3 imposes such severe restrictions on the lending of shares from cash accounts or excess margin (fully paid for) shares from margin accounts that most brokerage firms do not bother except in rare circumstances. (These restrictions include that the broker must have the express permission of the customer and provide collateral or a letter of credit.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Where {{shares have}} been shorted {{and the company}} that issues the shares {{distributes}} a dividend, the question arises as to who receives the dividend. The new buyer of the shares, who is the holder of record and holds the shares outright, receives the dividend from the company. However, the lender, who may hold its shares in a <b>margin</b> <b>account</b> with a prime broker and {{is unlikely to be}} aware that these particular shares are being lent out for shorting, also expects to receive a dividend. [...] The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate—though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be short the dividend.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a novel mathematical and experimental analysis of two approaches to margining customer accounts, strategy-based and risk-based. Building combinatorial models of hedging mechanisms of these approaches, we show that the strategy-based approach is, at this point, the most appropriate one for margining security portfolios in customer <b>margin</b> <b>accounts,</b> while the risk-based approach can work efficiently for margining only index portfolios in customer mar-gin accounts and inventory portfolios of brokers. We also show that the application of the risk-based approach to security portfolios in customer <b>margin</b> <b>accounts</b> is very risky and can result in the pyramid of debt in the bullish market and the pyramid of loss in the bearish market. The results of this paper support the thesis that the use of the risk-based approach to margining customer accounts with positions in stocks and stock options since April 2007 influenced and triggered the U. S. stock market crash in October 2008. We also provide recommendations on ways to set appropriate margin requirements to help avoid such failures in the future...|$|R
