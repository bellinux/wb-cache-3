Throughout {{the rest of the}} decade, he appeared in episodes of New Tricks, Agatha Christie's Poirot, and Kingdom, played Mark Thatcher in the fact-based drama Coup!, had a recurring role in the sitcom <b>My</b> <b>Family,</b> <b>and</b> starred in the costume drama Emma. He starred as John Le Mesurier in the Hattie Jacques television biopic Hattie and returned to a weekly TV series role in Wild at Heart in 2012.|$|E

His brother, literary author Lawrence Durrell, also wrote a volume about Corfu: Prospero's Cell: A Guide to the Landscape and Manners of the Island of Corcyra (Corfu).|$|E

25|$|Corfiotes have a {{long history}} of {{hospitality}} to foreign residents and visitors, typified in the 20th century by Gerald Durrell's childhood reminiscence <b>My</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> Other Animals. The north east coast has largely been developed by a few British holiday companies, with large expensive holiday villas. Package holiday resorts exist on the north, east and southwest coasts.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E
25|$|Freeh {{was hired}} by Kazeminy to conduct an {{independent}} investigation of all charges, and {{concluded that there was}} no wrongdoing or impropriety on behalf of the Colemans or Kazeminy. Freeh said both his investigation, and a separate Deep Marine board investigation, concluded McKim made false claims in an attempt to force a larger severance package out of Deep Marine. The Intercept, questioning Freeh's impartiality, reported that nine days after Freeh's investigation cleared Kazeminy of wrongdoing, Freeh's wife received a one-half ownership stake from Kazeminy in a Palm Beach property valued at $3 million. McKim’s allegations were repeated hundreds of times in local and national media reports during the waning days of the 2008 election in what Coleman called “multi-million-dollar attacks against <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> Nasser Kazeminy”.|$|E

25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, <b>my</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

During her illness, Schmirler {{had been largely}} removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler {{held a press conference}} to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: [...] "There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after <b>my</b> <b>family.</b> <b>And</b> the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place.

500|$|The {{book has}} {{eighteen}} chapters with a two-page preface, which explains {{his experience with}} Metamorphosis and how this book complements it. The thesis of this book is identified by one reviewer as: [...] "the importance of childhood's formative years {{for the development of}} the person. In Suzuki's case, it is the effects of racism, notably time spent in BC's internment camps during the Second World War, that still haunt him." [...] In an interview, Suzuki said, [...] "my drive to do well has been motivated by the desire to demonstrate to my fellow Canadians that <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> I had not deserved to be treated as we were". Suzuki identifies a turning point of his life as winning his high school's student presidential election. He initially refused to run believing he was not popular enough. His father encouraged him, saying: [...] "There's no disgrace in losing... The important thing is trying." [...] Suzuki ran and unexpectedly won with an [...] "outsider" [...] platform.|$|E
