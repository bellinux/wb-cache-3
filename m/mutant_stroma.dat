40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} the extracellular matrix (ECM) {{in the development of the}} cornea. After a brief summary of the corneal structure and ECM, we describe evidence suggesting that the differen-tiation of neural crest (NC) cells into endothelium and fibroblasts is under the control of ocular ECM. We then examine the role of collagen I in stromal morpho-genesis by comparing normal corneas with those of homozygous Movl 3 mice which do not make collagen I. We report that, in spite of this absence, the cellular morphology of the Movl 3 eye is indistinguishable from that of the wild type. In the 16 -day <b>mutant</b> <b>stroma,</b> however, the remaining collagens form small amounts of disorganized, thin fibrils rather than orthogonally organized 20 nm-diameter fibrils; a re...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMf 1, which encodes a winged-helix/forkhead {{transcription}} factor, is the murine homolog {{of human}} FKHL 7, mutated in individuals with autosomal dominant inherited dysgenesis of the anterior {{segment of the}} eye (Axenfeldâ€“Reiger anomaly). Mouse embryos homozygous for null mutations in Mf 1 (Mf 1 lacZ and Mf 1 ch) show severely abnormal development of the anterior segment. The cornea fails to separate from the lens, resulting in the complete absence of an anterior chamber. There is no differentiation of the inner corneal endothelial layer, as judged by electron microscopy and by absence of labeling with monoclonal antibody to zonula occludens protein 1, a normal component of occluding junctions in wild-type endothelial cells. In addition, the <b>mutant</b> corneal <b>stroma</b> is disorganized and the epithelium thicker than normal. The Mf 1 gene is normally expressed in the periocular mesenchyme at E 11. 5 but is downregulated as the corneal endothelium differentiates. In contrast, Mf 1 lacZ expression persists longer in mutant corneal mesenchyme, and abnormal expression is also seen in the mutant corneal epithelium. Based on classical studies with the chick embryonic eye, a model is proposed for the differentiation of the mammalian corneal endothelium from mesenchyme in response to putative signals from the lens. Possible roles for Mf 1 in this process are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Human {{breast cancer}} {{precursor}} cells {{remain to be}} elucidated. Using breast cancer gene product GT 198 (PSMC 3 IP; alias TBPIP or Hop 2) as a unique marker, we revealed the cellular identities of GT 198 mutant cells in human breast tumor stroma. GT 198 is a steroid hormone receptor coactivator and a crucial factor in DNA repair. Germline mutations in GT 198 are present in breast and ovarian cancer families. Somatic mutations in GT 198 are present in ovarian tumor stromal cells. Herein, we show that human breast tumor stromal cells carry GT 198 somatic mutations and express cytoplasmic GT 198 protein. GT 198 (+) stromal cells share vascular smooth muscle cell origin, including myoepithelial cells, adipocytes, capillary pericytes, and stromal fibroblasts. Frequent GT 198 mutations are associated with GT 198 (+) tumor stroma but not with GT 198 (-) tumor cells. GT 198 (+) progenitor cells are mostly capillary pericytes. When tested in cultured cells, mutant GT 198 induces vascular endothelial growth factor promoter, and potentially promotes angiogenesis and adipogenesis. Our results suggest that multiple lineages of breast tumor stromal cells are mutated in GT 198. These findings imply the presence of mutant progenitors, whereas their descendants, carrying the same GT 198 mutations, are collectively responsible for forming breast tumor microenvironment. GT 198 expression is, therefore, a specific marker of <b>mutant</b> breast tumor <b>stroma</b> and {{has the potential to}} facilitate diagnosis and targeted treatment of human breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|ClpC is a {{molecular}} chaperone of the Hsp 100 family. In higher plants {{there are two}} chloroplast-localized paralogs (ClpC 1 and ClpC 2) that are approximately 93 % similar in primary sequence. In this study, we have characterized two independent Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) clpC 1 T-DNA insertion mutants lacking on average 65 % of total ClpC content. Both mutants display a retarded-growth phenotype, leaves with a homogenous chlorotic appearance throughout all developmental stages, and more perpendicular secondary influorescences. Photosynthetic performance was also impaired in both knockout lines, with relatively fewer photosystem I and photosystem II complexes, but no changes in ATPase and Rubisco content. However, despite the specific drop in photosystem I and photosystem II content, no changes in leaf cell anatomy or chloroplast ultrastructure were observed in the mutants compared to the wild type. Previously proposed functions for envelope-associated ClpC in chloroplast protein import and degradation of mistargeted precursors were examined and shown not to be significantly impaired in the clpC 1 <b>mutants.</b> In the <b>stroma,</b> {{where the majority of}} ClpC protein is localized, marked increases of all ClpP paralogs were observed in the clpC 1 mutants but less variation for the ClpR paralogs and a corresponding decrease in the other chloroplast-localized Hsp 100 protein, ClpD. Increased amounts of other stromal molecular chaperones (Cpn 60, Hsp 70, and Hsp 90) and several RNA-binding proteins were also observed. Our data suggest that overall ClpC as a stromal molecular chaperone plays a vital role in chloroplast function and leaf development and is likely involved in photosystem biogenesis...|$|R
