40|$|An address voltage {{stabilization}} circuit for the single-side driving (SSD) method for AC plasma display panels (PDP) is proposed. The single-side driving method, which eliminates a common sustaining driver, uses only two electrodes in a three electrode AC PDP structure. The high-impedance (Hi-Z) mode {{operation of the}} data drive ICs during the sustaining period is needed for surface gas-discharge without <b>misfiring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SSD method but it produces the problem that the address voltage increases up to the breakdown voltage. The proposed circuit based on a flyback converter can stabilize the address voltage under the breakdown voltage and provide better surface gas-discharge performance without any <b>misfiring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SSD scheme...|$|R

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, the U.S. Army {{adopted the}} M72 LAW rocket, a lightweight, {{collapsible}} rocket launcher {{with the ability}} to penetrate moderate thicknesses of enemy armor. During the Vietnam War, the weapon was used primarily against NVA and Viet Cong defensive works and emplacements, as there were few encounters against enemy armor. Overall, the LAW was regarded as a success, though its ignition system frequently suffered from <b>misfires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heat and humidity of Vietnamese jungles. The LAW has since been replaced by the AT4 (M136).|$|R

30|$|When {{perforating}} with an abrasive water jet, it {{is possible}} that <b>the</b> pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> (perforation) will be higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> annulus because of water jet blasting against <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> wall, which also is the theoretical basis for the technology of hydro-jet fracturing. This paper analyzes the mechanism of generating pressure stagnation in water jet hole, and puts forward a new concept of hydroseal. Then, the distribution of pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> was simulated with the finite element method. The simulation results showed that <b>the</b> pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> annulus. Also, the lower the annular pressure (confining pressure) and the higher the blasting pressure, the greater the pressure difference. An experiment indicated that the cement sample was lifted up under <b>the</b> pressure stagnation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> which proved <b>the</b> finite element simulation results obviously.|$|R
