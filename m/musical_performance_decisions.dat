40|$|ABSTRACT- In {{the present}} article we observe the significations and the {{dimensions}} of interaction between instruments and performers in <b>musical</b> <b>performance.</b> This will lead us, firstly, to consider interaction as a phenomenon non-exclusively correlated {{with the use of}} numeric technologies. Then, still within the realm of interaction, we describe some of the transmutations introduced by digital music instruments in the domain of <b>musical</b> <b>performance.</b> Index Terms — Digital Music Instruments design, <b>Musical</b> <b>Performance,</b> Interaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{changing}} {{relationship between}} disciplinary and performative elements in <b>musical</b> <b>performance</b> practice {{is a fundamental}} process, which engenders essential changes in <b>musical</b> <b>performance.</b> Not so much the arrival of new electronic music devices, globalization, or the Internet as such, but the distinction between personal achievement and having performative potential creates new types of musical performers and new types of <b>musical</b> <b>performances.</b> It {{is the difference between}} performing something for its own sake, and performing something from the perspective of its effectiveness in a particular situation and compared to other concepts. Considered in a wider perspective, this change of relationship between values seems an indication that we are leaving the Foucauldian paradigm of discipline and are moving toward a society in which performance related aspects become the essential factor in forming discourse and from which knowledge and power are constructed. Change in the structures of <b>musical</b> <b>performance</b> is considered from the perspective of Niklas Luhmann's social systems theory. Change is a result of <b>musical</b> <b>performance's</b> connection with the environment of which the most defining quality is instability. This causes constant pressure for the <b>musical</b> <b>performance</b> system to organize adjustments. In considering the structures that enable these adjustments, the focus concerns change in relationship with boundary construction...|$|R

40|$|This project makes a {{theoretical}} characterization {{of what a}} live <b>musical</b> <b>performance</b> is. This is done by using theories {{in the fields of}} performance, aesthetics, interpretation and communication. The project analysis case is containing two <b>musical</b> rap <b>performances</b> by the rap group Palestinian Unit. We have interpreted the intention behind the performances of Palestinian Unit and revealed how the performances {{can be used as a}} way to communicate the message of the rap group. The discussion is about <b>musical</b> <b>performance</b> in a new context; if <b>musical</b> <b>performance</b> is a good tool of communication; and what the intention of the rap group is when crossing borders to communicate the message. Finally it is concluded that using <b>musical</b> <b>performance</b> as a communicative tool is most efficient when the performer as aware of the context he or she is performing in as well as being accompanied by relevant factual information...|$|R
