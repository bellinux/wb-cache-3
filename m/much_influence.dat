5|$|A {{controversial}} strategy {{proposed by}} Gale {{results in a}} decisive victory in District 2, enabling the rebels to launch a final assault against the Capitol itself. Katniss is assigned to a squad and sent to a relatively quiet sector so that a film crew can shoot propaganda. President Coin sends Peeta along, {{even though he is}} still dangerous and unpredictable. From this, Katniss suspects Coin wants her dead because she has too <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> and has not shown much support for Coin.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln {{lived in}} Indiana from 1816 until 1830, age 7 to 21. It was {{during these years}} that Lincoln first {{encountered}} slavery and began to form his opinions. Growing up in a climate where the state politics were run by men like Jennings and Pennington would have <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> {{on the development of}} Lincoln's views.|$|E
5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), the military-political council {{responsible}} for decisionmaking in the Austrian armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular with the royal court and lost <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> when, against his advice, Austria {{decided to go to}} war with France.|$|E

5|$|By 1967 {{many in the}} LSO {{felt that}} Fleischmann was seeking to exert too <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> on {{the affairs of the}} orchestra, and he resigned. Kertész, too, was {{dispensed}} with when he sought control of all artistic matters; his contract was not renewed when it expired in 1968. His successor as principal conductor was André Previn, who held the post for 11 years – at 2013 the longest tenure of the post to date.|$|E
5|$|Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and {{starvation}} are {{the other}} leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> the population.|$|E
5|$|Other Disney {{executives}} who also exercised <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> within the studio were Roy E. Disney (1985–2003, Chairman, Walt Disney Feature Animation), Jeffrey Katzenberg (1984–94, Chairman, The Walt Disney Studios), Michael Eisner (1984–2005, CEO, The Walt Disney Company), and Frank Wells (1984–94, President and COO, The Walt Disney Company).

5|$|Rensselaerswyck {{continued}} {{as a legal}} entity until the mid-1840s, having survived Dutch and British colonial times, even being given a special patent by Queen Anne to confirm the patroon's fiefdom upon British takeover of the area. The end of the manor came with the Anti-Rent War, when many tenants rose against the successors of Stephen Van Rensselaer III (who had died in 1839), having <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> on the Legislature elections of the time, and eventually intimidating the Van Rensselaer family enough to sell off most of its holdings.|$|E
5|$|The major {{character}} is Arthur Farnham, a wealthy Civil War veteran, likely based on Hay. Farnham, who inherited money, is without <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> in municipal politics, as his ticket is defeated in elections, {{symbolic of the}} decreasing influence of America's old-money patricians. The villain is Andrew Jackson Offitt (true name Ananias Offitt), who leads the Bread-winners, a labor organization that begins a violent general strike. Peace is restored {{by a group of}} veterans led by Farnham, and, at the end, he appears likely to marry Alice Belding, a woman of his own class.|$|E
5|$|Veteran West Virginia Senator Harley M. Kilgore {{offered to}} {{exchange}} seats with Barkley, putting Barkley {{on the front}} row with the chamber's senior members and himself on the back row with the freshman legislators, but Barkley declined the offer. In honor of his previous service, {{he was assigned to}} the prestigious Committee on Foreign Relations. In this position, he endorsed Eisenhower's appointment of Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal. His relative lack of seniority did not afford him <b>much</b> <b>influence.</b>|$|E

5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat, the military-political council {{responsible}} for the armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular at court and lost <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> when, against his advice, Austria {{decided to go to}} war with France. Karl Mack became the new main commander in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the eve of the war that called for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies, rather than three battalions of six companies. Austrian cavalry was considered the best in Europe, and one of the best of the time anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Essai remains Cantillon's only {{surviving}} {{contribution to}} economics. It was written around 1730 and circulated widely in manuscript form, {{but was not}} published until 1755. His work was translated into Spanish by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, probably in the late 1770s, and considered essential reading for political economy. Despite having <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> on the early development of the physiocrat and classical schools of thought, Essai was largely forgotten until its rediscovery by Jevons in the late 19th century. Cantillon was influenced by his experiences as a banker, and especially by the speculative bubble of John Law's Mississippi Company. He was also heavily influenced by prior economists, especially William Petty.|$|E
5|$|In 1533, {{at the age}} of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, {{second son}} of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France. Throughout his reign, Henry {{excluded}} Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favours on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail fifteen-year-old King Francis II. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine {{played a key role in}} the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life.|$|E

5|$|Riot Act is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on November 12, 2002 through Epic Records. Following a full-scale tour {{in support of}} its previous album, Binaural (2000), Pearl Jam took a year-long break. The band then reconvened {{in the beginning of}} 2002 and commenced work on a new album. The music on the record featured a diverse sound, including songs influenced by folk, art rock, and experimental rock. The lyrics deal with mortality and existentialism, with <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> from both the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival.|$|E
5|$|The arts of {{manuscript}} illumination, metalworking {{and sculpture}} flourished and produced treasures {{such as the}} Book of Kells, ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses that still dot the island today. A mission founded in 563 on Iona by the Irish monk Saint Columba began a tradition of Irish missionary work that spread Celtic Christianity and learning to Scotland, England and the Frankish Empire on Continental Europe {{after the fall of}} Rome. These missions continued until the late Middle Ages, establishing monasteries and centres of learning, producing scholars such as Sedulius Scottus and Johannes Eriugena and exerting <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien's works show <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> from Norse mythology, {{reflecting}} {{his lifelong}} passion for {{those stories and}} his academic interest in Germanic philology. The Hobbit is no exception to this; the work shows influences from northern European literature, myths and languages, especially from the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda. Examples include the names of characters, such as Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, Dwalin, Balin, Dain, Nain, Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf (deriving from the Old Norse names Fíli, Kíli, Oin, Glói, Bivör, Bávörr, Bömburr, Dori, Nóri, Dvalinn, Bláin, Dain, Nain, Þorin Eikinskialdi and Gandálfr). But while their names are from Old Norse, the characters of the dwarves are more directly taken from fairy tales such as Snow White and Snow-White and Rose-Red as collected by the Brothers Grimm. The latter tale may also have influenced the character of Beorn.|$|E

5|$|Władysław's {{mother died}} on 10 February 1598, {{less than three}} years after giving birth to him. He was raised by one of her former ladies of the court, Urszula Meierin, who {{eventually}} became a powerful player at the royal court, with <b>much</b> <b>influence.</b> Władysław's Hofmeister was Michał Konarski, a Polish-Prussian noble. Around early 17th century Urszula lost much of her influence, as Władysław gained new teachers and mentors, such as priests Gabriel Prowancjusz, Andrzej Szołdrski and Marek Łętkowski, and in the military matters, Zygmunt Kazanowski. Much of his curriculum was likely designed by priest Piotr Skarga, much respected by Sigmismund III. Władysław studied for several years in the Kraków Academy, and for two years, in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so <b>much</b> <b>influence</b> in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an {{office at the}} University of Melbourne in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books {{on a variety of}} topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had <b>much</b> <b>influence.</b> In 1969 he published Cellular Immunology, considered his magnum opus on immunity, attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote Immunological Surveillance, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.|$|E
