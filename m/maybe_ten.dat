40|$|Combinatorial {{optimisation}} {{methods are}} concerned with an objective function defined over an (exponentially) large search space. Often these are solved with metaheuristics, such as simulated annealing, various evolutionary strategies, tabu search, and many others. However, such metaheuristics are generally rather static creatures with relatively simple behaviours and with most intelligence delegated to the heuristics, the neighbourhoods, selection/acceptance criteria and/or the local search methods that they oversee. This static simpleness has often paid off in terms of simplicity of implementation: Often the metaheuristic is merely tens to hundreds of lines of code, in comparison to <b>maybe</b> <b>tens</b> of thousands of lines to implement complex local search moves (with the associated data-structures needed for them to run quickly). However, the metaheuristics do have some decisions to make, and simple static decisions tend to lead to an over-reliance on careful tuning of parameters. There is a long-standing, but ever-growing, desire that metaheuristics become much more dynamic, self-adaptive, and with inbuilt learning mechanisms, in short, that they become more intelligent. There have been various attempts to add this intelligence. This short abstract cannot hope {{to do justice to}} them all, however, some pointers into the recent literature are...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{presents}} the systematic {{design of a}} class of relational numerical abstract domains from non-relational ones. Constructed domains represent sets of invariants of the form (vj Γ vi 2 C), where vj and vi are two variables, and C lives in an abstraction of P(Z), P(Q), or P(R). We will call this family of domains weakly relational domains. The underlying concept allowing this construction {{is an extension of}} potential graphs and shortest-path closure algorithms in exotic-like algebras. Example constructions are given in order to retrieve well-known domains as well as new ones. Such domains can then be used in the Abstract Interpretation framework in order to design various static analyses. A major benefit of this construction is its modularity, allowing to quickly implement new abstract domains from existing ones. 1 Introduction Proving the correctness of a program is essential, especially for critical and embedded applications (such as planes, rockets, and so on). Among several correctness criteria, one should ensure that a program can never perform a run-time error (divide by zero, overflow, etc.). A classical method consists in finding a safety invariant before each dangerous operation in the program, and checking that the invariant implies the good behavior of the subsequent operation. Because this task is to be performed on the whole program [...] containing <b>maybe</b> <b>tens</b> of thousands of lines [...] and must be repeated after even the slightest code modification, we need a purely automatic static analysis approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} produsage {{developed}} from the realisation that new language was needed to describe the new phenomena emerging from the intersection of Web 2. 0, user-generated content, and social media since {{the early years of}} the new millennium. When hundreds, thousands, <b>maybe</b> <b>tens</b> of thousands of participants utilise online platforms to collaborate in the development and continuous improvement of a wide variety of content – from software to informational resources to creative works –, and when this work takes place through a series of more or less unplanned, ad hoc, almost random cooperative encounters, then to describe these processes using terms which were developed during the industrial revolution no longer makes much sense. When – exactly because what takes place here is no longer a form of production in any conventional sense of the word – the outcomes of these massively distributed collaborations appear in the form of constantly changing, permanently mutable bodies of work which are owned at once by everyone and no-one, by the community of contributors as a whole but by none of them as individuals, then to conceptualise them as fixed and complete products in the industrial meaning of the term is missing the point. When what results from these efforts is of a quality (in both depth and breadth) that enables it to substitute for, replace, and even undermine the business model of long-established industrial products, even though precariously it relies on volunteer contributions, and when their volunteering efforts make it possible for some contributors to find semi- or fully professional employment in their field, then conventional industrial logic is put on its head...|$|R

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{structure in}} the Galactic disk, the Galactic center and the Galactic halo can be delineated more clearly than ever before. In the Galactic disk, the magnetic structure has been revealed by starlight polarization within 2 or 3 kpc of the Solar vicinity, by {{the distribution of the}} Zeeman splitting of OH masers in two or three nearby spiral arms, and by pulsar dispersion measures and rotation measures in nearly half of the disk. The polarized thermal dust emission of clouds at infrared, mm and submm wavelengths and the diffuse synchrotron emission are also related to the large-scale magnetic field in the disk. The rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources at low Galactic latitudes can be modeled by electron distributions and large-scale magnetic fields. The statistical properties of the magnetized interstellar medium at various scales have been studied using rotation measure data and polarization data. In the Galactic center, the non-thermal filaments indicate poloidal fields. There is no consensus on the field strength, <b>maybe</b> mG, <b>maybe</b> <b>tens</b> of uG. The polarized dust emission and much enhanced rotation measures of background radio sources are probably related to toroidal fields. In the Galactic halo, the antisymmetric RM sky reveals large-scale toroidal fields with reversed directions above and below the Galactic plane. Magnetic fields from all parts of our Galaxy are connected to form a global field structure. More observations are needed to explore the untouched regions and delineate how fields in different parts are connected. Comment: 10 + 1 pages.
