The <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day shredders.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has frequently been {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. This confusion was fueled by the resurfacing of an older name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded as being too ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens were also a <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998. The proposal was accepted and the taxon listed as rejected in 1999.|$|E

Multiple concerts were filmed for the band's fifth DVD, titled Chaos in Motion 2007–2008. The compilation of concerts was released on September 30, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{completed}} a final <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song on 21 April 1967. Due {{to the difficulty}} in getting the two 4-track machines to play {{at exactly the same}} time, only a mono mix was attempted. In October 1968, while preparing the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album for release, EMI's engineers created a mock-stereo (duophonic) mix from this mono mix, instead of returning to the master tapes. For the monaural version of the album, originally available only in the UK, the engineers combined the two channels from the duophonic mix, rather than using the April 1967 mono mix.|$|E

Similar packages, WAMP and MAMP, are also available for Windows and macOS, with the first letter standing for the respective operating system. Although both PHP and Apache are provided as part of the macOS base install, users of these packages seek a simpler installation mechanism that can be more easily kept up to date.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics such as Daniel Kalabakov of RPGFan, {{who claimed that}} it was his favorite Super Nintendo Entertainment System-era Square soundtrack, primarily due to the mixture of techno and jazz. He preferred Shimomura's techno tracks, but enjoyed the way the two styles mixed together. Kero Hazel of Square Enix Music Online similarly praised the <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two styles, though he criticized the sound quality of the album and stated that the album would have been improved by using real instruments rather than synthesized ones.|$|E
5|$|The album, {{like their}} {{previous}} record Rings Around the World, was simultaneously released on CD, vinyl and DVD. The DVD featured a surround sound <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album along with animations, commentary by Mario Caldato Jr. (who mixed the record) and remixes. The {{majority of these}} remixes were re-released as the album Phantom Phorce in 2004.

5|$|The group {{carried out}} their vocal overdubs during the {{afternoon}} of 18 October. Over the instrumental break and the outro, the harmonies consist of McCartney singing a third above and Lennon a tenth below Harrison's double-tracked lead vocal. During the same session, Ringo Starr added a tambourine part. Although some Beatles authors credit Martin as having played harmonium, Fontenot says this contribution is inaudible on the completed track. A mono <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song was made on 25 October, and a stereo mix on 26 October – the day the Beatles collected their MBEs from Buckingham Palace.|$|E
5|$|With {{the vocal}} tracks completed, a final <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album was {{undertaken}} with engineer Dick Meaney at the Church in Crouch End during {{the autumn of}} 1991; it was the nineteenth studio in which Loveless had been worked on. The album was edited on an aged machine {{that had previously been}} used to cut together dialog for movies in the 1970s. Its computer threw the entire album out of phase. Shields was able to put it back together from memory, yet when it came to mastering the album, to Creation's dismay, he needed 13 days, rather than the usual one day.|$|E
5|$|Allen Lanier, Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser contributed {{instrumental}} {{parts and}} backing vocals to the tracks as guests. These remain Lanier's and J. Bouchard's only contributions to Imaginos. Columbia Records' complaints about Albert Bouchard's lead vocals pushed him to finance multiple recordings with try-outs of singers, including Jon Rogers and Joey Cerisano, whose performances on some songs {{were used for}} the final <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album in 1988. The new recordings, overdubs by other uncredited musicians, and mixing lasted until 1984. Musicians involved in this second phase of recording included future BÖC keyboard player Tommy Zvoncheck, who had already played with Clarence Clemons, Public Image Ltd and The Dream Syndicate.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary sources do {{not give}} {{reliable}} data on the size and composition of Harold's army, although two Norman sources give figures of 1.2million or 400,000 men. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, but most agree {{on a range of}} between 7000 and 8000 English troops. These men would have comprised a <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fyrd (militia mainly composed of foot soldiers) and the housecarls, or nobleman's personal troops, who usually also fought on foot. The main difference between the two types was in their armour; the housecarls used better protecting armour than that of the fyrd. The English army {{does not appear to have}} had many archers, although some were present. The identities of few of the Englishmen at Hastings are known; the most important were Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine. About 18 other named individuals can reasonably be assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including two other relatives.|$|E
5|$|Every song in {{the album}} is {{available}} either as A or B sides of single releases both in seven or twelve inch format. Seven of the songs out of ten saw US release either as A or B side and UK had the remaining three songs available also as A or B sides of singles. As of 2000 the singles are available in both 7 and 12 inch formats and few different mixes, even though some releases have been more targeted to UK/Europe audience. The original album <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> title track is not available as a single and the original mix was kept for future reissues of the album, unlike the two songs mentioned in the upper note, The single mix did not replace the title track on all future reissues.|$|E
5|$|Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? is {{the second}} studio album and major label debut by the American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on September 19, 1986 by Capitol Records. The project was originally handled by Combat Records, resulting in the first <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album being co-produced by Randy Burns. Capitol Records then bought {{the rights to the}} album and hired another producer, Paul Lani, to mix it himself. The recording of the album was difficult for the band, because of the ongoing drug issues the members had at the time. This was the last Megadeth album to feature drummer Gar Samuelson and guitarist Chris Poland, who were fired shortly after the album's promotional tour for drug abuse. The title track, noted for its politically conscious lyrics, was released as the album's lead single.|$|E
