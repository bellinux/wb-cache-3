40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study to detect warp breaks in terms of weave {{structure}} using MEMS accelerometer based detection system. The system is briefly described. The output signals of MEMS sensors, which were mounted on <b>harness</b> <b>cords</b> of a Jacquard machine, {{at the moment of}} warp yarn break and after the break for a broad range of basic weaves were acquired during weaving. The weaves investigated are commonly used in Jacquard weaving to form patterns. The strength of the MEMS output acceleration signals was analyzed in time domain. The results show that the system is capable of detecting warp yarn breaks for the broad range of weaves studied...|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} instance, injury can {{happen if the}} safety <b>harness</b> fails, the <b>cord</b> length is miscalculated, or the cord is not {{properly}} connected to the jump platform. In 1986, Michael Lush died of multiple injuries after bungee jumping for a stunt on a BBC television programme.|$|R
5000|$|Bungee {{jumping off}} a ramp. Two rubber cords - the [...] "bungees" [...] - are tied around the participant's waist to a <b>harness.</b> Those bungee <b>cords</b> {{are linked to}} steel cables along which they can slide due to {{stainless}} pulleys. The participants bicycle, sled or ski before jumping.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{parts of}} a loom are the frame, the warp-beam or weavers beam, the cloth-roll (apron bar), the heddles, and their mounting, the reed. The warp-beam is a wooden or metal cylinder {{on the back of}} the loom on which the warp is delivered. The threads of the warp extend in parallel order from the warp-beam to the front of the loom where they are attached to the cloth-roll. Each thread or group of threads of the warp passes through an opening (eye) in a heddle. The warp threads are separated by the heddles into two or more groups, each controlled and automatically drawn up and down by the motion of the heddles. In the case of small patterns the movement of the heddles is controlled by [...] "cams" [...] which move up the heddles by means of a frame called a harness; in larger patterns the heddles are controlled by a dobby mechanism, where the healds are raised according to pegs inserted into a revolving drum. Where a complex design is required, the healds are raised by <b>harness</b> <b>cords</b> attached to a Jacquard machine. Every time the harness (the heddles) moves up or down, an opening (shed) is made between the threads of warp, through which the pick is inserted. Traditionally the weft thread is inserted by a shuttle.|$|R
5000|$|The chariot {{that leads}} to victory is of another kind. Valour and fortitude are its wheels; truthfulness and tirtuous conduct are its banner; strength, discretion, {{self-restraint}} and benevolence are its four horses, <b>harnessed</b> with the <b>cords</b> of forgiveness, compassion and equanimity... Whoever has this righteous chariot, has no enemy to conquer anywhere. Valmiki ...|$|R
50|$|Historically {{associated}} with airborne units and divisions, paracord is today {{used by many}} military units in almost any situation where light cordage is needed. Typical uses include attaching equipment to <b>harnesses,</b> as dummy <b>cords</b> to avoid losing small or important items, tying rucksacks to vehicle racks, securing camouflage nets to trees or vehicles, and so forth. When threaded with beads, paracord {{may be used as}} a pace counter to estimate ground covered by foot.|$|R
60|$|Now it {{was seen}} that the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were drawing behind them a splendid golden chariot, {{to which they were}} <b>harnessed</b> by golden <b>cords.</b> The body of the chariot was {{decorated}} on the outside with designs in clusters of sparkling emeralds, while inside it was lined with a green and gold satin, and the cushions of the seats were of green plush embroidered in gold with a crown, underneath which was a monogram.|$|R
5000|$|The TVIS and iRED {{are largely}} {{ineffective}} {{when it comes}} to maintaining muscle volume and bone density. Both the TVIS and the iRED cannot generate forces that are similar to those experienced on Earth. [...] The <b>harnesses</b> and bungee <b>cords</b> used in many of these device cause substantial discomfort, and in the future need to be redesigned for ease of long-duration use. The CEVIS, at its maximal setting, is the only device that can achieve resistive loads that are comparable to Earth.|$|R
25|$|Now a major {{junction}} {{for western}} Connecticut, the city rapidly industrialized. Following the Civil War, it held several iron foundries and factories manufacturing firearms, <b>metallic</b> cartridges, horse <b>harnesses,</b> locks, and blinds. Wheeler & Wilson's sewing machines were exported throughout the world. Bridgeport annexed the West End {{and the village}} of Black Rock and its busy harbor in 1870. In 1875, P.T. Barnum was elected mayor of the town, which afterwards served as the winter headquarters of Barnum and Bailey's Circus and Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.|$|R
50|$|After {{landing in}} Montreal, teams {{traveled}} to the world headquarters of Cirque du Soleil in Saint-Michel. They had to dress in performer costume and complete {{a series of three}} Cirque de Soleil tricks, each partner required to perform at least one. First, one team member was <b>harnessed</b> with bungee <b>cords</b> and had to bounce to gain enough momentum to reach a trapeze. Next, one team member had to roll a large ball entirely across the room while standing on it. Finally, one team member had to scale a Chinese pole. Once all three routines were completed successfully, they received their next clue.|$|R
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine what part of the 'Jacquard' machine was designed by Jacquard himself. He may have combined the best mechanical elements of other inventors, but - at any rate - the machine he made must have differed from its predecessors in arrangement and minor working details. It was similar in most general principles to Vaucanson's arrangement, except that he made use of Jean-Baptiste Falcon's individual paste board cards and his square prism (or card 'cylinder'), which he is credited with having fully perforated on each of its four sides in lieu of Vaucanson's perforated 'barrel'. Jacquard's machine also contained eight rows of needles and uprights as compared with Vaucanson's double row, of which modifications enabled him to increase the figuring capacity of the machine. In his first machine, he supported the <b>harness</b> by knotted <b>cords,</b> which he elevated by a single trap board.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of various attachment methods and designs of platform transmitting terminals (PIT 2 ̆ 7 s) was tested on captive sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, Maryland, during 1989 - 91. Combinations of attachment and transmitter designs included neoprene <b>cord</b> <b>harness</b> with batteries {{separate from the}} transmitter (2 harness designs), Teflon ribbon harness with batteries incorporated into the transmitter package (4 transmitter models), and a package attached directly to the bird with epoxy glue only. Physical effects seen on cranes wearing PTT 2 ̆ 7 s ranged from skin lacerations (caused by rubbing of harness material) to no observed effects (other than feather wear). The most successful harness material and design utilized a Teflon ribbon harness with the 4 ribbon ends from the transmitter forming a neck loop and a body loop joined at the sternum. Time spent by sandhill cranes performing most activities did not change after transmitter attachment using this harness method...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the long-lined power kites used {{in extreme}} kiting sport, the focus {{in this section}} is the short-lined framed large kite. The kite line or [...] "hang line" [...] for best {{controlling}} the flight of the hang glider kite needs to be carefully lengthed; then the line frequently splits to two, three, or four main tethers that connect to the hung kite operator's or pilot's harness. Mike Meier, respected kite glider author wrote How To Get The Right Hang Height [...] NASA used mass-shifting in the Paresev hung-pilot aircraft with a stiffened-frame kite; the hang tether was also stiffened; differently, in sport hang gliding kite systems using the short hang line, the hang loop or first section of the hanging kite line is a flexible webbing; then the main lines to the <b>harness</b> are <b>cords</b> and sometimes webbing that are flexible. Control of {{the attitude of the}} kite's wing is achieved frequently by the pilot's grabbing the kite's stiffened airframe part called the control frame and pushing or pulling the kite's airframe left or right or forward and aft in various combinations; this control system is most commonly called [...] "weight-shifting" [...] although mechanically the situation is altering positions of mass to alter the center of gravity of the entire system relative to the aerodynamic center of pressure in order to effect leveraging moments to control the flight. The place on the kite airframe where the tether is tied is very important as in all kites; such connection or bridling takes into consideration the aerodynamic center of pressure and the system's center of gravity. A key article by Mike Meier Pitch Stability & Center of Mass Location by Mike Meier focuses on this concern of control.|$|R
40|$|The {{treadmill}} with {{vibration isolation}} system (TVIS) {{was developed to}} counteract cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurovestibular deconditioning during long-duration missions to the International Space Station (ISS). However, recent hardware failures have necessitated {{the development of a}} short-term, temporary contingency exercise countermeasure for TVIS until nominal operations could be restored. The purpose of our evaluation was twofold: 1) to examine whether a slick-plate/contingency exercise surface (CES) {{could be used as a}} walking/running surface and could elicit a heart rate (HR) greater than or equal to 70 % HR maximum and 2) to determine the optimal hardware configuration, in microgravity, to simulate running/walking in a 1 -g environment. One subject (male) participated in the slick surface evaluation and two subjects (one male, one female) participated in the microgravity evaluation of the slick surface configuration. During the slick surface evaluation, the subject was suspended in a parachute <b>harness</b> and bungee <b>cord</b> configuration to offset the subject#s body weight. Using another bungee cord configuration, we added a vertical load back to the subject, who was then asked to run for 20 minutes on the slick surface. The microgravity evaluation simulated the ISS TVIS, and we evaluated two different slick surfaces (Teflon surface and an aluminum surface coated with Tufram) for use as a CES. We evaluated each surface with the subject walking and running, with and without a handrail, and while wearing either socks or nylon booties over shoes. In the slick surface evaluation, the subject ran for 20 minutes and reached a maximum HR of 170 bpm. In the microgravity evaluation, the subjects chose the aluminum plate coated with Tufram as the CES, while wearing a pair of nylon booties over running shoes and using a handrail, as the optimal hardware configuration...|$|R
