When asked whether he believed that Japanese fans are less intense, he said it is a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> for bands and when Slipknot play, [...] "it's almost frightening how in to it they are." [...] However, he did note that between songs can be [...] "very awkward" [...] because the crowd is almost silent, whereas the band is used to a more energetic reception.|$|E
500|$|In a {{long history}} of {{conflicts}} between the empires of Portugal and Spain in America, [...] the Portuguese made numerous incursions – some of them permanent – into Spanish-claimed territory. Slave raids by Bandeirantes (frontiersmen from what is now Brazil) into the Jesuit Reductions of Paraguay carried off many Guaraní inhabitants, who feared and despised the Brazilians. The boundaries between the two empires were not resolved and the conflicts continued after independence, when Portuguese America became the Empire of Brazil. Brazil had no practical access to its own territory of Mato Grosso except by sailing from the Atlantic Ocean up the River Paraguay (see map); fear that Paraguay might interfere with the navigation was a source of conflict. [...] Where Paraguay ended, and where the Mato Grosso began, was a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E

Sleepy Hollow eventually earned $101,071,502 in domestic gross, and $105 million in foreign sales, coming to a worldwide total of $206,071,502. David Walsh of the National Institute on Media and the Family criticized the film's financial success from the exaggeration of gore. [...] "The real impact {{is not so much}} that violent images create violent behavior," [...] Walsh explained, [...] "but that they create an atmosphere of disrespect." [...] Burton addressed the concerns as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> [...] "Everyone has a different perception of things.

500|$|Critics of {{evolution}} assert that evolution is [...] "just a theory," [...] which emphasizes that scientific theories are never absolute, or misleadingly presents it as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> {{rather than of}} fact or evidence. This reflects a difference {{of the meaning of}} theory in a scientific context: whereas in colloquial speech a theory is a conjecture or guess, in science a theory is an explanation whose predictions have been verified by experiments or other evidence. Evolutionary theory refers to an explanation for the diversity of species and their ancestry which has met extremely high standards of scientific evidence. An example {{of evolution}} as theory is the modern synthesis of Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian inheritance. As with any scientific theory, the modern synthesis is constantly debated, tested, and refined by scientists, but there is an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that it remains the only robust model that accounts for the known facts concerning evolution.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} what he called the [...] "garden-variety lyrics" [...] of the ballad, James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "Halo" [...] was [...] "the most evocative power ballad" [...] {{recorded}} by Beyoncé, comparing it to the work done by American record producer and songwriter Phil Spector on his Wall of Sound mixing board. Critics have highlighted the similarities of [...] "Halo" [...] to Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella" [...] (2007); Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that [...] "Halo" [...] has the same [...] "icy synths, drivetime rock dynamic, and a similar repetitive chorus". This view was echoed by Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News and Brent DiCrescenzo of Timeout, who viewed [...] "Halo" [...] as a [...] "Bette Midler–level hymn from , lift savior theme". Nick Levine of Digital Spy described [...] "Halo" [...] as a [...] "muscular hybrid" [...] of [...] "Umbrella" [...] and Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love". David Balls of the same website wrote, [...] "Halo' is a contemporary power ballad in the 'Bleeding Love' mould ... Could Lewis have pulled this off better?

2500|$|The {{absence of}} any ICC ruling about matches played before 1947 (or before 1895 in Great Britain) is {{problematic}} for those cricket statisticians who wish to categorise earlier matches in the same way.

2500|$|In his dissent, Justice Powell {{pointed out}} that a lawyer's primary task, even in a [...] "routine" [...] divorce case, is one of {{diagnosis}} and advice: {{to point out to}} the client concerns of which he might not be aware, and ensure that the client addresses those concerns. Powell thought it difficult to enumerate a value for this aspect of legal representation, and hence for consumers to sense how much diagnosis and advice they could expect for a fixed, advertised price. Consequently, {{it is not possible to}} know whether Bates's and O'Steen's assertion that their fees were [...] "reasonable" [...] was an accurate one. [...] "Whether a fee is 'very reasonable' is a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> and not a matter of verifiable fact as the Court suggests.

2500|$|The {{answer to}} the {{question}} of whether Gascon or Catalan should be considered dialects of Occitan or separate languages has long been a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> or convention, rather than based on scientific ground. However, two recent studies support Gascon's being considered a distinct language. For the very first time, a quantifiable, statistics-based approach was applied by Stephan Koppelberg in attempt to solve this issue. Based on the results he obtained, he concludes that Catalan, Occitan, and Gascon should all be considered three distinct languages. More recently, Y. Greub and J.P. Chambon (Sorbonne University, Paris) demonstrated that the formation of Proto-Gascon was already complete at the eve of the 7th century, whereas Proto-Occitan was not yet formed at that time. These results induced linguists to do away with the conventional classification of Gascon, favoring the [...] "distinct language" [...] alternative. Both studies supported the early intuition of late Kurt Baldinger, a specialist of both medieval Occitan and medieval Gascon, who recommended that Occitan and Gascon be classified as separate languages. However, this statement hurts the Occitanist doctrine, which states as one of its fundamental dogmas, that Gascon is a dialect of Occitan, [...]|$|E
2500|$|In cricket {{to throw}} the ball when bowling is illegal and results in a no ball, but until 1960 it was {{undefined}} and it took a strong minded umpire confident of the backing of the authorities to call a bowler for this offence. To accuse a bowler of throwing was to call in question his sportsmanship, in effect to call him a cheat, and could result in libel charges by the offended bowler. A bowler who threw the ball [...] increased his pace, from slow to medium or medium to fast, and the whip of the wrist altered the line of the ball, variations that could easily dismiss a batsman. When applied to short-pitched deliveries the speed and inconsistent bounce of a [...] "chucker" [...] could be very dangerous, as demonstrated by the feared West Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith. Another difficulty for the umpires was that although the upright straight arm was the ideal many bowlers had a slightly bent bowling arm without throwing the ball, and of course leg spinners used a strong wrist action, so it was not easy to sort out the innocent from the guilty. Sir Donald Bradman said [...] "It is the most complex question I have known in cricket, because it {{is not a matter of}} fact, but a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and interpretation. It is so involved that two men of equal good will and sincerity could take opposite views".|$|E
2500|$|Style guides codify {{rules to}} {{minimize}} inconsistency, {{the ultimate goal}} of which is to have the style unnoticed by the reader (that is, to avoid catching the reader's eye, either with trivial differences or with a lot of superfluous hyphens). The style guide rules allow exceptions to avoid awkwardness. For example, a guide will typically say to follow dictionary X's style for any word entered therein, and for words not entered, to close up by default and thus hyphenate only to avoid awkwardness. Such a rule successfully codifies almost all choices and thus leaves little to discretion except a few rare or neologistic words, which are safely hyphenated. This ensures high intradocument and interdocument consistency. Rules about avoiding doubled vowels or doubled consonants are often mentioned in style guides. These appropriately cascade only downstream, not upstream, of the [...] "follow dictionary X" [...] rule, because most dictionaries close up many well-established doubled-letter pairs. (For example, any style that follows Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary thus closes up preempt, reexamine, deemphasize, nonnegotiable, posttransfusion, and hundreds of others.) As mentioned earlier, the definition of [...] "awkwardness" [...] for any given word is inherently subjective but nonetheless also subject to consensus. For example, reexamine and deemphasize are accepted as nonawkward by a broad consensus; to prefer the hyphenated styling is a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> but to insist that the solid styling is awkward would be considered pedantic by many educated readers. However, some doublings attract smaller majorities than others in such a consensus; with the /coworker example (mentioned earlier) or with antiinflammatory/, many readers may consider solid styling nonawkward whereas plenty of others don't, and in such cases, dictionary styles may vary (Dorland's, antiinflammatory; Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary, [...] ). Tripled letters rarely occur, but when they do, the hyphen is considered mandatory (thus , not shelllike).|$|E
