5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> difference. They argue that such immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E
5|$|The second sub-plot {{depicts the}} lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly {{boarders}} who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall {{and listen to the}} other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.|$|E

5|$|Presented in {{traditional}} 2-D animation sprites, the game {{consists of three}} modes to help navigate, {{the map of the}} Dragon World, the area maps, and the battle mode. The world map will be available from the start, and will allow players easy access to each of the areas throughout the game. On area maps the player will navigate through various places such fields, forests, caves, and towns on the top screen. The touch screen will display available equipment that can be used while in fields. These items are available courtesy of Capsule Corporation Dyno-Caps which can be bought, given, or found in various spots and or treasure chests. Many of these areas have obstacles such as rocks and brush which the player will have overcome with ki blasts. However, some of these obstacles require stronger levels of ki blasts. The battle screen will take place at the screen with the party facing off with a monster or a boss, their stats and the command select icon presented via the touch screen. The game <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> to no use of the stylus, forcing players to rely on the control pad.|$|E

60|$|Q. Are {{there any}} other things that can <b>make</b> <b>little</b> sins great ones?--A. Yes; as when you sin against the {{judgments}} of God. As for example, you see the judgments of God come upon some for their transgressions, and you go on in their iniquities; as also when you sin against the patience, long-suffering, and forbearance of God, this will <b>make</b> <b>little</b> sins great ones (Dan 5:21-24; Rom 2:4,5).|$|R

As some generator or dynamo-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear reflectors are frequently also mandatory.

25|$|In July 2016, Edward Snowden criticised Wikileaks for insufficiently curating its content. When Snowden made data public, {{he did so}} {{by working}} with the Washington Post, the Guardian and other news organisations, {{choosing}} only to make documents public which exposed National Security Agency surveillance programs. Content that compromised national security or exposed sensitive personal information was withheld. Wikileaks, on the other hand, <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> effort to remove sensitive personal information or withhold content with adverse national security implications. Wikileaks responded by accusing Snowden of pandering to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.|$|E
25|$|A {{third group}} <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> {{distinction}} between debt and taxes, this group emphasizes reduction in spending rather than tax policy or debt reduction. They {{argue that the}} true cost of government is the level of spending not how that spending is financed. Every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken from American workers, regardless whether it is from debt or taxes. Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{recommended}} to age ripened pu'er to air out the unpleasant musty flavors and odors formed due to maocha fermentation. However, some collectors argue that keeping ripened pu'er longer than 10 to 15 years <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> sense, {{stating that the}} tea will not develop further and possibly lose its desirable flavors. Others note that their experience has taught them that ripened pu'er indeed does take on nuances through aging, and point to side-by-side taste comparisons of ripened pu'er of different ages. Aging the tea increases its value, but may be unprofitable.|$|E

25|$|Qutb's {{experiences}} as an Egyptian Muslim – his village childhood, professional career, and activism in the Muslim Brotherhood – left an indelible mark on his theoretical and religious works. Even Qutb's early, secular writing shows {{evidence of his}} later themes. For example, Qutb's autobiography of his childhood Tifl min al-Qarya (A Child From the Village) <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> mention of Islam or political theory and is typically classified as a secular, literary work. However, it is replete with references to village mysticism, superstition, the Qur'an, and incidences of injustice. Qutb's later work developed along similar themes, dealing with Qur'anic exegesis, social justice, and political Islam.|$|E
25|$|With a {{score of}} 0.943 on the Education Index, its overall rank is 37, but ranks third in the Caribbean after Cuba and Barbados, and second in South America after Argentina. According to DFID, Guyana has {{achieved}} the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education but continues to struggle with the provision of increased access to satisfactory secondary education. As {{one of the poorest}} countries in the Western Hemisphere, instruction in Guyana's schools <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> or no use of instructional technologies such as interactive whiteboards or other multimedia tools. Indeed, many schools are short on basic resources, especially in the areas of science and technology, and this sometimes puts students at a disadvantage when compared to their counterparts in the region.|$|E
25|$|Though image {{intensification}} technology {{employed by}} different manufacturers varies, from the tactical {{point of view}} a night vision system is an optical device that enables vision at low light. The US government itself has recognized the fact that technology itself <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> difference as long as an operator can see clearly at night. Consequently, the United States bases export regulations not on the generations, but on a calculated factor called figure of merit (FOM). The method of FOM calculation {{and its implications for}} export are briefly described in a National Defense University document called “The NATO Response Force” authored by Jeffrey P. Bialos, the Executive Director of the Transatlantic Security and Industry Program at the Johns Hopkins University and Stuart L. Koehl, a Fellow at the Center for Transatlantic Relations of the same university.|$|E

25|$|John Burley's origins are obscure, {{not least}} because his name was not uncommon. Burley is a toponymic surname signifing a meadow or {{clearing}} by a fortified place and is found fairly widely across the Midlands and the North of England. He has been portrayed as a nephew of Simon de Burley, an influential courtier executed by the Merciless Parliament {{at the behest of}} the Lords Appellant. However, this <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> sense in view of John Burley's political position and apparent social origins. He seems to have been a son of a John Burley of Wistanstow in southern Shropshire and a nephew of John Burnell of Westbury, Shropshire. The lawyer John Burley is known from a quitclaim deed of 1397 to have had at that time three brothers: Nicholas, portioner of the church of Westbury, James and Edmund. There seems to have been pattern of having a lawyer and a cleric in each generation.|$|E
500|$|In stanza 8 of {{the poem}} Fjölsvinnsmál, Svafrþorinn is stated {{as the father of}} Menglöð by an unnamed mother, who the hero Svipdagr seeks. Menglöð has often been theorized as the goddess Freyja, and {{according}} to this theory, Svafrþorinn would therefore be Njörðr. The theory is complicated by the etymology of the name Svafrþorinn (þorinn meaning [...] "brave" [...] and svafr means [...] "gossip") (or possibly connects to sofa [...] "sleep"), which Rudolf Simek says <b>makes</b> <b>little</b> sense when attempting to connect it to Njörðr.|$|E
500|$|According to Professor John Meisel, {{who wrote}} a book about the 1957 campaign, Diefenbaker's {{speaking}} style was [...] "reminiscent of the fiery orators so popular in the nineteenth century.

[...] As a new face on the national scene given to outspoken attacks on the government, he began to attract unexpectedly large crowds early in the campaign. When reduced to the written word, however, Diefenbaker's rhetoric sometimes proved to be without much meaning. According to journalist and author Peter C.
