40|$|Summary. The {{total number}} of corpora lutea {{developed}} in {{the left and right}} ovaries of 170 white-toothed shrews (Crocidura russula monacha) differed significantly, showing a functional dominance of the left ovary. Blastocysts were equally distributed in both uterine horns. In most birds, only the left ovary is functional, although rare instances of individuals with both or only right ovaries have been reported (see Sadleir, 1973). In other vertebrate groups ovarian asym¬ <b>metry</b> is <b>an</b> unusual phenomenon and is rare among mammals, although it has been found in the platypus, in some marsupials and in eutherians (see Mossman & Duke, 1973; Wimsatt, 1975). The asymmetry varies from minor differences in the average weight of the two ovaries, to the occurrence of a nonfunctional ovary which can be appreciably smaller than the functional ovary. The data in the present paper were obtained during a wider study of reproduction in the white-toothed shrew, Crocidura russula monacha, which is common in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Ovulation in this shrew occurs after mating or can be induced by exogenous hormones (see Hellwing, 1971; Funkenstein, 1974). In the course of a broader experiment on ovulation, sufficient data have emerged showing differences in the number of ova shed and of corpora lutea (CL) produced in th...|$|R

40|$|Topological solitons - are {{of broad}} {{interest}} in physics. They are objects with localised energy and stability ensured by their topological properties. It {{is possible to}} create them during phase transitions which break some sym- <b>metry</b> in <b>a</b> frustrated system. They are ubiquitous in condensed matter, ranging from monopole excitations in spin ices to vortices in superconduc- tors. In such situations, their behaviour has been extensively studied. Less well understood and yet equally interesting are the symmetry-breaking phase transitions that could produce topological defects is the early universe. Grand unified theories generically admit the creation of cosmic strings and monopoles, amongst other objects. There {{is no reason to}} expect that the behaviour of such objects should be classical or, indeed, supersymmetric, so to fully understand the behaviour of these theories it is necessary to study the quantum properties of the associated topological defects. Unfortunately, the standard analytical tools for studying quantum field theory - including perturbation theory - do not work so well when applied to topological defects. Motivated by this realisation, this thesis presents numerical techniques for the study of topological solitons in quantum field theory. Calculations are carried out nonperturbatively within the framework of lattice Monte Carlo simulations. Methods are demonstrated which use correlation functions to study the mass, interaction form factors, dispersion relations and excitations of quantum topological solitons. Results are compared to exact expressions obtained from integrability, and to previous work using less sophisticated numerical techniques. The techniques developed are applied to the prototypical kink soliton and to the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

These include the small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins, RNA polymerase II, and complexes containing phosphati- dylinositol- 3 -kinase-like kinases. The structure and stoichiometry of yeast R 2 TP and how it couples to Hsp 90 are currently unknown. Here, we determine the 3 D organization of yeast R 2 TP using sedimenta- tion velocity analysis and cryo-electron microscopy. The 359 -kDa complex comprises one Rvb 1 p/Rvb 2 p hetero-hexamer with domains II (DIIs) forming an open basket that accommodates a single copy of Tah 1 p-Pih 1 p.

40|$|Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} chronic disorder in which retrograde flow of gastric contents into the oesophagus causes troublesome symptoms or lesions. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy controls reflux disease in 95 % of the patients and the remaining 5 % have PPI-refractory GORD. Patients with PPI-refractory GORD, unwillingness to take lifelong medication or extra-oesophageal manifestations are candidates for anti-reflux surgery. Candidates for antireflux surgery with erosive reflux disease on upper endoscopy and/or pathological reflux in supine or bipositional body position with a positive symptom-reflux association during 24 -h pH <b>metry,</b> have <b>a</b> classic indication for antireflux surgery. The aims {{of this study were}} (I) to explore indications for laparoscopic antireflux surgery, (II) to compare fundoplication techniques and (III) evaluate physiological effects. Consecutive cohort studies proved that candidates for antireflux surgery with isolated upright reflux, oesophageal acid hypersensitivity, negative symptom-reflux correlation or non-erosive reflux disease benefit from laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) as much as those with classic indications for surgery. Consequently, indications for antireflux surgery should be broadened and fundoplication should not be withheld from these patients. On the other hand, patients with poor oesophageal peristalsis or high supine acid exposure before surgery should be counselled about their higher chance of recurrent reflux after LNF. A cohort study in 2040 patients demonstrated that tailoring the degree of fundoplication based on preoperative oesophageal motility is probably not necessary, since oesophageal peristalsis before surgery has no impact on postfundoplication dysphagia. A small cohort study found that LNF for failed endoluminal EsophyX fundoplication provides satisfactory reflux control, but is associated with a risk of gastric perforations during LNF and a high rate of postfundoplication dysphagia. The ten-year results of a randomised clinical trial (RCT) in 146 patients demonstrated that laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery reduces the reoperation rate for incisional hernia (2. 5 %versus 13. 0 %) with similar long-term effectiveness compared with conventional fundoplication. Surgeon experience, however, affected early outcome of laparoscopic fundoplication and this pleads for centralisation of expertise. LNF is the most frequently performed operation for GORD. Dysphagia and gas-related symptoms are the main side-effects of LNF and a study that preformed impedance monitoring before and after LNF demonstrated that the latter are caused by a {{reduction in the number of}} gastric belches that is accompanied by an increase in oesophageal belching. Partial laparoscopic anterior (LAF) and Toupet fundoplication (LTF) have been proposed to reduce these symptoms. The 5 -year results of 4 RCTs in 425 patients demonstrated that 90 LAF provides inferior long-term reflux control compared with LNF. In contrast, 180 LAF reduced dysphagia and gas-related symptoms compared with LNF, with similar long-term control of reflux symptoms. In a meta-analysis of RCTs, LTF was associated with fewer reinterventions (3. 1 %versus 7. 0 %), less dysphagia and fewer gas-related symptoms, with similar reflux control compared with LNF. A subsequent impedance study shed light on the physiological origin of these findings and found that LNF and LTF similarly control acid and weakly acidic reflux, with a smaller reduction of gastric belches. Therefore, 180 LAF and LTF should be considered the surgical procedure of choice for GOR...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced GAmma Tracking Array (AGATA) {{project is}} an European collabora- tion project that is aiming to {{construct}} a next generation gamma-ray spectrometer for nuclear-structure applications. The final array will consist of 180 highly-segmented HPGe detectors mounted into 60 triple clusters forming a full 4 π shell. AGATA will utilise pulse-shape analysis and gamma-ray tracking to achieve high photopeak efficiency and peak-to-total. Central to the AGATA spectrometer is the Nouvelle Ac- quisition temps-Réel Version 1. 2 Avec Linux (NARVAL) data-acquisition system that will perform pulse-shape analysis and gamma-ray tracking calculations in real time (online). The system is comprised of separate blocks of actions, called actors. Each one containing a self-sufficient piece of code designed for a specific action. AGATA data can be downloaded and replayed through an offline version of NARVAL, known as the NARVAL-emulator. With a new format and techniques there is need to define new methodology to analyse the data. Discussed {{in the first part}} of this work will be processing of AGATA data and how by utilising the actors of the NARVAL-emulator different output formats can be chosen. In the next part of this work, the Compton polarimetry capability of an AGATA triple cluster will be investigated by utilising pulse-shape analysis and the detector’s granularity. The basic design of a Compton polarimeter consists of two detectors; one acting as a scatterer and the second as a absorber. The same principles apply to an AGATA triple cluster with each sector act- ing as the scatterer and absorber. The pulse-shape analysis algorithm identifies the positions and energies of the interaction points. Data was obtained from the heavy- ion fusion-evaporation of 110 Pd (32 S, 4 n) 138 Sm at 135 MeV was used to investigate the Compton polarimetry capability of an AGATA triple cluster. This work utilised the phenomenon that the scattering cross-section for gamma rays is larger in the direction perpendicular to its electric field vector than parallel. This is described by the differ- ential Compton scattering cross-section for polarised gamma rays. A useful event to determine linear polarisation occurs if the incident gamma ray is Compton scattered from the first interaction and then fully absorbed at the second interaction. The sum of the energies deposited in the two interactions gives the energy while the azimuthal scattering angle contains the linear polarisation information. To determine the linear polarisation of a gamma ray, a polarisation sensitivity and asymmetry measurement can be made. Such measurements were made in this work using gamma rays from 138 Sm of known linear polarisations. The polarisation sensitivity method utilised the incident and scattered gamma-ray energy, in addition to the azimuthal scattering an- gle information produced from the pulse-shape analysis algorithm. The experimental polarisation sensitivities ranged from 5. 0 ± 0. 3 % at 139. 7 keV to 16. 4 ± 0. 1 % at 1287 keV. A asymmetry measurement was carried by determining the number of gamma rays that scattered perpendicular and parallel to the reaction plane. <b>A</b> positive asym- <b>metry</b> would indicate <b>an</b> electric transition and a negative a magnetic one. It was found that there was partial consistency with expectation. From the asymmetry and polarisation sensitivity measurement an experimental linear polarisation for each gamma ray was determined. The result should be in the range − 1 ≤P(θγ) ≤+ 1 with the sign propagating through from the asymmetry measurement. Finally a coinci- dence efficiency and figure of merit was measured and are given as 32. 6 ± 1. 0 % and 3. 9 ± 0. 2 %, respectively at 346. 9 keV.

Tan- shinone Ⅰ, tanshinone ⅡA and cryptotanshinone are major active components isolated from the roots of Danshen, has been shown anti-inflammatory, anti- oxidative and cytotoxic activities. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effect and mechanisms of action of tanshinoneⅠ, tanshinone ⅡA and crypto- tanshinone in highly invasive human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (CL 1 - 5). Results showed that tanshinoneⅠ, tanshinone ⅡA and cryptotanshinone sig- nificantly inhibited CL 1 - 5 cells growth in low concentration (10, 10 and 5 µg/ml) and time dependent. After coculture with macrophages, lung cancer cell lines exhibited higher invasive potentials and matrix-degrading activities. TanshinoneⅠ, tanshinone ⅡA and cryptotanshinone inhibited macrophage-conditioned medium induced lung cancer cell migration activity and inhibited gelatinase activity in the media. Matrigel-based invasion assay showed that tanshinoneⅠand tanshinone ⅡA inhibited in vitro invasive activity of CL 1 - 5 cells induced by macrophage- conditioned medium. TanshinoneⅠand tanshinone ⅡA inhibited macrophage- conditioned medium induced IL- 8 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner as measured by real-time quantitative PCR. The inhibition of IL- 8 induction by tan- shinoneⅠand tanshinone ⅡA is a transcriptional event, as shown by tanshinone Ⅰand tanshinone ⅡA significant reduction of IL- 8 promoter-luciferase reporter activities. By electrophoretic mobility assay, tanshinoneⅠ significantly reduced the AP- 1 and NF-κB binding activity induced by macrophage-conditioned medium. Altogether, our results demonstrate that tanshinoneⅠ inhibits IL- 8 induction in CL 1 - 5 cells; this inhibition is mediated by the attenuation of AP- 1 and NF-κB binding activity and blocked signaling pathway. In addition, result from flow cyto- <b>metry</b> analysis revealed <b>a</b> time-dependent increase of apoptotic cells in 72 hours after treating CL 1 - 5 cells with tanshinone ⅡA. Tanshinone ⅡA inhibits growth and proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells by inducing apoptosis. Further- more, put into these active components isolated from the roots of Danshen on cancer cells/macrophages cocultures, utilize metastasis-associated microarray to analysis the gene expression profiles of lung cancer CL 1 - 5 cells that responding to differentially active components, can apply to explain the functional mecha- nisms of different components. Below sublethal concentrations of tanshinoneⅠ, tanshinone ⅡA and cryptotanshinone (10, 10 and 5 µg/ml), several metastasis- related genes were suppressed, including PDGF-β, Shc, Shb, ephrin-A 1, Rab 8, MAPKK 3 and CD 44. In addition, the results of animal experiment showed that tanshinoneⅠ can reduce the tumor volume. To sum up the above experimental results, we conclude that tanshinoneⅠ, tanshinone ⅡA and cryptotanshinone have anti-cancer and anti-metastasis potential, and may be helpful in treating cancer, or assist in chemotherapy. 中文摘要 [...] i 英文摘要 [...] iii 目錄 [...] v 表目錄 [...] . vii 圖目錄 [...] viii 緒論 [...] . 1 一、癌症形成之機轉 [...] . 2 二、非小細胞肺癌 [...] . 4 三、癌轉移 [...] 6 四、血管新生 [...] 7 五、腫瘤相關巨噬細胞 [...] 9 六、發炎反應與癌症 [...] 11 七、中草藥丹參 [...] . 13 八、研究目的和策略 [...] 15 材料方法 [...] . 17 一、細胞株培養 [...] 17 二、中草藥丹參有效成份 [...] 17 三、細胞存活能力分析 [...] 17 四、MTT分析法 [...] 17 五、癌細胞與單核球細胞共同培養系統 [...] . 18 六、試管內細胞遷徙能力分析 [...] . 19 七、Gelatin zymography分析 [...] . 19 八、試管內侵犯能力分析 [...] . 19 九、總量核醣核酸的純化 [...] . 20 十、反轉錄反應與回收cDNA [...] 20 十一、即時定量聚合酶連鎖反應 [...] . 21 十二、大腸桿菌勝任細胞的製備 [...] . 21 十三、大腸桿菌的轉形方法 [...] 22 十四、少量質體DNA之製備 [...] 22 十五、短暫性轉染與螢光報導基因分析 [...] 23 十六、細胞核萃取物的備製 [...] 24 十七、EMSA (electromobility shift assay) [...] 25 十八、利用流式細胞儀來檢測CL 1 - 5 細胞凋亡的情況 [...] 27 十九、基因微陣列系統 [...] 28 二十、雜交探針製備 [...] 28 二十一、基因微陣列雜交法 [...] 29 二十二、免疫化學之呈色偵測及顯色圖形之影像處理 [...] . 29 二十三、資料分析 [...] 30 二十四、生物體內抗腫瘤影響(In vivo antitumor effect) 分析 [...] 30 結果 [...] 31 ~ 38 討論 [...] 39 ~ 43 結論 [...] 44 圖表 [...] 45 ~ 69 參考文獻 [...] . 70 ~ 79 附錄 [...] 80 ~ 8...|$|R
