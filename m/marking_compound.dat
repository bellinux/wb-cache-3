40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to estimate the contact pattern for gear drives. The proposed method {{is based on the}} geometric properties of the generated surfaces of the pinion and the gear and it neglects the mechanical characteristics of the mating members. The key feature of the method is the superimposition of a virtual <b>marking</b> <b>compound</b> over the gear surface that mimics the industrial practice of contact pattern inspection. For each meshing condition the instantaneous contact area is estimated as the intersection of the pinion surface with the <b>marking</b> <b>compound</b> gear surface. Finally, the contact pattern is estimated by the convex envelope of all the instantaneous contact areas in the zr-plane. The <b>marking</b> <b>compound</b> shape is identified through an optimization process to match a target contact pattern obtained, e. g. with an accurate loaded tooth contact analysis tool. The proposed method has been tested with a dedicated FEM software package capable of producing a very accurate contact pattern estimation of the contact pattern under load. Extensive simulations have shown that, once the optimal <b>marking</b> <b>compound</b> shape has been identified, the proposed method computes a reliable contact pattern even for very different surface geometries (e. g. an ease-off on the pinion surface) and assembly errors. The computational cost of the entire procedure is about two orders of magnitude lower than that required to run the full FEM analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{combination}} of chemometric resolution and cubic spline data interpolation was investigated as a method to correct the retention time shifts for chromatographic fingerprints of herbal medicines obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). With {{the help of the}} resolution approaches in chemometrics, it was easy to identify the purity of chromatographic peak clusters and then resolve the two-dimensional response matrix into chromatograms and spectra of pure chemical components so as to select multiple <b>mark</b> <b>compounds</b> involved in chromatographic fingerprints. With these mark components determined, the retention time shifts of chromatographic fingerprints might be then corrected effectively. After this correction, the cubic spline interpolation technique was then used to reconstruct new chromatographic fingerprints. The results in this work showed that, the purity identification of the chromatographic peak clusters together with the resolution of overlapping peaks into pure chromatograms and spectra by means of chemometric approaches could provide the sufficient chromatographic and spectral information for selecting multiple <b>mark</b> <b>compounds</b> to correct the retention time shifts. The cubic spline data interpolation technique was user-friendly to the reconstruction of new chromatographic fingerprints with correction. The successful application to the simulated and real chromatographic fingerprints of two Cortex cinnamomi, fifty Rhizoma chuanxiong, ten Radix angelicae and seventeen Herba menthae samples from different sources demonstrated the reliability and applicability of the approach investigated in this work. Pattern recognition based on principal component analysis for identifying inhomogenity in chromatographic fingerprints from real herbal medicines could further interpret it. © 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Objectives: We {{evaluated}} two reported high affinity {{and high}} specificity NFT-tracers [18 F]T 808 and [18 F]T 807. Characteristics making these molecules valuable bench <b>mark</b> <b>compounds</b> {{for development of}} other NFT-tracers. We studied preclinical characteristics of [18 F]T 808, and explored whether T 807 and other reported NFT-tracers (PIB, FDDNP, BF- 158, BF- 170, lansoprazole and astemizole) share the same binding site on this protein. We further performed autoradiography experiments on brain sections of a P 301 L mouse model of AD. Methods: [18 F]T 808 was synthesized according to a published procedure [1]. We performed a biodistribution study in NMRI-mice at 2, 10, 30 and 60 min (n= 4 /time point) post injection (p. i.) of [18 F]T 808. Radiometabolites of [18 F]T 808 were quantified in plasma and brain at 10 and 60 min p. i. Autoradiography studies were done with [18 F]T 808 and [18 F]T 807 on human tissue sections of AD-brains and P 301 L transgenic mice models and their wild-type controls. Slices were incubated with 0. 74 MBq/ 500 µL of tracer with/without 1 µM of cold reference compounds. Results: Biodistribution studies confirmed the reported rapid brain uptake and washout (4. 91 %ID/g at 2 min and 0. 80 %ID/g at 30 min p. i.). Analysis of brain homogenate extracts showed the presence of two polar radiometabolites and a fraction of intact tracer of 87 % at 10 min and 34 % at 60 min p. i. In plasma, 34 % of radioactivity was present as intact tracer at 10 min p. i. and 26 % at 60 min p. i. Autoradiography on human tissue sections of AD-brains showed binding to tau-rich regions that was up to 75 % displaceable {{in the presence of}} 1 µM of T 808 and/or T 807. Binding inhibition with 21 % was observed for PIB, 23 % for BF- 158 and 31 % for BF- 170. Lansoprazole, astemizole and FDDNP did not show significant displacement. No specific binding to murine tau in the P 301 L transgenic mouse model was observed.

30|$|Because of {{the trace}} amounts of {{compounds}} in the seedlings, their quantitative {{analysis in the}} seedlings was difficult. In attempts to improve the determination of these compounds in A. mongholicus, several studies have been reported. The current method for the determination of these compounds mainly uses high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with DAD or ESI–MS Detection (Kwon and Park 2012; Gong et al. 2015). Being the common analytical tool for various compounds, HPLC and LC–MS both are being more and more widely applied in biological research, and {{have been used to}} quantify the <b>marked</b> <b>compounds</b> in biological samples such as A. mongholicus seedlings (Liu et al. 2015 a; b). However, the threshold of sensitivities of these HPLC methods for detecting these compounds in A. mongholicus seedling is high. Furthermore, the major weakness of these LC–MS methods mainly includes chromatographic running time, which at more than 18  min is considered too long. This is time consuming and not suitable for analyzing large number of sample. Even though some experiments were investigated for determination of some compounds in A. mongholicus (Lv et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2005; Qi et al. 2006), there is no established sensitive method regarding of simultaneous determination of astragaloside IV, cycloastragenol, calycosin- 7 -O-β-d-glucoside, calycosin, ononin and formononetin in seedlings was published.|$|R

The distribution map of total PAHs content was obtained as a contour plot. The concentration range of 16 PAHs varied by over two orders of magnitude from 0. 016 mu g g(- 1) in rural to 3. 884 mu g g(- 1) in suburban soils with the relatively standard deviation of 70. 5 %, showing large differences in the extent of PAHs pollution at the various sampling sites. It was notable that the concentration of BaP was 0. 005 - 0. 270 mu g g(- 1) {{with a mean of}} 0. 055 mu g g(- 1). In general, the distribution of PAHs centered on the high molecular weight PAHs known to be carcinogenic. The 4 - 6 ring PAHs represented about 66 % in rural samples and 70 % in suburban soils of the total PAHs found. There was relatively good relationship among most of the individual PAHs and the compounds of Pyr, BaA, Flu, BbF, BaP, Chr and Ph gave strong correlation (r > 0. 8) with the sum of PAHs. The selected <b>marked</b> <b>compounds,</b> a principal component analysis (PCA) and special PAHs compound ratios (Ph/An vs Flu/Pyr; Sigma COMB/Sigma EPA - PAHs) suggest the pyrogenic origins, especially traffic exhausts, are the dominant sources of PAHs in Beijing outskirts soils.

In the present study, a library of 36 compounds was synthesized by using the pentamidine molecule as the parent compound modified by a 1, 4 -piperazinediyl moiety as the central linker to restrict conformation flexibility. The compounds were evaluated for anti-Pneumocystis carinii activity in a bioluminescent ATP-driven assay. Four of the compounds were highly active, with 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of < 0. 01 μg/ml; four had very marked activity (IC 50 < 0. 10 μg/ml); ten had marked activity (IC 50 < 1. 0 μg/ml); nine had moderate activity (IC 50 < 10 μg/ml); one had slight activity (IC 50 = 34. 1 μg/ml); and the remaining eight did not demonstrate activity in this assay system.

40|$|Wetlands {{provide a}} suite of social and {{ecological}} critical functions such as being habitats of disease-carrying vectors, providing buffer zones against hurricanes, controlling sediment transport, filtering nutrients and contaminants, and a repository of great biological diversity. More recently, wetlands have also been recognized as crucial for carbon storage {{in the context of}} global climate change. Despite such importance, quantitative approaches to many aspects of wetlands are far from adequate. Therefore, improving our quantitative understanding of wetlands is necessary to our ability to maintain, manage, and restore these invaluable environments. In wetlands, hydrologic factors and ecosystem processes interplay and generate unique characteristics and a delicate balance between biotic and abiotic elements. The main hydrologic driver of wetland ecosystems is the position of the water level that, being above or below ground, determines the submergence or exposure of soil. When the water level is above the soil surface, soil saturation and lack of oxygen causes hypoxia, anaerobic functioning of microorganisms and anoxic stress in plants, that might lead to the death of non-adapted organisms. When the water level lies below the soil surface, the ecosystem becomes groundwater-dependent, and pedological and physiological aspects play their role in the soil water balance. We propose here a quantitative description of wetland ecohydrology, through a stochastic process-based water balance, driven by a <b>marked</b> <b>compound</b> Poisson noise representing rainfall events. The model includes processes such as rainfall infiltration, evapotranspiration, capillary rise, and the contribution of external water bodies, which are quantified in a simple yet realistic way.

40|$|Three central {{topics that}} {{have been at the}} heart of {{research}} into second language (L 2) acquisition over the past 30 years are the extent to which properties of a speaker’s first language (L 1) transfer into their L 2 mental grammars, the extent to which L 2 learners’ mental grammars are constrained by an innate language faculty (Universal Grammar (UG)), {{and the nature of the}} development of grammatical knowledge. Much of the evidence bearing on these topics has come from the investigation of the acquisition of syntactic properties. There have been comparatively fewer studies of these topics in other domains of the grammar. This thesis investigates the role of L 1 transfer and UG in the acquisition of two pre-syntactic properties in English by L 1 speakers of Libyan Arabic: noun compounding (a lexical operation) and argument structure realization (a property at the semantics-syntax interface). The participants were selected at different stages of learning English in the classroom to provide a measure of possible development. Using elicited production and a grammaticality judgement task, results suggest some possible evidence of L 1 influence on plural <b>marking</b> in noun <b>compounds</b> and knowledge of the morphological marking of constructions realizing argument structure. But in the latter case L 1 influence appears to lead to a general problem with the realization of intransitive verbs, rather than direct transfer of L 1 properties into the L 2. There is also some evidence of the influence of UG on the representation of unaccusative versus unergative verbs, but no evidence of UG influence in other areas investigated (constraints on number <b>marking</b> in noun <b>compounds</b> and on the the linking of thematic arguments to syntactic positions). Little development was observed across the two groups investigated. Broadly, the results are consistent with iii an L 1 transfer/access to UG view of the L 2 acquisition of pre-syntactic properties, without providing strong support for this positio...|$|R
40|$|Mammals use urine, feces, or the {{secretion}} {{of specialized}} skin glands to mark their territories. These sources can carry different information and, thus, have different functions. Presently {{it is not}} known if beavers (Castor spp.) deposit castoreum (primarily a mixture of secondary metabolites from urine) from the castor sacs and secretion from the anal glands (AGS) together or alone when scent marking their territories. We hypothesized that castoreum would be the main scent signal used in the defense of beaver territories during winter and predicted that castoreum would be deposited more often than AGS. A total of 96 scent marks on snow were collected from January 1 to March 31, 1997 – 1999 in the Bø River, Telemark County, Norway. In order to obtain control material, we chemically analyzed AGS and castoreum from 60 dead beavers collected during January–May 1997 – 1999. We compared the compounds found in the dead beavers with compounds found in the scent marks on snow. Samples were analyzed by using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). All 96 scent <b>marks</b> contained <b>compounds</b> from castoreum, whereas compounds from AGS were found in only four scent marks. This suggests that beavers do not specifically deposit AGS on scent mounds as they do with castoreum and that the AGS compounds we found probably were remnants of AGS from the feet or fur following pelt lubrication or coprophagy behavior. We conclude that castoreum is the main scent signal used in the defense of beaver territories during winter...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} culture media of five fungi involved in esca of grapevine have been investigated. Eutypa lata, extensively studied some years ago, produces eutypine [4 -hydroxy- 3 -(3 -methyl- 3 -butene- 1 -ynyl) benzaldehyde] {{that seems to be}} the most phytotoxic metabolite. Using the same analytical method for Stereum hirsutum, we isolated nine compounds. Sterehirsutinal, a compound similar to frustulosine, but having two vinylacetylenic chains, possesses a toxicity comparable to eutypine. From Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum we isolated nine metabolites that have not been extensively tested, but the simplest one, p-hydoxybenzaldehyde, shows <b>marked</b> toxicity. Other <b>compounds</b> (naphthalenone derivatives) are known to be involved in different wood diseases. From Phaeoacremonium aleophilum we also isolated p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and scytalone. Preliminary results on Fomitiporia punctata confirmed again the presence in the culture medium of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and of a new chromanone biogenetically related to eutypine. The presence of molecules carrying the aldehyde function seems to play an important role in the toxicity of the five fungi implicated in esca...|$|R
5000|$|Because Lapine is {{presented}} in the novels as Standard English, Lapine Foreigner Talk is essentially English Foreigner Talk with a Lapine gloss and thus provides an example of linguistic enculturation for children who read the books. Breaking down the syntax of Lapine Foreigner Talk to compare with that of standard Lapine, Corder finds that they are roughly the same with the only notable difference being an inversion of the proportion of paratactic to <b>marked</b> coordination in <b>compound</b> sentences. Specifically, Corder reports Lapine Foreigner Talk to consist of 73% simple sentences, 15% compound sentences (70% paratactic and 30% marked coordination), and 12% complex sentences (with 60% complemented by the four verbs [...] "think", [...] "know", [...] "say", and [...] "tell"). Valdman further notes differences between the Lapine Foreigner Talk used to facilitate discussion as with Kehaar the gull, and that used to signal the depreciated status of the unnamed mouse (a less powerful animal in the rabbit world).|$|R
40|$|Unlike other Modern Greek dialects {{in which}} {{compounds}} are one-word structures, in Pharasiot Greek – an Asia Minor Greek dialect {{heavily influenced by}} Turkish – compounds are formed by two fully inflected words, where the left-hand con- stituent is <b>marked</b> with <b>compound</b> markers whose shape is conditioned morpholog- ically. Based on structural similarities between compound structures in Pharasiot Greek and in Turkish, we claim that Pharasiot Greek compounding is selectively copied from Turkish. The compound marker role in Pharasiot Greek is assumed by what are originally genitive suffixes by identification of the genitive with the Turkish compound marker, which is exapted from a possessive suffix, attaching to right-hand constituent. We correlate certain structural {{differences between the two}} languages to the nature and the locus of the compound marker. Among these differences is the occurrence of phrasal constituents in the non-head position in Turkish and lack thereof in Pharasiot Greek. We show that the compound marker in Pharasiot Greek attaches to stems. As such, no phrasal constituent can be hosted in the position to which the compound marker attaches. In Turkish, on the other hand, since the compound marker attaches to the head, the non-head can easily host phrasal constituents. We test this correlation against Khalkha Mongolian, an- other Altaic language, in which, unlike Turkish, the compound marker attaches to the non-head. We show that similar to Pharasiot Greek, but unlike Turkish, phrasal constituents cannot be hosted in the non-head position in Khalkha, verify- ing the correlation we proposed between the locus of the compound marker and the availability of phrasal non-heads...|$|R
