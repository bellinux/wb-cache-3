5|$|There is a Vita sancti Oswaldi auctore anonymo (Anonymous Life of Saint Oswald), written {{soon after}} Oswald's death (probably by Byrhtferth) that {{did much to}} spread his cult {{throughout}} England. Later, Eadmer wrote Vita sancti Oswaldi (Life of Saint Oswald) and Miracula sancti Oswaldi (<b>Miracles</b> <b>of</b> Saint Oswald) {{at the request of}} the chapter of Worcester. There is also a life written by Senatus, prior of Worcester, and important biographical information in the Historia Rameseiensis.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how the Confession of Faith would be interpreted. During the 19th century, Old School Presbyterians insisted that the Confession be interpreted according to strict Calvinism, while the New School Presbyterians favored a looser interpretation. From 1910 to 1927, the Confession of Faith was officially interpreted with reference to five fundamental beliefs: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the <b>miracles</b> <b>of</b> Christ.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{wrote his}} Life and <b>Miracles</b> <b>of</b> St Thomas of Canterbury around 1173 to 1174. Though lost, {{it is one}} of the main sources for an Icelandic saga on Becket {{entitled}} Thómas saga Erkibyskups, which survives in a copy dating from the first half of the 14th century. This saga preserves a number of otherwise unknown details about Becket's life and remains one of the main sources for Becket studies. Robert's life also was a source for the work of Benet of St Albans, another biographer of Becket. A modern historian partially reconstructed Robert's biography from these sources. A major source for Robert's work on Becket was the writings of John of Salisbury. A modern biographer of Becket, Frank Barlow, speculates that Robert's biography was lost because it favoured the king's side of the story, rather than Becket's.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of what we}} {{know about}} Columbanus is based on Columbanus' own works (as far as they have been preserved) and Jonas of Bobbio's Vita Columbani (Life of Columbanus), which was written between 639 and 641. Jonas entered Bobbio after Columbanus' death but relied on reports of monks who still knew Columbanus. A {{description}} of <b>miracles</b> <b>of</b> Columbanus written by an anonymous monk of Bobbio is of much later date. In the second volume of his Acta Sanctorum O.S.B., Mabillon gives the life in full, together with an appendix on the <b>miracles</b> <b>of</b> the saint, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.|$|E
25|$|Christian {{authors also}} view the <b>miracles</b> <b>of</b> Jesus not merely as acts {{of power and}} omnipotence, but as works of love and mercy, {{performed}} not {{with a view to}} awe by omnipotence, but to show compassion for sinful and suffering humanity. And each miracle involves specific teachings.|$|E

25|$|Kuber (also Kouber or Kuver) was a Bulgar {{leader who}} {{according}} to the <b>Miracles</b> <b>of</b> Saint Demetrius led in the 670s, a mixed Bulgar and Byzantine Christian population, whose ancestors had been transferred from the Eastern Roman Empire to the Syrmia region in Pannonia by the Avars 60 years earlier. According to a scholarly theory, {{he was the son}} of Kubrat, brother of Khan Asparukh and member of the Dulo clan.|$|E
25|$|Sanal Edamaruku, {{president}} of the Indian Rationalist Association, has criticised TV channels broadcasting shows featuring godmen.

He travels through villages demonstrating the tricks behind these miracles.|$|E
25|$|Christian {{authors have}} {{discussed}} the <b>miracles</b> <b>of</b> Jesus at length and assigned specific motives to each miracle, e.g., authors Pentecost and Danilson suggest that the Walking on Water miracle centered {{on the relationship of}} Jesus with his apostles, rather than their peril or the miracle itself. And that the miracle was specifically designed by Jesus to teach the apostles that when encountering obstacles, they need to rely on their faith in Christ, first and foremost.|$|E

25|$|The British Mandate of Palestine {{that came}} into effect in 1923 aimed at restricting land {{purchases}} of previously Arab-owned land by Jewish immigrants. For this reason the Jewish population was initially more urban and had a higher share in industrial occupations than did the Arab majority. This particular development resulted economically {{in one of the}} few growth <b>miracles</b> <b>of</b> the region whereby the structure of firms was determined mainly by private entrepreneurs rather than by the government.|$|E
25|$|Period (i) {{extends from}} {{the date of the}} alleged apparitions down to 1556, by which date there first emerges clear {{evidence}} of a Marian cult (a) located in an already existing ermita or oratory at Tepeyac, (b) known under the name Guadalupe, (c) focussed on a painting, and (d) believed to be productive of miracles (especially <b>miracles</b> <b>of</b> healing). This first period itself divides into two unequal sub-periods either side of the year 1548 when Bishop Zumárraga died.|$|E
25|$|The Siege of Thessalonica in 617 or 618 was an {{unsuccessful}} siege {{of the city}} of Thessalonica, the major Byzantine stronghold in the region, by the Avars and the Slavic tribes (Sclaveni) who had settled in the city's vicinity. The attack was the last and best-organized attempt by the Avars to take the city. It lasted for 33 days and involved the use of siege engines, but in the end failed. The main source for these events are the <b>Miracles</b> <b>of</b> Saint Demetrius, named after Thessalonica's patron saint, Saint Demetrius.|$|E
