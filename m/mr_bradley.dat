He also makes an ally of Ginger Corrigan, a girl whom he has met in the area, and who successfully draws Poppy out about the Pale Horse organisation. She obtains from her an address in Birmingham where he meets <b>Mr</b> <b>Bradley,</b> a disbarred lawyer who outlines to him {{the means by which}} the Pale Horse functions without breaking the law, i.e. Bradley bets that someone will die within {{a certain period of time}} and the client bets otherwise. If the person in question does die within a certain period of time, then the client must pay or else (one client who refused fell in front of an oncoming train and was killed).|$|E

60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bradley</b> {{looked from}} the {{one to the other}} in mute wonder. Mainwaring cast an imploring glance at Louise, which had the desired effect. Much more seriously, and in a quaint, business-like way, the young girl took it upon herself to explain to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bradley</b> that Richardson had brought the invalid some {{important}} news that would, unfortunately, not only shorten his stay in America, but even compel him to leave The Lookout sooner than he expected, perhaps to-morrow. Mainwaring thanked her with his eyes, and then turned to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bradley.</b>|$|R

60|$|Accompanied by the Franklins, the Rovers tramped {{around the}} various oil wells located in and near Derrickville.
