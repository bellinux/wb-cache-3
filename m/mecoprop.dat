50|$|Chlorophenoxy {{herbicides}} are a {{class of}} herbicide which includes: MCPA, 2,4,5-T and <b>mecoprop.</b> Large amounts have been produced since the 1950s for agriculture. Acute toxic effects after oral consumption are varied and may include: vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, gastrointestinal haemorrhage acutely followed by coma, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, ataxia, nystagmus, miosis, hallucinations and convulsions. Treatment with urinary alkalinization may be helpful but evidence to support this practice is limited.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,4-D is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} selective herbicide which kills many terrestrial and aquatic broadleaf weeds, but not grasses. It acts by mimicking {{the action of the}} plant growth hormone auxin, which results in uncontrolled growth and eventually death in susceptible plants. Because it was discovered in the 1940s, {{there is no longer a}} patent governing the manufacture and sale of 2,4-D, and any company is free to produce it. Thus, it is sold in various formulations under a wide variety of brand names. 2,4-D can be found in commercial lawn herbicide mixtures, which often contain other active ingredients including <b>mecoprop</b> and dicamba. Over 1,500 herbicide products contain 2,4-D as an active ingredient.|$|E
50|$|No {{mixture is}} likely to have all these attributes, but the first two listed are the most important. There is a risk that {{mixtures}} will select for resistance to both components in the longer term. One practical advantage of sequences of two herbicides compared with mixtures is that a better appraisal of the efficacy of each herbicide component is possible, provided that sufficient time elapses between each application. A disadvantage with sequences is that two separate applications have to be made and {{it is possible that the}} later application will be less effective on weeds surviving the first application. If these are resistant, then the second herbicide in the sequence may increase selection for resistant individuals by killing the susceptible plants which were damaged but not killed by the first application, but allowing the larger, less affected, resistant plants to survive. This has been cited as one reason why ALS-resistant Stellaria media has evolved in Scotland recently (2000), despite the regular use of a sequence incorporating <b>mecoprop,</b> a herbicide with a different mode of action.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mecoprop,</b> {{also known}} as MCPP (see Figure 1), {{is one of the}} most {{commonly}} used lawn care herbi-cides in the U. S. According to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), over 3 million applications, 1 totalling 5 million pounds, 2 of meco-prop are used in yards and gardens every year. Only two popular yard and garden herbicides (2, 4 -D and glyphosate) are used more widely. 2 As a selective herbicide that targets broadleaf plants, <b>mecoprop</b> typically is used to kill broadleaf plants grow-ing in lawns and turf. Farmers also use it to kill these weeds in cereal crops. 3 <b>Mecoprop</b> is often sold in combi-nations of several related herbicides (including 2, 4 -D, dicamba, or MCPA). <b>MECOPROP</b> (MCPP) <b>Mecoprop</b> (MCPP) is a common lawn care herbicide. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 5 million pounds are used every year on U. S. lawns. It is typically sold in products that are combinations of several related herbicides and as “weed and feed ” products. Part of the phenoxy herbicide chemical family, <b>mecoprop</b> kills plants by imitating naturally occurring plant growth hormones. Symptoms of exposure to <b>mecoprop</b> include burning skin and eyes, nausea, dizziness, and headaches. In laboratory tests, <b>mecoprop</b> has inhibited the synthesis of DNA (the molecules that contain genetic information), interfered with blood clotting, and inhibited the production of important components of the immune system. Laboratory tests using a commercial mecoprop-containing herbicide showed that the fertility of mice who drank water contaminated with low levels of the herbicide was less than that of mice who drank uncontaminated water. Even the lowest dose level tested in this experiment reduced litter size. A regional study in Canada found that exposure to <b>mecoprop</b> was associated with an increased risk of the cancer non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. <b>Mecoprop</b> is frequently found in urban streams. One study (done in King County, Washington) found <b>mecoprop</b> in every urban stream sample analyzed. In both greenhouse and field studies, <b>mecoprop</b> has caused plant diseases to infect more plants or produce more spores. registered for use in the U. S. in 1964. ...|$|E
40|$|New {{strategies}} {{to reduce the}} environmental and economic costs of pesticides use are currently under study. Microencapsulation {{has been used as}} a versatile tool for the production of controlled release agricultural formulations. In this study, the photochemical degradation of the herbicides MCPA and <b>mecoprop</b> has been investigated in different aqueous media such as ultrapure and river water under simulated solar irradiation. To explore the possibility of introducing cyclodextrins in the herbicide formulations, the photodegradation study of the inclusion complexes of MCPA and <b>mecoprop</b> with (2 -hydroxypropyl) -β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) was also performed. The half-lives of MCPA and <b>mecoprop</b> inclusion complexes were increased approximately by a factor of three related to the free molecules. Additionally, it has been shown that the photodegradation of MCPA and <b>mecoprop</b> is influenced by their structural features. The additional methyl group existing in <b>mecoprop</b> molecular structure has a positive influence on the stabilization of the radical intermediate formed in the first stage of photodegradation of both herbicides. The results found indicated that MCPA and <b>mecoprop</b> form inclusion complexes with HP-β-CD showing higher photostability compared to free herbicides indicating that HP-β-CD may serve as ingredient in these herbicide formulations...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of an aqueous solution containing <b>mecoprop</b> (2 -(2 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenoxy) propionic acid) {{has been studied}} at PbO 2 anodes by cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis. The influence of current density, hydrodynamic conditions, temperature and pH on the degradation rate and current efficiency is reported. The results obtained show {{that the use of}} PbO 2 leads to total mineralization of <b>mecoprop</b> due to the production of oxidant hydroxyl radical electrogenerated from water discharge. The current efficiency for the electrooxidation of <b>mecoprop</b> is enhanced by low current density, high recycle flow-rates and high temperature. In contrast, the pH effect was not significant. It has also been observed that <b>mecoprop</b> decay kinetics follows a pseudo-first-order reaction and the rate constant increases with rising current density...|$|E

40|$|The tfdA gene encodes for an α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme which catalyses {{the first}} step of the {{degradation}} of phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicides such as 2 (2 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenoxy) propionic acid (<b>mecoprop).</b> The bacterial diversity of soil enrichment cultures containing <b>mecoprop</b> was examined by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries of both 16 S rRNA genes and tfdA genes. The 16 S rRNA gene sequences were diverse and clustered with either the Beta- or Gammaproteobacteria. The 16 S rRNA gene sequence from a bacterial strain isolated from an enrichment culture, grown on R-mecoprop, which represented a dominant band in the DGGE profiles, had a high 16 S rRNA sequence identity (100 %) to Burkholderia glathei. This is the first report that B. glathei is implicated in <b>mecoprop</b> degradation. PCR amplification of the tfdA genes detected class III tfdA genes only, and no class I or class II tfdA sequences were detected. To understand the genes involved the degradation of specific <b>mecoprop</b> (R-) and (S-) enantiomers, oligonucleotide probes targeting the tfdA, rdpA, sdpA and cadA genes were hybridized to DNA extracted from enrichment cultures grown on either R-mecoprop or (R/S) racemic <b>mecoprop.</b> Strong hybridization signals were obtained with sdpA and tfdA probes using DNA extracted from cultures grown on racemic <b>mecoprop.</b> A strong hybridization signal was also obtained with the rdpA probe with DNA extracted from the cultures grown on R-mecoprop. This suggests the rdpA gene is involved in R-mecoprop degradation while tfdA, sdpA and cadA genes are involved in the degradation of both R- and S-mecoprop. © 2007 The Authors...|$|E

40|$|Disposal of the chiral phenoxyacid {{herbicide}} <b>mecoprop</b> into landfills in the Lincolnshire Limestone has polluted {{an abstraction}} well 2. 5 km away. Differences {{in the biological}} behaviour of the two mirror image structures of <b>mecoprop</b> (or enantiomers), means that changes in the enantiomeric ratio (ER) can help identify the extent of biodegradation down gradient of the landfill. Deposited as a racemic mixture (i. e. 50 % of each enantiomer), {{there has been no}} change in the ER in the most polluted part of the landfill plume where conditions are sulphate reducing/methanogenic, indicating no degradation. In the iron and nitrate reducing zones of the plume (S) -mecoprop dominates suggesting either inversion of the (R) -mecoprop to (S) -mecoprop, or faster degradation of (R) -mecoprop. In the aerobic aquifer the gradual increase in the ER in favour of (R) -mecoprop suggests faster degradation of (S) -mecoprop. The persistence of <b>mecoprop</b> in the confined Lincolnshire Limestone further down dip is explained by degradation being inhibited by sulphate reducing conditions that develop naturally...|$|E

N-doped TiO 2 Degussa P 25 was also slightly more efficient than TiO 2 Degussa P 25. However, under the same experimental conditions, no degradation of clopyralid was observed in the presence of any of the mentioned catalysts. When the kinetics of <b>mecoprop</b> degradation was studied using UV light, more efficient were the undoped powders, while in the case of clopyralid, N-doped TiO 2 Degussa P 25 powder was most efficient, which is probably a consequence of the difference in the molecular structure of the two herbicides...|$|E

To allow further risk assessment the adsorption and biodegradation was investigated in batch cultures and modell ecosystemes. The experiments simulated worst-case situations during slow sand filtration, aerobic and anaerobic underground passage and in the unsaturated and saturated soil. In general, the herbicides could be degraded partially during slow sand filtration and underground passage, but only under special environmental conditions. The degradation processes showed, that hydroxybenzonitriles and <b>mecoprop</b> can pass the slow sand filters especially in regard to continuous input situations. Under groundwater conditions the herbicides are persistent for one or more than four weeks. The adaptation times and degradation rates of bromoxynil, ioxynil and <b>mecoprop</b> indicated a potential for endangerment during groundwater recharge and bank filtration.

When strain MH was offered racemic <b>mecoprop</b> as the growth substrate, it could degrade both the (R) and the (S) enantiomer to completion, as shown by biomass formation, substrate consumption, and stoichiometric chloride release. However, the (S) enantiomer disappeared much faster from the culture medium than the (R) enantiomer. These results suggest the involvement of specific enzymes for the degradation of each enantiomer.

The herbicides also reduced the incidence of 'whiteheads' associated with take-all injury. In additional evaluations, <b>mecoprop,</b> difenzoquat, and dinoseb did not affect severity of disease on the roots, but whiteheads again were reduced. Diclofop-methyl applied at 1. 12 kg ai/ha in early January often reduced the severity of take-all disease on seminal and crown roots. Higher rates of this herbicide, however, occasionally increased disease severity. The number of seminal roots produced by plants treated with diclofop-methyl often depended upon both application rate {{and the level of}} take-all stress. Crown root and tiller production were stimulated by diclofop-methyl. Low rates of difenzoquat, dinoseb, and <b>mecoprop</b> often increased tillering as well. The responses of the wheat plant to all four herbicides generally were greatest in plots with take-all disease. Fresh weights of individual tillers generally were reduced in response to herbicide application. Stimulations of tillering in diseased plots treated with diclofop-methyl progressively declined when applications were delayed after early January. Grain yields were greater in diseased plots treated with <b>mecoprop,</b> difenzoquat, and dinoseb than in the untreated check in 1982. Grain yield was either reduced or unaffected by diclofopmethyl, regardless of the level of take-all disease present. Herbicides did not affect grain yield in 1983. In vitro growth of three isolates of Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici was not inhibited by diclofop-methyl at concentrations below 10,uM.

This indicates that values found for topsoils can be extrapolated to aquifer materials and that organic matter is the most important parameter for sorption {{of pesticides}} by soils. Column experiments and in situ experiments seem to be the best methods to study sorption on aquifer materials...|$|E
30|$|The FBCR {{system was}} {{developed}} and tested by three experiments investigating sorption and biodegradation of two herbicides (isoproturon and <b>mecoprop)</b> in different saturated materials (hydrofilt and river sediment). Efficiency of the FBCR system was assessed according to criteria i.e. reliability, leaking inhibition, reproducibility, practical of use and cost. The {{results indicated that the}} latest version (Version 4) of the FBCR system has been significantly improved and ready to extend to similar studies.|$|E
3000|$|The trapped plant {{nutrients}} and pesticides may be easily degraded or transformed by {{biological and chemical}} processes. Cole et al. (1997) report the removal of chloropyrifos (62 – 99  %), dicamba (90 – 100  %), 2, 4 D (89 – 98  %), and <b>mecoprop</b> (89 – 95  %) using Bermuda grass buffer. On the other hand, atrazine (98  %) and pyrethroid (100  %) removal is possible using vegetated drainage ditch (Moore et al. 2001) [...]...|$|E
