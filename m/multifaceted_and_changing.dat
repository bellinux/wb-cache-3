40|$|Abstract — The {{potential}} benefits of and business imperatives for continuous assurance (CA) are now widely acknowledged. However, uncertainty remains about how CA may be effectively implemented at a theoretical and practical level. The aim {{of this paper is}} to report on the first stage of a long-term comparative case study research project examining the adoption and implementation of CA in Australian organizations. The research supports three goals, to inform strategies for creating CA capability, increase success of CA initiatives and advance theory. Key preliminary findings emerging from the comparative analysis of six case studies include the: <b>multifaceted</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> nature of CA; the importance of developing and leveraging data analytics capabilities, managing exceptions and multi-stakeholder interactions; the challenges of messy data, complex IT environments and understanding information needs; and the need for senior management support and a strong business case to progress CA initiatives.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to clarify {{alternative}} approaches to organizational analysis, this paper is concerned to stimulate the debate on how an inquiry of organizational phenomena in general, and that of organizational learning in particular, can be accomplished. Encouraging attention to different aspects of various paradigmatic approaches, the paper focuses on critical theory, postmodernism and social constructionism and how these paradigms have contributed and {{can contribute to the}} research in the subject domain of organizational learning. To this end, a paradigmatic review of the literature on organizational learning is offered in this paper. Organizational learning, as the study of learning processes of, and within, organizations, has attracted significant attention in the academe since early 1980 s. There is a plethora of studies on organizational learning, which offer rich material for a paradigmatic review. In this study, we illustrate how critical theorist, social constructionist and postmodernist approaches can contribute to the field of organizational learning [...] We highlight the need for further development of the field, from alternative paradigmatic perspectives, with a view to generating more insights into the <b>multifaceted,</b> complex <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> nature of learning in contemporary organization...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} information in mediating the potential negative effects of uncertainty in prostate cancer {{in relation to the}} individual patient journey, conceptualized as the individual's response to his disease over time. Design. A qualitative methodology was adopted to investigate men's constructions of their experience of information and its changing role in the management of uncertainty along the pathway of care. A cross-sectional design allowed comparison of the responses of men at similar stages and along different time points in the cancer pathway. Data collection was undertaken via focus group discussions and individual interviews. Method. Men from 4 weeks post-diagnosis to palliative care were recruited from hospital out-patient clinic registers and a local support group. Seven focus groups and 22 semi-structured interviews were held involving a total of 22 participants. Transcripts were analysed through a process of theme comparison. Results. Findings suggest that uncertainty is both <b>multifaceted</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing.</b> Its impact is affected by a range of personal, disease related, and social factors. For some men it may bring about positive readjustment rather than a negative response. Effective communication of information by health professionals provides reassurance, knowledge, and understanding the balance of which varies over time and between individuals. Conclusion. Health professionals may contribute to the reduction of the negative effects of uncertainty through communication of information regarding process of care as well as medical issues. Strategies tailored to individual differences in information requirements and to changing needs may facilitate positive adjustment. ...|$|E
40|$|This book {{recognizes the}} {{centrality}} of gender as an organizing principle in the ways water is envisioned, used and managed every day at different locations and in different contexts. Gender intersects with other factors such as race, ethnicity, and economic, social and geographical locations. Consequently, the connections between gender and water are contingent and heterogeneous, <b>multifaceted</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing.</b> As water itself is fluid, so are the social constructs of it, shaping women and men's lives. Fluid Bonds makes gender visible in the various ways water is dealt with, and questions how these ways affect gender and how gender affects views on water. Through a rich offering of case studies, it identifies the multiple and changing relationships between the two, and notes some commonalities whilst gendering the use and management of water. Development experts perceive the connections between gender and water as mainly related to poverty, raising questions of unequal access to resources, and poor sanitation leading to ill-health of women and children. This 'othering' becomes a constant feature, leading to a perception that the 'problems' have been sorted out in gender-wise North. The gendered realities of poverty and water are such {{that no one can}} possibly deny them; the case studies included in Fluid Bonds illustrate various issues: of rights, of access, of health and sanitation, of women’s invisibility in farming and fishing, of women facing the impact of policies, of being excluded from the sustainability agenda, of being 'given' solution from above, and also of women’s agency in dealing with water-related issues. However, the streams of hydrofeminisms coming together in Fluid Bonds also create a common terrain for the scholars from the North and the South to begin a reappraisal of water as an essential and gendered substance. Fluid Bonds brings together a group of experts representing a wide range of methodological approaches, backgrounds and understandings on gender and water. The twenty-two chapters point to the need of greater rights of women in determining how water is used by communities, show how women's roles remain hidden, how their priorities are neglected, and how discourses about gender roles and rights determine women's participation in water management. Collectively, the contributors consider the problematic fluidity and indefinite categories of gender and water, tracing the bonds as well as drawing out some differences, focusing on the gendered nature of water in life, of which women and men, at all times, constitute a part. The book will be of immediate interest to academics, development planners, administrators, educators, activists and water experts (see over for contents) ...|$|E
40|$|Recent reviews on {{research}} into fathers consistently have drawn {{attention to the}} increased knowledge and thinking of the <b>multifaceted,</b> complex, <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> nature of fathers’ role. Paternal involvement has been studied with reference {{to a number of}} variables, including personality, attitudes, and family structure. The concept of “understanding mental states” and of mentalization and the notion and working definition of Reflective Self Function, as devised by Fonagy and colleagues, seem to have important implications for paternal and parental involvement, and for normal development of the infant– caretaker relationship. The aim of our research was to broaden current knowledge and thinking about fathering during pregnancy by investigating how 112 prospective fathers are involved in the transition to fatherhood and how they are able to reflect on their experience. Our aim was to identify parental styles according to May’s concepts and to rate Reflective Self Function in The Clinical Interview for Parents During Pregnancy [Colloquio per Genitori in Gravidanza (CGG) ]. The CGG is a semistructured clinical interview devised with the most recent psychoanalytic views on mental representations taken into account and is aimed at investigating feelings and attitudes toward the baby, the couple’s inner and subjective world. Our results highlighted the complexity of paternal involvement in pregnancy and its relation with Reflective Self Function. Specific relations also were found between Reflective Self Function and the three styles of detachment/involvement identified by Ma...|$|R

40|$|Bisexuality {{has been}} largely ignored by sociologists in recent years. The sociological elision of {{bisexuality}} is problematic, as it contributes to the social erasure of bisexuals. A sociological reclamation of bisexual ontologies supports a broader movement within the discipline towards critical and nuanced analysis of <b>multifaceted,</b> fragmented, hybridised, <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> sexed <b>and</b> gendered identities. This reclamation is aligned with broader movements aiming to shift sociological thought beyond a Eurocentric and USA-centric sexuality/gender studies that relies on unitary and binary notions of 'male/female', and 'lesbian, gay, heterosexual' (LGH). This paper showcases innovative analysis of bisexuality along the key trajectories of identities, commodification, inequalities, activism, and citizenship. It provides a snapshot {{of some of the}} arguments developed in Monros' monograph Bisexuality: Identities, Politics, and Theories (Palgrave MacMillan 2015). The book takes an international approach, using the UK, India, Colombia, and the USA as case study countries, and it utilises original empirical research with bisexual people and others who do not identify as LGH (based in Colombia and the UK). The book draws on, and contributes to, critical intersectional and materialist sexuality/gender studies, and queer studies. The paper will include material provided by research contributors regarding their experiences of identities, sexualities and relationships, and biphobia. It will outline their citizenship claims, and some of the divergences amongst bisexual people regarding these. Bisexual people, and others who do not identify as LGH, are highly diverse in terms ofidentities, and experiences of equalities/inequalities...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 94 - 99. This study investigates {{factors which}} affect the {{motivation}} of volunteer telephone counsellors, including demographic variables as well as volunteers' subjective perceptions of the factors which have influenced their involvement. The {{study was conducted in}} two stages. The first consisted of a demographic analysis of two groups of counsellors from an organisation in the Western Cape, while the second stage involved a qualitative analysis of semi-structured in-depth interviews with respondents who were drawn from these groups. 446 volunteers were selected for demographic analysis, of whom 247 were the full complement of current counsellors in the organisation as of April, 1993, and 199 were ex-volunteers who had terminated their involvement during the preceding three years. Eight demographic variables were recorded for each volunteer: current age, gender, age on joining the organisation, educational level, religious orientation, marital and parental status and length of service. Volunteers were predominantly female (75 %), and were on average middle-aged, well-educated, and Christian (64 %). Approximately half of the group were married. Parents comprised 50 % of the group. The average length of service was approximately five years. Length of service was analysed in relation to each of the other demographic variables in turn in order to discover which factors, if any, were implicated in volunteer turnover. Parental status was the only variable found to be significant in terms of length of service across both current and ex-volunteer groups. A regression analysis performed on the data set as a whole identified parental status as a significant predictor of length of service. The second stage of the study consisted of 23 in-depth interviews. Respondents (12 current volunteers, 11 ex-volunteers) were selected according to a purposive technique which took the form of a systematic, structured sampling strategy in order to maximize the diversity of obtained responses. A descriptive phenomenological perspective was adopted in order to tap the rich, subjective experiences of respondents. Interview data was analysed according to an inductive, constantly comparative approach. Findings based on respondents' self-report suggest that motivational factors underlying volunteer participation are <b>multifaceted</b> <b>and</b> complex, <b>changing</b> in nature ii and salience during the course of involvement (from initial contact with the organisation until termination of participation). Although self-serving motives seemed {{to play a major role}} in influencing participation, especially during the early stages of involvement, altruistic motives appeared to be important in sustaining on-going involvement. On the basis of findings which have emerged from the study, recommendations have been made as to possible strategies that could be adopted by the organisation to improve volunteer management. The most important of these concerns the implementation of a supervision and support structure for all active volunteers...|$|R
