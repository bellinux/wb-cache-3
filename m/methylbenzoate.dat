40|$|Floral scent is {{typically}} a complex mixture of {{low molecular weight}} volatile compounds (100 - 200 Da) which gives the flower its unique, characteristic fragrance. The major components in the fragrance of snapdragon flowers are the aromatic ester <b>methylbenzoate</b> and two monoterpene olefins, (E) -β-ocimene and myrcene. Petunia floral scent consists almost exclusively of benzenoid/phenylpropanoid-related compounds, and is dominated by <b>methylbenzoate,</b> benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde and benzyl benzoate. Using a functional genomic approach, a cDNA encoding a putative salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (SAMT) was isolated in snapdragon and its potential involvement in the production and emission of <b>methylbenzoate</b> was analyzed. Using a similar approach, genes encoding enzymes potentially responsible {{for the formation of}} <b>methylbenzoate</b> and benzylbenzoate and phenyl ethyl benzoate in petunia were isolated and characterized. The molecular mechanisms responsible for postpollination changes in floral scent emission were investigated in snapdragon and petunia flowers using <b>methylbenzoate,</b> one of the major scent compounds emitted by these flowers, as an example. In both species, a pollination-induced decrease in <b>methylbenzoate</b> emission begins only after pollen tubes reach the ovary. Petunia and snapdragon both synthesize <b>methylbenzoate</b> from benzoic acid and S-adenosyl- L-methionine (SAM); however, they use different mechanisms to down-regulate its production after pollination. In petunia, expression of the gene responsible for <b>methylbenzoate</b> synthesis is suppressed by ethylene. In snapdragon, a decrease in S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BAMT) activity and a decrease in the ratio of SAM to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (2 ̆ 2 methylation index 2 ̆ 2) after pollination are concomitant with the decrease in <b>methylbenzoate</b> emission, and are therefore likely involved in this post-pollination change in emission. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{survival}} of microorganisms can be predicted {{through the use}} of active biological containment systems. We have constructed contained Pseudomonas putida strains that degrade alkylbenzoates. The modified strain carries a fusion of the Plac promoter to the gef gene, which encodes a killing protein.

Similar uncontained strains were also constructed and tested as a control. Contained and uncontained strains were genetically stable, and their survival and functionality in soil microcosms were as expected. Both contained and uncontained strains survived well in soils supplemented with alkylaromatics, whereas {{survival of}} the contained strain in soil microcosms without <b>methylbenzoates</b> was markedly reduced, in contrast to the control strain, which survived in these soils in the absence of alkylbenzoates.

40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{responsible for}} postpollination changes in floral scent emission were investigated in snapdragon cv Maryland True Pink and petunia cv Mitchell flowers using a volatile ester, <b>methylbenzoate,</b> {{one of the}} major scent compounds emitted by these flowers, as an example. In both species, a 70 to 75 % pollination-induced decrease in <b>methylbenzoate</b> emission begins only after pollen tubes reach the ovary, a process that takes between 35 and 40 h in snapdragon and ∼ 32 h in petunia. This postpollination decrease in emission is not triggered by pollen deposition on the stigma. Petunia and snapdragon both synthesize <b>methylbenzoate</b> from benzoic acid and S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM); however, they use different mechanisms to downregulate its production after pollination. In petunia, expression of the gene responsible for <b>methylbenzoate</b> synthesis is suppressed by ethylene.

40|$|In many {{flowering}} plants, such as petunia (Petunia × hybrida), ethylene {{produced in}} floral organs after pollination elicits {{a series of}} physiological and biochemical events, ultimately leading to senescence of petals and successful fertilization. Here, we demonstrate, using transgenic ethylene insensitive (44568) and Mitchell Diploid petunias, that multiple components of emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are regulated by ethylene. Expression of benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (PhBSMT 1 and 2) mRNA is temporally and spatially down-regulated in floral organs {{in a manner consistent}} with current models for postpollination ethylene synthesis in petunia corollas. Emission of <b>methylbenzoate</b> and other VOCs after pollination and exogenous ethylene treatment parallels a reduction in PhBSMT 1 and 2 mRNA levels. Under cyclic light conditions (day/night), PhBSMT mRNA levels are rhythmic and precede emission of <b>methylbenzoate</b> by approximately 6 h. When shifted into constant dark or light conditions, PhBSMT mRNA levels and subsequent <b>methylbenzoate</b> emission correspondingly decrease or increase to minimum or maximum levels observed during normal conditions, thus suggesting that light may be a more critical influence on cyclic emission of <b>methylbenzoate</b> than a circadian clock. Transgenic PhBSMT RNAi flowers with reduced PhBSMT mRNA levels show a 75 % to 99 % decrease in <b>methylbenzoate</b> emission, with minimal changes in other petunia VOCs.

40|$|The benzenoid ester, <b>methylbenzoate</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} scent compounds detected in the majority of snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) varieties. It is produced in upper and lower lobes of petals by enzymatic methylation of benzoic acid in the reaction catalyzed by S-adenosyl-l-methionine:benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BAMT). To identify the location of <b>methylbenzoate</b> biosynthesis, we conducted an extensive immunolocalization study by light and electron microscopy at cellular and subcellular levels using antibodies against BAMT protein. BAMT was immunolocalized predominantly in the conical cells of the inner epidermal layer and, to a much lesser extent, in the cells of the outer epidermis of snapdragon flower petal lobes. It was also located in the inner epidermis of the corolla tube with little BAMT protein detected in the outer epidermis and in the yellow hairs within the tube on the bee's way to the nectar. These results strongly suggest that scent biosynthetic genes are expressed almost exclusively in the epidermal cells of floral organs. Immunogold labeling studies reveal that BAMT is a cytosolic enzyme, suggesting cytosolic location of <b>methylbenzoate</b> biosynthesis. The concentration of scent production on flower surfaces that face the pollinators during landing may increase pollination efficiency and also help to minimize the biosynthetic cost of advertising for pollinators...|$|E

Toluene was toxic if applied {{directly to the}} medium at concentrations higher than 0. 5 mM. To provide toluene continuously at a nontoxic concentration, it was supplied in an inert hydrophobic carrier phase.

Toluene was completely oxidized to CO 2, as demonstrated by measurement of the degradation balance. The presence of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase indicated a terminal oxidation of acetyl coenzyme A via the CO dehydrogenase pathway. The use of hypothetical intermediates of toluene degradation was tested in growth experiments and adaptation studies with dense cell suspensions. Results do not support a degradation of toluene via one of the cresols or <b>methylbenzoates,</b> benzyl alcohol, or phenylacetate as free intermediate. Benzyl alcohol did not serve as growth substrate; moreover, it was a strong, specific inhibitor of toluene degradation, whereas benzoate utilization was not affected by benzyl alcohol.

40|$|Pseudomonas putida {{converts}} benzoate to catechol {{using two}} enzymes that are encoded on the chromosome and whose expression is induced by benzoate. Benzoate also binds to the regulator XylS to induce {{expression of the}} TOL (toluene degradation) plasmid-encoded meta pathway operon for benzoate and <b>methylbenzoate</b> degradation. Finally, benzoate represses the ability of P. putida to transport 4 -hydroxybenzoate (4 -HBA) by preventing transcription of pcaK, the gene encoding the 4 -HBA permease. Here we identified a gene, benR, as a regulator of benzoate, <b>methylbenzoate,</b> and 4 -HBA degradation genes. A benR mutant isolated by random transposon mutagenesis was unable to grow on benzoate. The deduced amino acid sequence of BenR showed high similarity (62 % identity) to the sequence of XylS, {{a member of the}} AraC family of regulators. An additional seven genes located adjacent to benR were inferred to be involved in benzoate degradation based on their deduced amino acid sequences. The benABC genes likely encode benzoate dioxygenase, and benD likely encodes 2 -hydro- 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase. benK and benF were assigned functions as a benzoate permease and porin, respectively. The possible function of a final gene, benE, is not known. benR activated expression of a benA-lacZ reporter fusion in response to benzoate. It also activated expression of a meta cleavage operon promoter-lacZ fusion inserted in an E. coli chromosome. Third, benR was required for benzoate-mediated repression of pcaK-lacZ fusion expression. The benA promoter region contains a direct repeat sequence that matches the XylS binding site previously defined for the meta cleavage operon promoter. It is likely that BenR binds to the promoter region of chromosomal benzoate degradation genes and plasmid-encoded <b>methylbenzoate</b> degradation genes to activate gene expression in response to benzoate.

The apparatus itself is also broken down into its component parts and discussed. UED has the capability of studying both ground and excited state systems, which will be demonstrated by example. A number of molecules were studied in their ground states (chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, iodobenzene, 2 -fluoropyridine, acetylacetone, benzaldehyde, acetophenone, and <b>methylbenzoate).</b> The structures were determined and compared with structures derived by theoretical calculations and with the results of previous gas electron diffraction inquiries.

Maximal emission of MeSA was observed following alamethicin treatment of leaves. A gene (AtBSMT 1) encoding a protein with both benzoic acid (BA) and salicylic acid (SA) carboxyl methyltransferase activities was identified using a biochemical genomics approach. Its ortholog (AlBSMT 1) in A. [*]lyrata, a close relative of A. [*]thaliana, was also isolated. The AtBSMT 1 protein utilizes SA more efficiently than BA, whereas AlBSMT 1 catalyzes the methylation of SA less effectively than that of BA. The AtBSMT 1 and AlBSMT 1 genes showed expression in leaves under normal growth conditions and were more highly expressed in the flowers. In A. [*]thaliana leaves, the expression of AtBSMT 1 was induced by alamethicin, Plutella xylostella herbivory, uprooting, physical wounding, and methyl jasmonate. SA was not an effective inducer. Using a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter approach, the promoter activity of AtBSMT 1 was localized to the sepals of flowers, and also to leaf trichomes and hydathodes. Upon thrip damage to leaves, AtBSMT 1 promoter activity was induced specifically around the lesions...|$|E
40|$|Mutant {{strains of}} Pseudomonas putida (arvilla) mt- 2 which {{have lost the}} ability to grow at the expense of m- or p-toluate (<b>methyl{{benzoate}})</b> but retain the ability to grow with benzoate arise spontaneously during growth on benzoate; this genetic loss occurs to a lesser extent during growth on nonaromatic carbon sources in the presence of mitomycin C. The mutants have totally lost the activity of the enzymes of the divergent meta pathway {{with the possible exception of}} 2 -oxopent- 4 -enoate hydratase and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -oxovalerate aldolase; unlike the wild type they utilize benzoate by the ortho pathway. Evidence is presented that these mutants have lost a plasmid coding for the enzymes of the meta pathway, which may be transmitted back to them or into other P. putida strains. Preliminary results from these mutants and from a mutant defective in the regulation of the plasmid-carried pathway suggest that the wild type contains two benzoate oxidase systems, one on the plasmid which is nonspecific in both its catalysis and its induction and one on the chromosome which is more specific to benzoate as substrate and is specifically induced by benzoate...|$|E
40|$|Petunia hybrida line W 115 (Mitchell) has {{large white}} flowers that produce a {{pleasant}} fragrance. By applying solid phase micro extraction (SPME) techniques coupled to GC-MS analysis, volatile emission was monitored in vivo using a targeted metabolomics approach. Mature flowers released predominantly benzenoid compounds of which benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, <b>methylbenzoate,</b> phenylethylalcohol, iso-eugenol and benzylbenzoate were most abundant. This emission had a circadian rhythm reaching its maximum at dusk. During petal limb expansion two sesquiterpenes were emitted by the petunia flowers, tentatively identified as germacrene D and cadina- 3, 9 -diene. In vitro {{analysis showed that}} the petal limbs and stigma were the main producers of the benzenoids and sesquiterpenes, respectively. Moreover, comparison of in vivo and in vitro analysis indicated that volatiles were not stored during periods of low emission but rather were synthesized de novo. DNA-microarray analysis revealed that genes of the pathways leading {{to the production of}} volatile benzenoids were upregulated late during the day, preceding the increase of volatile emission. RNA-gel blot analyses confirmed that the levels of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) synthase transcripts increased towards the evening. Our results suggest that the circadian production of volatile benzenoids in petunia W 115 is, at least partly, regulated at the transcript level...|$|E
40|$|In plants, {{benzoic acid}} (BA) is {{believed}} to be synthesized from Phe through shortening of the propyl side chain by two carbons. It is hypothesized that this chain shortening occurs via either a b-oxidative or non-b-oxidative pathway. Previous in vivo isotope labeling and metabolic flux analysis of the benzenoid network in petunia (Petunia hybrida) flowers revealed that both pathways yield benzenoid compounds and that benzylbenzoate is an intermediate between L-Phe and BA. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic petunia plants in which the expression of BPBT, the gene encoding the enzyme that uses benzoyl-CoA and benzyl alcohol to make benzylbenzoate, was reduced or eliminated. Elimination of benzylbenzoate formation decreased the endogenous pool of BA and <b>methylbenzoate</b> emission but increased emission of benzyl alcohol and benzylaldehyde, confirming the contribution of benzylbenzoate to BA formation. Labeling experiments with 2 H 5 -Phe revealed a dilution of isotopic abundance in most measured compounds in the dark, suggesting an alternative pathway from a precursor other than Phe, possibly phenylpyruvate. Suppression of BPBT activity also affected the overall morphology of petunia plants, resulting in larger flowers and leaves, thicker stems, and longer internodes, which was consistent with the increased auxin transport in transgenic plants. This suggests that BPBT is involved in metabolic processes in vegetative tissues as well...|$|E
40|$|Floral {{scent of}} 13 night-flowering Silene species (Caryophyllaceae) was {{collected}} by head-space adsorption and analysed via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Benzenoids together with isoprenoids dominated the scent in all species.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{isolation}} of Pseudomonas cepacia MB 2, {{believed to be the}} first microorganism to utilize 2 -methylbenzoic acid as the sole carbon source. Its growth range included all mono- and dimethylbenzoates (with the exception of 2, 5 - and 2, 6 -dimethylbenzoates) and 3 -chloro- 2 -methylbenzoate (but not 4 - or 5 -chloro- 2 -methylbenzoate) but not chlorobenzoates lacking a methyl group. 2 -Chlorobenzoate, 3 -chlorobenzoate, and 2, 3 -, 2, 4 -, and 3, 4 -dichlorobenzoates inhibited growth of MB 2 on 2 -methylbenzoate as a result of cometabolism to the corresponding chlorinated catechols which blocked the key enzyme catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase. A metapyrocatechase-negative mutant, MB 2 -G 5, showed accumulation of dimethylcatechols from 2, 3 - and 3, 4 -dimethylbenzoates, and phenols were detected in resting-cell transformation extracts bearing the same substitution pattern as the original substrate, presumably following thermal degradation of the intermediate dihydrodiol. 2 -Methylphenol was also found in extracts of the mutant cells with 2 -methylbenzoate. These observations suggested a major route of <b>methylbenzoate</b> metabolism to be dioxygenation to a carboxy-hydrodiol which then forms a catechol derivative. In addition, the methyl group of 2 -methylbenzoate was oxidized to isobenzofuranone (by cells of MB 2 -G 5) and to phthalate (by cells of a separate mutant that could not utilize phthalate, MB 2 -D 2). This pathway also generated a chlorinated isobenzofuranone from 3 -chloro- 2 -methylbenzoate...|$|E
40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{spectra of}} some metal carbonyl and organometallic complexes are reported and assigned. Emphasis is placed upon Raman {{data and the}} instrumentation and sampling techniques of laser Raman spectroscopy are discussed. Oriented single crystal Raman spectra are presented for M 2 (CO) 10 M = Mn, Re, together with new solution data. These allow a reassignment of the vibrational spectra of these molecules. The spectra of M(CO) 3 (?-Arene) complexes are considered, M = Cr, Mo, W, or Mn; arene = benzene, aniline, anisole, <b>methylbenzoate,</b> toluene, mesitylene, hexamethylbenzene, cyclopentadiene or methylcyclopentadiene. The spectra of the free and co-ordinated ligands are compared, and the ro 1 e of charge back-donation from the metal atom to the ring is considered, qualitatively. An attempt is made to relate {{the magnitude of the}} back-donation to the frequency shifts of the internal vibrations of the arene upon co-ordination. Intense Raman bands at ~ 100 cm- 1 are found to be characteristic of many metal carbonyl complexes. The nature of these bands is considered. Frequencies and assignments of the vibrational spectra of palladium ?-allyl and ?- 2 -methylallyl halogen dimers are presented. The possible structural change in solution is considered. All solid-state spectra are considered in terms of a factor group analysis, where appropriate crystal structure data are available. It is shown that point molecular symmetry is usually a poor approximation when interpreting solid-state spectra. The concept of 'local symmetry' is discussed critically, and also shown to be an inadequate approximation, except for some non-axially symmetric systems...|$|E
40|$|We used {{arrays of}} {{artificial}} flowers {{with and without}} fragrance to determine the importance of olfactory and visual cues in attracting insects to a floral mimic. The mimic is a fungus, Puccinia monoica Arth., which causes its crucifer hosts (here, Arabis drummondii Gray) to form pseudoflowers that mimic co-occurring flowers such as the buttercup, Ranunculus inamoenus Greene. Although pseudoflowers are visually similar to buttercups, their sweet fragrance is distinct. To determine whether visitors to pseudoflowers were responding to fragrance we performed an experiment in which we removed the visual cues, but allowed fragrance to still be perceived. In this experiment we found that pseudoflower fragrance can attract visitors by itself. In other experiments {{we found that the}} relative importance of olfactory and visual cues depended on the species of visitor. Halictid bees (Dialictus sp.) had a somewhat greater visual than olfactory response, whereas flies (muscids and anthomyiids) were more dependent on olfactory cues. We also used bioassays to determine which of the many compounds present in the natural fragrance were responsible for attraction. We found that halictid bees were equally attracted to pseudoflowers and to a blend containing phenylacetaldehyde, 2 -phenylethanol, benzaldehyde and <b>methylbenzoate</b> in the same relative concentrations as in pseudoflowers. Flies, on the other hand, only responded to pseudoflower scent, indicating that we have not yet identified the compound(s) present in pseudoflowers that are attracting them. The ability of insects to differentiate pseudoflowers from true flowers by their fragrance may be important {{in the evolution of the}} mimicry system. Different fragrances may facilitate proper transfer of both fungal spermatia and pollen, and thus make it possible for the visual mimicry to evolve...|$|E
40|$|Snapdragon flowers emit two {{monoterpene}} olefins, myrcene and (E) -�-ocimene, {{derived from}} geranyl diphosphate, {{in addition to}} a major phenylpropanoid floral scent component, <b>methylbenzoate.</b> Emission of these monoterpenes is regulated developmentally and follows diurnal rhythms controlled by a circadian clock. Using a functional genomics approach, we have isolated and characterized three closely related cDNAs from a snapdragon petal-specific library that encode two myrcene synthases (ama 1 e 20 and ama 0 c 15) and an (E) -�-ocimene synthase (ama 0 a 23). Although the two myrcene synthases are almost identical (98 %), except for the N-terminal 13 amino acids, and are catalytically active, yielding a single monoterpene product, myrcene, only ama 0 c 15 is expressed at a high level in flowers and contributes to floral myrcene emission. (E) -�-Ocimene synthase is highly similar to snapdragon myrcene synthases (92 % amino acid identity) and produces predominantly (E) -�-ocimene (97 % of total monoterpene olefin product) with small amounts of (Z) -�-ocimene and myrcene. These newly isolated snapdragon monoterpene synthases, together with Arabidopsis AtTPS 14 (At 1 g 61680), define a new subfamily of the terpene synthase (TPS) family designated the Tps-g group. Members of this new Tps-g group lack the RRx 8 W motif, which is a characteristic feature of the Tps-d and Tps-b monoterpene synthases, suggesting that the reaction mechanism of Tps-g monoterpene synthase product formation does not proceed via an RR-dependent isomerization of geranyl diphosphate to 3 S-linalyl diphosphate, as shown previously for limonene cyclase. Analyses of tissue-specific, developmental, and rhythmic expression of these monoterpene synthase genes in snapdragon flowers revealed coordinate...|$|E
40|$|Plants use floral {{and fruit}} {{volatiles}} as chemical cues {{to interact with}} their environment by attracting pollinators and seed dispersers, thus ensuring plant reproductive success. These volatiles also have a significant economic value as they contribute directly to the quality, and indirectly to the yield, of crops. Arising from diverse biochemical pathways, floral and fruit volatiles {{can be divided into}} four major classes according to their metabolic origin: benzenoids/phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, fatty acid derivatives and amino acid derivatives. Benzenoids are of particular interest in the floral scent of snapdragon and petunia flowers where <b>methylbenzoate</b> is a dominant volatile arising from benzoic acid (BA). Benzoic acid (BA) is also an important building block in a wide spectrum of compounds from primary metabolites to secondary products. Benzoic acid biosynthesis from L-phenylalanine requires shortening the propyl side chain by two carbons, which can occur via a β-oxidative pathway or a non-β-oxidative pathway with benzaldehyde (BD) as a key intermediate. The non-β-oxidative route requires benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (BALDH) to convert BD to BA. Using a functional genomics approach, we identified an Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon) BALDH, which exhibits 40 % identity to bacterial BALDH. Transcript profiling, biochemical characterization of the purified recombinant protein, molecular homology modeling, in vivo stable isotope labeling, and transient expression in petunia flowers reveal that BALDH is capable of oxidizing BD to BA in vivo. GFP localization and immunogold labeling studies show that this biochemical step occurs in mitochondria, raising a question about the role of subcellular compartmentalization in BA biosynthesis. To determine if a similar enzyme is responsible for BA formation in petunia flowers, we isolated and analyzed three ALDH candidates for expression in limb tissue. One candidate, whose recombinant protein had activity with BD, was down-regulated by RNAi. However, the resulting emission profile in these plants was inconsistent with its function as a BALDH. ...|$|E

Only strain LB 400 also mineralizes a few mono- and dichlorobiphenyls, due {{to the presence of}} a functioning chlorocatechol pathway. Here, we used a Tn 5 -based minitransposon shuttle system to chromosomically introduce genes tcbRCDEF, encoding the chlorocatechol pathway into KF 707, and genes cbdABC encoding a 2 -chlorobenzoate 1, 2 -dioxygenase into KF 707 and LB 400, as well as transposon Tn 4653 from the TOL plasmid providing genes xylXYZL, encoding a broad-range toluate (<b>methylbenzoate)</b> dioxygenase and its dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, to extend the range for the mineralization of halogenated benzoates in LB 400 and in KF 707. The engineered derivatives of LB 400, and KF 707 thus gained the ability for the mineralization of all isomeric monochloro- and bromobenzoates of the so-called lower pathway which, consequently, also allowed the mineralization of all monochlorobiphenyls and a number of di- and trichlorobiphenyls, thus preventing the accumulation of halobenzoates and of catabolites thereof. LB 400 and KF 707 also grow with the two commercial PCB formulations, Aroclor 1221 and Aroclor 1232, as the sole carbon and energy sources, but not with higher halogenated PCB mixtures, similar to the already published strain RW 112. Repeated exposition of the modified LB 400 to short pulses of UV light, over a prolonged period of time, allowed the isolation of a derivative of LB 400, termed RW 118, capable of growth with Aroclor 1016 still containing only traces of biphenyl, and in co-culture with modified KF 707 termed RW 120, and modified H 850 (RW 112) with Aroclor 1242, the commercial mixture already void of biphenyl and monochlorobiphenyls...|$|E
