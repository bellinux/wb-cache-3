2500|$|The {{historical}} name Grand Sport {{returned to}} the Corvette lineup in 2010 as an entirely new model series that replaced the Z51 option. The new model was basically an LS3 equipped Z06 with a steel frame instead of aluminum. It retained many {{of the features of}} the Z06 including a wide body with 18x9.5 and 19x12 inch wheels, dry sump oiling (manual transmission coupes only), 6-piston 14" [...] front brakes and 4-piston rear, and improved suspension. <b>Manual</b> <b>power</b> train equipped G/S coupe models receive a tweaked LS3 with a forged crank, are built in Z06 fashion by hand, and utilize a dry-sump oil system. The first three gears were also made shorter for better throttle response and faster acceleration. A new launch control system was introduced for all models that allows for sub-4-second 0–60. EPA is estimated 26 MPG highway, 1.0 G on skid pad.|$|E

6000|$|Her bitterest enemies--and she had many--could hardly accuse Mrs. Hauksbee of wasting her time. Otis Yeere was one {{of those}} {{wandering}} [...] "dumb" [...] characters, foredoomed through life to be nobody's property. Ten years in Her Majesty's Bengal Civil Service, spent, for the most part, in undesirable Districts, had given him little to be proud of, and nothing to bring confidence. Old enough to have lost the first fine careless rapture that showers on the immature 'Stunt imaginary Commissionerships and Stars, and sends him into the collar with coltish earnestness and abandon; too young to be yet able to look back upon the progress he had made, and thank Providence that under the conditions of the day he had come even so far, he stood upon the [...] "dead-centre" [...] of his career. And when a man stands still, he feels the slightest impulse from without. Fortune had ruled that Otis Yeere should be, for the first part of his service, one of the rank and file who are ground up in the wheels of the Administration; losing heart and soul, and mind and strength, in the process. Until steam replaces <b>manual</b> <b>power</b> in the working of the Empire, there must always be this percentage--must always be the men who are used up, expended, in the mere mechanical routine. For these promotion is far off and the mill- grind of every day very near and instant. The Secretariats know them only by name; they are not the picked men of the Districts with the Divisions and Collectorates awaiting them. They are simply the rank and file--the food for fever--sharing with the ryot and the plough-bullock the honor of being the plinth on which the State rests. The older ones have lost their aspirations; the younger are putting theirs aside with a sigh. Both learn to endure patiently {{until the end of the}} day. Twelve years in the rank and file, men say, will sap the hearts of the bravest and dull the wits of the most keen.|$|E

40|$|Wheelchair users rely {{on their}} wheelchairs for {{mobility}} for {{extended periods of time}} every day. According to the International Standards Organization 2631 - 1 standard on human vibration, individuals in a seated position when exposed to whole-body vibrations (WBV) are at risk of injury. This study evaluated vibration exposure during <b>manual</b> and <b>power</b> wheelchair driving over nine sidewalk surfaces and differences in vibration exposure over 3 years. Ten nondisabled subjects were asked to drive a manual wheelchair at 1 m/s and a power wheelchair at 1 m/s and 2 m/s over nine sidewalk surfaces while WBV were measured at the seat and footrest of the wheelchair. At 1 m/s, significant differences existed between surfaces and years at both the seat and the footrest for the <b>manual</b> and <b>power</b> wheelchair users. At 2 m/s, significant differences existed between surfaces and years at the seat and the footrest for power wheelchair users.

40|$|Background and Purpose. Assistive {{devices such}} as wheelchairs are used by {{children}} with mobility limitations {{and all over the}} world for the purpose of increasing independence and mobility. This freedom of mobility raises the issue of safety provided by either the <b>manual</b> or <b>power</b> wheelchair. Researchers have looked at the safety of <b>manual</b> and <b>power</b> wheelchairs separately and identified factors that increase aild decrease risks associated with wheelchair accidents. Currently there is no data comparing the level of safety between <b>manual</b> and <b>power</b> wheelchair use. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify only differences in safety concerns between a <b>manual</b> versus a <b>power</b> wheelchair. Methods. This study was conducted as a research survey and was distributed to parents of pediatric individuals who were wheelchair users. These children were living in the Portland metropolitan area and were independent in wheelchair mobility. The level of safety was determined by a numerical scale. Results. As predicted, there was no statistically significant difference in safety between <b>power</b> and <b>manual</b> wheelchair use. Conclusion and Discussion. Although no statistical significance was found in the total safety level, significant differences were found in individual safety questions: This data will be used to provide healthcare professionals, caregivers, and wheelchair manufactures information so that a safer wheelchair can be prescribed, designed, and distributed to children with mobility limitations...|$|R
50|$|Motion {{graphics}} are {{pieces of}} digital footage or animation which {{create the illusion}} of motion or rotation, and are usually combined with audio for use in multimedia projects. Motion graphics are usually displayed via electronic media technology, but may also be displayed via <b>manual</b> <b>powered</b> technology (e.g. thaumatrope, phenakistoscope, stroboscope, zoetrope, praxinoscope, flip book). The term distinguishes still graphics from those with a transforming appearance over time, without over-specifying the form. While any form of experimental or abstract animation can be called motion graphics, the term typically more explicitly refers to the commercial application of animation and effects to video, film, TV, and interactive applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{increasing}} {{speed and}} complexity of today’s designs implies {{a significant increase in}} the power consumption of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) chips. To meet this challenge, researchers have developed many different design techniques to reduce power. The complexity of today’s ICs, with over 100 milliontransistors, clocked at over 1 GHz, means <b>manual</b> <b>power</b> optimization would be hopelessly slow and all too likely to contain errors. Computer-aided design (CAD) tools and methodologies are mandatory.|$|E
50|$|A {{motorized}} wheelchair, powerchair, {{electric wheelchair}} or electric-powered wheelchair (EPW) is a wheelchair that is propelled {{by means of}} an electric motor rather than <b>manual</b> <b>power.</b> Motorized wheelchairs are useful for those unable to propel a manual wheelchair or who may need to use a wheelchair for distances or over terrain which would be fatiguing in a manual wheelchair. They may also be used not just by people with 'traditional' mobility impairments, but also by people with cardiovascular and fatigue-based conditions.|$|E

50|$|Today snow plows are {{produced}} by numerous companies {{around the world and}} available for different kinds of vehicles such as service trucks, pickup trucks, SUVs and ATVs. They are installed using model specific or universal hardware and mount to the frame of the vehicle to ensure durable connection. There are <b>manual,</b> <b>power</b> and hydraulic operating snow plows. All necessary mounting hardware usually comes in set with a plow. Snow plow blades are available in various sizes depending on a vehicle type. Service trucks usually use a blade sized 96 in and more. Common blade size for pickup trucks and full size SUVs is 78 - 96 in. Smaller ATV snow plow blades are 48 - 78 in wide.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} Packards to date, the Model G's engine was {{placed under the}} driver's bench and {{laterally}} mounted, the crank protruding out of the right side. As mentioned, it {{was derived from the}} single-cylinder variant for which Packard already had a good reputation. Construction consisted of two single-cylinder engines that were connected in a horizontal opposed position and worked on a common crank shaft. Blocks were cast iron with non-detachable cylinder heads. Cylinders had a bore and stroke of 6 x 6 1/2 in. (152.4 × 165.1 mm) each, resulting in a displacement of 184 c.i (3,015 cm³) per cylinder and huge 368 c.i. (6,030 cm³) for the whole engine. Packard used a Longuemar float-feed carburetor for each cylinder. Ignition advance was <b>manual.</b> <b>Power</b> rating (following then-actual practice) was 24 H.P.|$|E
50|$|The {{new engine}} is of all {{aluminum}} construction, {{made out of}} 356 aluminum with a T7 heat treat to further enhance block integrity and cylinder bore chill during casting. Specifically created and cast for Koenigsegg by Grainger & Worrall, a casting specialist with F1 experience in drivetrain components, the engine is built, assembled and tested at their Ängelholm production plant. The engine is lubricated with a dry sump system with a separate oil pump and the pistons are cooled {{by means of an}} internal cooler that sprays oil onto them in order to run high cylinder pressure with 91 octane fuel making it capable of 14 mpg (17 l/100 km) in combined cycle and 18 mpg (13 l/100 km) in highway travel.Available transmissions are a Cima 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automated <b>manual.</b> <b>Power</b> is fed to the wheels through a torque-sensitive limited slip differential.|$|E

Overheating in localised areas can cause bone necrosis and {{have an impact on the}} rate of healing of the bone post operation and overheating also affects the sharpness life of the blade. A review of the literature indicates that work has been complete on temperature in the immediate cutting zone. This study is focusing on the size of the overheated zone relative to the cutting position...|$|R
