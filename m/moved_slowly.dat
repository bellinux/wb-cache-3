5|$|As the {{previous}} storm was moving along the coastline {{of the southeastern}} United States, a new hurricane was observed in the western Caribbean Sea, about halfway between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based on a ship report, was estimated at 105mph (165km/h). The hurricane <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> west-northwestward, and another ship experienced its strong winds on October7. There were no further observations, so its complete track is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kyle was the {{eleventh}} tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed from a strong tropical disturbance that tracked across the northeastern Caribbean Sea {{in the third}} week of September. As a low pressure area, it <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, dumping torrential rains across those islands.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} gradually {{developed over the}} extreme southeastern Caribbean Sea on November 1. It <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> westward and steadily organized. By November 4, the system stalled to the north of Curaçao, which was followed by a turn to the northeast. Convection slowly organized as a surface circulation formed, and on November 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen. Initially weak with only 20mph (32km/h) winds, the depression steadily organized as it moved northeastward, and a Reconnaissance Aircraft mission confirmed the existence of the cyclone on November 6 as it was located midway between Puerto Rico and the Netherlands Antilles. Late on the 6th, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Klaus while located a short distance south of Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|A ship sunk in {{the western}} Gulf of Mexico on October1, {{which was the first}} {{indication}} of the second tropical cyclone of the season. The storm <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> northeastward toward the southeastern Louisiana coastline, intensifying to its estimated peak winds of 70mph (115km/h). On October4, it passed near or over southeastern Louisiana, producing heavy rain and gusty winds in New Orleans. Flooding was observed in portions of the city, and the West Rigolets Lighthouse on Lake Pontchartrain suffered $5,000 in damage due to the storm (1868USD, $81,000 2010USD). The storm accelerated northeastward and struck near Apalachicola, Florida late on October4.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed {{east of the}} Bahamas on September6. It <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> northwestward towards {{the coast of the}} United States and attained hurricane strength early on September9. The cyclone continued travelling northwest along the US coast, becoming a Category 2 hurricane whilst off the coast of Georgia on September 11. On September 13 the cyclone made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, but then quickly weakened to a {{tropical storm}} and turned eastward into the Atlantic on September14. Throughout September15, whilst over water, the storm regained hurricane strength and continued northward before becoming extratropical in the mid-Atlantic on September17.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September 1. An {{area of low pressure}} {{associated with the}} wave <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> westward, and its convection initially appeared to become better organized. On September 3, as it passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands, organization within the system degraded, though convection increased the next day. The system gradually became better organized, and Dvorak classifications began early on September 5. Based on the development of a closed surface circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen early on September 6. Hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Isabel, though operationally the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until 13hours after it first developed.|$|E

5|$|As Erica moved {{towards the}} south and {{subsequently}} to the north, the cyclone strengthened, becoming equivalent to a tropical storm according to the JTWC by 1500UTC on 5 March. Erica later attained maximum sustained winds of 105km/h (65mph 1-minute sustained). However the system began to move against {{the direction of the}} wind shear environment, and it lost much of its organization. On 7 March at 2230UTC, Erica lost cyclone status and degenerated into a tropical low. The remnant circulation <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> to the northeast, and the wind shear conditions abated. As a result, Erica began to gain some signs of organization. At this time the remnants moved towards the southeast {{as a result of an}} upper-level trough developing over Australia.|$|E
5|$|Church members {{reported}} that Father Feit's confession line <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> {{that night and}} that he was away from the sanctuary several times. When the canal at the crime scene was drained several days after the discovery of Garza's body, Feit's photo slide viewer was found in the canal. Fellow priests noticed scratch marks on Feit's hands after midnight mass, and they said it was irregular for Feit to have taken Garza to the church rectory to hear her confession. The McAllen Police Department initially said that Feit passed polygraph tests, but the tests were later said to be inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Graham of the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone {{season was}} a weak {{tropical}} storm that affected Australia during late February and early March 2003. Graham originated {{from an area}} of convection that emerged onto water after sitting over Australia on 23 February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed an {{area of low pressure}} that developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on 27 February. The storm <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> to the east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported.|$|E

5|$|Franklin moved erratically to {{the east}} {{weakening}} as shear increased again. The NHC predicted that would dissipate, but the weakening trend stopped on July 25 with Franklin a minimal tropical storm. The storm passed to 200miles (325km) {{to the west of}} Bermuda on July 26 and <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> northwards into the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream. The shear also reduced once again allowing Franklin to re-strengthen somewhat, with winds reaching 60mph (95km/h) on July 28. Franklin began to accelerate to the northeast, becoming extratropical on July 30 to the south of Newfoundland. The extratropical storm passed just south of the Avalon Peninsula later that day and was absorbed by a larger system on July 31.|$|E
5|$|Located {{south of}} a mid-level ridge and the {{continuing}} gap wind event, the nascent depression <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> west-southwest on October20. Initial environmental conditions were modestly favorable, allowing for steady intensification. The depression achieved tropical storm status by 00:00UTC on October21; the National Hurricane Center (NHC) assigned it the name Patricia accordingly. Throughout much of October21, Patricia moved through a region of drier, more stable air and over relatively cool sea surface temperatures. Both of these factors served to delay intensification of the cyclone. The system unraveled substantially, with banding features dissipating and the low-level circulation becoming poorly defined. Once clear of the hindering factors, convection blossomed over Patricia late on October21 and a central dense overcast formed over the center. Simultaneously, the storm accelerated west-northwest.|$|E
5|$|On June 1, a {{tropical}} depression formed off western Cuba from an organized cloud system. It <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto on June 3. Alberto traveled generally northeast on an erratic course, and briefly intensified to a Category1 hurricane, {{one of the}} earliest hurricanes of June, and the earliest date for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970. Due to strengthening vertical wind shear, Alberto then quickly weakened into {{a tropical}} storm, doubled back to the west, and dissipated near the Florida Keys on June 6. Alberto {{is an example of a}} storm to enter the Gulf of Mexico and dissipating while never make landfall, which is an unusual event.|$|E

5000|$|According to a tactile Bayesian perceptual model {{put forward}} by Goldreich (2007), the brain expects that tactile stimuli tend to <b>move</b> <b>slowly.</b> The Bayesian model reaches an optimal {{probabilistic}} inference by combining uncertain spatial and temporal sensory information with a prior expectation for low-speeds. The expectation that stimuli tend to <b>move</b> <b>slowly</b> results in the perceptual underestimation of the spatial separation between rapidly consecutive stimuli ("perceptual length contraction"), thereby reproducing the tau effect and related illusions.|$|R
5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> {{over the next few}} days, later merging with a tropical wave on October15. The merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation of a broad area of low pressure. This feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00:00UTC on October20; at this time the depression was situated roughly 205mi (335km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. A mid-level ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing path.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Ami {{was one of}} {{the worst}} {{cyclones}} ever to affect Fiji. Cyclone Ami developed from a low-pressure area east of Tuvalu on January 12. The storm <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> towards the southwest early in its existence. Influenced by an upper-level trough, Ami slowed down and began moving towards the south and then southeast. The cyclone attained severe tropical cyclone intensity on January 13. Ami made its first landfall at Vanua Levu, before subsequently making another landfall on Taveuni. Ami reached peak intensity as an equivalent Category3 cyclone on the Australian cyclone scale on January 14. Accelerating to the southeast, the cyclone began to cross over cool sea surface temperatures and encountered wind shear. Ami transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the day after.|$|E
5|$|The NHC {{introduced}} {{the system in}} its tropical weather outlook on November28, {{with the possibility of}} subtropical or tropical development noted. It <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> westward, becoming better organized, and by late that day resembled a subtropical cyclone; however, as it was still connected to the cold front, it could not have been classified as such. Early on November29, an area of deep convection developed and organized over the surface center when it was about 915mi (1470km) east of Bermuda. The NHC accordingly assessed the system as developing into a tropical storm, designating it with the Greek letter Epsilon.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> to the north-northwest {{through a}} break in the subtropical ridge, and as convective banding features became more prominent the system intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well-established upper-level outflow. Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection, though deep convection re-developed the following morning. Outflow continued to improve, and with warm sea surface temperatures Beryl gradually intensified to attain peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) early on July 20 while located about 120miles (190km) east of Nags Head, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm of}} the 1941 season formed on September 11 in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico. This was an abnormally late start to an Atlantic hurricane season: only on two other occasions between 1887 and 1941 had no storms developed prior to September 11. The storm <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> in a generally westward direction {{for the next few}} days, peaking as a moderate tropical storm with winds of 45mph (75km/h). It then weakened until it made landfall along the northern Texas coast between Galveston and Port Arthur as a tropical depression, where it caused only minor damage. Near 0600 UTC on September 16, the storm deteriorated into a depression, and dissipated a few hours later.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl caused {{flooding}} {{in several states}} in the Eastern United States in August1994. The second named storm and third tropical cyclone of the season, Beryl developed from an upper-level low pressure area over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on August14. Initially a tropical depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm about 24hours after forming. Beryl then <b>moved</b> <b>slowly</b> northeastward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) before making landfall near Panama City, Florida, early on August16. Within 12hours of moving inland, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, but persisted as a tropical cyclone {{for a few days}} while traversing the Eastern United States. Beryl was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over Connecticut early on August19.|$|E
