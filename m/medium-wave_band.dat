25|$|The {{island has}} one local {{commercial}} radio station: Isle of Wight Radio has broadcast in the <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band</b> since 1990 and on 107.0MHz (with three smaller transmitters on 102.0MHz) FM since 1998, {{as well as}} streaming on the Internet. The island is also covered {{by a number of}} local stations on the mainland, including the BBC station BBC Radio Solent broadcast from Southampton.|$|E
50|$|The Blosenbergturm is {{a former}} radio {{transmission}} tower built for the German-language radio station DRS at Beromünster in the Canton of Lucerne, Switzerland, in 1937. It radiated at 531 kHz, the lowest officially allocated frequency in the European <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
5000|$|WCTN is a {{radio station}} {{broadcasting}} on 950 kHz in the <b>medium-wave</b> AM <b>band</b> from Potomac, Maryland. WCTN has broadcast Indian language programming (Hindi, Punjabi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Gujarati, Bangala, and more), Radio Zindagi 950 AM. It has been broadcasting an oldies format (with an emphasis on music from the 1990s and early 2000s) since 2016.|$|R
50|$|WPAT (930 AM) is the callsign of a {{radio station}} {{licensed}} to Paterson, New Jersey. Located at 930 kHz in the <b>medium-wave</b> AM <b>band,</b> the station runs paid ethnic programming. Established in 1941, WPAT is owned by Multicultural Broadcasting, and its studios are in New York City, in Manhattan's Financial District. The station's four 380 ft transmitting towers are in Clifton, New Jersey.|$|R
50|$|Small loop antennas are lossy and inefficient, {{but they}} can make {{practical}} receiving antennas in the <b>medium-wave</b> (520-1610 kHz) <b>band</b> and below, where the antenna inefficiency is masked by large amounts of atmospheric noise.|$|R

50|$|The Transmitter Nuremberg-Kleinreuth was a {{broadcasting}} {{facility for}} medium wave at Nuremberg, Bavaria, Germany. It {{was founded in}} 1927 in Nuremberg-Kleinreuth at the former Broadcast Street 24, now Sigmund Street 181, in order to supply the northern areas of Bavaria with broadcast programs in the <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... 8HA {{has been}} on the air since 1971, and is the only {{commercial}} radio station operating on the <b>medium-wave</b> (i.e. AM) <b>band</b> in the Northern Territory (the only other station to do so, 8DN in Darwin, was shut down in the 1990s).|$|R
50|$|Historically, amateur {{stations}} have rarely {{been allowed to}} operate on frequencies lower than the <b>medium-wave</b> broadcast <b>band,</b> but in recent times, as the historic users of these low frequencies have been vacating the spectrum, limited space has opened up to allow for new amateur radio allocations and special experimental operations. Since the 500 kHz band is generally no longer used for regular marine communications, some countries permit experimental amateur radio radiotelegraph operations in that band. Many countries, however, continue to restrict this frequency which was historically reserved for distress calls. The 2200-meter band is available for use in several countries, and the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-07) made it a worldwide amateur allocation. Before {{the introduction of the}} 2200-meter band in the UK in 1998, operation on the even lower frequency of 73 kHz had been allowed between 1996 and 2003.|$|R
40|$|Each {{country was}} {{allocated}} frequency band(s) for direct-to-listener {{digital audio broadcasting}} at WARC- 92. These allocations were near 1500, 2300, and 2600 MHz. In addition, some countries are encouraging the development of digital audio broadcasting services for terrestrial delivery only in the VHF bands (at frequencies from roughly 50 to 300 MHz) and in the <b>medium-wave</b> broadcasting <b>band</b> (AM band) (from roughly 0. 5 to 1. 7 MHz). The development activity increase was explosive. Current development, as of February 1993, {{as it is known}} to the author is summarized. The information given includes the following characteristics, as appropriate, for each planned system: coverage areas, audio quality, number of audio channels, delivery via satellite/terrestrial or both, carrier frequency bands, modulation methods, source coding, and channel coding. Most proponents claim that they will be operational in 3 or 4 years...|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of DXing the <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band</b> has diminished as the popular music formats quickly {{migrated to the}} clearer, though less propagating, FM radio beginning in the 1970s. Meanwhile, the MW band in the United States was {{getting more and more}} crowded with new stations and existing stations receiving FCC authorization to operate at night. In Canada, just the opposite occurred as AM stations began moving to FM beginning in the 1980s and continuing through today.|$|E
50|$|On May 20, 1985, Radio Martí began {{broadcasts}} to Cuba {{from the}} United States. The {{first day of}} broadcasting was chosen to commemorate the 83rd anniversary of Cuba's independence from United States rule on May 20, 1902. The fears of broadcasters proved well-founded, when Cuba-based transmitters briefly broadcast powerful signals on the <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band</b> in 1985, disrupting U.S. AM radiostation broadcasts in several states. Cuba continues to broadcast interference against U.S. broadcasts specifically directed to Cuba in attempts {{to prevent them from}} being received within Cuba.|$|E
50|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} are usually {{credited with the}} discovery of transatlantic radio communication in the shortwave bands. The first successful transatlantic tests were conducted by radio amateurs in December 1921 operating in the 200 meter <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band,</b> the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe at 200 meters and at least 20 North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two way transatlantic shortwave radio contacts were completed by radio amateurs in November 1923, on 110 meters.|$|E
50|$|In January 1983 {{a presidential}} decree {{allocated}} a <b>medium-wave</b> radio frequency <b>band</b> to the National Spiritual Assembly of Bolivia for Caracollo, near Oruro, to become 'Radio Baha'i of Bolivia'. Construction {{of the new}} AM 1 kW. station and its associated teaching institute were scheduled for completion in January 1984 and for inauguration at Naw-Ruz, the Bahá'í new year, the same year WLGI came online in the US. The radio station covered a region in Bolivia and Peru of over 400 assemblies. Its call letters are CP-220. The station used alternative energy systems {{as well as an}} appropriate technology setup which allowed its relative low power output to rival the effectiveness of stations with more raw broadcasting power. Its call letters are CP220 and it is still on the air.|$|R
50|$|AM {{stations}} were the earliest broadcasting stations to be developed. AM refers to amplitude modulation, {{a mode of}} broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal {{in response to the}} amplitude of the signal to be transmitted. The <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band</b> is used worldwide for AM broadcasting. Europe also uses the long wave band. In response to the growing popularity of FM stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some North American stations began broadcasting in AM stereo, though this never gained popularity, and very few receivers were ever sold.|$|E
5000|$|Tunnel {{transmitters}} {{are used}} in Germany only for audio transmitters working in FM-range and for further radio services, such as mobile phone services which also work in this frequency range. Elsewhere, there are also tunnel transmitters for audio broadcast transmitters, which work in the long and medium wave bands. An {{example of this is}} in the Dartford Crossing tunnel near London, where the programme [...] "Virgin 1215" [...] in the <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band</b> and the BBC's Radio 4 on 198 kHz long wave are rebroadcast in the tunnel. Emergency information could also be relayed using this system, interrupting programming to relay warnings.|$|E
50|$|The 324 metre high mast is a {{grounded}} construction with triangular cross section. Until {{the early}} 1990s {{it had a}} highly effective fading-reducing transmitting antenna {{in the form of}} a special cage aerial developed in Russia, known as the ARRT-antenna. It was used for the 1000 kW-medium wave transmitter operated on 783 kHz, which was the strongest transmitter of the former GDR, as transmitting antenna. Today this mast has a cage aerial for long wave. Both the 210 metre high tube masts are isolated from the ground. One of the two tube masts can be used as a toe-fed mast antenna for long and medium wave, while the other mast can be used only as a transmitting antenna for the <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Experimental Radio Station Eberswalde was an {{experimental}} radio station {{of the company}} Carl Lorenz founded in Eberswalde, Germany in 1909. It used an umbrella aerial, which was carried at a 70 metres high, guyed central mast and at the corners on 16 30 metres high timber masts, as antenna system. The central mast was a wood-latticed mast with a weight of 10,2 tons, guyed in 5 levels. As transmitters arc and machine transmitters were used, which served mainly {{for the purpose of}} telegraphy. Between January 1923 until January 1925, music transmissions were also done, although the station was never a regular broadcasting station. Starting from 1924, the station was used for short wave experiments. In 1928, the first experimental radio beacon was built on the Experimental Radio Station Eberswalde. It worked in the <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band</b> and used a triangle plane aerial, which was hung up on three 28 metres tall masts. Starting from middle of the 1930s, the Experimental Radio Station Eberswalde was gradually shut down. In 1939, the entire antenna systems including the central mast were dismantled. Starting from 1942, the buildings were used for a research centre for peat utilization. One hoped {{to be able to make}} fuel from peat. From 1954 to 1963, the facilities, which are unused today, served for the forest-economy faculty of the Humboldt University of Berlin.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe work shows, that in {{developing}} transmission network for data transmission {{in the waters}} of the Northern Sea route it is expediently to use <b>medium-wave</b> <b>band</b> at the expense of more steady telecommunication line because of lack of spatial wave in near-field zone. Types of modulation and signal-code designs for down-link and up-link were determined. Also it was established that using amplitude-phase modulations with block turbo code, it provides the best spectral and energy efficiency for down-link and frequency-shift signal for up-link is efficient...|$|E
