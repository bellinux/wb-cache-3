The experiments are carried out in a laboratory flume using various geometrical dimensions under different flow conditions. The basic principles are employed to correlate the discharge to the relevant geometrical and hydraulic parameters in nondimensional form. The experimental data are then used to develop a general nondimensional equation for predicting the discharge through the combined system knowing its geometry and the head of water over the weir. It was found that only one equation describes both horizontal and sloping channels with either mild or steep slopes. Also, the <b>modular</b> <b>limit</b> for combined flow is discussed and an equation for its calculation is presented as well.

40|$|The Sector Venturi {{is a novel}} {{design to}} {{determine}} discharge in sewers. Its main features are simplicity, accuracy of ± 5 %, and low cost. Further, the <b>modular</b> <b>limit</b> is comparable to standard flumes, and the capacity is equal to similar devices. Based on an optimization procedure, the best geometry was retained. The Sector Venturi {{is characterized by a}} ring of variable diameter, in which two sharp-crested sectors are attached. When mounting the Sector Venturi, the ring is expanded to match with the pipe section. The sector elements are sharp crested and have a notch at the invert. The principle of discharge measurement involves critical flow across a constriction. To stabilize the depth reading, holes are drilled in the sectors and two symmetrically arranged containers allow reading of the total head. The discharge is determined with a rating curve. One particular feature of the Sector Venturi is its insensitivity to clogging. As outlined, there are several disadvantages when compared with the pier-shaped Mobile Venturi Flume, but these do not detract from a useful means of discharge measurements in sewage...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to explain the fimdamental {{principles}} involved in analytically modeling the flow through weirs and flumes, so that the head-discharge relationship and the <b>modular</b> <b>limit</b> of such structures can be determined. The information provided allows flumes of nearly any cross-sectional shape to be calibrated to a reasonable degree of accuracy. Software for making these calculations is presented in Chapter 8. 6. 1 Continuity Equation Figure 6. 1 shows a stream tube that is a flow passage bounded by streamlines. Since there is, by definition, no flow across a streamline, and since we assume that water is incompressible, water must enter the tube through cross-section 1 and exit through cross-section 2 at the same flow rate, measured in volume per unit time. From the assumption of steady flow, {{it follows that the}} shape and position of the stream tube do not change with time. For steady flow, the rate, Q, at which water is flowing across a small section is the product of the average velocity component perpendicular to the section, v, and the area of the section, A. For cross sections 1 and 2 in Figure 6. 1, we thus can write Q = vIAI = v 24 Equation 6. 1 is the continuity equation and is valid for incompressible fluid flow through any stream tube. If Equation 6. 1 is applied to a stream tube with a fixed and well-described boundary, such as a broad-crested weir with steady flow through it (the channel bottom, side slopes, and water surface being the boundaries of the stream tube, as shown in Figure 6. 2), the continuity equation reads Figure 6. 1 The stream tube...|$|E

40|$|A {{labyrinth}} spillway is an {{overflow spillway}} to regulate and control flow in canals, rivers and reservoirs. The main hypothesis {{for the development}} of such a spillway is to increase the discharge per unit width of structure for a given headwater. This type of structure is often an efficient alternative to a gated-spillway type where either the increase of the flood-passage capacity or the control of the water surface upstream is concerned. This study was aimed to investigate the hydraulic performance of labyrinth spillways of general trapezoidal planform with simple curved apexes. In the experimental work, twelve spillway models with double cycles were considered using three different curved apexes (R/w= 0. 15, 0. 2, 0. 25), each with four different crest heights (w/P= 1. 5, 2, 3, 4). Based on the cited recommendations, the length magnification was set to a constant ratio of (l/w= 3); the crest shape was to be of a semi-circular form with simple radius (r= 15 mm); and the spillway walls were vertical with the thickness of T= 2 r. An intensive experiment was carried out over a wide range of flows, providing 720 flow data ranging from free flow to submerged flow conditions. 1 D flow equation was presented using combined mathematical and dimensional analysis. A coefficient of discharge, Cd, was introduced to represent the influence of the effective geometric and hydraulic parameters on the flow capacity over the spillway. <b>Modular</b> <b>limit</b> was also controlled to see whether the flow over the spillway would be submerged.

For example, changes in gene expression can {{provide insight into}} developmental and physiological mecha-nisms that link genotype and phenotype. However, classical analytical techniques are poorly suited to quantitative genetic studies of gene expression where the number of traits assayed per individual can reach many thousand. Here, we derive a Bayesian genetic sparse factor model for estimating the genetic covariance matrix (G-matrix) of high-dimensional traits, such as gene expression, in a mixed effects model. The key idea of our model {{is that we need}} only consider G-matrices that are biologically plausible. An organism’s entire phenotype is the result of processes that are <b>modular</b> and have <b>limited</b> complexity. This implies that the G-matrix will be highly structured. In particular, we assume that a limited number of intermediate traits (or factors, e. g., variations in development or physiology) control the variation in the high-dimensional phenotype, and that each of these intermediate traits is sparse – affecting only a few observed traits. The advantages of this approach are two-fold. First, sparse factors are interpretable and provide biological insight into mechanisms underlying the genetic architecture. Second, enforcing sparsity helps prevent sampling errors from swamping out the true signal in high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the advantages of our model on simulated data and in an analysis of a published Drosophila melanogaster gene expression data set...|$|R

To explore this phenomenon, interviews with ten senior managers and engineers with long experience in the automotive business were conducted at a car manufacturer. The interviewees agreed that configuring cars becomes more time-consuming and costly with increasing product complexity. In this paper we reason that there are upcoming solutions suitable for complex configurations. As a basis for this, we propose a distinction between limiting and managing product complexity, and stress that these approaches affect internal cost over time differently. If companies choose to limit complexity we suggest optimizing configuration rules, reducing variants or both. Conversely, we propose and contrast two different configuration strategies for managing complexity, 1) the Modular approach, and 2) the Configurable Component (CC) approach. The <b>Modular</b> approach may <b>limit</b> the ability to change. However, only few changes in manufacturing systems are needed. The CC approach is a long-term fully flexible configuration approach prepared for changes.

40|$|Compression {{testing of}} tri-isotropic (TRISO) carbon/silicon carbide-coated fuel {{particles}} between anvil materials {{with a wide}} range of hardnesses was investigated. During compression testing, the particle produces a hardness impression before it fractures. For subsequent measurements, the same position can therefore not be used. A special testing machine was designed to use the same set of anvils for testing more than one specimen. By each time positioning a particle at a slightly different position between the anvils, a large number of measurements could be made. The load required for fracture is almost independent of anvil hardness for very hard or very soft anvils. Finite element stress analysis showed that when the anvil hardness is very high, fracture occurs because of high local contact bending stresses at the point of contact. In the case of very soft anvils, a tensile stress develops along a latitudinal direction along the perimeter of the particle over a large volume in between the contact zones with the anvils. The particle then fractures by the development of cracks at right angles to the direction of the tensile stress. From the fracture load, the ability of the particle to withstand internal pressure can be assessed. The advantages of using compression testing of full particles between soft anvils without prior preparation to complement previous test methods are highlighted.

However, manual fence insertion, is a tedious and time- consuming activity, that {{also needs to be}} repeated each time the program is updated. Therefore, the development of efficient tools for automatic fence insertion is a crucial challenge in concurrent program design.

40|$|The physics {{programme}} and {{the design}} are described of a new collider for particle and nuclear physics, the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), in which a newly built electron beam of 60 GeV, to possibly 140 GeV, energy collides with the intense hadron beams of the LHC. Compared to the first ep collider, HERA, the kinematic range covered is extended {{by a factor of}} twenty in the negative four-momentum squared, Q 2, and in the inverse Bjorken x, while with the design luminosity of 1033 cm- 2 s - 1 the LHeC is projected to exceed the integrated HERA luminosity by two orders of magnitude. The physics programme is devoted to an exploration of the energy frontier, complementing the LHC and its discovery potential for physics beyond the Standard Model with high precision deep inelastic scattering measurements. These are designed to investigate a variety of fundamental questions in strong and electroweak interactions. The LHeC thus continues the path of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) into unknown areas of physics and kinematics. The physics programme also includes electron-deuteron and electron-ion scattering in a (Q 2, 1 /x) range extended by four orders of magnitude as compared to previous lepton-nucleus DIS experiments for novel investigations of neutron's and nuclear structure, the initial conditions of Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and further quantum chromodynamic phenomena. The LHeC may be realised either as a ring-ring or as a linac-ring collider. Optics and beam dynamics studies are presented for both versions, along with technical design considerations on the interaction region, magnets including new dipole prototypes, cryogenics, RF, and further components. A design study is also presented of a detector suitable to perform high precision DIS measurements {{in a wide range of}} acceptance using state-of-the art detector technology, which is <b>modular</b> and of <b>limited</b> size enabling its fast installation. The detector includes tagging devices for electron, photon, proton and neutron detection near to the beam pipe. Civil engineering and installation studies are presented for the accelerator and the detector. The LHeC can be built within a decade and thus be operated while the LHC runs in its high-luminosity phase. It so represents a major opportunity for progress in particle physics exploiting the investment made in the LHC. © 2012 CERN. 0 SCOPUS: ar. jSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{vaccinia virus}} {{complement}} control protein (VCP) {{is involved in}} the modulation of the host inflammatory response during vaccinia virus infection. It possesses the ability to inhibit both classical and alternative pathways of complement activation, as well as bind to heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans, making it a unique multifunctional protein with therapeutic potential. VCP is able to block complement activity through its ability to bind C 3 b and C 4 b. Other very novel activities arise from VCP 2 ̆ 7 s ability to bind heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, allowing the protein to attach itself to cell surfaces. The goal of this research was to fully characterize the structure and various functions of VCP. The structural basis for VCP 2 ̆ 7 s ability to bind heparin was investigated using heparin affinity chromatography, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and homology modeling with well-characterized heparin binding proteins. VCP was found to possess two regions involved in heparin binding, one involved in weak binding located at the junction of complement control protein (CCP) modules 1 and 2, and a second involved in strong binding located at the extreme C-terminal tip of the protein. Additional functions, involved in blocking molecular interactions with cells, were also identified and determined to be a result of VCP 2 ̆ 7 s ability to bind heparin. The structural basis for VCP 2 ̆ 7 s ability to bind complement was investigated using the hemolysis assay, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and homology modeling with well-mapped complement regulatory proteins. VCP was found to be the smallest functional unit able to bind and cause factor I cleavage of C 3 b/C 4 b, thus inhibiting complement activity. VCP was also shown to possess the ability to simultaneously bind and inhibit complement activation, using its entire exposed surface, while remaining attached to heparin by its C-terminal heparin binding site. The structure of VCP and its structural and functional stability were determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR, DSC, and the hemolysis assay. VCP was found to be an elongated filamentous protein, with defined CCP <b>modular</b> regions with <b>limited</b> intermodular interfacing, existing as a monomer in solution. VCP was found to possess the ability to structurally withstand temperatures in excess of 90 oC. In addition, VCP was able to retain functional integrity following exposure to many adverse physical conditions, which would result in irreversible denaturation of most other proteins. Lastly, the in vivo pharmacokinetics of VCP was investigated in rats. VCP was injected as a bolus at different routes and using various concentrations. Continuous and intermittent intravenous injection strategies were also investigated. In all cases, the serum CH 50 was monitored over time to determine the half-life of VCP activity in the serum. Traces of intact VCP was detected in urine by SDS-PAGE analysis, giving clues to its excretion and elimination from the body. This research has provided greater understanding of the architectural features of a protein that contribute to heparin and complement binding. In addition, this research may prove important for the future use of VCP as a novel immunomodulating agent, as well as future protein-engineering efforts to design a better treatment for many complement mediated diseases, such as: Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease, central nervous system (CNS) injury, systemic lupus erythematosus, and xenograft transplant rejections...|$|R
