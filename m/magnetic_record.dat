5000|$|Detecting {{lightning}} {{activity in}} the geologic record can be difficult, given the instantaneous nature of lightning strikes in general. However, fulgurite, a glassy tube-like, crust-like, or irregular mineraloid that forms when lightning fuses soil, quartz sands, clay, rock, biomass, or caliche is prevalent in electrically-active regions around the globe and provides evidence of not only past lightning activity, but also patterns of convection. [...] Since lightning channels carry an electric current to the ground, lightning can produce magnetic fields as well. While lightning-magnetic anomalies can provide evidence of lightning activity in a region, these anomalies are often problematic for those examining the <b>magnetic</b> <b>record</b> of rock types because they disguise the natural magnetic fields present.|$|E
5000|$|LIRM {{anomalies}} {{can often}} be problematic when examining the magnetic characteristics of rock types. LIRM anomalies can disguise the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of the rocks in question because the subsequent magnetization caused by the lightning strike reconfigures the <b>magnetic</b> <b>record.</b> [...] While investigating the soil attributes at the 30-30 Winchester archeological site in northeastern Wyoming to discern the daily activities of prehistoric people that had once occupied that region, David Maki noticed peculiar anomalies in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>record</b> that did not match the circular magnetic remnant features of the ovens used by these prehistoric groups for cooking and pottery. [...] The LIRM anomaly was significantly bigger than the other magnetic anomalies and formed a dendritic structure. [...] To test {{the validity of the}} assertion that the magnetic anomaly was indeed the result of lightning and not another process, Maki (2005) tested the soil samples against known standards indicative of LIRM anomalies developed by Dunlop et al. (1984), Wasilewski and Kletetschka (1999), and Verrier and Rochette (2002). [...] These standards include, but are not limited to: 1) Average REM (ratio between natural remanent magnetization to a laboratory standard value) greater than 0.2, and 2) Average Koenigsberger ratio (ratio between natural remanent magnetization and the natural field created by Earth's magnetic field). [...] The findings indicated the evidence of LIRM at the archaeological site. LIRM anomalies also complicated the determination of the relative location of the poles during the late Cretaceous from the magnetic field record of basaltic lava flows in Mongolia. [...] The presence of LIRM-affected rocks was determined when calculated Koenigsberger ratios were drastically higher than other magnetic signatures in the region.|$|E

5000|$|In 1962 Matthews, as a {{research}} fellow at King's College, Cambridge, made a survey across part of an ocean ridge in the north-west Indian Ocean. This revealed a pattern of magnetic anomalies running in parallel stripes and virtually symmetrically {{on either side of the}} ridge. The most plausible explanation for these anomalies required the assumption (already in circulation at the time, but not yet proven) that the Earth's magnetic field had reversed its polarity repeatedly over time. Ocean crust consists of basic igneous rock, containing significant amounts of magnetite. When such rock solidifies, the magnetite aligns itself with the prevailing magnetic field at the time, thus providing a sort of [...] "fossil" [...] <b>magnetic</b> <b>record.</b> If new crust were being formed at the ridges and moving away, as Hess theorized, then reversals in the Earth's magnetic polarity would result in just the kind of parallel, symmetrical anomalies that Matthews' survey had found. The ocean crust would in effect act as a kind of giant tape recorder of magnetic anomalies over time.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring an earthquake, the {{physical}} and the chemical transformations along a slip zone lead to an intense deformation within the gouge layer of a mature fault zone. Because the gouge contains ferromagnetic minerals, it {{has the capacity to}} behave as a magnetic recorder during an earthquake. This constitutes a conceivable way to identify earthquakes slip zones. In this paper, we investigate the <b>magnetic</b> <b>record</b> of the Chelungpu fault gouge that hosts the principal slip zone of the Chi-Chi earthquake (Mw 7. 6, 1999, Taiwan) using Taiwan Chelungpu-fault Drilling Project core samples. Rock magnetic investigation pinpoints the location of the Chi-Chi mm-thick principal slip zone within the 16 -cm thick gouge at ~ 1 km depth. A modern magnetic dipole of Earth magnetic field is recovered throughout this gouge but not in the wall rocks nor in the two other adjacent fault zones. This <b>magnetic</b> <b>record</b> resides essentially in two magnetic minerals; magnetite in the principal slip zone, and neoformed goethite elsewhere in the gouge. We propose a model where magnetic record: 1) is preserved during inter-seismic time, 2) is erased during co-seismic time and 3) is imprinted during post-seismic time when fluids cooled down. We suggest that the identification of a stable <b>magnetic</b> <b>record</b> carried by neoformed goethite may be a signature of friction-heating process in seismic slip zone...|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{studies of}} {{sedimentary}} records {{provide an opportunity}} to characterize both anthropogenic and naturally-induced climate change and place these changes in a temporal framework {{in order to understand the}} timing of these changes and potential forcing mechanisms. The focus of this dissertation is the use of paleomagnetism and environmental magnetism in different environments (estuarine, lacustrine, and terrestrial), that span thousands to millions of years, to characterize changes in depositional environment overtime, identify the mechanisms responsible for those changes, constrain them within the geologic time scale, and ultimately relate those changes to regional and/or global climate. ^ The Chesapeake Bay is a drowned river valley estuary formed by the flooding of the Susquehanna River and adjacent coastal plains during post-glacial sea-level rise. The magnetic properties of several cores from the axial channel and shallow flanks record the inundation process by identifying changes in erosion and deposition. In addition to these natural changes, European settlement within the watershed and adjacent coastline increased sedimentation in the bay by exposing surface and subsurface soils to erosion through deforestation and cultivation. ^ A paleo- and environmental <b>magnetic</b> <b>record</b> from Bear Lake (Idaho-Utah) details changes in the hydrological balance of the lake over several glacial and interglacial cycles. Millennial-scale variations in the abundance of Fe-oxides (similar in timing to North Atlantic Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillations) suggest a relationship between the size of the Laurentide ice sheet, the position of the polar jet stream, and glacial advances in the Uinta Mountains. ^ The <b>magnetic</b> <b>record</b> from Gorina Quarry of the Buenos Aires Province of Argentina shows a series pedogenic complexes formed during several periods of soil formation and loess deposition.
