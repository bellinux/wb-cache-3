40|$|Experimental {{electrolysis}} cells using various platinum catalyzed carbon electrodes were tested. When operated at 200 mA/sq cm {{current density}} using 50 w/o acid at 50 C and 1 atm, a reference cell required 1. 22 volts and degraded rapidly. After several improvements {{were incorporated into}} electrodes and the test cell configuration, a later cell required only 0. 77 volts under identical operating conditions. At a lower current density, 100 mA/sq cm, the cell required only 0. 63 volts. Kinetic studies on metal electrodes, measurements of temperature effects on electrode kinetics, investigations of electrocatalytic activities of metal electrodes {{over a wide range}} of acid concentrations, cyclic voltametric studies and evaluation of alternate catalysts were also conducted. From diffusivity experiments, a cation exchange membrane material, P- 4010, exhibited an excellent diffusion coefficient, more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of rubber. Ionic resistivity measurements of eight materials showed that <b>microporous</b> <b>rubber</b> had the lowest resistivity...|$|E
40|$|Apparently, {{electrolyte}} retention in the TESC {{was the most}} critical variable for reproducibil ity obtain-ing O 2 reduction at a rate sufficient o establish an O 2 cycle in a practical Pb-acid cell, without resorting to an auxil iary electrode. It is a complex function of the four variables mentioned previously. Since it was not feasible to optimize {{electrolyte retention}} through con-trol of electrode and/or separator porosity or cell pack pressure, only el imination of the free electrolyte reser-voir remained as a possible technique to achieve such control. This method was evaluated by raising the cell pack 0. 5 in. above {{the bottom of the}} test cell. The electrolyte level could then be dropped below the bottom of the cell pack, el iminating all contact between them. Ionic contact o the reference electrode was maintained through a thin piece of separator on {{the back side of the}} test electrode which dipped into the electrolyte reservoir. Five such fully exposed elec-trodes, with three layers of <b>microporous</b> <b>rubber</b> on their inside faces, yielded Iss's of [...] 110, [...] 78, [...] 114, [...] 118, and [...] 93 mA at [...] 50 mV ~ 1 and 1 psig O 2 in 1. 3 sp gr H 2 SO 4. These Iss'S lie in a significantly narrower range toward the upper end of the values obtained previously. Since b~) th O 2 diffusion and the ability to send cur-rent through the system are heavily dependent on the amount of electrolyte retained in the TESC, over which there was no effective control, this data should not be considered to represent exactly the O 2 reduc-tion capability of the Pb/PbSO 4 electrode. Satisfactory operation of maintenance-free Pb-acid cells will re-quire close control of electrolyte metering. The op-t imum amount of electrolyte will have to be deter-mined through a study of the initial distribution of electrolyte between electrodes and separators and its variation with cycling.

40|$|This review {{describes}} the recent development of membrane reactors for biological {{treatment of waste}} gases. In this type of bioreactor gaseous pollutants are transferred through a membrane to the liquid phase, where micro-organisms degrade the pollutants. The membrane bioreactor combines the advantages of membrane devices with the clean technology of biological air purification. Two types of membrane materials {{can be used for}} gas-liquid contact: hydrophobic microporous material and dense material, such as silicone <b>rubber.</b> <b>Microporous</b> material generally has a higher permeability, but dense membranes can be advantageous in the case specific selectivity is required. Biomass is generally present as a biofilm on the membrane, but may also be suspended in the liquid phase. In a number of cases the reactor performance appears to be hampered by an unstable biofilm performance and/or by clogging of the liquid channels due to excess biomass formation. So far, membrane bioreactors for waste gas treatment have only been tested on laboratory scale. If the long-term stability of these reactors can be demonstrated, we expect membrane bioreactors to be useful tools in the treatment of gas streams containing poorly water-soluble pollutants and highly chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are difficult to treat with the conventional methods for biofiltration...|$|R
