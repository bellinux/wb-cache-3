On October 17, 2006, a federal judge rejected New York City's refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city. Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks. Christine Todd Whitman, administrator of the EPA {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, was heavily criticized by a U.S. District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe. <b>Mayor</b> <b>Giuliani</b> was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return quickly to the greater Wall Street area.|$|E
25|$|In March 1996, the New York City Council sued <b>Mayor</b> <b>Giuliani</b> {{over the}} {{proposed}} {{sale of the}} hospitals. The conflict over hospitals {{was one of several}} power struggles between the mayor and the City Council after the dissolution of the New York City Board of Estimate in 1990. In March 1996, Mount Sinai withdrew bids to take over Queens Hospital and Elmhurst Hospital. Later that month, the Community Advisory Board of QHC also filed suit against the mayor. The plans to sell Coney Island Hospital were blocked by the New York Supreme Court on January 15, 1997. According to the ruling, the 1970 state law creating the Health and Hospitals Corporation did not grant the agency the ability to sell or lease city hospitals; this power had been previously held by the Board of Estimate. By mid-1997, <b>Mayor</b> <b>Giuliani</b> dropped his plans to sell the hospitals.|$|E
25|$|On August 19, 1997, {{after the}} failed sale, <b>Mayor</b> <b>Giuliani</b> {{announced}} plans to construct state-of-the-art buildings on the Queens Hospital Center campus. Originally planned with 379 beds, the new hospital later had its capacity reduced to 200. The project was promoted by Queens Borough President Claire Shulman. Ground broke on the new hospital on October 8, 1998. At least three of the original buildings were demolished to make room. The construction of new hospital took place in spite of continuing attempts to sell or privatize the hospital. The project was financed with taxable municipal bonds issued from the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, in order to lower costs in the event the city decided to sell the hospital in the future. The new Queens Hospital Center, which cost $147 million to construct, was opened December 5, 2001, at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by <b>Mayor</b> <b>Giuliani.</b>|$|E

Despite his strong support of <b>Mayor</b> <b>Giuliani,</b> Badillo's bid for Mayor never received serious support from Giuliani or the Republican Party, and lost badly in the Republican primary to billionaire Michael Bloomberg, {{who had just}} switched parties as Badillo had done earlier.|$|E
25|$|During {{his first}} term as mayor of New York City, Giuliani hired a new police commissioner, William Bratton, who applied the broken windows theory of urban decay, which holds that minor {{disorders}} and violations create a permissive atmosphere that leads to further and more serious crimes that can threaten {{the safety of a}} city. Within several years, Giuliani was widely credited for major improvements in the city's quality of life, and in lowering the rate of violent crimes. While still <b>Mayor,</b> <b>Giuliani</b> ran for the U.S. Senate in 2000; however, he withdrew from the race upon learning of his prostate cancer diagnosis. Giuliani was named Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2001, and was given an honorary knighthood in 2002 by the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II for his leadership {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.|$|E

500|$|The Van Cortlandt Stadium {{was built}} by Parks Commissioner Moses and Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia during the Great Depression, and was funded by Works Progress Administration. It is located north of Van Cortlandt Park South near Broadway in the park's {{southwest}} corner. The stadium opened on September 22, 1939, to a day of track events and a football game between Manhattan College and Fordham University. It had 18 tennis courts, five basketball courts, six handball courts, three baseball fields, three football fields (including one in the stadium itself), three horseshoe pitching fields, a running track, and a bowling green, as well as water fountains and lockers. In 1994, <b>Mayor</b> <b>Giuliani</b> funded a $415,000 project for concrete repairs to the stadium, and in 1998, the [...] running track was rebuilt for nearly a million dollars.

2500|$|During {{his eight}} years as <b>mayor,</b> <b>Giuliani</b> was a {{constant}} advocate of publicly funded stadiums.

[...] The dual $1 billion plans had also been put forth unsuccessfully by Giuliani in 1996. [...] Giuliani faced questions about how to finance these stadiums, while the city struggled to balance the budget. Recently built stadiums in Baltimore and Cleveland had cost one-third to one-fourth the $1 billion set aside for the proposed New York stadiums; the $1 billion stadiums were to be the most expensive in American history. His 1998 plan to relocate the Yankees to the west side of Manhattan had been met with strong opposition; at that time, $3 million in city money was given to the Yankees for site planning. [...] Six city officials were sent on a city trip to explore stadiums in Baltimore, Denver and other cities.|$|E

About one week after the shooting, Clinton visited with O'Connor, Blum and McEntee. During his first major speech since his election as <b>mayor,</b> <b>Giuliani</b> cited the Ferguson murders while he repeated his previous calls for the death penalty and a uniform gun licensing law. During his monthly radio call-in show, Governor Mario Cuomo called the Ferguson shootings [...] "a dramatic, spectacular slaughter", and called for stronger gun control measures. U.S. Senator Al D'Amato said the Ferguson case demonstrated the need for capital punishment in New York State because [...] "that is the only fitting punishment for this cold-blooded killer".|$|E
