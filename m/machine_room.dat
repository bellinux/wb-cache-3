5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof <b>machine</b> <b>room.</b> The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. The locomotive is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The <b>machine</b> <b>room</b> has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key is locked {{in such a way that}} it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented {{witnesses who}} testified to bloodstains and {{strands of hair}} found on the lathe, to support their theory that the murder occurred on the factory's second floor in the <b>machine</b> <b>room</b> near Frank's office. The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested {{the place of the}} murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.|$|E

25|$|The first Nord-1 {{was inaugurated}} on 21 May 1968 {{and sent to}} the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) to have {{instruments}} installed. It spent a year in Trondheim and was constantly needing repairs. However, once it was not constantly being tweaked by engineers it operated for eighteen months without any failures. The Nord-1 was installed on MS Taimyr—a newly constructed Wilh. Wilhelmsen freight vessel—on 16 June 1969. This was the world's first such on-ship computer, which both featured an automatic radar plotting aid and an automated <b>machine</b> <b>room.</b> By 1973, Norsk Data had delivered 105 units to Norcontrol.|$|E

50|$|This layout {{is usually}} {{reflected}} in the internal elevator zoning. Since nearly all elevators require <b>machine</b> <b>rooms</b> above the last floor they service, mechanical floors are often used to divide shafts that are stacked {{on top of each}} other to save space. A transfer level or skylobby is sometimes placed just below those floors.|$|R

[...] In August 2011, Brighton and Hove City Council approved a planning application for some renovation and remodelling work, including an extension.

500|$|The {{sessions}} for Revolver furthered {{the spirit of}} studio experimentation evident on Rubber Soul. With the Beatles increasingly involved {{in the production of}} their music, Martin's role as producer had changed to one of a facilitator and collaborator, whereby the band now relied on him to make their ideas a reality. According to Rodriguez, Revolver marked {{the first time that the}} Beatles integrated studio technology into the [...] "conception of the recordings they made". He views this approach as reflective of the group's waning interest in live performance before crowds of screaming fans, [...] "in favor of creating soundscapes without limitation" [...] in a studio environment. For the first time at EMI Studios, the company's four-track tape machines were placed in the studio's control room, alongside the producer and balance engineer, rather than in a dedicated <b>machine</b> <b>room.</b> The Beatles' new recording engineer on the project was nineteen-year-old Geoff Emerick, whom author and critic Ian MacDonald describes as an [...] "English audio experimentalist" [...] in the tradition of Joe Meek. Emerick recalls that no preproduction or rehearsal process took place for Revolver; instead, the band used the studio to create each song from what was often just an outline of a composition. Speaking shortly before the start of the sessions, Lennon said that they had considered making the album a continuous flow of tracks, without gaps to differentiate between each song.|$|E

2500|$|The second torpedo struck {{about three-quarters}} of the way along the ship, just outside the rear limit of the side armour plating. The torpedo punched through {{the side of the}} ship before {{exploding}} in the aft <b>machine</b> <b>room.</b> The explosion tore upward through two messes and a relaxation area called [...] "the Soda Fountain" [...] before finally ripping a 20-metre-long hole in the main deck. Later reports put the number of deaths in the area around the explosion at 275 men. After the explosion, the ship rapidly filled with smoke. The explosion also damaged [...] General Belgranos electrical power system, preventing her from putting out a radio distress call. Though the forward bulkheads held, water was rushing in through the hole created by the second torpedo and could not be pumped out because of the electrical power failure.
