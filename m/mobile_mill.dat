5000|$|Sepro Mobile Plants are {{designed}} to be easily re-locatable as they are mounted on road transportable custom built trailer assemblies. These include the Sepro <b>Mobile</b> <b>Mill</b> Plant and Sepro Mobile Flotation Plant, both of which were installed by Banks Island Gold Ltd at the company's Yellow Giant Gold Property on the coast of British Columbia. They can be designed to encompass a wide variety of process options from crushing through to the final concentrate collection. [...] Sepro Modular and Skid Mounted Plants are engineered around structural elements that are simple and easy to erect on site. These plants can be designed with larger equipment for higher tonnage applications than that of the Sepro Mobile Plants. One example is a 360 TPD Gold Processing Plant Sepro supplied to ProEurasia LCC for the Vladimirskaya Project in Russia. This included milling, gravity and smelting circuits.|$|E
40|$|With <b>mobile</b> <b>milling</b> machines, large plant {{components}} can {{be repaired}} directly on their site of operation. Transportation costs and transportation risk for these expensive and heavy work pieces are avoided and downtime {{for the plant}} can be reduced greatly. In the article a solution for a mobile machine using the principle of parallel kinematics is presented. Furthermore, methods for implementing and coordinate allocation, as well as assistance systems for the generation of the machining path are shown. The applicability {{of the system is}} demonstrated for the revision of large turbine rotors...|$|R
50|$|Chris Mills is the {{president}} and co-founder of Hitcents, a technology-based creative agency in Bowling Green, Kentucky specializing in web design, application development and <b>mobile</b> games. <b>Mills</b> currently manages the Hitcents offices in the United States and China.|$|R
50|$|Various {{travelling}} shops {{served the}} area over the years, including Burke's of High Street (Brendan Whelan), Harry Campbell of Vicarschoroland and Jack Grady of High Street. Jack Grady {{was the last}} to offer this service, which ceased in the late 1970s. The late Jack Grady also provided a <b>mobile</b> threshing <b>mill</b> service to the local community from the late 1940s to the mid-1970s.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It {{is known}} for the {{traditional}} milling machine in operation at low speed and efficiency. This paper describes the research of servo motor control strategies for the <b>mobile</b> gantry <b>milling</b> machine. The principles of AC servo motor dynamics, master-slave servo control, and adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference system based on controller are illustrated. Using these strategies when the master servo motor is interference by the external signal, the reference speed of the slave servo motor can follow just like the master motor. Finally the mechanical coupling can be eliminated and the mechanical damage can be avoided...|$|R
500|$|Hagley mill is a {{historic}} site, [...] south of Hagley's centre, on part of the former Hagley Estate. The mill and land are owned by the Department of Transport; they were acquired {{as part of the}} construction of Bass Highway. The site's significance is that it is possibly the only extant mill in Australia that was horse-driven, and almost certainly the only example in Tasmania. The mill and associated buildings date from 1830–40. The mill appears to have been converted c.1870 to fit a <b>mobile</b> steam <b>mill.</b> Its wheel house has original ironstone foundations and brick walls forming an octagonal building, a design peculiarity to accommodate the horses and driving mechanism. The site has a barn, one-room cottage and dairy that all date from the mill's construction.|$|R
30|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{facility}} design prescribed {{to address the}} challenges of meeting high operational efficiency and flexibility in highly volatile environments is dynamic system reconfiguration (DSR). An early paper on modeling a multi-period dynamic functional layout where departments can be relocated was published by Rosenblatt (1986). More recent works that attempt to solve dynamic functional layout problems include Balakrishnan et al. (2000), Dunker et al. (2005), Baykasoglu et al. (2006), McKendall and Shang (2006), McKendall et al. (2006) and Pillai et al. (2011). There is also substantial literature on DSR {{in the context of}} cellular manufacturing systems (CMS). For example, Chen (1998) and Balakrishnan and Cheng (2005) developed mathematical models for DSR of cellular manufacturing systems and proposed dynamic programming approaches to solve their respective models. Defersha and Chen (2006 a) developed a comprehensive model that incorporates several design factors in addition to dynamic cell configuration. Later, in Defersha and Chen (2006 b), the authors developed a genetic algorithm to solve the comprehensive model. The use of a genetic algorithm, simulated annealing and Tabu search for DSR of cellular manufacturing systems was also reported in Wicks and Reasor (1999), Mungwattana (2000), Tavakkoli et al. (2005 b) and Tavakkoli et al. (2005 a). A solution technique based on artificial neural network can be found in Saidi and Safaei (2006). Dynamic reconfiguration of distributed layouts has been reported in Lahmer and Benjaafar (2005). Some technological advances are also enabling DSR. For instance, a compact and <b>mobile</b> <b>milling</b> machine (TRAK QuikCell QCM- 1) developed by Southwestern Industries ([URL] is small enough to fit through most doors and has a rigid frame that does not require re-leveling after each move. A shift to lighter machine tools is being driven by advances in materials and processing technologies (Heragu and Kochhar 1994). As well, there are now systems, such as robotic parkings ([URL] modular automated parking system, that allow easy storage and retrieval of large equipment and machine tools. Although originally designed for car parking garages, the technology is being used in manufacturing environments to store machine tools and retrieve them as needed (Benjaafar et al. 2002).|$|R
50|$|Alfred Irwin, {{treasurer}} of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, purchased the house in 1852. During the American Civil War his wife, Margaret Kilshaw Irwin, defended the home against Union soldiers by proclaiming the property neutral territory on account of her British citizenship and hanging the Union Jack from the balcony. T.K. and Lee Fearn Irwin, their sons, were both veterans of the Civil War and gained local prominence in the late 19th century. Lee served as Mobile's assistant postmaster, president of the Cherokee Cotton Mills, and manager of the <b>Mobile</b> Oil <b>Mills.</b> His older brother T.K., once aide to Confederate president Jefferson Davis, went on to establish the Mobile Cotton Exchange and later became its president. T.K. married Mary Anna Ketchum. Much of their correspondence from the Civil War years and after remains on file at Oakleigh today. Oakleigh remained in the Irwin family until sold by Daisy Irwin Clisby, granddaughter of Alfred, in 1916.|$|R
50|$|I-10 {{enters the}} city of <b>Mobile</b> at Halls <b>Mill</b> Creek just east of SR-193. The highway has a directional-T {{interchange}} with {{the southern end of}} I-65, which serves Montgomery and Birmingham. I-10 continues northeast from I-65 as an eight-lane freeway that parallels CSX's NO&M Subdivision rail line. The highway has a complex interchange with SR-163 (Dauphin Island Parkway) just east of the Dog River; the interchange includes a flyover from southbound SR-163 to eastbound I-10 and a left-ramp flyover from westbound I-10 to southbound SR-163. I-10 and the railroad form the northern margin of Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley (formerly Brookley Air Force Base), along which the freeway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Michigan Avenue. North of the airport, the Interstate has a pair of half-diamond interchanges with Duval Street and Broad Street; the half-interchanges are connected by a one-way pair of frontage roads.|$|R
