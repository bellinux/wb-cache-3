5|$|This {{equation}} {{relating the}} two radial forces {{can be understood}} qualitatively as follows. The difference in angular speeds (or equivalently, in angular <b>momenta)</b> causes {{a difference in the}} centripetal force requirement; to offset this, the radial force must be altered with an inverse-cube force.|$|E
5|$|To {{these rules}} we must add a further one for closed loops that implies an {{integration}} on <b>momenta</b> , since these internal ("virtual") particles are not constrained to any specific energy–momentum – even that usually required by special relativity (see this article for details).|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow {{him in their}} presentation. When performing calculations {{it is much easier}} to work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' <b>momenta</b> rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then look the same, but the lines have different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and <b>momenta.</b>|$|E
5|$|Philosophers {{in antiquity}} used {{the concept of}} force {{in the study of}} {{stationary}} and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing <b>momenta</b> near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.|$|E
25|$|For comparison, in the {{equivalent}} Euler–Lagrange {{equations of motion}} of Lagrangian mechanics, the conjugate <b>momenta</b> also do not appear; however, those equations are a system of N, generally second-order equations for the time evolution of the generalized coordinates. Similarly, Hamilton's equations of motion are another system of 2N first-order equations for the time evolution of the generalized coordinates and their conjugate <b>momenta</b> p1...pN.|$|E
25|$|Even if the {{generalized}} coordinates {{are just the}} ordinary spatial coordinates, the conjugate <b>momenta</b> {{are not necessarily the}} ordinary momentum coordinates. An example is found in the section on electromagnetism.|$|E
25|$|In each of {{the above}} cases, for a system of particles, the total angular {{momentum}} is just {{the sum of the}} individual particle angular <b>momenta,</b> and the centre of mass is for the system.|$|E
25|$|For a long time, lattice {{simulations}} {{seemed to}} indicate that the modified gluon and ghost propagators proposed by Gribov and Zwanziger were correct. In 2007, however, computers had become sufficiently strong to probe the region of low <b>momenta,</b> where the propagators are most modified, {{and it turned out that}} the Gribovndash&Zwanziger picture is not correct. Instead, the gluon propagator goes to a constant value when the momentum is taken to zero, and the ghost propagator still goes like 1/k2 at low <b>momenta.</b> This is the case for both 3 and 4 space-time dimensions. A solution to this discrepancy has been proposed, adding condensates to the Gribovndash&Zwanziger action.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the behavior of the theory at large and small <b>momenta,</b> a key quantity is the propagator. For a Yang–Mills theory we have to consider both the gluon and the ghost propagators. At large <b>momenta</b> (ultraviolet limit), the question was completely settled with the discovery of the asymptotic freedom. In this case it is seen that the theory becomes free (trivial ultraviolet fixed point for renormalization group) and both the gluon and ghost propagators are those of a free massless particle. The asymptotic states of the theory are represented by massless gluons that carry the interaction. The coupling runs to zero as we will see in the next section.|$|E
25|$|To {{explain these}} derivations, the {{following}} notation is introduced. First, the phase space {{is described in}} terms of generalized position coordinates q'j together with their conjugate <b>momenta</b> p'j. The quantities q'j completely describe the configuration of the system, while the quantities (q'j,p'j) together completely describe its state.|$|E
25|$|In quantum mechanics, {{coupling}} also {{exists between}} angular <b>momenta</b> belonging to different Hilbert spaces {{of a single}} object, e.g. its spin and its orbital angular momentum. If the spin has half-integer values, such as 1/2 for an electron, then the total (orbital plus spin) angular momentum will also be restricted to half-integer values.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{descriptions}} of motion: dynamics and kinematics. Dynamics is general, since <b>momenta,</b> forces and energy of the particles are taken into account. In this instance, sometimes the term refers to the differential equations that the system satisfies (e.g., Newton's second law or Euler–Lagrange equations), and sometimes to the solutions to those equations.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{consider}} virtual {{particles in}} a candidate {{formulation of the}} theory. Formally, special relativity requires that the range of <b>momenta</b> of the particles is infinite because one can change the momentum of a particle by an arbitrary amount through a change of frame of reference. If the formulation is not to distinguish any inertial frame of reference, the particles {{must be allowed to}} carry any value of momentum. Since the quantum field modes corresponding to particles with different <b>momenta</b> form different degrees of freedom, the requirement of including infinitely many values of momentum means that one requires the theory to involve infinitely many degrees of freedom. But for mathematical reasons, being forced to use computers for sufficiently precise calculations, one has to work with a finite number of degrees of freedom. One must limit the momentum range by some cutoff.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{results show}} that (nearly) all {{produced}} and observed neutrinos have left-handed helicities (spins antiparallel to <b>momenta),</b> and all antineutrinos have right-handed helicities, within the margin of error. In the massless limit, it means that only one of two possible chiralities is observed for either particle. These are the only chiralities included in the Standard Model of particle interactions.|$|E
25|$|The Delaunay orbital elements, {{commonly}} referred to as Delaunay variables, are action-angle coordinates consisting of the argument of periapsis, the mean anomaly and the longitude of the ascending node, along with their conjugate <b>momenta.</b> They are used to simplify perturbative calculations in celestial mechanics, for example while investigating the Kozai-Lidov oscillations in hierarchical triple systems. They were introduced by Charles-Eugène Delaunay during his study of the motion of the Moon.|$|E
25|$|Immediately after Heisenberg {{discovered}} his uncertainty principle, Bohr {{noted that the}} existence of any sort of wave packet implies uncertainty in the wave frequency and wavelength, since a spread of frequencies is needed to create the packet itself. In quantum mechanics, where all particle <b>momenta</b> are associated with waves, it is the formation of such a wave packet which localizes the wave, and thus the particle, in space. In states where a quantum mechanical particle is bound, it must be localized as a wave packet, and the existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value in particle wavelength, and thus also momentum and energy. In quantum mechanics, as a particle is localized to a smaller region in space, the associated compressed wave packet requires a larger and larger range of <b>momenta,</b> and thus larger kinetic energy. Thus the binding energy to contain or trap a particle in a smaller region of space increases without bound as the region of space grows smaller. Particles cannot be restricted to a geometric point in space, since this would require an infinite particle momentum.|$|E
25|$|Setting up {{a theory}} with a finite cutoff for {{mathematical}} reasons, one {{hopes that the}} cutoff can be made sufficiently large to avoid its appearance in observables of physical interest, but in local quantum field theories that are of interest in hadronic physics the situation is not that simple. Namely, particles of different <b>momenta</b> are coupled through the dynamics in a nontrivial way, and the calculations aiming at predicting observables yield results that depend on the cutoffs. Moreover, they {{do so in a}} diverging fashion.|$|E
25|$|The zero-phonon line is {{an optical}} analogy to the Mössbauer lines, which {{originate}} in the recoil-free emission or absorption of gamma rays from the nuclei of atoms bound in a solid matrix. In {{the case of the}} optical zero-phonon line, the position of the chromophore is the physical parameter that may be perturbed, whereas in the gamma transition, the <b>momenta</b> of the atoms may be changed. More technically, the key to the analogy is the symmetry between position and momentum in the Hamiltonian of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Both position and momentum contribute in the same way (quadratically) to the total energy.|$|E
25|$|At low <b>momenta</b> (infrared limit) the {{question}} has been more involved to settle. The {{reason is that the}} theory becomes strongly coupled in this case and perturbation theory cannot be applied. The only reliable approach to get an answer is performing lattice computation on a computer powerful enough to afford large volumes. An answer to this question is a fundamental one as it would provide an understanding to the problem of confinement. On the other side, it should not be forgotten that propagators are gauge-dependent quantities and so, they must be managed carefully when one wants to get meaningful physical results.|$|E
25|$|In reality, {{there is}} {{interaction}} between the electrons {{with each other and}} the atomic cores of the crystal. This has several consequences: For example, the unambiguous relation between energy and momentum of an electronic state is broken and an electronic band structure is formed. Measuring the momentum of one electronic state gives a distribution of <b>momenta</b> which are all separated by reciprocal lattice vectors. Hence, an ACAR measurement on a solid with completely filled bands (i.e. on an insulator) gives a continuous distribution. An ACAR measurement on a metal has discontinuities where bands cross the Fermi level in all Brillouin zones in reciprocal space. This discontinuous distribution is superimposed by a continuous distribution from the entirely filled bands. From the discontinuities the Fermi surface can be extracted.|$|E
25|$|In this {{approach}} the physical vacuum {{is viewed as}} the quantum superfluid which is essentially non-relativistic whereas the Lorentz symmetry is not an exact symmetry of nature but rather the approximate description valid only for the small fluctuations of the superfluid background. Within {{the framework of the}} approach a theory was proposed in which the physical vacuum is conjectured to be the quantum Bose liquid whose ground-state wavefunction is described by the logarithmic Schrödinger equation. It was shown that the relativistic gravitational interaction arises as the small-amplitude collective excitation mode whereas relativistic elementary particles can be described by the particle-like modes in the limit of low <b>momenta.</b> The important fact is that at very high velocities the behavior of the particle-like modes becomes distinct from the relativistic one - they can reach the speed of light limit at finite energy; also, faster-than-light propagation is possible without requiring moving objects to have imaginary mass.|$|E

500|$|Nuclei {{of two of}} {{the stable}} {{isotopes}} of xenon, 129Xe and 131Xe, have non-zero intrinsic angular <b>momenta</b> (nuclear spins, suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance). The nuclear spins can be aligned beyond ordinary polarization levels by means of circularly polarized light and rubidium vapor. The resulting spin polarization of xenon nuclei can surpass 50% of its maximum possible value, greatly exceeding the thermal equilibrium value dictated by paramagnetic statistics (typically 0.001% of the maximum value at room temperature, even in the strongest magnets). Such non-equilibrium alignment of spins is a temporary condition, and is called hyperpolarization. The process of hyperpolarizing the xenon is called optical pumping (although the process is different from pumping a laser).Xe ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the patent}} office {{promoted}} Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern. In [...] "Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung" [...] (""), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined <b>momenta</b> and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.|$|E
