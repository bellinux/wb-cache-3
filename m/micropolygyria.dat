50|$|Fukuyama {{congenital}} {{muscular dystrophy}} also affects the nervous system and various associated parts. FCMD affects normal development of the brain producing a broadly smooth, bumpy shaped cortex named cobblestone lissencephaly as well as various other malformations, notably <b>micropolygyria.</b> Children also experience delayed myelination in the brain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Micropolygyria,</b> {{also known}} as polymicrogyria, polygyria, or microgyria, is a {{neuronal}} migration disorder, a developmental anomaly of the brain characterized by development of numerous small convolutions (microgyri), causing mental retardation and/or other neurological disorders. It is present {{in a number of}} specific neurological diseases, notably multiple sclerosis and :Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, a specific disease cause by mutation in the :Fukutin gene (FKTN).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{mitochondrial}} translational machinery {{allows the}} genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to be translated in situ. Mitochondrial translation requires {{a number of}} nucleus-encoded protein factors, {{some of which have}} been found to carry mutations in patients affected by mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. We have previously described the first, and so far only, mutation in the mitochondrial elongation factor Tu, mt-EFTu, in a baby girl with polycystic encephalopathy, <b>micropolygyria,</b> and leukodystrophic changes. In spite that the mutant mt-EFTu was present in normal amount in the patient's tissues, mitochondrial translation was severely reduced, determining multiple defects in the amount and activity of mtDNA-dependent respiratory chain complexes. By an in-vitro reconstructed translational system, we here provide evidence that the mutant mt-EFTu variant fails to bind to aminoacylated mitochondrial tRNAs, thus explaining the observed impairment of mitochondrial translation. This is the first analysis on the molecular mechanism of a mtDNA translation defect due to a nuclear gene mutation...|$|E
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu), encoded by the TUFM gene, is {{a highly}} conserved GTPase, {{which is part of}} the mitochondrial protein translation machinery. In its activated form it delivers the aminoacyl-tRNAs to the A site of the mitochondrial ribosome. We report here on a baby girl with severe infantile macrocystic leukodystrophy with <b>micropolygyria</b> and a combined defect of complexes I and IV in muscle biopsy, caused by a novel mutation identified in TUFM. Using human mutant cells and the yeast model, we demonstrate the pathological role of the novel variant. Moreover, results of a molecular modeling study suggest that the mutant is inactive in mitochondrial polypeptide chain elongation, probably as a consequence of its reduced ability to bind mitochondrial aa-tRNAs. Four patients have so far been described with mutations in TUFM, and, following the first description of the disease in a single patient, we describe similar clinical and neuroradiological features in an additional patient...|$|E
40|$|Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is an {{uncommon}} sporadic nonfamilial congenital dysplastic abnormality {{of the central}} nervous system, characterized by enlargement of one cerebral hemisphere, with cranial asymmetry, hemiparesis, epilepsy, and mental retardation. It can occur in isolation or associated with various anomalies, namely skin disorders. The main neuropathologic findings are hemispheric gigantism, macro- and/or <b>micropolygyria,</b> cortical thickening with lack of lamination, blurred boundaries of the gray and white matter, and large ortho- and heterotopic neural cells. The results obtained by morphological investigations carried out on six patients with HME, compared with the findings recorded in similar studies performed on one patient with tuberous sclerosis (TS) and another with pachygyria, allow the authors to (a) confirm the dysplastic nature of HME and its autonomy from TS; (b) demonstrate that ortho- and heterotopic neuronal cells do not differentiate completely during proliferation and migration from the germinal matrix; (c) document, by means of flow cytometric study, a normal euploid DNA content in the enlarged hemisphere, consequently ruling out heteroploidy {{as a cause of}} both cell "hypertrophy" and enlargement of the malformed cerebral hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} autopsy {{case of a}} two-day-old female infant with a very unusual {{combination}} of neuroblastoma in situ in both adrenals and microcephaly. This baby was born to a 28 -year-old mother after 38 weeks of gestation, and died of respiratory difficulty 2 days later. At autopsy, the baby weighted 1, 840 gm, and the brain was extraordinarily small with a weight of 125 gm. The gyral pattern was simplified and irregular. Microscopically massive migration defects, pachygyria, <b>micropolygyria,</b> leptomeningeal glioneuronal islands, small corticospinal tract and heterotopic Purkinje cells in the cerebellum were found. In addition, there were medullary nodules in both adrenals. They measured 0. 7 x 0. 4 cm and 0. 7 x 0. 3 cm, respectively. These nodules showed the typical histological features of undifferentiated neuroblastoma. The tumor nodules were confined to the medullary portion and did not extend to the cortex or contiguous structures meeting the criteria of neuroblastoma in situ. Based on these unusual and seemingly unrelated sets of findings, {{it is suggested that}} the histogenesis of neuroblastoma in situ could {{be a part of the}} generalized dysontogenic process...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial protein {{translation}} {{is a complex}} process performed within mitochondria by an apparatus composed of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) –encoded RNAs and nuclear DNA–encoded proteins. Although the latter by far outnumber the former, {{the vast majority of}} mitochondrial translation defects in humans have been associated with mutations in RNA-encoding mtDNA genes, whereas mutations in protein-encoding nuclear genes have been identified in a handful of cases. Genetic investigation involving patients with defective mitochondrial translation led us to the discovery of novel mutations in the mitochondrial elongation factor G 1 (EFG 1) in one affected baby and, for the first time, in the mitochondrial elongation factor Tu (EFTu) in another one. Both patients were affected by severe lactic acidosis and rapidly progressive, fatal encephalopathy. The EFG 1 -mutant patient had early-onset Leigh syndrome, whereas the EFTu-mutant patient had severe infantile macrocystic leukodystrophy with <b>micropolygyria.</b> Structural modeling enabled us to make predictions about the effects of the mutations at the molecular level. Yeast and mammalian cell systems proved the pathogenic role of the mutant alleles by functional complementation in vivo. Nuclear-gene abnormalities causing mitochondrial translation defects represent a new, potentially broad field of mitochondrial medicine. Investigation of these defects is important to expand the molecular characterization of mitochondrial disorders and also may contribute to the elucidation of the complex control mechanisms, which regulate this fundamental pathway of mtDNA homeostasis...|$|E
