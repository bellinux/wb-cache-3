The ratio of flat web to curved web axial deformations and longitudinal rotations were calculated using NASTRAN models. <b>Multiplying</b> <b>factors</b> were developed from these calculations for various web thicknesses.

A survey book or ledger had to be kept to record the process and the gauging of the grain in the cistern, the couch, and on the floor. The volume of the grain was carefully measured, based upon the mean width, length and height, and calculated by mental arithmetic, pen and paper, or slide rule.
