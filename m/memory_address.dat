5|$|Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain {{either a}} program {{instruction}} or data. In a program instruction, bits 0–12 represented the <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> of the operand to be used, and bits 13–15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16bits were unused. The SSEM's single operand architecture {{meant that the}} second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only {{the address of the}} data in memory.|$|E

50|$|For {{implementations}} {{of programming}} languages that {{are using a}} compiler, identifiers are often only compile time entities. That is, at runtime the compiled program contains references to <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> and offsets rather than the textual identifier tokens (these <b>memory</b> <b>addresses,</b> or offsets, having been assigned by the compiler to each identifier).|$|R
25|$|SU (subtract): Subtract (one's complement) {{the data}} at the {{referenced}} <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> from {{the contents of}} register A and store the result in A.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that even}} if I/O chips like VIC-II only uses 64 {{positions}} in the <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> space, it will occupy 1,024 addresses because some address bits are left undecoded.|$|E
25|$|MP (multiply): Multiply the {{contents}} of register A by the data at the referenced <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> and store the high-order product in register A and the low-order product in register LP. The parts of the product agree in sign.|$|E

25|$|On April 25, 2005, Microsoft {{released}} Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows Server 2003, x64 Editions in Standard, Enterprise and Datacenter SKUs.

25|$|Though tries {{are usually}} keyed by {{character}} strings, {{they need not}} be. The same algorithms {{can be adapted to}} serve similar functions of ordered lists of any construct, e.g. permutations on a list of digits or shapes. In particular, a bitwise trie is keyed on the individual bits making up any fixed-length binary datum, such as an integer or <b>memory</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E

25|$|One {{technique}} used on early IBM XT computers was to install additional RAM into the video <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> range {{and push the}} limit up {{to the start of}} the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA). Sometimes software or a custom address decoder was required for this to work. This moved the barrier to 704 KB (with MDA/HGC) or 736 KB (with CGA).|$|E
25|$|Calculators {{also have}} the ability to store numbers into {{computer}} memory. Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in variables. The variables can also be used for constructing formulas. Some models {{have the ability to}} extend memory capacity to store more numbers; the extended <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> is termed an array index.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1952, a {{high-speed}} shifter was added, which improved the speed for shifting {{by a factor}} of five. In July 1953, a 100-word expansion core memory was added to the system, using binary coded decimal, excess-3 number representation. To support this expansion memory, ENIAC was equipped with a new Function Table selector, a <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> selector, pulse-shaping circuits, and three new orders were added to the programming mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|A stack {{is usually}} {{represented}} in computers by {{a block of}} memory cells, with the [...] "bottom" [...] at a fixed location, and the stack pointer holding {{the address of the}} current [...] "top" [...] cell in the stack. The top and bottom terminology are used irrespective of whether the stack actually grows towards lower <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> or towards higher <b>memory</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{best way}} {{to speed up the}} baby-step giant-step {{algorithm}} is to use an efficient table lookup scheme. The best in this case is a hash table. The hashing is done on the second component, and to perform the check in step 1 of the main loop, γ is hashed and the resulting <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> checked. Since hash tables can retrieve and add elements in O(1) time (constant time), this does not slow down the overall baby-step giant-step algorithm.|$|E
25|$|In both {{segmentation}} and paging, certain {{protected mode}} registers specify to the CPU what <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> it should allow a running program to access. Attempts to access other addresses trigger an interrupt which cause the CPU to re-enter supervisor mode, placing the kernel in charge. This {{is called a}} segmentation violation or Seg-V for short, and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation, {{and because it is}} usually a sign of a misbehaving program, the kernel generally resorts to terminating the offending program, and reports the error.|$|E
25|$|DV (divide): Divide the {{contents}} of register A by the data at the referenced <b>memory</b> <b>address.</b> Store the quotient in register A and the absolute value of the remainder in register Q. Unlike modern machines, fixed-point numbers were treated as fractions (notional decimal point just to right of the sign bit), so you could produce garbage if the divisor was not larger than the dividend; there was no protection against that situation. In the Block II AGC, a double-precision dividend started in A and L (the Block II LP), and the correctly signed remainder was delivered in L. That considerably simplified the subroutine for double precision division.|$|E

25|$|The AGC {{transferred}} data to {{and from}} memory through the G register in a process called the memory cycle. The memory cycle took 12 timing pulses (11.72μs). The cycle began at timing pulse 1 (TP1) when the AGC loaded the <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> to be fetched into the S register. The memory hardware retrieved the data word from memory at the address specified by the S register. Words from erasable memory were deposited into the G register by timing pulse 6 (TP6); words from fixed memory were available by timing pulse 7. The retrieved memory word was then available in the G register for AGC access during timing pulses 7 through 10. After timing pulse 10, the data in the G register was written back to memory.|$|E
25|$|TS (transfer to storage): Store {{register}} A at {{the specified}} <b>memory</b> <b>address.</b> TS also detects, and corrects for, overflows {{in such a}} way as to propagate a carry for multi-precision add/subtract. If the result has no overflow (leftmost 2 bits of A the same), nothing special happens; if there is overflow (those 2 bits differ), the leftmost one goes the memory as the sign bit, register A is changed to +1 or −1 accordingly, and control skips to the second instruction following the TS. Whenever overflow is a possible but abnormal event, the TS was followed by a TC to the no-overflow logic; when it is a normal possibility (as in multi-precision add/subtract), the TS is followed by CAF ZERO (CAF = XCH to fixed memory) to complete the formation of the carry (+1, 0, or −1) into the next higher-precision word. Angles were kept in single precision, distances and velocities in double precision, and elapsed time in triple precision.|$|E
25|$|Most micro kernels use {{a message}} passing system {{of some sort}} to handle {{requests}} from one server to another. The message passing system generally operates on a port basis with the microkernel. As an example, if a request for more memory is sent, a port is opened with the microkernel and the request sent through. Once within the microkernel, the steps are similar to system calls. The rationale {{was that it would}} bring modularity in the system architecture, which would entail a cleaner system, easier to debug or dynamically modify, customizable to users' needs, and more performing. They are part of the operating systems like AIX, BeOS, Hurd, Mach, macOS, MINIX, QNX. Etc. Although micro kernels are very small by themselves, in combination with all their required auxiliary code they are, in fact, often larger than monolithic kernels. Advocates of monolithic kernels also point out that the two-tiered structure of microkernel systems, in which most of the operating system does not interact directly with the hardware, creates a not-insignificant cost in terms of system efficiency. These types of kernels normally provide only the minimal services such as defining <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> spaces, Inter-process communication (IPC) and the process management. The other functions such as running the hardware processes are not handled directly by micro kernels. Proponents of micro kernels point out those monolithic kernels have the disadvantage that an error in the kernel can cause the entire system to crash. However, with a microkernel, if a kernel process crashes, it is still possible to prevent a crash of the system as a whole by merely restarting the service that caused the error.|$|E
