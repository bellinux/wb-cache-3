5|$|Under Napoleon, a new {{emphasis}} towards the destruction, not just outmanoeuvring, of enemy armies emerged. Invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive. The political effect of war increased; defeat for a European power <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> than {{the loss of}} isolated enclaves. Near-Carthaginian peaces intertwined whole national efforts, intensifying the Revolutionary phenomenon of total war.|$|E
5|$|More of the {{octagonal}} $50 {{pieces were}} sold {{than of the}} round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed.|$|E
5|$|This {{proposed}} recognition <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> to Floyd {{even than}} trade advantages and justice; {{it was another}} step in the disenthrallment of America. It would afford relief from that political plexus which had {{made it impossible for}} one European nation to move, even in matters relating to America, without creating a corresponding movement in each of the others. He was tired of negotiating the things which related exclusively to America in London, Paris, and Madrid.|$|E
50|$|Recruiter {{elections}} were elections held during {{the seventeenth century}} to fill vacant seats in the House of Commons in England. The words 'recruit' and 'recruiter' <b>meant</b> nothing <b>more</b> than filling a vacancy, so, the contemporary phrase recruiter member of parliament, <b>meant</b> nothing <b>more</b> than {{a member of the}} House of Commons who had been elected in a By-election.|$|R

5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use superheated steam propulsion. The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E
5|$|Saggers {{started the}} tour as the clear second-choice wicket-keeper, as Don Tallon {{had played in}} each of Australia's 11 Tests since the {{resumption}} of cricket after the Second World War, while Saggers was yet to make his Test debut. Saggers made his first-class debut shortly {{before the start of}} the war, and after the resumption, was regarded as the second in line for Test selection behind Tallon. However, as Australia did not make any substantial tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities, there was no need to take a reserve gloveman on such trips. However, the trip to England <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> than six months abroad, so a back-up wicketkeeper was needed, and Saggers was selected for his first national squad.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{court upheld}} a {{socio-economic}} ranking system for commoners and nobles, {{which was based}} on the twenty-ranks system installed by the statesman Shang Yang (d. 338 BCE) of the State of Qin. All males above the age of 15 (excluding slaves) could be promoted in rank up to level eight. When a commoner was promoted in rank, he was granted a more honorable place in the seating arrangements of hamlet banquets, was given a greater portion of hunted game at the table, was punished less severely for certain crimes, and could become exempt from labor service obligations to the state. This system favored the elderly, since a longer lifespan <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> opportunities to become promoted. In addition to an increase in salary (see table to the right), newly promoted men were granted wine and ox-meat for a celebratory banquet. The 19th and 20th ranks were both marquess ranks, yet only a 20th rank allowed one to have a marquessate fief.|$|E

5|$|When Charles had {{announced}} {{that he wanted to}} work on an album of country music in 1961, during a period of racial segregation and tension in the United States, he received generally negative commentary and feedback from his peers, including fellow R musicians and ABC-Paramount executives. The country album concept, however, <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> to Charles as a test of his record label's faith in him and respect for his artistic freedom than as a test of social tolerance among listeners amid racial distinctions of country and R Fueled by his esteem for creative control, Charles pitched the idea of a country album to ABC representatives. Following the successful lobby of the concept and a contract renewal in early 1962, which was linked to the launching of his own Tangerine label, Charles prepared his band for the recording sessions that produced Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.|$|E

25|$|More debt {{securities}} <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> {{business for the}} Big Three agencies, which many investors depended on to judge the securities of the capital market.

Jan Kounen, director of D'autres mondes, also {{gave him a}} minor role in his 2004 Western, Blueberry (aka Renagade). When asked {{about the impact of}} his work with Jan Kounen, Arévalo said: [...] "It <b>meant</b> that <b>more</b> and more people became aware of ayahuasca shamanism, and that's good.

25|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} are {{credited with the}} discovery of skywave propagation on the shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used surface wave propagation at very low frequencies, which are attenuated along the path. Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> signal attenuation. This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.|$|E
25|$|More people <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> {{demand for}} {{services}} and information. In 1874, the Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) began offering horse-drawn public transportation.

A unified and paid Hamilton Fire Department, replaced the numerous volunteer fire companies in 1879, led by fire chief Alexander Aitchison.|$|E
25|$|No {{small part}} of Furness's {{historical}} significance {{lies in the fact}} that the young Louis Sullivan picked this office - then known as Furness & Hewitt - to work in for a short period after he left Ware's School in Boston.

25|$|Since 1998, the {{insurance}} company Western QBE had been Glory's title (front-of-shirt) sponsor. However, when ownership of the Glory was handed to FFA, Western QBE decided not to sponsor the club for the 2006–07 season. This left the Glory in a tough position—a lack of sponsorship and owners meant a lack of money, a lack of quality players, poor results and poor football, poor crowd attendances and low ticket sales. This is the model that had affected so many NSL clubs and led to their demise, and had led {{to the demise of}} the New Zealand Knights. Therefore, the Glory knew they needed to find a sponsor quickly, and transitional owners FFA knew they needed to find good owners in a timely fashion as well. 18 rounds into the 2006–07 season, Western QBE returned as title sponsor, signing for the remaining three rounds and {{until the end of the}} 2007–08 A-League season. This brought much-needed stability to the club; the funds helped to secure the supporters' faith, which set off another chain-reaction: fans <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> money, which <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> advertisement, which meant survival, which meant potential owners felt more secure about bidding for the club's licence. This all led to a much larger and more highly respected squad for the 2007–08 season.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in tobacco took hold. In turn, this <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> demand for tobacco from America again, and this meant a boom in increased slavery in the southern United States where tobacco was grown. Post American Revolution, tobacco skyrocketed in price. Wartime had a huge influence over the price of tobacco because, just prior to the Revolution, there was a small peak in price during the Seven Years' War when different cultures gained a desire for tobacco after fighting opponents who had been smoking it.|$|E
25|$|More {{available}} {{jobs in the}} cigar industry attracted more residents. Cigar workers found ready employment in the ever-growing number of large factories and small storefront shops (“buckeyes”) and came in ever-growing numbers. More immigration <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> amenities such as {{a wider range of}} businesses and more opportunities for social and cultural events, which in turn attracted more new residents, which attracted more businesses, etc. This cycle of growth lasted until the late 1920s, by which time Ybor City was home to hundreds of cigar making businesses {{and tens of thousands of}} permanent residents and had a thriving cultural scene.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, {{the arrival}} of Clive Lloyd <b>meant</b> <b>more</b> {{competition}} for batting places at Lancashire, and the county, under the captaincy of Jack Bond, embarked on a policy of concentrating on success in one-day cricket, where Atkinson's slow scoring and fielding limitations were shown up {{by a group of}} new and younger players. Atkinson played regularly in first-class matches until the middle of the season, but did not appear at all in the new John Player League, the Sunday one-day competition which Lancashire won in its first season. He was dropped from the side in mid July, and never appeared again in first-class cricket. He was 31 at the time.|$|E

Afterwards at odds over politics, they became estranged, but Hazlitt continued to follow the intellectual development of one who answered more closely to his idea of a man of genius than anyone he had ever met, as he continued to chastise Coleridge and other former friends for their abandonment of the radical ideals they had once shared.|$|E
25|$|Forza Motorsport is a {{simulation}} racing video game. Players compete in events {{around the globe}} using real licensed cars {{on a variety of}} real world and fictional courses.
