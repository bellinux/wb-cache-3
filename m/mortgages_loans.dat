The United States has home ownership rates comparable to Europe, but overall default rates are lower in Europe than in the United States.

50|$|In the UK variable-rate {{mortgages}} {{are more}} common, unlike the fixed-rate mortgage {{common in the}} United States. Home ownership rates are comparable to the United States, but overall default rates are lower. In the UK, mortgage loan financing relies less on securitized assets (such as mortgage-backed securities) than the United States, Denmark, and Germany, and more on deposits like Australia and Spain, since funds raised by building societies {{must be at least}} 50% deposits. Thus, lenders prefer variable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages to reduce potential interest rate risks between what they charging in mortgage interest and what they are paying in interest for deposits and other funding sources. Prepayment penalties are still common, whilst the United States has discouraged their use. Like other European countries {{and the rest of the}} world, but unlike most of the United States, <b>mortgages</b> <b>loans</b> are usually not nonrecourse debt, meaning debtors are liable for any loan deficiencies after foreclosure.|$|E

[...] She went on to advise: [...] "When an inexperienced person comes into possession of her fortune, and especially if it be a small one, her first inquiry is, 'How can I invest my money so as to get the highest possible interest?' Let her rather seek to place it where her Capital will be safest. The Duke of Wellington used to say, 'High interest is another name for bad security.' In this country 4½ per cent is generally the highest safe Interest you can receive: 4 per cent, more usually so. When 6, 7, 8, or more per cent, is offered by Banks, <b>Mortgages,</b> <b>Loans,</b> or Mines, beware of accepting it, as the probability is that you will lose both your Principal and Interest, as so many have done. Such an Interest can seldom be given consistently with safety." ...|$|E

30|$|The Spanish {{mortgages}} are loans with full-recourse {{in contrast}} with the limited recourse <b>mortgages</b> <b>loans</b> in the most states of the US. While in those states the guarantee is the dwelling, this is not so in Spain. In the event of a mortgage foreclosure, the lender seizes mortgagor’s dwelling, which is sold at auction at a price generally quite bellow its market price. After that, borrowers still hold a debt consisting in the outstanding mortgage debt minus the auction prize of the dwelling plus the interests for late payment, which are generally quite high. Mortgage foreclosure usually takes a long period (an even more in crisis times); 11 therefore, these interests consist in the accumulation of the monthly payment for the long period priced at an interest rate of 15 – 20  %. If mortgagors do not hold other real estate properties or businesses that can be included as guarantee in the mortgage contract, lenders will force borrowers to include another person, usually a relative, as a guarantor. The guarantor is responsible of the mortgage monthly payments in the event that borrowers cannot meet these payments. If the guarantor has no earnings or income to take responsibility of these mortgage monthly payments, lenders can seize also guarantor’s properties.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, most {{developed}} countries {{have suffered a}} severe recession due to a financial crisis starting in the US with <b>mortgages</b> <b>loans.</b> The lack of credit risk management has been pointed out {{as one of the}} causes of this bank panics. To avoid a similar situation, the credit card companies need to have proper risk management tools. This thesis presents a credit scoring system which aims at setting credit lines and thus, controlling credit risk. It includes three types of models: application scorecards, early detection scorecards and behavioral scorecards. They have been built on real and recent data coming from a German credit card company. The models have been built with a training sample and validated accordingly, using logistic regression. Information value and validation charts have been used for comparing the models. In the scoring process described, the scorecards are used in a sequential order. The author shows that minimizing losses might not be optimal in order to maximize profit. Finally, the author presents possible extensions to the research. The author hopes that the microeconomic analysis of the mechanics of a particular lender’s credit allocation process described in this thesis can play some part in preventing future financial crisis.
