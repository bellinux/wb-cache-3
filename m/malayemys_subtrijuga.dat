50|$|The Mekong {{snail-eating turtle}} (<b>Malayemys</b> <b>subtrijuga)</b> is {{a species of}} turtle in the Geoemydidae family. It was {{monotypic}} within the genus Malayemys until Brophy (2004, 2005) revalidated (based on morphology) Malayemys macrocephala (Gray, 1859) long time {{considered to be a}} synonym of M. subtrijuga.|$|E
50|$|Ang Trapaing Thmor {{sanctuary}} is also {{an important}} conservation area for a number of other threatened species. One globally threatened primate species, the long tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) is found within the sanctuary. One globally threatened ungulate species—the Eld's deer (Rucervus eldii)—and three globally threatened turtle species—the Asian box turtle (Cuora amboinensis), the Malayan snail-eating turtle (<b>Malayemys</b> <b>subtrijuga),</b> and the elongated tortoise (Indotestudo elongata)—are also found within Ang Trapaing Thmor.|$|E
40|$|Allometry, sexual dimorphism, and {{geographic}} variation were {{studied in the}} Malayan snail-eating turtle, <b>Malayemys</b> <b>subtrijuga</b> (Schlegel and Müller, 1844), using regression and discriminant function analyses. Allometry was evident in M. subtrijuga from the Chao Phraya River Basin. Shell shape changed in males as carapace length increased more than shell width and height, whereas females showed proportional changes. This difference in allometric growth yielded sexually dimorphic adults. Females attained larger sizes and had relatively wider and higher shells than males. Discriminant function analysis of shell and head-stripe characters revealed a clear pattern of geographic variation that {{was consistent with the}} topography of Southeast Asia and the poor dispersal abilities of these turtles. Two morphologically distinct groups of Malayemys occur allopatrically in lowland areas of mainland Southeast Asia, and each requires recognition as a distinct species. Turtles from the Mekong River Basin retain the name <b>Malayemys</b> <b>subtrijuga</b> (Schlegel and Müller, 1844), whereas those from the Chao Phraya and Mae Khlong basins, coastal areas of southeastern Thailand, and the Malay Peninsula are assigned the name Malayemys macrocephala (Gray, 1859). Both species are potentially threatened by overcollection and habitat destruction, and should be protected separately. Finally, discriminant function analysis of shell and head-stripe characters suggested that M. subtrijuga on Java were derived from the Mekong River Basin...|$|E
40|$|Geographic {{variation}} was {{studied in}} the south-east Asian turtles of the genus Malayemys (Testudines: Bataguridae). Discriminant function analysis of head-stripe and shell characters reveals a clear pattern of geographic variation {{that is consistent with}} the topography of south-east Asia and the poor dispersal abilities of these turtles. Two phenotypically and morphologically distinct groups of Malayemys occur allopatrically in lowland areas of mainland south-east Asia, and my data concludes that each should be recognized as a distinct species. Turtles from the Mekong River Basin retain the name <b>Malayemys</b> <b>subtrijuga</b> (Schlegel and Müller, 1844), whereas those from the Chao Phraya and Mae Klong river basins, coastal areas of south-eastern Thailand, and the Malay Peninsula are assigned the name Malayemys macrocephala (Gray, 1859). Malayemys macrocephala has four or fewer nasal stripes (99 %) and an infraorbital stripe that is relatively wide at the loreal seam (98 % of InfSW/HW= 0. 07 - 0. 18) and does not extend or extends only slightly superior to the loreal seam (96 %). Conversely, M. subtrijuga has six or more nasal stripes (89 %) and an infraorbital stripe that is relatively narrow at the loreal seam (92 % of InfSW/HW= 0. 02 - 0. 06), extends completely superior to the loreal seam (96 %), and usually joins the supraorbital stripe (64 %). Female M. macrocephala also have relatively longer AnL and relatively shorter Vert 5 L and PecL than M. subtrijuga. Similarly, male M. macrocephala have relatively longer PPLL and AbdL, relatively shorter Pleu 1 L and PecL, and greater RLatK values than M. subtrijuga. Both species are potentially threatened by overcollection and habitat destruction, and should be protected as separate taxa of concern. In addition, discriminant function analysis of shell and head-stripe characters suggests that M. subtrijuga on Java are derived by human intervention primarily from the Mekong River Basin...|$|E
