Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying Denny Duquette in medical drama Grey's Anatomy and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in [...] "Carpenter Street". He later explained to Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I had to pay <b>my</b> <b>bills.</b> I knew I'd play some guy saying some stuff. Then I got a call saying I needed to go in for a prosthetic fitting. I remember them dripping goop on my face, and I had straws sticking out of my nose. I couldn't eat lunch. I was claustrophobic. I'd go home in tears. This was the job that made me want to quit acting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Possibly no {{love was}} lost between Cole and Washington, the former calling the latter, {{one of the}} “companie of Caterpillar fellowes” who “live upon <b>my</b> <b>bills</b> of export.” This is the same Cole who {{declared}} [...] "he had formerly a better man (than Gov. Berkeley) for his pimpe.” [...] Washington may have had vested interests in the property and purchased the court ordered Anderson settlement acreage a few months later.|$|E

Dear me, dear me,’ he said, looking in my face with a curious, puzzled, and pathetic look, like a dull child at school, ‘if there be a judgment afterwards, <b>my</b> <b>bill</b> is long enough.’ ...|$|R

2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay <b>my</b> <b>bills,</b> and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very strange," [...] said I. [...] "And now, Summers, if {{you will}} bring me <b>my</b> <b>bills</b> and a new cheque-book, we will begin to get things into order." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay! nay! I've had enough," [...] said Lord Walterton, nodding a heavy {{head up and}} down, [...] "there are {{too many}} of <b>my</b> <b>bills</b> about as it is.... I've had enough." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Miss Devon, to-day is Saturday, and I'm makin' up <b>my</b> <b>bills,</b> so I'll {{trouble you}} for your month's board, and as much on the old account as you can let me have." ...|$|E
6000|$|TOUCHIT.--I paid my lodgings regularly, and <b>my</b> <b>bills</b> {{without asking}} questions. I never weighed the {{tea in the}} caddy, or counted the lumps of sugar, or heeded the rapid {{consumption}} of my liqueur-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Thorne replied thoughtfully, [...] "it {{might serve}} the purpose if he told Grantly that I {{generally}} paid <b>my</b> <b>bills.</b> I don't {{ask him to}} guarantee my account or back my draft. It wouldn't be reasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|The landlady met {{me at the}} door. ‘Here, madam,’ said she, with a curtsey insolently low, ‘here is <b>my</b> <b>bill.</b> Would it {{inconvenience}} you {{to settle}} it at once?’ ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{long after}} I {{received}} <b>my</b> <b>bill.</b> I was astounded at the nerve of it! For administering gas, debtor, so much; for removing teeth, debtor, so much;--and so on.|$|R
6000|$|... "With all my heart, sir. But, before quitting this house, I will {{discharge}} <b>my</b> <b>bill,</b> {{and communicate}} <b>my</b> position {{to a couple}} of friends, who are waiting in the passage." ...|$|R
6000|$|Roll on, thou ball, roll on! Through pathless {{realms of}} Space Roll on! What though I'm in a sorry case? What though I cannot meet <b>my</b> <b>bills?</b> What though I suffer toothache's ills? What though I swallow countless pills? Never YOU mind! Roll on! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I dare not," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have gone}} already further than I meant to. This {{house and the}} {{servants}} and carriages are costing me a small fortune. I dare not even look at <b>my</b> <b>bills.</b> Another house {{is not to be}} thought of." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I shouldn't like {{to disturb}} {{that kind of}} optimism--and here he is; I'll leave {{you to talk to}} him. As it happens, Elcot looks rather grumpy, and the mail-carrier has just brought out a sheaf of <b>my</b> <b>bills</b> from Winnipeg which he hasn't seen yet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Muddle it away, paying <b>my</b> <b>bills</b> with it,--according to the very, {{very old}} story.

It worked beautifully at first. I thought that I was going to pay all <b>my</b> <b>bills,</b> and have lots of money to spend. Then I doubled the stakes--I wanted to win a lot--and everything went wrong!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ''Tis her affianced,' {{said the}} Emir; 'the {{man who has}} robbed me of my natural bride. It is to be hoped, however, that, when she is married, Besso will adopt me as his son, which {{in a certain sense}} I am, having been fostered by his wife. If he do not leave me his fortune, he ought at least to take up all <b>my</b> <b>bills</b> in Syria. Don't you think so, my Tancred?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well, I have nought to {{complain}} of!' exclaimed Sir Gervas. 'They were brave-hearted boys {{for the most}} part. I might have had their names on <b>my</b> <b>bills</b> {{as long as their}} fingers could hold a pen, but slit me if I like bleeding my own companions. They might have found a place for me, too, had I consented to play second-fiddle where I had been used to lead the band. I' faith, I care not what I turn my hand to amongst strangers, but I would fain leave my memory sweet in town.' ...|$|E
60|$|I paid <b>my</b> <b>bill</b> and departed. The commissionnaire {{pushed open}} the door, whistle in hand. He looked at me a little curiously. Without doubt he had watched my attempt to speak to Delora. I drew a half-sovereign from my pocket.|$|R
