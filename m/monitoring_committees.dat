25|$|A triple-blind {{study is}} an {{extension}} of the double-blind design; the monitoring committee response variables is not told the identity of the groups. The committee is simply given data for groups A and B. A triple-blind study has the theoretical advantage of allowing the monitoring committee to evaluate the response variable results more objectively. This assumes that appraisal of efficacy and harm, as well as requests for special analyses, may be biased if group identity is known. However, in a trial where the monitoring committee has an ethical responsibility to ensure participant safety, such a design may be counterproductive since in this case monitoring is often guided by the constellation of trends and their directions. In addition, by the time many <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> receive data, often any emergency situation has long passed.|$|E

The aim is to, among others, have a law in the State that will make maternal death reportable and stipulates 10 hours duration for referral of pregnant women laboring in peripheral center. The Bill was eventually passed into Law on May 21, 2008 and assented to by the Governor on June 5, 2008.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of data monitoring {{and the need}} for the use of data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> in clinical trials sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry differ from those of trials sponsored by government. Data monitoring is a continuous process in industry trials due to the regulatory requirements and the need to more thoroughly evaluate safety of new compounds. As part of this process, interim analyses are employed to make decisions about treatment effects. In some cases, such analyses may require the use of an external data monitoring committee to assist in the data review, analysis and decision making. A number of examples of interim analyses, with and without data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees,</b> are discussed. Issues surrounding the need for external data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> and recommendations are presented. In particular the issues of sponsor participation in the data monitoring committee and controls of the decision making process are considered...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the impact of board structure on the performance of French firms in the presence of several <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees.</b> We studied 80 publicly listed French firms spanning from 2001 to 2013. We concluded that large board size has a negative effect on market performance. While large board size in combination with the existence of at least three committees enhances accounting performance and does not have any impact on market performance, the existence of a board dominated by independent directors with the presence of at least three committees seems to have only a negative impact on accounting performance. Our findings indicate that <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> are beneficial for shareholders only for corporations with a large board size...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{composition}} of boards of directors and their <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> (audit and compensation) for large Australian companies. For firms whose boards use a committee structure, much of the monitoring responsibility of the board is expected to rest with the independent committee members. We document a positive association between the proportion of independent directors on the full board and its <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees,</b> and {{a greater proportion of}} independent directors on both audit and compensation committees than the full board. Our hypotheses tests involve an examination of the impact of other mechanisms used to control agency conflicts on full board and committee independence, and the association between this independence and firm value. We find that full board independence is associated with low management ownership and an absence of substantial shareholders. Audit committee independence is associated with reduced monitoring by debtholders when leverage is low. While we predict a positive relationship between board and monitoring committee independence and firm value, our results do not support this conjecture...|$|E
