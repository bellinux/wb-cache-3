500|$|All of {{a sudden}} it was kicking off, big time. Everyone started piling in, right in front of me... The only people not {{involved}} were [...] John Lukic, Tony Adams, David O'Leary and me... I went over to break things up... and spotted the cavalry coming over the half-way line, in the shape of O'Leary and Adams. I felt it was <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> head them off at the pass and moved in, instinctively grabbing Adams with one hand and thumping him with the other." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It was {{the first}} film that I had done with Ang that was all in English, and it's Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant — these great, great actors. When you get footage like that, you realise that your job is really not technical. It was <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> look at {{something}} that Emma Thompson had done and say, 'Eh, that's not good, I'll use this other one instead.' And not only was I allowed to pass judgment on these tremendous actors, I was required to." ...|$|E
500|$|After unsuccessfully {{trying to}} persuade the referee to change his {{decision}} about the penalty, Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved. However, Seaman failed {{to hold on to}} the ball and Jason McAteer scored from the rebound. Although many people believe that he deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play, Fowler said at the time: [...] "As a goalscorer it's part of <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> take it and I wanted to score it. I tried to score. I never missed on purpose. It just happened, it was a bad penalty." ...|$|E

I have inherited the responsibilities of an embarrassed house. <b>My</b> <b>job's</b> <b>to</b> repair its credit, wipe out debts, and make Wyndhams' respected, as it was respected once. A big job, but the ambition behind it gives me driving force." ...|$|R
500|$|During the 2008 presidential campaign, Swift {{promoted}} the Every Woman Counts campaign, aimed at engaging {{women in the}} political process, {{and was one of}} many country stars to record a PSA for the Vote (For Your) Country campaign. She stated: [...] "I don't think it's <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> try and influence people which way they should vote." [...] Following Barack Obama's inauguration, she told Rolling Stone that she supported the president: [...] "I've never seen this country so happy about a political decision in my entire time of being alive. I'm so glad this was my first election." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{direction}} of the film, Selick reflected, [...] "It's as though he [...] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> make it look like 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films." [...] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, [...] "I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total." [...] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.|$|E
500|$|St. John {{was unaware}} that Malone and the {{producers}} of OLTL were considering him as Todd, but had no strategy in his performance once he won the role. [...] When speaking of the recast, he stated, [...] "It's nice, because I had instant concrete relationships." [...] He liked that he could consult old scripts and his fellow castmembers to gain information about his character, resources {{he did not have}} when playing Walker. [...] He was able to use these resources to figure out his relationship to other characters, which helped him analyze how to play a scene. [...] St. John stated that as an actor, he let the audience interpret the character, and believed in exploring and portraying the moment as it was written in the script. He said, [...] "Todd is already written on the page, so it's <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> bring him to life in that moment." ...|$|E

500|$|Further {{disappointment}} followed as the American 4 x 100m relay team, with Gay as anchor, {{failed to}} qualify for the final. Darvis Patton and Gay failed to pass on the baton in the heat. Gay personally took responsibility for the dropped baton but Patton denied this was true, saying [...] "That's Tyson Gay. He's a humble guy, but I know it's <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> get the guy the baton and I didn't do that." [...] After stating his desire to win four Olympic gold medals (by adding the 400 metres to his repertoire) earlier in the year, Gay finished the 2008 Olympics without a single medal. Having failed to reach the finals of the 100m sprint or relay, he reflected upon his failure to make the podium in Beijing: [...] " [...] then I went to grab it and there was nothing. It's kind of the way it's been happening to me this Olympics." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{autobiography}} released {{a few years}} later, Gerrard reflected that Liverpool were fortunate to win, but was critical of Arsenal's [...] "bitter" [...] reaction: [...] "Wenger and Ljungberg kept complaining about the hand-balls. Get real, boys. That's football. Grow up." [...] He reserved special praise for his opponent Vieira however, saying {{a few days after}} the game: [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> try and stop him, but he definitely got the better of me that day. He's such a great player. He's so fit, and he dictates the pace of a game. There are a lot of things you can learn just by watching him." [...] Assessing his career in a column for the Telegraph, Owen wrote that winning the cup was [...] "...the best day of my career, the game I look back on more than any other and think it was the most exhilarating experience I ever had playing football." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Damage a Man Can Do" [...] {{was filmed}} in early October 2008. On playing Harry as {{a figment of}} Dexter's imagination, James Remar told Vanity Fair that [...] "it's {{challenging}} to play a specter in somebody’s current existence." [...] He said: [...] "In my own life, I find myself doing some task [...] and {{having a conversation with}} my mother or father, who are both deceased. [...] I suspect lots of people do it. And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me. And so it's <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> do my best to be that image in Dexter's mind." [...] When asked about playing the only character to join Dexter in his [...] "kill room," [...] Jimmy Smits said: [...] "The crew has a great respect for what they are doing in those scenes. They are energized because those moments are the staple of the show, {{but at the same time}} they are very somber. Michael doesn't really like to interface with a lot of people on those days, because it's such a serious subject matter." ...|$|E

500|$|Liz {{says that}} she watches the CBS police {{procedural}} television series The Mentalist and that she has become a body language expert, in which she figures out that Jack has not told Colleen about Avery's pregnancy, similar to the show's series protagonist played by actor Simon Baker. Some reviewers have noted that Tracy's movie The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas is a parody to the movies [...] (2000), Norbit (2007), and the comedic fictional character Madea. Later, Tracy says [...] "As an actor, it is <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> tell the truth, hold the mirror to humanity, and sell Proactiv", this is a reference to Proactiv Solution, an over-the-counter topical treatment for mild to moderate forms of acne {{and the fact that}} the product has many celebrity spokespeople.

500|$|In July 1996, Radiohead started rehearsing and {{recording}} OK Computer in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, {{but at the same time}} we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record... It's <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E

5000|$|Shortly after Millers {{article was}} published, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, and Donald Rumsfeld {{appeared}} {{on television and}} pointed to Millers story in support of their position. As summarized by the New York Review of Books, [...] "in the following months, the tubes would become a key prop in the administration’s case for war, and the Times played a critical part in legitimizing it." [...] Miller later said of the controversy <b>My</b> <b>job</b> isnt <b>to</b> assess the governments information and be an independent intelligence analyst myself. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> is <b>to</b> tell readers of The New York Times what the government thought about Iraqs arsenal.|$|R

[...] BLM Director Neil Kornze said that [...] "Based on information about conditions on the ground, and in consultation with law enforcement, we have made a decision to conclude the cattle gather because of our serious concern about the safety of employees and members of the public." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ghomeshi {{was charged}} by police on {{multiple}} counts {{of sexual assault}} but {{was found not guilty}} of all but one of these in March 2016. He was to be tried in June on the last remaining charge, relating to a complainant who had also worked at CBC; her name was later revealed to be Kathryn Borel. On May 11, 2016 however, the Crown withdrew the charge after Ghomeshi signed a peace bond (which does not include an admission of guilt) and apologized to Borel. Borel was critical of the CBC for its handling of her initial complaint about Ghomeshi's behavior. [...] "When I went to the CBC for help, what I received in return was a directive that, yes, he could do this and, yes, it was <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> let him," [...] she told the assembled media representatives.|$|E
2500|$|Blethyn's last film of 1998 was Little Voice {{opposite}} Jane Horrocks and Michael Caine. Cast against type, {{she played}} a domineering yet needy fish factory worker who has nothing but contempt for her shy daughter and lusts after a local showbiz agent. A breakaway from the kind at heart roles Blethyn had previously played, it was the character's antipathy that attracted the actress to accept the role of Mari: [...] "I have to understand why she is the way she is. She is a desperate woman, but she also has an optimistic take on life which I find enviable. Whilst I don't approve of her behaviour, {{there is a reason}} for it and it was <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> work that out." [...] Both Blethyn's performance and the film received rave reviews, and the following year, she was again Oscar nominated, this time for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx in 1954 and from Fordham University in the Bronx with a bachelor's degree in Communication Arts in 1958, DeLillo {{took a job}} in {{advertising}} because he couldn't get one in publishing. He worked for five years as a copywriter at the agency of Ogilvy & Mather on Fifth Avenue at East 48th Street, writing image ads for Sears Roebuck among others, working on [...] "Print ads, very undistinguished accounts....I hadn’t made the leap to television.

[...] DeLillo published his first short story in 1960—"The River Jordan", in Epoch, the literary magazine of Cornell University—and began {{to work on his}} first novel in 1966. Discussing the beginning of his writing career, DeLillo said, [...] "I did some short stories at that time, but very infrequently. I quit my job just to quit.
