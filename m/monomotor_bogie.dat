50|$|A <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogie</b> (bogie monomoteur) {{is a form}} of {{traction}} bogie {{used for}} an electric locomotive or diesel-electric locomotive. It is distinguished by having a single traction motor on each bogie.|$|E
50|$|The coupled wheels, {{rather than}} {{individual}} traction motors, encouraged resistance to wheelslip. This advantage was recognised and influenced future French designs, {{such as the}} typically French <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogie</b> rather than the axle-hung traction motors used elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Each {{locomotive}} had one SACM 16 cylinder four-stroke {{diesel engine}} of 3,550 horsepower (2,650 KW) driving an alternator whose output was rectified by silicon rectifiers. There were two traction motors, each {{mounted on a}} 3-axle <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogie</b> with two-speed gearing.|$|E
50|$|Traction motors: AEC/Alstom/Siemens MG1420. Two motors (<b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies),</b> force-ventilated, fully suspended.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Monomotor</b> <b>bogies</b> {{are widely}} used in France, for designs by Alstom.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: SNCF Class BB 25500 {{electric}} locomotive at Strasbourg. This locomotive has <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies</b> and two-speed gearing ...|$|R
50|$|This was an {{innovative}} design {{in which two}} diesel engines drove a common alternator sited between them. There was no stator but two rotors spinning in opposite directions. Each diesel engine ran at 1,500 rpm so the effective rotational speed of the alternator was 3,000 rpm. There were two traction motors, each mounted on a 3-axle <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogie.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{arrangement}} {{has been}} used for electric locos with three <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies,</b> such as the Italian FS Class E.632 of 1982.|$|R
5000|$|WAG 3: Out of service. <b>Monomotor</b> <b>bogies.</b> Max speed 80 km/h. 10 Built in 1965[...] 30,000 kgf of {{tractive}} effort. Above 6,000 tons hauling capacity up to 70 km/h {{on level}} track ...|$|R
5000|$|Brake {{equipment}} {{consists of}} pneumatic, electro-pneumatic, regenerative and dynamic brakes. The <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies</b> {{were derived from}} the Y217 bogies of BB67400 locomotives and have primary (coil springs) and secondary ("sandwich" [...] blocs) suspension.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{locomotives}} with <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies</b> {{are sometimes}} fitted with two-speed gearing. This allows higher tractive effort for hauling freight trains but at reduced speed. Examples include the SNCF classes BB 8500 and BB 25500.|$|R
50|$|The Class 1700 {{are similar}} {{but not entirely}} equal to the Class 1600/1800. The newer 1700 series have updated and {{extended}} electronics, a newer safety system (ATB phase 4 vs ATB phase 3 in the 1600 series) and a different braking system. The locomotives are fitted with <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} had 3-axle <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies</b> {{with each}} set of 3 axles coupled by gears. Speed regulation was by rheostats and series-parallel control. The motors had double armatures so there were four [...] "demi-motors" [...] which allowed three motor groupings: full series, series-parallel and full parallel. The power controller had 28 steps.|$|R
50|$|SNCF's BB 25500 {{class are}} part of a series of {{electric}} locomotives built by Alstom. They are the dual system version of the BB 17000 (AC) and BB 8500 (DC) locomotives (17000+8500=25500). They are fitted with <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies</b> with two different gear ratios. This allows them to have either increased tractive effort for freight, or a higher top speed. This makes them suitable for both freight and passenger trains.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} are {{fitted with}} <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies</b> with two different gear ratios. This {{allows them to}} increase their tractive effort {{in exchange for a}} reduction in their top speed. This makes them suitable for both freight and passenger trains. They acquired the nickname Danseuses (dancers) due to their tendency to sway from side to side at speed, which led to them being blacked at a number of depots.|$|R
5000|$|Differently {{from many}} of the {{previous}} FS classes, the E.632/633 carbody is not articulated. The power plant is made of three [...] FS T850 DC motors, mounted on <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies,</b> each with two axles. Each motor is provided with a three-frequency chopper which takes place of the resistor network used on older Italian locomotives (rheostat). This allow the motors to run for an indefinite period of time without risks.|$|R
50|$|The WAM1 {{locomotives}} were {{supplied by}} Mitsubishi in 1964-66 (four in 1964, 14 in 1965 {{and two in}} 1966). They were jointly built by Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Hitachi, as shown by their builders' plates. They are of the B-B configuration, with two <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies,</b> each with one bogie-mounted DC traction motor; the two traction motors were permanently coupled in parallel. They had an Oerlikon compressor and exhauster for the locomotive's air brakes and the train's vacuum brakes, and Arno rotatory converters. They were equipped with two Faively AM-12 pantographs.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies,</b> each {{powered by a}} {{longitudinally}} suspended motor driving both axles. The power supply is 750 volts DC from overhead lines using a pantograph (the Brecknell Willis High Reach pantograph). Speed is controlled from the cab by a joystick controller with a which must be continually held in place to keep the track brakes off. No other vigilance control is fitted, because of the perceived safety {{of a system of}} street-running trams. Drivers are seated on sprung seats for comfort and a PA system allows them to communicate with passengers.|$|R
50|$|Type 126 was {{the result}} of an order from SNCB to BN in 1964 for 5 {{prototype}} electric locomotives that would be more powerful than all previous types. Additional weight was designed in at the start to increase tractive effort as with Type 123. Although Type 126 certainly looks Belgian with a strong resemblance to Type 150/Class 15, it is in fact an SNCF Class BB 9400 under the skin. The main internal difference between the two was BB 9400 ran on 1500 volts DC and Type 126 ran on 3000 volts DC. Most electrical components either came directly from France or were license-built in Belgium. These locos also had wheelslip detection. When the production series of locomotives were ordered they incorporated what SNCB had learned from the 5 prototypes. The five prototypes were rebuilt in 1976-1977 to bring them up to standard with the production batch, which had a number of small improvements. Unusually for SNCB, the French heritage of these locomotives got them classified as B-B rather than Bo-Bo, being fitted with license-built Schneider <b>monomotor</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
