5000|$|By {{speeding}} up Morse code using analog tape or digital modes such as JT6M or FSK441, very short high-speed bursts of digital {{data can be}} bounced off the ionized gas trail of meteor showers. The speed required to confirm a two way contact via a short lived ionized <b>meteor</b> <b>trail</b> can only be performed by fast computers on both ends with very little human interaction. One computer will send a request for contact and if successfully received by a distant station, a reply will be sent by the receiving stations computer usually via the same ionized <b>meteor</b> <b>trail</b> to confirm the contact. If nothing is received after the request, a new request is transmitted. This continues until a reply is received to confirm the contact or until no contact can be made and no new requests are sent. Using this high speed digital mode, a full two way contact, can be completed in one second or less and can only be validated using a computer.

40|$|Abstract. The {{temporal}} and height statistics of the occur-rence of <b>meteor</b> <b>trails</b> during the Leonid meteor shower re-vealed {{the capability of}} the Indian MST radar to record large numbers of <b>meteor</b> <b>trails.</b> The distribution of radio <b>meteor</b> <b>trails</b> due to a Leonid meteor shower {{in space and time}} pro-vided a unique opportunity to construct the height profiles of lower thermospheric temperatures and winds, with good time and height resolution. There was a four-fold increase in the <b>meteor</b> <b>trails</b> observed during the LMS compared to a typical non-shower day. The temperatures were found to be in excellent continuity with the temperature profiles below the radio meteor region derived from the co-located Nd-Yag LIDAR and the maximum height of the temperature profile was extended from the LIDAR to ∼ 110 km. There are, how-ever, some significant differences between the observed pro-files and the CIRA- 86 model profiles.

50|$|Small, sand-grain sized meteoroids are {{entering}} the atmosphere constantly, essentially every few seconds in any given region of the atmosphere, and thus ionization trails {{can be found in}} the upper atmosphere more or less continuously. When radio waves are bounced off these trails, it is called meteor burst communications. Meteor radars can measure atmospheric density and winds by measuring the decay rate and Doppler shift of a <b>meteor</b> <b>trail.</b> Most meteoroids burn up when they enter the atmosphere. The left-over debris is called meteoric dust or just meteor dust. Meteor dust particles can persist in the atmosphere for up to several months. These particles might affect climate, both by scattering electromagnetic radiation and by catalyzing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere. Meteoroids or their fragments may achieve dark flight after deceleration to terminal velocity. Dark flight starts when they decelerate to about 2 - 4 km/s mph.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} are investigated of {{the lower}} thermosphere through comparison of optical observations of motions of ejected vapor trails with radar observations of motions of ionized <b>meteor</b> <b>trails.</b> In particular, the winds obtained {{from a series of}} vapor trail observations which occurred at Wallops Island, Virginia during the night of 14 - 15 December 1970 are to be compared with wind data deduced from radar observations of <b>meteor</b> <b>trails</b> during the same period.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{details of}} new techniques in specular meteor radar data acquisition, modeling and determining the fundamental specular meteor radar echo signal parameters. One goal of Multistatic Meteor Wind Radar (MMWR) is increasing the {{spatial and temporal}} resolution of the upper-atmospheric windfield estimate by distributing a network of synchronized interferometers over large spatial regions {{on the order of}} 100 ’s of [km]. Modern theories of <b>meteor</b> <b>trail</b> diffusion are placed in the context of modeling the ground illumination pattern created when an arbitrarily placed <b>meteor</b> <b>trail</b> scatters VHF radio waves originating from an arbitrarily located transmitter. The ground illumination pattern shows how <b>meteor</b> <b>trail</b> scatter can be observed by receivers located over large spatial regions on Earth’s surface. MMWR is enabled with the Colorado Software Radar (CoSRad), a software-defined radar remote sensing transceiver system developed at the University of Colorado’s ARSENL laboratory. Various specular <b>meteor</b> <b>trail</b> echoes observed using CoSRad configured to drive existing radars highlight CoSRad’s potential for reconfigurability. A set of long-baseline multistatic observations taken using a prototype system deployment in Australia demonstrates the MMWR measurement principle and the ground illumination pattern model. Unexpected issues encountered when processing the prototype MMWR data using traditional interferometry methods motivated {{the development of a new}} technique to solve the parameter estimation problem of specular meteor radar interferometry on the complex plane. One benefit of the complex plane interferometry solution technique is the formation of a parameter covariance matrix, representing the precision of the measured trail location, Doppler and diffusion signal parameters. The determination of fundamental measurement parameter precision is important, as it lays the groundwork for calculating the precision of the derived multistatic windfield. This dissertation presents modern techniques in modeling and observing specular scatter from meteor trails and estimating the fundamental signal parameters of spatial location, Doppler frequency and diffusion coefficient from the specular radar echoes...|$|E

30|$|Most {{interferometric}} meteors {{working at}} HF, MF and lower VHF frequencies (the most common frequencies for {{these types of}} radars) rely on so-called specular reflections from the <b>meteor</b> <b>trail.</b> For monostatic systems, {{this means that the}} trail must be orientated perpendicularly to the vector from the radar to the midpoint of the trail, so that the signal reflects back as if being bounced off a mirror. For bistatic systems, in which the transmitter and the receiver are not co-located, the angle of incidence of the wave from the transmitter relative to the <b>meteor</b> <b>trail</b> must equal the angle of reflection of the wave back towards the receiver location. We will develop our theory using the bistatic case: the monostatic case is simply a limiting case of the bistatic case, where the transmitter and receiver become coincident.|$|E

Because the <b>meteor</b> <b>trail</b> is discrete, it is possible to essentially deconvolve the pulse received at the receiver and determine the true trail range to better accuracy than the theory suggests, i.e. the position of the peak as a function of “range” will be a good representation of the true position. This could help reduce the height uncertainty but will, however, require that the signal is digitized at higher resolution than 2  km. However, at distances more than 100  km to the left or right of the receiver, the dominant cause of worsening resolution is the angular effect ("Angular vertical resolution" [...] section), so the corrections for range achieved by deconvoution offer only limited opportunity for improvement.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFading {{times of}} radar echoes from underdense meteor trails {{in the upper}} mesosphere/lower {{thermosphere}} are commonly used to determine ambipolar diffusivities and hence ambient temperature.

More than 3 thousand range-spread <b>meteor</b> <b>trail</b> echoes (RSTEs) were observed. Among the trail echoes, the spatial structure of <b>meteor</b> <b>trail</b> irregularities {{responsible for a}} single long-duration RSTE event persisting for ~ 4 [*]min was reconstructed. This RSTE {{was found to be}} initially generated at 90 – 115 [*]km altitudes and aligned along the radar beam boresight. After about the first minute of the trail lifetime, the trail echo appeared only in a narrow altitude range of 94 – 98 [*]km. An analysis on the spatial pattern of the long-duration RSTE showed that the trail irregularities at lower range gates moved away from the region perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. The eastward drifts of the RSTE irregularities were found to decrease with increasing altitude, e. g., from 80 [*]ms− 1 at ~ 94 [*]km to 20 [*]ms− 1 at ~ 100 [*]km. Simultaneous horizontal neutral wind measurements made with the Fuke all-sky meteor radar (located north of Sanya) recorded a similar velocity profile.
