40|$|AbstractTaking {{into account}} the {{influences}} of scatterer geometrical shapes on induced currents, an algorithm, termed the sparse-matrix method (SMM), is proposed to calculate radar cross section (RCS) of aircraft configuration. Based on the geometrical characteristics and the method of moment (MOM), the SMM {{points out that the}} strong current coupling zone could be predefined according to the shape of scatterers. Two geometrical parameters, the surface curvature and the <b>electrical</b> <b>space</b> between the field position and source position, are deducted to distinguish the dominant current coupling. Then the strong current coupling is computed to construct an impedance matrix having sparse nature, which is solved to compute RCS. The efficiency and feasibility of the SMM are demonstrated by computing elec-tromagnetic scattering of some kinds of shapes such as a cone-sphere with a gap, a bi-arc column and a stealth aircraft configuration. The numerical results show that: (1) the accuracy of SMM is satisfied, as compared with MOM, and the computational time it spends is only about 8 % of the MOM; (2) with the <b>electrical</b> <b>space</b> considered, making another allowance for the surface curvature can reduce the computation time by 9. 5 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{framework}} for optimum signal shaping in multi-carrier modulation is presented for optical wireless communications (OWC). The two fundamental multi-carrier transmission schemes based on orthogonal frequency divi-sion multiplexing (OFDM), direct-current-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM), are studied. The optimum signal shaping is defined as optimum biasing and optimum scaling of the time domain signal within the optical power constraints of the transmitter front-end. These include {{the boundaries of the}} limited linear dynamic range, such as minimum and maximum radiated optical power, and the desired average optical power level. As a result, the <b>minimum</b> required <b>electrical</b> signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to maintain a target bit-error ratio (BER) is obtained for a desired multi-level quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) scheme and a given combination of optical power constraints. The average optical power is varied over dynamic ranges of 10 dB, 20 dB and 30 dB. With the increase of the dynamic range and for a major portion of the average optical power levels, DCO-OFDM demonstrates a lower <b>minimum</b> <b>electrical</b> SNR requirement for a target BER as compared to ACO-OFDM for modulation orders with similar spectral efficiencies.
