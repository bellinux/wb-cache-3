6000|$|Another {{species of}} <b>Madrepore</b> (11) was {{discovered}} on our Devon coast by Mr. Gosse, more gaudy, though not so delicate in hue as our Caryophyllia. Mr. Gosse's locality, {{for this and}} numberless other curiosities, is Ilfracombe, on the north coast of Devon. My specimens came from Lundy Island, {{in the mouth of}} the Bristol Channel, or more properly from that curious [...] "Rat Island" [...] to the south of it, where still lingers the black long-tailed English rat, exterminated everywhere else by his sturdier brown cousin of the Hanoverian dynasty.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Gosse next {{tried the}} fairy of the walking {{mouth with a}} house- fly, who escaped only by hard fighting; and at last the gentle creature, after {{swallowing}} and disgorging various large pieces of shell-fish, found viands to its taste in [...] "the lean of cooked meat and portions of earthworms," [...] filling up the intervals by a perpetual dessert of microscopic animalcules, whirled into that lovely avernus, its mouth, by the currents of the delicate ciliae which clothe every tentacle. The fact is, that the <b>Madrepore,</b> like those glorious sea-anemones whose living flowers stud every pool, is by profession a scavenger and a feeder on carrion; and being as useful as he is beautiful, really comes under the rule which he seems at first to break, that handsome is who handsome does.|$|E

60|$|But I wish Tom {{had given}} up all his naughty tricks, and left off tormenting dumb animals {{now that he had}} plenty of playfellows to amuse him. Instead of that, I am sorry to say, he would meddle with the creatures, all but the water-snakes, for they would stand no nonsense. So he tickled the <b>madrepores,</b> to make them shut up; and frightened the crabs, to make them hide in the sand and peep out at him with the tips of their eyes; and put stones into the anemones' mouths, to make them fancy that their dinner was coming.|$|R

"It was {{a garden}} still beyond all price, Even {{yet it was}} a place of paradise; And here were coral bowers, And grots of <b>madrepores,</b> And banks of sponge, as soft and fair to eye As e'er was mossy bed Whereon the wood-nymphs lie With languid limbs in summer's sultry hours. Here, too, were living flowers, Which, like a bud compacted, Their purple cups contracted; And now in open blossom spread, Stretch'd, like green anthers, many a seeking head. And arborets of jointed stone were there, And plants of fibres fine as silkworm's thread; Yea, {{beautiful}} as mermaid's golden hair Upon the waves dispread.

60|$|Now when Tom got there, {{he found}} that the isle stood all on pillars, and that its roots were full of caves. There were pillars of black basalt, like Staffa; and pillars of green and crimson serpentine, like Kynance; and pillars ribboned with red and white and yellow sandstone, like Livermead; and there were blue grottoes like Capri, and white grottoes like Adelsberg; all curtained and draped with seaweeds, purple and crimson, green and brown; and strewn with soft white sand, on which the water-babies sleep every night. But, to keep the place clean and sweet, the crabs picked up all the scraps off the floor and ate them like so many monkeys; while the rocks were covered with ten {{thousand}} sea-anemones, and corals and <b>madrepores,</b> who scavenged the water all day long, and kept it nice and pure. But, to make up to them for having to do such nasty work, they were not left black and dirty, as poor chimney-sweeps and dustmen are. No; the fairies are more considerate and just than that, and have dressed them all in the most beautiful colours and patterns, till they look like vast flower-beds of gay blossoms. If you think I am talking nonsense, I can only say that it is true; and that an old gentleman named Fourier used to say that we ought to do the same by chimney-sweeps and dustmen, and honour them instead of despising them; and he was a very clever old gentleman: but, unfortunately for him and the world, as mad as a March hare.|$|R
6000|$|THE {{connection}} between Brainstones, Mushroom Corals, and other <b>Madrepores</b> abounding on Polynesian reefs, and the [...] "Sea Anemones," [...] which have lately become so {{familiar to us}} all, {{can be seen by}} comparing our comparatively insignificant C. Smithii with our commonest species of Actinia and Sagartia. The former is a beautiful object when the fleshy part and tentacles are wholly or partially expanded. Like Actinia, it has a membranous covering, a simple sac-like stomach, a central mouth, a disk surrounded by contractile and adhesive tentacles. Unlike Actinia, it is fixed to submarine bodies, to which it is glued in very early life, and cannot change its place. Unlike Actinia, its body is supported by a stony skeleton of calcareous plates arranged edgewise so as to radiate from the centre. But as we find some Molluscs furnished with a shell, and others even of the same character and habits without one, so we find that in spite of this seemingly important difference, the animals are very similar in their nature. Since the introduction of glass tanks we have opportunities of seeing anemones crawling up the sides, so as to exhibit their entire basal disk, and then we may observe lightly coloured lines of a less transparent substance than the interstices, radiating from the margin to the centre, some short, others reaching the entire distance, and arranged in exactly the same manner as the plates of Caryophyllaea. These are doubtless flexible walls of compartments dividing the fleshy parts of the softer animals, and corresponding with the septa of the coral. Fig. 2 A represents a section of the latter, to be compared with the basal disk of Sagartia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Doubtless you are {{familiar}} with the stony skeleton of our <b>Madrepore,</b> as it appears in museums. It consists of a number of thin calcareous plates standing up edgewise, and arranged in a radiating manner round a low centre. A little below the margin their individuality is lost in the deposition of rough calcareous matter. [...] . The general form is more or less cylindrical, commonly wider at top than just above the bottom. [...] . This is but the skeleton; and though it is a very pretty object, those who are acquainted with it alone, can form but a very poor idea of the beauty of the living animal. [...] . Let it, after being torn from the rock, recover its equanimity; then you will see a pellucid gelatinous flesh emerging from between the plates, and little exquisitely formed and coloured tentacula, with white clubbed tips fringing the sides of the cup-shaped cavity in the centre, across which stretches the oval disc marked with a star of some rich and brilliant colour, surrounding the central mouth, a slit with white crenated lips, like the orifice of one of those elegant cowry shells which we put upon our mantelpieces. The mouth is always more or less prominent, and can be protruded and expanded to an astonishing extent. The space surrounding the lips is commonly fawn colour, or rich chestnut-brown; the star or vandyked circle rich red, pale vermilion, and sometimes the most brilliant emerald green, as brilliant as the gorget of a humming-bird." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet, in that sketch, {{rude and}} ludicrous as it is, {{you have the}} {{elements}} of life in their first form. The people who could do that were sure to get on. For, observe, the workman's whole aim is straight at the facts, {{as well as he}} can get them; and not merely at the facts, but {{at the very heart of}} the facts. A common workman might have looked at nature for his serpent, but he would have thought only of its scales. But this fellow does not want scales, nor coils; he can do without them; he wants the serpent's heart--malice and insinuation;--and he has actually got them to some extent. So also a common workman, even in this barbarous stage of art, might have carved Eve's arms and body a good deal better; but this man does not care about arms and body, if he can only get at Eve's mind--show that she is pleased at being flattered, and yet in a state of uncomfortable hesitation. And some look of listening, of complacency, and of embarrassment he has verily got:-- note the eyes slightly askance, the lips compressed, and the right hand nervously grasping the left arm: nothing can be declared impossible to the people who could begin thus--the world is open to them, and all that is in it; while, on the contrary, nothing is possible to the man who did the symmetrical angel--the world is keyless to him; he has built a cell for himself in which he must abide, barred up for ever-- there is no more hope for him than for a sponge or a <b>madrepore.</b>|$|E

6000|$|The lagoon in Keeling atoll is shallow; in the atolls of the Low Archipelago {{the depth}} varies from 20 to 38 fathoms, {{and in the}} Marshall Group, {{according}} to Chamisso, from 30 to 35; in the Caroline atolls {{it is only a}} little less. Within the Maldiva atolls there are large spaces with 45 fathoms, and some soundings are laid down of 49 fathoms. The greater part of the bottom in most lagoons, is formed of sediment; large spaces have exactly the same depth, or the depth varies so insensibly, that it is evident that no other means, excepting aqueous deposition, could have leveled the surface so equally. In the Maldiva atolls this is very conspicuous, and likewise in some of the Caroline and Marshall Islands. In the former large spaces consist of sand and SOFT CLAY; and Kotzebue speaks of clay having been found within one of the Marshall atolls. No doubt this clay is calcareous mud, similar to that at Keeling Island, and to that at Bermuda already referred to, as undistinguishable from disintegrated chalk, and which Lieutenant Nelson says is called there pipe-clay. (I may here observe that on the coast of Brazil, where there is much coral, the soundings near the land are described by Admiral Roussin, in the [...] "Pilote du Bresil", as siliceous sand, mingled with much finely comminuted particles of shells and coral.

40|$|In Switzerland, asphalt {{deposits}} and occurrences are prominent at the foothills {{and around the}} first synclines of the Jura Mountains in the cantons of Neuchâtel and Vaud. They are all {{closely associated with the}} Cretaceous, Hauterivian and Barremian, limestone formations. During most of the Hauterivian and Barremian, an important carbonate platform developed on the northern, passive margin of Tethys. This paper aims at providing a coherent lithostratigraphic and sedimentological framework (part I) enabling the study and elucidation of the origin of the {{asphalt deposits}} (part II). The lithostratigraphic framework study, based on a sequential analysis of the series, resulted in the revision of the classical formations defined in the region. A coherent subdivision for the region of the Jura of Neuchâtel and Northern Vaud is proposed. Two formations persist over the whole series, the "Pierre jaune de Neuchâtel", overlain by the "Calcaires urgoniens du Jura". Each formation representing a second order sequence separated by a major discontinuity, the "Discontinuité de La Russille". The sedimentological study further demonstrates the existence of three distinct carbonate depositional facies over the time period covering the two formations. Sandy oolithic and oo-bioclastic shoals, capped by the “Discontinuité De La Russille”, dominate the “Pierre jaune De Neuchâtel” paleogeography. Following the major discontinuity expressed by hard grounds, sedimentation resumed, with a calm transgressional facies constituted mainly of biostrome with large <b>madrepores.</b> This facies gradually morphs into a more typical urgonian facies: lagoon type deposits with rudists as well as white sandy bio-pelclastic shoal deposits. Both facies are part of the "Calcaires urgoniens du Jura" formation. The clastic facies from both formations offer good reservoir characteristic especially since they have for the most part undergone an early vadose diagenesis enhancing the primary porosity. The reservoir of the main and by far the largest asphalt deposit at La Presta (Val-de- Travers) is located in the "Calcaires urgoniens du Jura" formation. The detailed quantitative three dimensional structural and sedimentological study carried out at the asphalt mine of La Presta allows us to furthermore propose a multi-migration genetic model for the asphalt deposits. Hydrocarbon molecules expelled from the source rock by primary migration moved by secondary migration into stratigraphic and diagenetic traps formed by bio-pelclastic shoal deposits encased by pure biomicrite acting as seals, where they accumulated as oil. A tertiary migration took place during the folding of the Jura Mountains in the Tertiary, also bringing the oil-bearing reservoirs closer to surface, causing severe biodegradation of the oils into asphalts. Based on our observations at La Presta, we are now in the position to better understand the distribution of the asphalt deposits in general, controlled by the paleogeographic evolution of the Cretaceous carbonate platform and the resulting re-migration post dating the Tertiary folding of the Jura Mountains...|$|R
6000|$|But we {{have not}} landed yet on the dry part of the reef. Let us make for it, taking care {{meanwhile}} {{that we do not}} get our feet cut by the coral, or stung as by nettles by the coral insects. We shall see that the dry land is made up entirely of coral, ground and broken by the waves, and hurled inland by the storm, sometimes in huge boulders, mostly as fine mud; and that, {{under the influence of the}} sun and of the rain, which filters through it, charged with lime from the rotting coral, the whole is setting, as cement sets, into rock. [...] And what is this? A long bank of stone standing up as a low cliff, ten or twelve feet above high-water mark. It is full of fragments of shell, of fragments of coral, of all sorts of animal remains; and the lower part of it is quite hard rock. Moreover, it is bedded in regular layers, just such as you see in a quarry. But how did it get there? It must have been formed at the sea-level, some of it, indeed, under the sea; for here are great masses of <b>madrepore</b> and limestone corals imbedded just as they grew. What lifted it up? [...] Your companions, if you have any who know the island, have no difficulty in telling you. It was hove up, they say, in the earthquake in such and such a year; and they will tell you, perhaps, that if you will go on shore to the main island which rises inside the reef, you may see dead coral beds just like these lying on the old rocks, and sloping up along the flanks of the mountains to several hundred feet above the sea. I have seen such many a time.|$|E
6000|$|Next, {{what are}} those bright little buds, like salmon-coloured Banksia roses half expanded, sitting closely on the stone? Touch them; the soft part is retracted, and the orange flower of flesh is {{transformed}} into a pale pink flower of stone. That is the <b>Madrepore,</b> Caryophyllia Smithii (Plate V. fig. 2); one of our south coast rarities: and see, on the lip of the last one, which we have carefully scooped off with the chisel, two little pink towers of stone, delicately striated; drop them into this small bottle of sea-water, and from the top of each tower issues every half-second - what shall we call it? - a hand or a net of finest hairs, clutching at something invisible to our grosser sense. That is the Pyrgoma, parasitic only (as far as we know) on the lip of this same rare Madrepore; a little [...] "cirrhipod," [...] the cousin of those tiny barnacles which roughen every rock (a larger sort whereof I showed you on the Turritella), and of those larger ones also who burrow in the thick hide of the whale, and, borne about upon his mighty sides, throw out their tiny casting nets, as this Pyrgoma does, to catch every passing animalcule, and sweep them into the jaws concealed within its shell. And this creature, rooted to one spot through life and death, was in its infancy a free swimming animal, hovering from place to place upon delicate ciliae, till, having sown its wild oats, it settled down in life, built itself a good stone house, and became a landowner, or rather a glebae adscriptus, for ever and a day. Mysterious destiny! - yet not so mysterious as that of the free medusoid young of every polype and coral, which ends as a rooted tree of horn or stone, and seems to the eye of sensuous fancy to have literally degenerated into a vegetable. Of them you must read for yourself in Mr. Gosse's book; in the meanwhile he shall tell you something of the beautiful Madrepores themselves. His description, (10) by far the best yet published, should be read in full; we must content ourselves with extracts.|$|E
60|$|In {{the case}} of the white coral, the {{skeleton}} is more complete. In the red coral, the skeleton belongs to the whole; in the white coral there is a special skeleton for every one of these polypes in addition to that for the whole body. There is a skeleton formed in the body of each of them, like a cup divided by a number of radiating partitions towards the outside; and that cup is formed of carbonate of lime, only not stained red, as in {{the case of}} the red coral. And all these cups are joined together into a common branch, the result of which is the formation of a beautiful coral tree. This is a great mass of <b>madrepore,</b> and in the living state every one of the ends of these branches was terminated by a beautiful little polype, like a sea anemone, and all the skeleton was covered by a soft body which united the polypes together. You must understand that all this skeleton has been formed in the interior of the body, to suit the branched body of the polype mass, and that it is as much its skeleton as our own bones are our skeleton. In this next coral the creature which has formed the skeleton has divided itself as it grew, and consequently has formed a great expansion; but scattered all over this surface there were polype bodies like those I previously described. Again, when this great cup was alive, the whole surface was covered with a beautiful body upon which were set innumerable small polype flowers, if we may so call them, often brilliantly coloured; and the whole cup was built up in the same fashion by the deposit of carbonate of lime in the interior of the combined polype body, formed by budding and by fission in the way I described. You will perceive that there is no necessary limit to this process. There is no reason why we should not have coral three or four times as big; and there are certain creatures of this kind that do fabricate very large masses, or half spheres several feet in diameter. Thus the activity of these animals in separating carbonate of lime from the sea and building it up into definite shapes is very considerable indeed.|$|E
6000|$|Round Water-island we went, into {{a narrow}} channel between steep green hills, covered to their tops, as late as 1845, with sugar- cane, but now only with scrub, among which the ruins of mills and {{buildings}} stood sad and lonely. But Nature in this land of perpetual summer hides {{with a kind of}} eagerness every scar which man in his clumsiness leaves on the earth's surface; and all, though relapsing into primeval wildness, was green, soft, luxuriant, as if the hoe had never torn the ground, contrasting strangely with the water-scene; with the black steamers snorting in their sleep; the wrecks and condemned hulks, in process of breaking up, strewing the shores with their timbers; the boatfuls of Negroes gliding to and fro; and all the signs of our hasty, irreverent, wasteful, semi- barbarous mercantile system, which we call (for the time being only, it is to be hoped) civilisation. The engine had hardly stopped, when we were boarded from a fleet of negro boats, and huge bunches of plantains, yams, green oranges, junks of sugar-cane, were displayed upon the deck; and more than one of the ladies went through the ceremony of initiation into West Indian ways, which consisted in sucking sugar-cane, first pared for the sake of their teeth. The Negro's stronger incisors tear it without paring. Two amusing figures, meanwhile, had taken up their station close to the companion. Evidently privileged personages, they felt themselves on their own ground, and looked round patronisingly on the passengers, as ignorant foreigners who were too certain to be tempted by the treasures which they displayed to need any solicitations. One went by the name of Jamaica Joe, a Negro blacker than the night, in smart white coat and smart black trousers; a tall courtly gentleman, with the organ of self-interest, to judge from his physiognomy, very highly developed. But he was thrown into the shade by a stately brown lady, who was still very handsome--beautiful, if you will--and knew it, and had put on her gorgeous turban with grace, and plaited her short locks under it with care, and ignored the very existence of a mere Negro like Jamaica Joe, as she sat by her cigars, and slow-match, and eau-de-cologne at four times the right price, and mats, necklaces, bracelets, made of mimosa-seeds, white negro hats, nests of Curacoa baskets, and so forth. They drove a thriving trade among all newcomers: but were somewhat disgusted to find that we, though new to the West Indies, were by no means new to West Indian wares, and therefore not of the same mind as a gentleman and lady who came fresh from the town next day, with nearly a bushel of white branching <b>madrepores,</b> which they were going to carry as coals to Newcastle, six hundred miles down the islands. Poor Joe tried to sell us a nest of Curacoa baskets for seven shillings; retired after a firm refusal; came up again to R-----, after a couple of hours, and said, in a melancholy and reproachful voice, 'Da--- take dem for four shillings and sixpence. I give dem you.' ...|$|R
40|$|The alcyonarian fauna of the West Indies is {{prolific}} and conspicuous and {{has been}} known for many years, with the natural result that a great many more species have been described than actually exist. The deep-water fauna, which received little attention prior to the work of VERRILL, was thoroughly reviewed by DEICHMANN in 1936. The shallow-water and reef fauna {{was the subject of a}} series of extensive papers by KUKENTHAL and his collaborators, KUNZE, MOSER, RIESS, BIELSCHOWSKY, and TOEPLITZ, but this ambitious study appears to have been based upon inadequate collections and its usefulness is seriously limited by the number of synonyms and misidentifications that it contains. No comprehensive survey of the fauna exists, and there is no satisfactory guide for the identification of specimens. This paper, which was prepared at the request of Dr. P. WAGENAAR HUMMELINCK, Secretary of the Stichting ‘Natuurwetenschappelijke Studiekring voor Suriname en de Nederlandse Antillen’ (Foundation for Scientific Research in Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles), forms such a guide and at the same time reviews the fauna to the extent permitted by the collections in hand and the literature. With Dr. HUMMELINCK’S collection of West Indian octocorals serving as a nucleus, the pertinent material in the collections of the U. S. National Museum was critically revised and correlated with the literature in order to gain an accurate picture of the known fauna. As a result of this study, it was possible to recognize 75 species of alcyonarians belonging to the orders Telestacea, Alcyonacea, Gorgonacea, and Pennatulacea inhabiting the reefs and shallow waters of the warm western Atlantic. An additional 21 species from deeper water are also included for comparative purposes or because they inhabit the transitional zone just below the region of active reef growth. Seventeen species and a few growth forms are described as new to science. Each species is diagnosed and illustrated with drawings of the details of spiculation and, in the case of new or especially common species, photographs of the colonial form. Taxonomic keys with couplets illustrated for clarity are provided to facilitate the identification of specimens. The species described in this paper are arranged as indicated in the Table of Contents (p. 3 — 7). A total of 96 species are described from the region including the Bermudas, the southeastern coast of the United States, the Bahamas and Antilles, and the east coast of South America south to the reefs of Brazil. Of these, 52 species occur in the reef habitat proper or closely associated with it, and another 23 species occur in depths of 25 fathoms or less. The orders Telestacea, Alcyonacea, and Pennatulacea are togehter represented by only 13 species within the bathymetric limits set forth, the remaining 83 belonging to the order Gorgonacea. The littoral and reef-dwelling representatives of the last-named order belong for the most part to the two families Plexauridae and Gorgoniidae, which include 35 and 34 species respectively. When the shallow-water alcyonarian fauna is added to the deep-water fauna as reported by DEICHMANN, a total of 196 species is revealed for the area. This is a fauna of only modest proportions when compared with that of the East Indies, where some 445 species (exclusive of Pennatulacea) were obtained by the ‘Siboga’ Expedition, but nevertheless, the gorgonians are the dominant sessile animals on many of the reefs of Florida, the Bahamas, and the Antilles. This dense population consists chiefly of about a dozen species, all the others being rare or of local occurrence, so it appears that the reef fauna is rich in individuals but poor in species. The distribution of alcyonarians is influenced by a variety of factors, among them salinity, temperature, illumination, depth of water, and character of the bottom. It is not possible to single out any one factor as the most important, since they all interact closely, but there is no doubt that temperature is one of the most influential. Although temperature requirements and tolerations have not been determined experimentally for alcyonarians, they can reasonably be assumed to parallel more or less closely those of the principal reef-formers. It has been observed that formation of reefs does not take place in waters that drop below 68 °F. for any appreciable period during the winter. Since active growth of reefs occurs at Bermuda, the northernmost limit of the West Indian fauna, its annual minimum temperature of 66 °F, may be taken as the limit for reef formation in the West Indian area. Tropical alcyonarians occur up to this minimum isotherm of both coasts of Florida. Most alcyonarians are stenohaline and require salinities within the range found in the open sea. However, the occurrence of a few species, such as Leptogorgia setacea of the southeastern coast of the United States, in the brackish inshore waters of bays and river mouths indicates that a limited degree of euryhalinity does occur in the Octocorallia. A rough and solid bottom is apparently as necessary for the attachment of gorgonian planulae as it is for those of <b>madrepores,</b> and the importance of this requirement is clearly demonstrated on the west coast of Florida, where reef communities gain a foothold only on the scattered solid outcrops on an otherwise broad, sandy shelf. A few species of Gorgonacea are known to live unattached, the colonies apparently doing so in some cases because no suitable objects were available for attachment, in others because they were broken loose from their original solid support but continued to live in a prone position. Certain deep-water gorgonacean groups (families Chrysogorgiidae and Isididae) that inhabit areas with a scarcity of solid material are able to adapt the form of their holdfast to the conditions present at the time of metamorphosis, producing either a calcareous basal disk for attachment to shells and stones, or a branched, rootlike process for anchoring the colony firmly in a muddy bottom. The pennatulaceans, which are adapted for life on soft bottoms, require either sand or mud and therefore are not found closely associated with reef communities. The octocorals of the reefs are restricted bathymetrically to the upper 25 fathoms of water, perhaps because of their symbiotic zooxanthellae, which require sunlight for the process of photosynthesis, but the physiological relationships of zooxanthellae and their coelenterate hosts are in general less clearly understood in the octocorals than in the <b>madrepores,</b> so the cause of the bathymetricphotic correlation cannot be stated in general terms. Obviously, the vertical distribution of those octocorals that are dependent upon their zooxanthellae for nutrition is governed by the physiological requirements of the algae. In those octocorals that are nutritionally independent of their zooxanthellae (as appears to be generally the case among scleractinian corals) other ecological factors must limit bathymetric distribution. In the West Indies, almost all of the shallow-water octocorals, which represent 38 % of the total known fauna, belong to the two families Plexauridae and Gorgoniidae. Very few members of these families extend downward below 25 fathoms, and very few members of the deep-water families venture into water shallower than this. In the East Indies, where a rich tropical alcyonarian fauna exists, 59 % of the species taken by the ‘Siboga’-Expedition lived in depths shallower than 50 meters, but this fauna is inordinately rich in groups poorly represented in the West Indies, where 85 % of the species are gorgonaceans. In both regions, somewhat more than 40 % of the gorgonaceans occur in depths less than 50 meters. The alcyonarians are an important component of the reef community, perhaps more so in the West Indies than elsewhere in the tropics because of the great profusion of a few conspicuous forms in the reef habitat. They provide shelter and sustenance for a wide array of casual associates, epizoa, commensals, and parasites, ranging from other coelenterates to fishes. Moreover, when they die they liberate great quantities of calcareous spicules which are then available for incorporation into the general mass of the reef. The alcyonarian fauna of the warm parts of the western Atlantic shows a high degree of endemism and only indistinct subdivision into smaller faunal regions. It is possible to distinguish a Carolinian fauna occupying the southeastern coast of the United States, with part of its species occurring only along the Atlantic coast and part of them with isolated populations in the northern Gulf of Mexico. At least three species follow the continental coast more or less continuously from the Carolinas to Brazil. This is basically a continental fauna and its species do not range out into the West Indian islands. The fauna of the West Indies is essentially an insular fauna and it suffers depletion wherever it invades continental coasts. The largest number of reef dwelling species seems to occur in the northern islands of the Lesser Antilles, the Greater Antilles, and the Florida Keys. At the present time, more species are known from the last-named locality than from the islands of the Greater Antilles, but it has certainly been more thoroughly explored. Intensive collecting will probably reveal an even larger number of species in the northeastern part of the Antilles. Antillean species extend along both coasts of Florida northward to about the 66 °F. minimum surface isotherm, but their number is sharply diminished. A small group of the hardiest species reaches Bermuda, which is the northernmost outpost of the West Indian fauna. Records indicate that the Antillean fauna becomes attenuated also toward the southern islands of the Lesser Antilles, and the Leeward Group along the coast of South America has a fauna comparable in many respects with that of Bermuda. However, the fauna of Bermuda is restricted by the low temperature of the water during midwinter (66 °F), a limiting factor that does not exist at the low latitude of the Leeward Islands. The fauna must instead be restricted by other ecological factors, perhaps imposed by the proximity of the continental coast. The alcyonarian fauna of the reefs of Brazil, although composed largely of West Indian genera — Plexaurella, Muriceopsis, Lophogorgia — shares few species, perhaps no more than three or four, with the Antillean region to the north, and is probably the most distinct of the subregions of the western Atlantic. Within the broad limits of the warm western Atlantic fauna 1 region, extending from Bermuda south to Brazil, we can distinguish an insular Antillean fauna centered in the northeastern part of the Antilles; a continental Carolinian fauna along the southeastern Atlantic seabord, some of its species with disjunct populations in the Gulf of Mexico and some following virtually the entire coastline from the Carolinas to Brazil; and a Brazilian fauna extending northward along the South American coast as far as Trinidad. The presence in the West Indies of Alcyonarian genera known also in the tropical Indo-West Pacific can be explained only on the basis of former faunal continuity. The presence of a small amphi-American element clearly points to the existence of a continuous East Pacific-West Atlantic (or trans-American) fauna during the past, and the high level of endemism in the West Indian region suggests a subsequent rapid development of a new fauna from remnants of the old, left behind after closure of the Central American seaways. The distribution of modern alcyonarians corroborates the former existence of a great equatorial sea, the Tethys, that permitted circumtropical distribution of marine animals, which geology tells us existed during much of Earth’s history between the Cambrian and the Tertiary...|$|R
60|$|The woodcut {{shows the}} form of the bottom off the reef: the water deepens for a space between one and two hundred yards wide, very {{gradually}} to twenty-five fathoms (A in section), beyond which the sides plunge into the unfathomable ocean at an angle of 45 deg. (The soundings from which this section is laid down were taken with great care by Captain Fitzroy himself. He used a bell-shaped lead, having a diameter of four inches, and the armings each time were cut off and brought on board for me to examine. The arming is a preparation of tallow, placed in the concavity {{at the bottom of the}} lead. Sand, and even small fragments of rock, will adhere to it; and if the bottom be of rock it brings up an exact impression of its surface.) To the depth of ten or twelve fathoms the bottom is exceedingly rugged, and seems formed of great masses of living coral, similar to those on the margin. The arming of the lead here invariably came up quite clean, but deeply indented, and chains and anchors which were lowered, in the hopes of tearing up the coral, were broken. Many small fragments, however, of Millepora alcicornis were brought up; and on the arming from an eight-fathom cast, there was a perfect impression of an Astraea, apparently alive. I examined the rolled fragments cast on the beach during gales, in order further to ascertain what corals grew outside the reef. The fragments consisted of many kinds, of which the Porites already mentioned and a Madrepora, apparently the M. corymbosa, were the most abundant. As I searched in vain in the hollows on the reef and in the lagoon, for a living specimen of this <b>Madrepore,</b> I conclude that it is confined to a zone outside, and beneath the surface, where it must be very abundant. Fragments of the Millepora alcicornis and of an Astraea were also numerous; the former is found, but not in proportionate numbers, in the hollows on the reef; but the Astraea I did not see living. Hence we may infer, that these are the kinds of coral which form the rugged sloping surface (represented in the woodcut by an uneven line), round and beneath the external margin. Between twelve and twenty fathoms the arming came up an equal number of times smoothed with sand, and indented with coral: an anchor and lead were lost at the respective depths of thirteen and sixteen fathoms. Out of twenty-five soundings taken at a greater depth than twenty fathoms, every one showed that the bottom was covered with sand; whereas, at a less depth than twelve fathoms, every sounding showed that it was exceedingly rugged, and free from all extraneous particles. Two soundings were obtained at the depth of 360 fathoms, and several between two hundred and three hundred fathoms. The sand brought up from these depths consisted of finely triturated fragments of stony zoophytes, but not, as far as I could distinguish, of a particle of any lamelliform genus: fragments of shells were rare.|$|E
6000|$|This gentleman believes, that {{subsequently}} to the subsidence {{by which}} the atolls in the Low Archipelago were produced, the whole area has been elevated {{to the amount of}} a few feet; this would indeed be a remarkable fact; but as far as I am able to judge, the grounds of his conclusion are not sufficiently strong. He states that he found in almost every atoll which he visited, the shores of the lagoon raised from eighteen to thirty inches above the sea-level, and containing imbedded Tridacnae and corals standing as they grew; some of the corals were dead in their upper parts, but below a certain line they continued to flourish. In the lagoons, also, he frequently met with clusters of <b>Madrepore,</b> with their extremities standing from one inch to a foot above the surface of the water. Now, these appearances are exactly what I should have expected, without any subsequent elevation having taken place; and I think Mr. Couthouy has not borne in mind the indisputable fact, that corals, when constantly bathed by the surf, can exist at a higher level than in quite tranquil water, as in a lagoon. As long, therefore, as the waves continued at low water to break entirely over parts of the annular reef of an atoll, submerged to a small depth, the corals and shells attached on these parts might continue living at a level above the smooth surface of the lagoon, into which the waves rolled; {{but as soon as the}} outer edge of the reef grew up to its utmost possible height, or if the reef were very broad nearly to that height, the force of the breakers would be checked, and the corals and shells on the inner parts near the lagoon would occasionally be left dry, and thus be partially or wholly destroyed. Even in atolls, which have not lately subsided, if the outer margin of the reef continued to increase in breadth seaward (each fresh zone of corals rising to the same vertical height as at Keeling atoll), the line where the waves broke most heavily would advance outwards, and therefore the corals, which when living near the margin, were washed by the breaking waves during the whole of each tide, would cease being so, and would therefore be left on the backward part of the reef standing exposed and dead. The case of the madrepores in the lagoons with the tops of their branches exposed, seems to be an analogous fact, to the great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon of Keeling atoll; a condition of things which I have endeavoured to show, has resulted from the lagoon having become more and more enclosed and choked up with reefs, so that during high winds, the rising of the tide (as observed by the inhabitants) is checked, and the corals, which had formerly grown to the greatest possible height, are occasionally exposed, and thus are killed: and this is a condition of things, towards which almost every atoll in the intervals of its subsidence must be tending. Or if we look to the state of an atoll directly after a subsidence of some fathoms, the waves would roll heavily over the entire circumference of the reef, and the surface of the lagoon would, like the ocean, never be quite at rest, and therefore the corals in the lagoon, from being constantly laved by the rippling water, might extend their branches to a little greater height than they could, when the lagoon became enclosed and protected. Christmas atoll (2 deg N. latitude) which has a very shallow lagoon, and differs in several respects from most atolls, possibly may have been elevated recently; but its highest part appears (Couthouy, page 46) to be only ten feet above the sea-level. The facts of a second class, adduced by Mr. Couthouy, in support of the alleged recent elevation of the Low Archipelago, are not all (especially those referring to a shelf of rock) quite intelligible to me; he believes that certain enormous fragments of rock on the reef, must have been moved into their present position, when the reef was at a lower level; but here again the force of the breakers on any inner point of the reef being diminished by its outward growth without any change in its level, has not, I think, been borne in mind. We should, also, not overlook the occasional agency of waves caused by earthquakes and hurricanes. Mr. Couthouy further argues, that since these great fragments were deposited and fixed on the reef, they have been elevated; he infers this from the greatest amount of erosion not being near their bases, where they are unceasingly washed by the reflux of the tides, but at some height on their sides, near the line of high-water mark, as shown in an accompanying diagram. My former remark again applies here, with this further observation, that as the waves have to roll over a wide space of reef before they reach the fragments, their force must be greatly increased with the increasing depth of water as the tide rises, and therefore I should have expected that the chief line of present erosion would have coincided with the line of high-water mark; and if the reef had grown outwards, that there would have been lines of erosion at greater heights. The conclusion, to which I am finally led by the interesting observations of Mr. Couthouy is, that the atolls in the Low Archipelago have, like the Society Islands, remained at a stationary level for a long period: and this probably is the ordinary course of events, subsidence supervening after long intervals of rest.) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} unravel the tectonic {{evolution}} of the north-central sector of the Sicily Channel (Central Mediterranean), a seismo-stratigraphic analysis of single- and multi-channel seismic reflection profiles has been carried out. This allowed to identify, between 20 and 50  km offshore the central-southern coast of Sicily, a ~ 80 -km-long deformation belt, characterized {{by a set of}} WNW–ESE to NW–SE fault segments showing a poly-phasic activity. Within this belt, we observed: i) Miocene normal faults reactivated during Zanclean–Piacenzian time by dextral strike-slip motion, {{as a consequence of the}} Africa–Europe convergence; ii) releasing and restraining bend geometries forming well-developed pull-apart basins and compressive structures. In the central and western sectors of the belt, we identified local transpressional reactivations of Piacenzian time, attested by well-defined compressive features like push-up structures and fault-bend anticlines. The reconstruction of timing and style of tectonic deformation suggest a strike-slip reactivation of inherited normal faults and the local subsequent positive tectonic inversion, often documented along oblique thrust ramps. This pattern represents a key for an improved knowledge of the structural style of foreland fold-and-thrust belts propagating in a preexisting extensional domain. With regard to active tectonics and seismic hazards, recent GPS data and local seismicity events suggest that this deformation process could be still active and accomplished through deep-buried structures; moreover, several normal faults showing moderate displacements have been identified on top of the <b>Madrepore</b> Bank and Malta High, offsetting the Late Quaternary deposits. Finally, inside the northern part of the Gela Basin, multiple slope failures, originated during Pleistocene by the further advancing of the Gela Nappe, reveal tectonically induced potential instability processes...|$|E
