Lokko is the shortest-serving principal of the academy and one of its longest-serving staff, having been employed by the academy for 22 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{public in}} Boston and Lowell {{continued}} to attribute Kinney and Freeman's deaths to Hanson despite the court declaring her not guilty, and rumors had {{even begun to}} attribute the death of Freeman's father to Hanson as well. Hanson's father-in-law, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Freeman</b> had died suddenly while Hanson and Freeman had been visiting him following their wedding. In 1841, Kinney published her autobiography, A Review of the Principal Events of the Last Ten Years in the Life of Mrs. Hannah Kinney: Together with Some Comments upon the Late Trial, Written by Herself to combat rumors of her guilt. In response, her ex-husband Ward Witham, published a biography of Hannah, entitled Life of Mrs. H. Kinney, for Twenty Years in 1842. He accused her of adultery and slander, but publicize an opinion on the murder trial.|$|E

500|$|First ending: Charles {{does not}} visit Sarah, but {{immediately}} returns to Lyme to reaffirm {{his love for}} Ernestina. They marry, though the marriage never becomes particularly happy, and Charles enters trade under Ernestina's father, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Freeman.</b> The narrator pointedly notes the {{lack of knowledge about}} Sarah's fate. Charles tells Ernestina about an encounter which he implies is with the [...] "French Lieutenant's Whore", but elides the sordid details, and the matter is ended. The narrator dismisses this ending as a daydream by Charles, before the alternative events of the subsequent meeting with Ernestina are described. Critic Michelle Phillips Buchberger describes this first ending as [...] "a semblance of verisimilitude in the traditional 'happy ending'" [...] found in actual Victorian novels.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} in the book occurs when Maya and Bailey's father {{unexpectedly}} appears in Stamps. He takes the two children with him when he departs, but leaves them with their mother in St. Louis, Missouri. Eight-year-old Maya is sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Freeman.</b> He is found guilty during the trial, but escapes jail time and is murdered, presumably by Maya's uncles. Maya feels guilty and withdraws from everyone but her brother. Even after returning to Stamps, Maya remains reclusive and nearly mute until she meets Mrs. Bertha Flowers, [...] "the aristocrat of Black Stamps", who encourages her through books and communication to regain her voice and soul. This coaxes Maya out of her shell.|$|E
50|$|In 1790 Ireland {{resided in}} Arundel Street, Strand, {{and a year}} later removed to 8 Norfolk Street. His {{household}} consisted of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Freeman,</b> a housekeeper and amanuensis, whose handwriting shows her to have been a woman of education, a son William Henry, and a daughter Jane. The latter painted some clever miniatures. He had also a married daughter, Anna Maria Barnard. The Ireland family Bible shows that all three children were illegitimate, and that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Freeman</b> was their mother. Mrs. Freeman’s original name was Anna Maria de Burgh Coppinger.|$|R

500|$|Arensberg {{notes that}} Maya's rape is {{connected}} to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Freeman</b> threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape {{was the first time he}} touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, [...] "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".|$|E
2500|$|In 1868, The Republican, a Springfield, Massachusetts newspaper, {{mentioned}} Hannah Hanson as [...] "Hannah Kinney, {{supposed to}} have poisoned the Rev <b>Mr</b> <b>Freeman,</b> her second husband, as well as Kinney, her third."

60|$|Lady Churchill, {{with her}} long neck, splendid hair and complexion, short chin, and {{sparkling}} blue eyes, was beautiful to look at, but not at all disposed to be agreeable to the Queen's ladies, whom she treated {{with a sort of}} blunt scorn, not at all disguised by the forms of courtesy. However, she had, to their relief, a good deal of leave of absence just then to visit her children, as indeed the ladies agreed that she did pretty much as she chose, and that the faithful Mrs. Morley was somewhat afraid of the dear <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Freeman.</b>|$|R
60|$|My own last {{personal}} {{concern with}} {{it was on}} a matter, of fox-hunting. [Footnote: I have written various articles for it since, especially two on Cicero, to which I devoted great labour.] There came out in it an article from the pen of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Freeman</b> the historian, condemning the amusement, which I love, on the grounds of cruelty and general brutality. Was it possible, asked <b>Mr.</b> <b>Freeman,</b> quoting from Cicero, that any educated man should find delight in so coarse a pursuit? Always bearing in mind my own connection with The Fortnightly, I regarded this almost as a rising of a child against the father. I felt at any rate bound to answer <b>Mr.</b> <b>Freeman</b> in the same columns, and I obtained Mr. Morley's permission to do so. I wrote my defence of fox-hunting, and there it is. In regard to the charge of cruelty, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Freeman</b> seems to assert that nothing unpleasant should be done to any of God's creatures except f or a useful purpose. The protection of a lady's shoulders from the cold is a useful purpose; and therefore a dozen fur-bearing animals may be snared in the snow and left to starve to death in the wires, in order that the lady may have the tippet,--though a tippet of wool would serve the purpose as well as a tippet of fur. But the congregation and healthful amusement of one or two hundred persons, on whose behalf a single fox {{may or may not be}} killed, is not a useful purpose. I think that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Freeman</b> has failed to perceive that amusement is as needful and almost as necessary as food and raiment. The absurdity of the further charge as to the general brutality of the pursuit, and its consequent unfitness for an educated man, is to be attributed to Mr. Freeman's ignorance of what is really done and said in the hunting-field,--perhaps to his misunderstanding of Cicero's words. There was a rejoinder to my answer, and I asked for space for further remarks. I could have it, the editor said, if I much wished it; but he preferred that the subject should be closed. Of course I was silent. His sympathies were all with Mr. Freeman,--and against the foxes, who, but for fox-hunting, would cease to exist in England. And I felt that The Fortnighty was hardly the place for the defence of the sport. Afterwards <b>Mr.</b> <b>Freeman</b> kindly suggested to me that he would be glad to publish my article in a little book to be put out by him condemnatory of fox-hunting generally. He was to have the last word and the first word, and that power of picking to pieces which he is known to use in so masterly a manner, without any reply from me! This I was obliged to decline. If he would give me the last word, as be would have the first, then, I told him, I should be proud to join him in the book. This offer did not however meet his views.|$|E

She did not approve of such common names as Princess Anne and Lady Churchill used--Mrs. Morley and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Freeman!</b> They must have something better than what was used by the Cockpit folks, and she was sure that her dear Portia would soon be of the only true faith.|$|R
