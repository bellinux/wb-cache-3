5|$|As a {{byproduct}} of his presence in Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct, Iwata became {{the public face of}} Nintendo. Iwata enjoyed conversing with reporters and would prepare stories in advance to entertain them. Even when time did not allow, he would <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> interviewers and chat casually.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstream}} media depicted Diệm as a friendly and charismatic leader who related {{well to the}} populace. The Herald showed photographs of the president eating cheese, and inspecting the foliage at the Botanic Gardens. Diệm was depicted making friends with a young boy from a Collingwood public housing estate and having tea with South Vietnamese students studying abroad at the University of Melbourne, with the females wearing the traditional ao dai. In contrast, Diệm was generally regarded as aloof and distant from the population, rarely heading outside the presidential palace to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> his people, and holding military processions in honour of his ascension to power in front of empty grandstands.|$|E

5|$|Priscus first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} sources when he was appointed, in late 587 or early 588, to command in the East against the Persians as magister militum per Orientem, replacing Philippicus. He only reached the East in spring, and assumed his new command at Monocarton in April. Priscus immediately ran into trouble with the soldiers: his haughty manner in refusing to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> them made him unpopular, and when a decree by Emperor Maurice which reduced army pay by a quarter was announced, the soldiers mutinied on Easter day, 18 April 588. Priscus not only failed to restore order, but was himself attacked and forced to flee to Constantina, while the soldiers elected the dux of Phoenice, Germanus, as their leader. Priscus's attempts from Constantina to calm the soldiers by employing the local bishops as mediators and rescinding the decree also failed. Philippicus was restored to command by Maurice, while Priscus returned to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E
5|$|As most meat ant colonies {{rarely have}} a second queen, polydomy is not always {{associated}} with polygyny, although the two are frequently associated with each other because polygynous colonies reproduce by budding. This means that the ecological factors that promote polydomy and polygny both differ. Studies show that most meat ants are produced by a single, inseminated queen due to {{the high level of}} relatedness in all but one tested colonies. Colonies that are not closely related are the result of colony fusion (meaning that two unrelated and separate colonies form a single entity). Meat ants also show nest fidelity: in polydomous colonies, workers from different nests will always <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> others from different nests but never return to a nest they do not originate from. Instead, they return to the nest they enclosed in. This means that colonies may only homogenise through brood transfer. As discussed before, nestmates from different nests will always be aggressive towards each other, but this is due to a number of factors: genetic and spatial distance in nests can correlate with the level of aggression exhibited by the ants. However, they exhibit more aggression to ants of different species from adjoining territories. They are also aggressive to conspecific ants from distant colonies, suggesting that environmental cues {{play a vital role in}} nestmate recognition. An example is that background odours in a particular environment may impair ants from identifying their own nestmates, and may need to make more attempts to determine an ant's identity.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan was}} for the infiltrators to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> the local populace and incite them to rebellion. Meanwhile, guerilla warfare would commence, {{destroying}} bridges, tunnels and highways, as well as Indian Army installations and airfields, creating conditions for an 'armed insurrection' in Kashmir. If the attempt failed, Pakistan hoped to have raised international attention to the Kashmir issue. Using the newly acquired sophisticated weapons through the American arms aid, Pakistan believed that it could achieve tactical victories in a quick limited war.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium {{carbamate}} {{solutions are}} notoriously corrosive to metallic construction materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steel—especially in the hottest {{parts of the}} plant such as the stripper. Traditionally corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuously injecting {{a small amount of}} oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Because the carbon dioxide feed is recovered from ammonia synthesis gas, it contains traces of hydrogen that can <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> passivation air to form an explosive mixture if allowed to accumulate.|$|E
25|$|Lorikeet Adventure, the Nurture Trail, and the Bird Propagation Center {{opened in}} 2006 between Bird World and the Primate Panorama. Lorikeet Adventure is a large, open-air mesh tent where {{visitors}} can <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> and feed lories and lorikeets. The Nurture Trail {{is a short}} trail through a forested glade home to two exhibits: one for red-crowned cranes and one for cinereous vultures. The trail then goes past smaller outdoor enclosures attached to the Bird Propagation Center, which provides the Denver Zoo with state-of-the-art facilities for breeding and raising all types of birds.|$|E

25|$|The khanith form an {{accepted}} third gender in Oman. The khanith are male homosexual prostitutes whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> women, {{and they often}} do at weddings or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their society, khaniths can marry women, proving their masculinity by consummating the marriage. Should a divorce or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.|$|E
25|$|Bird World, {{opened in}} 1975, {{features}} open aviaries in which guests can <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> exotic birds such as Egyptian plovers, rhinoceros hornbills, and crested oropendolas and even two-toed sloths.

There are four outdoor exhibits directly {{attached to the}} exterior of Bird World which are home to African penguins, Steller's sea eagles, kea and double-wattled cassowaries.|$|E
25|$|The PLA {{maintains}} {{a number of}} garrisons in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In addition to the PLA Forces Hong Kong Building, there are notable garrisons at the Stonecutters Island, and at Stanley Fort. Soldiers located at these three garrisons {{are considered to be}} the élite of the PLA. The soldiers are not permitted to leave their compounds, even during off-duty times to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> the local populace. As a military property, the PLA Forces Hong Kong Building is heavily guarded by very alert soldiers with machine guns. It is best to photograph it from somewhere along Harcourt Road and not to attract too much attention.|$|E
