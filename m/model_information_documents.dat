The method of document structuring by highlighting the specific elements of variable information and applying a specialised markup language is proposed here. The algorithm for analysing the <b>document</b> <b>information</b> structure and constructing the adaptive model for visual setting of generation parameters is considered.

The idea begins with <b>information</b> flow <b>model</b> of RT-related document in a firm and the meta data which represents <b>model</b> of <b>document</b> <b>information</b> transformation is applied. Finally, the proposed RT model is implemented to experimental system by using semantic Web tool for feasibility test with an RT scenario. Query Language is used for finding the requirements to be traced and its related <b>information</b> inside the <b>document</b> data storage...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{tool support}} is much {{needed for the}} tedious and {{error-prone}} task of managing system requirements and system architectures. With the primary objective of providing practical support for software engineers, we have developed a tool for managing system requirements, system architectures and their traceability, which is being used in real-world industrial projects. The tool {{is based on a}} well considered <b>information</b> <b>model</b> of system requirements and architectures, and embodies a set of document templates providing guidance for software engineers. In this paper, we report on our experience in designing and improving the tool. In particular, we highlight a number of case studies that {{played a significant role in}} formulating the <b>information</b> <b>model</b> and <b>document</b> templates, and provide an assessment of the tool relative to existing practice...|$|R
40|$|A {{goal of the}} International Planetary Data Alliance (lPDA) is {{to develop}} a set of archive data {{standards}} that enable the sharing of scientific data across international agencies and missions. To help achieve this goal, the IPDA steering committee initiated a six month proj ect to write requirements for and draft an <b>information</b> <b>model</b> based on the Planetary Data System (PDS) archive data standards. The project had a special emphasis on data formats. A set of use case scenarios were first developed from which a set of requirements were derived for the IPDA archive data standards. The special emphasis on data formats was addressed by identifying data formats that have been used by PDS nodes and other agencies in the creation of successful data sets for the Planetary Data System (PDS). The dependency of the IPDA <b>information</b> <b>model</b> on the PDS archive standards required the compilation of a formal specification of the archive standards currently in use by the PDS. An ontology modelling tool was chosen to capture the <b>information</b> <b>model</b> from various sources including the Planetary Science Data Dictionary [I] and the PDS Standards Reference [2]. Exports of the <b>modelling</b> <b>information</b> from the tool database were used to produce the <b>information</b> <b>model</b> <b>document</b> using an object-oriented notation for presenting the model. The tool exports can also be used for software development and are directly accessible by semantic web applications...|$|R
40|$|Information {{retrieval}} is {{the process}} of evaluating a user's query, or information need, against a set of documents (books, journal articles, web pages, etc.) to determine which of the documents satisfies the query. With the advent of the World Wide Web, there is suddenly a need to query enormous sets of documents both efficiently and accurately. In the vector space <b>model</b> of <b>information</b> retrieval, <b>documents</b> are represented by sparse vectors each component of which corresponds to a term, usually a word, in the documents set. In the simplest case, the components of these vectors are the raw frequency counts of each term in each document. More sophisticated term weighting schemes are used to improve information retrieval accuracy. We study a specific term weighting scheme (log-entropy weighting) to determine its effectiveness on different aspects of retrieval. New approaches to term weighting are also examined. In addition, we describe our workshop experience and some of our technical wo [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} database-centric {{approach}} to web site development {{in which both}} application and web content data are managed by a database. The development process is based on three main stages of <b>information</b> <b>modeling,</b> <b>document</b> content design and presentation specification. A Java framework based on the OMS object-oriented data management system has been developed to support the development life cycle from rapid prototyping through to operation. We describe how the framework supports access from heterogeneous clients and how it has been extended to include a web content manager. We describe how the OMS Java framework provides three level of abstractions – storage, information and access in order to realize these objectives. We then present each of these layers in turn – starting with the information abstractions which lie {{at the core of}} the system and then going on to the storage and access layers...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} {{an outgrowth of}} research performed with a data base of merged individual income tax returns and <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> Tax Year 1989 was the first year for which such a data base was created and perfected. Traditionally, the Statistics of Income (SOI) Division of the Internal Revenue Service has interpreted its mandate to produce "statistics reasonably available {{with respect to the}} operations of the internal revenue laws " [1] as meaning tabulating data shown on tax returns. In recent years, with the computerization of the millions of <b>information</b> <b>documents</b> prepared by employers, banks, stock brokers, payers of pensions, etc., data from these documents have increasingly become "reasonably available. " Data from <b>information</b> <b>documents,</b> when matched to tax returns, can be used to serve as a check on the data shown on individual income tax returns, as well as to provide an indication of how much of the income on a joint return belongs to the husband and how much to the wife. In addition, it is possible to pull a sample of <b>information</b> <b>documents</b> that do not match to tax returns, and use them to tally data about non-filers. The data base used for this paper was created as a tool to compare tax return data to data gathered from <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> It includes a sample of tax returns matched to <b>information</b> <b>documents,</b> as well as unmatched tax returns and unmatched <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> The age of each individual in the sample was determined by matching his or her social security number (SSN) to the Year of Birth file, whic...|$|R
