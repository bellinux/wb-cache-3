40|$|Abstract — Cooperative {{relaying}} with Distributed Space-Time Coding (DSTC) {{and cooperative}} Opportunistic Relaying (OR) {{are the two}} <b>main</b> <b>relaying</b> techniques that are typically employed in current wireless systems. However, OR is less complex and proven to be outage optimal compared to DSTC. Thus, {{in this paper we}} propose a Multi-Mode Relaying (MMR) technique that is based on OR and combined with the Successive Relaying (SR) technique {{in order to deal with}} the half-duplex constraint of the relay nodes. MMR, by employing Multi-Mode Decode-and-Forward (MMDF) relay nodes and incorporating two interference mitigation algorithms, not only combines the merits of OR and SR but also is able to alleviate the increased inter-relay interference caused by SR. The performance of MMR is evaluated through simulation and the results show that it is able to increase the average end-to-end capacity of the wireless path as well as the percentage of high quality packets received at the terminal of the user...|$|R

50|$|The red {{ignition}} cassette {{used with}} Trionic 5 {{is mounted on}} the valve cover {{on top of the}} spark plugs. The ignition cassette houses four ignition coils/transformers whose secondary coil is direct connected to the spark plugs. The cassette is electrically supplied with battery voltage from the <b>main</b> <b>relay</b> (B+) and is grounded in an earth point. When the <b>main</b> <b>relay</b> is activated the battery voltage is reformed to 400 V DC which is stored in a capacitor. 400 V voltage is connected to one of the poles of the primary coil in the four spark coils. To the ignition cassette there are four triggering lines connected from the Trionic ECU, pin 9 (cyl. 1), pin 10 (cyl. 2), pin 11 (cyl. 3) and pin 12 (cyl. 4). When the ECU is grounding pin 9, the primary coil for the first cylinder is grounded (via the ignition cassettes B+ intake) and 400 V is transformed up to a maximum of 40 kV in the secondary coil for cyl. 1.

50|$|The fuel {{injector}} valves {{are of a}} solenoid type with needle and seat. They are opened by a current flowing through the injector's coil and are closed by a strong spring when the current is switched off. To ensure as optimal combustion as possible and with that lower exhaust emission the injectors are equipped with four holes, which gives a good distribution of the fuel. The squirts of fuel are very exact positioned (two jets on the backside on each inlet valve). This put very high demands on the fixation of the injectors. To secure this fixation the injectors are fixed in pairs by a special retainer between cylinders 1 - 2 and 3 - 4. The injectors are electrically supplied from the <b>main</b> <b>relay,</b> while the ECU grounds the injectors.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} overcurrent relays (OCRs) coordination {{in the presence of}} DGs. OCRs are optimally set to work in a coordinated manner to isolate faults with minimal impacts on customers. The penetration of DGs into the power system changes the fault current levels seen by the OCRs. This can deteriorate the coordinated operation of OCRs. Operation time difference between backup and <b>main</b> <b>relays</b> can be below the standard limit or even the backup OCR can incorrectly work before the main OCR. Though resetting of OCRs is tedious especially in large systems, it cannot alone restore the original coordinated operation in the presence of DGs. The paper investigates the optimal utilization of fault current limiters (FCLs) to maintain the directional OCRs coordinated operation without any need to OCRs resetting irrespective of DGs status. It is required to maintain the OCRs coordination at minimum cost of prospective FCLs. Hence, the FCLs location and sizing problem is formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization is adopted for solving the optimization problem to determine the optimal locations and sizes of FCLs. The proposed algorithm is applied to meshed and radial power systems at different DGs arrangements using different types of FCLs. Moreover, the OCRs coordination problem is studied when the system includes both directional and non-directional OCRs. Comparative analysis of results is provided...|$|R
