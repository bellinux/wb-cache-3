5|$|During the day, whitetip reef sharks {{spend much}} of their time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which rely on ram {{ventilation}} and <b>must</b> <b>constantly</b> swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its gills and lie still on the bottom. At night, whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes, crustaceans, and octopus in groups, their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices and holes to extract hidden prey. Individuals may stay within a particular area of the reef for months or years, frequently returning to the same shelter. This species is viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. One of the few sharks in which mating has been observed in the wild, receptive female whitetip reef sharks are followed by prospective males, which attempt to grasp her pectoral fin and maneuver the two of them into positions suitable for copulation. Females give birth to one to six pups every other year, after a gestation period of 1013 months.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who <b>must</b> <b>constantly</b> push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Comprehensive Political Guidance (CPG), {{a policy}} {{document}} {{that had been}} agreed by Defence Ministers in June 2006 and an addition to the 1999 Strategic Concept document, was formally endorsed during the summit. The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing transformation in the coming 10 to 15 years. More specifically, the document expresses {{the belief that the}} principal threats to the Alliance in the coming decades are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse of new technologies, and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy and sustain them over long periods of time. The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% <b>must</b> <b>constantly</b> be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E

25|$|In {{the model}} Piaget {{developed}} in stage three, {{he argued that}} intelligence develops {{in a series of}} stages that are related to age and are progressive because one stage must be accomplished before the next can occur. For each stage of development the child forms a view of reality for that age period. At the next stage, the child must keep up with earlier level of mental abilities to reconstruct concepts. Piaget conceived intellectual development as an upward expanding spiral in which children <b>must</b> <b>constantly</b> reconstruct the ideas formed at earlier levels with new, higher order concepts acquired at the next level.|$|E

After years of being a taxi driver, he decides to become a reporter with In-ha to prove his family's innocence, and show reporter Song Cha-ok what being a true reporter means.

25|$|Artificial {{harmonics}} {{are more}} difficult to produce than natural harmonics, as they involve both stopping the string and playing a harmonic on the stopped note. Using the octave frame (the normal distance between the first and fourth fingers in any given position) with the fourth finger just touching the string a fourth higher than the stopped note produces the fourth harmonic, two octaves above the stopped note. Finger placement and pressure, as well as bow speed, pressure, and sounding point are all essential in getting the desired harmonic to sound. And to add to the challenge, in passages with different notes played as false harmonics, the distance between stopping finger and harmonic finger <b>must</b> <b>constantly</b> change, since the spacing between notes changes {{along the length of the}} string.|$|E
25|$|The young {{generally}} resemble their parents. Growth {{is accomplished}} by periodic shedding of the exoskeleton (ecdysis). A scorpion's developmental progress is measured in instars (how many moults it has undergone). Scorpions typically require between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Moulting commences with a split in the old exoskeleton just below {{the edge of the}} carapace (at the front of the prosoma). The scorpion then emerges from this split; the pedipalps and legs are first removed from the old exoskeleton, followed eventually by the metasoma. When it emerges, the scorpion's new exoskeleton is soft, making the scorpion highly vulnerable to attack. The scorpion <b>must</b> <b>constantly</b> stretch while the new exoskeleton hardens to ensure that it can move when the hardening is complete. The process of hardening is called sclerotisation. The new exoskeleton does not fluoresce; as sclerotisation occurs, the fluorescence gradually returns.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{practical}} reasons why calculated hits may weaken {{the effectiveness of}} terrorist activities. Targeted killings physically eliminate skilled terrorists, bomb makers, forgers, recruiters and other operatives, who need time to develop expertise. Targeted hits also disrupt the opponent's infrastructure and organization, and cause immense stress on individual leaders and fighters, who <b>must</b> <b>constantly</b> move, switch locations and hide. This reduces {{the flow of information}} in the terrorist organization and reduces its effectiveness. Targeted killings may also serve as a demoralizing agent. Targeted individuals cannot visit their wives, children, relatives or families without severe risk, and may even shirk their names coming out in public for fear of liquidation as Israeli killings of Hamas leaders Ahmed Yassin and Abdelaziz Rantisi caused Hamas to not publicly identify their replacement, a necessary step to secure his survival.|$|E

500|$|During the 18th century, {{there was}} a debate over poetic {{language}} and the translations of Smart, especially of Horace, positioned him as one who sought to redeem traditional forms and understanding of language. However, some critics, like Alan Liu, believe that translations are effectively forced to compete against the original works, and that Smart's language, at least in his translations, <b>must</b> <b>constantly</b> seek to undermine the original authors, like Horace. Not all critics agree with Liu, and those like Donald Davie believe that the Smart's translations cannot {{be compared to the}} original works, but are part of a system of Smart competing against the language of his contemporaries. Thomas Keymer further verified this point about Smart's translations by revealing that the poet claims, in William Toldervy's The History of Two Orphans, [...] "But what heaven-exciting harmony might we not expect from that exalted genius, who can produce such lines as these following!" [...] in anticipation of replacing the previous flawed translations of the Psalms.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the senior}} dance, Tom invites his ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) {{to his office}} to finally {{disclose}} his romantic feelings for her, but she rejects him. Not satisfied with the outcome, he attempts to blackmail her into a date using an alimony lawsuit as leverage. Tom and Wendy are later shown hugging and presumably making amends, although their conversation remains inaudible. Meanwhile, April's (Aubrey Plaza) boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee) and his boyfriend Ben (Josh Duvendeck) mock the senior citizens, causing April to question why their interactions <b>must</b> <b>constantly</b> be [...] "cloaked in like 15 layers of irony". They accuse her of [...] "lameness", which they attribute to spending time with Andy, and provide her with several ultimatums. She breaks up with them in response.

In {{an interview with the}} camera crew, Ann describes the relationship as [...] "good", but her tone of voice and body language around Mark contradict her statements. She later becomes jealous when Andy dedicates a song to April, even {{going so far as to}} question April about the possibility of a budding relationship between April and Andy, to which April responds impatiently.|$|E
500|$|Linnie Blake {{felt that}} Gwen's had a passive role {{in her own}} affair; as with her lesbian clinch with an alien and her forceable impregnation; she argues that the Gothic {{situations}} in Torchwood continually parallels in the [...] "invasion" [...] of her sexuality. Valerie Estelle Frankel argued that Gwen finds [...] "the missing side of herself" [...] with her immersion {{into the world of}} Torchwood, represented by [...] "affairs and homosexuality and the threat of death" [...] rather than her ordinary domestic life with Rhys. Daniel Rawcliffe noted that Indira Varma's character Suzie, featured in the premiere episode and in [...] "They Keep Killing Suzie", is used as a [...] "doppelgänger" [...] for Gwen, (a trope of Gothic fiction– compare with the terms [...] "Gothic double" [...] and literary foil). Suzie's actions, and parallels with Gwen, help to illuminate some of Gwen's own ethically ambiguous decisions in the first series. Gwen <b>must</b> <b>constantly</b> fight against Suzie, and Suzie's example, [...] "if she is to be proved worthy of working alongside Captain Jack". According to Frankel Gwen's confrontation with Suzie mirrored her confrontation with her [...] "inner self"; her literal journey into death gave her [...] "the wisdom and duality of both worlds, life and death, mundane and magical" [...] and allowed her to become stronger.|$|E
