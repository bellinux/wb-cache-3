5000|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>measurement</b> {{techniques}} {{based on}} cavity perturbation theory are generally {{used to determine}} the dielectric and magnetic parameters of materials and various circuit components such as dielectric resonators. Since ex-ante knowledge of the resonant frequency, resonant frequency shift and electromagnetic fields is necessary in order to extrapolate material properties, these measurement techniques generally make use of standard resonant cavities where resonant frequencies and electromagnetic fields are well known. Two examples of such standard resonant cavities are rectangular and circular waveguide cavities and coaxial cables resonators [...] Cavity perturbation measurement techniques for material characterization are used in many fields ranging from physics and material science to medicine and biology.|$|E

40|$|Wrrs rnr ADVENT oF new, highly {{sophisticated}} microwave devices and systems, there {{has developed a}} need for fast, accurate, and complete characterization of the networks that comprise them. Two popular techniques exist for characteization of microwave networks. They can be broadly classified as fixed-frequency or sweptfrequency techniques. The power of the fixed-frequency technique is that the mismatch, tracking, and directivity errors of the measurement system can be minimized by 'tuning out'the residual errors, achieving high accuracy. Fixed-frequency techniques, however, are slow and somewhat tedious. Swept-frequency techniques in general offer a fast means of gathering data across broad bandwiths, and the advantage of intuitive insight into the device being tested. Normally, {{it is difficult to}} account for all errors, when using the swept-frequency technique, since they can not be completely 'tuned out ' in the broadband case. The question is, can we somehow devise a <b>microwave</b> <b>measurement</b> system which will provide the advantages of the above two techniques without incurring any of the disadvantages?
