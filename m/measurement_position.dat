This is so that any heat flow then measured is due to specimen rate processes rather than due to a continuing process of bringing the specimen to the set temperature. The time for introduction of a specimen in a 3-20 ml IMC ampoule into <b>measurement</b> <b>position</b> is ca. 40 minutes in many instruments. This means that heat flow from any processes which take place within a specimen during that the introduction period will not be recorded.|$|E

It also allows the placement of ancillary detectors in the opposite side to measure other types of radiation emitted by the activity implanted in the tape (x rays, e−/e+, etc.).

Lucrecia’s light is collected by 8 photomultipliers.

If one knew where the beam was, one could determine its new <b>position.</b> A relative <b>measurement</b> is essentially independent of errors in mechanical fabrication or electrical components. The minimum measurable displacement is only limited by the strength of the electrical signals or the signal to noise ratio of the position signal. An absolute <b>position</b> <b>measurement</b> is much more challenging. All inaccuracies in mechanical components and fabrication, electrical components, installation and assembly errors must be considered and controlled along with the issues common to relative <b>position</b> <b>measurements.</b> However, if the object is to strike a small specific point on a target or pass the beam through a small hole, absolute beam <b>position</b> <b>measurements</b> are required.
