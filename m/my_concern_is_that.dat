The sequence in the film when a housekeeper confronts a truckload of Iranian revolutionary guards at the Canadian ambassadors home bears a striking resemblance to Williams story.

This study, {{entitled}} "Parents' {{views on}} teaching of Sexuality {{issues in the}} Environmental Education Curriculum in the Zambezia Province of Mozambique" focused on parents of grade seven learners in Quelimane and Cololo in the Zambezia Province. My interest in conducting such an investigation stemmed from the fact <b>that</b> I <b>am</b> working for the project piloting the above curriculum, including issues of Population (Pop) and Family Life Education (FLE). I <b>was</b> informed <b>that</b> parents' <b>were</b> not satisfied with our work in the schools, {{due to the fact}} <b>that</b> we <b>were</b> "teaching nonsense to young children, promoting promiscuity". <b>My</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> not having parents support our project, it would never succeed even if having the best intentions regarding the youth. Therefore, there was a need to conduct an inquiry which could lead to identifying the real reason underpinning the parents' refusal, and to afterwards design a plan to modify the training in order to gain parents' support. In this regard, I conducted interviews and lesson observations in some schools where the trial testing was done, followed by data analysis of research data representing the parents', learners' and teachers' opinions and my own views. This way, I hoped to propose ways of strengthening the relationship between the school community and parents and also to empower all participants (community, teachers and learners). Hopefully, a curriculum would result from the consensus among all interested parties in the process, with the objective of improving the citizens' life...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} undertaken was an ethnographic {{study of}} a single junior school was founded {{on the premise that}} children have considerably more knowledge about ‘citizenship’ and democratic processes than their teachers appreciate or are willing to acknowledge. It <b>was</b> my contention <b>that</b> in developing a citizenship programme and scheme of work in school this should be taken account of to inform, not only the curriculum, but also teaching and learning. <b>My</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> without doing so, paradoxically, citizenship might {{have more to do with}} social control than the intended outcome of empowerment. A key finding of the study <b>was</b> <b>that</b> teachers taught social and moral responsibility rather than rights and <b>that</b> responsibility <b>was</b> inextricably linked to pupils’ behaviour. It also found that much of the information, knowledge and understanding, about democratic processes held by children appeared to be caught rather than taught. The study also showed that teachers taught about ‘safe issues’ whilst avoiding any teaching relating to local, national or world political events <b>that</b> might <b>be</b> contentious or controversial. From the findings a theoretical model for citizenship <b>was</b> developed <b>that</b> shows the relationship between citizenship knowledge, social control, empowerment, and teaching and learning. This study has contributed to the developing understanding of citizenship as it has been implemented in primary schools in England. The evidence suggests that unless teachers take account of pupils’ prior knowledge of citizenship they will by default indeed be teaching for social control rather than empowerment.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about peer {{rejection}} and bullying {{in schools and}} the tragic consequences that it can have. The focus of the paper is in the ways schools interact with groups of young males and, more importantly, those who are left out of these groupings. <b>My</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> schools currently give too little attention to informing and/or shaping the peer group practices of young people. I argue that the current educational theory and practice focus too heavily on individuals and their potential to act independently and overlook the all-important socialization that takes place within and between groups. Drawing on two case-studies of young males who experience peer rejection, I seek to raise concerns about the contemporary socializing practices of young males and the burgeoning need for schools {{to play a role}} in bringing about change. Given the continued prominence of sport as a trajectory for defining the dominant masculinity, I believe that it is critical that physical educators engage with the discussions and debates that surround this topic. <br /...|$|E

Drawing on the findings of a large-scale project which looks at programme trends and patterns in one city in Aotearoa/New Zealand in the 1980 s and 1990 s in the light of government policies, the paper examines whether we are losing touch with some of these traditions as a consequence of increasing globalisation. In particular <b>my</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> democratic traditions may be lost as corporations and governments seek to reduce the scope of adult learning programmes and as those of us working in the field find ourselves driven to conform with neo-liberal policies that rest on ideologies of instrumental rationalism and abstract individualism.

30|$|<b>My</b> third <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the history}} of technology, {{particularly}} those involving network effects, shows <b>that</b> decentralization <b>is</b> often accompanied by centralization simultaneously.

The promise of the decentralized internet with distributed content creation and consumption has come true, yet search has become a significant bottleneck with Google currently acting as a centralized gateway. Similarly, in social media, Facebook has enabled disparate communities and individuals to connect and share information, yet it has centralized the matching of friends and the connections. Blockchain technology also exhibits network effects, and many of the novel applications being developed require ecosystem coordination (Iansiti and Lakhani 2017); thus I expect centralization also to emerge.|$|R

Systemic Change The building of resilient kids is a long-term developmental process that involves systemic change-the fundamental altering of our human systems, including the family, the school, the neighborhood, community-based organizations, and the workplace to make each of these arenas supportive, caring, participatory climates for all involved persons. Fostering resiliency isn’t something we do to kids; it isn’t about teaching them “resiliency skills, ” per se. Rather, protective-factor research has clearly shown us that the development of resiliency is the process of healthy human development that is based on and grows out of nurturing, participatory relationship...|$|E
40|$|In the {{following}} passages I begin to articulate an eroticization {{of the text}} without prescription and without end. This is partly from within the terms of what Alice Jardine once called Jacques Derrida’s ‘pornosophy’. Yet it also breaks with the letter of that pornosophy and comes to find a greater radicality available via Walter Benjamin’s work on translation. Although Benjamin may not immediately spring to mind to ground an emerging politics and poetics of queer sexuality, certainly Gayatri Spivak has named translation as an erotic relation bound to undo the translator’s ‘(selv) edges’. Here, however, I appropriate Benjamin specifically for his uprooting of metaphor as it attempts to root kinship and reproduction in nature rather than language. While Derrida’s work is frequently hospitable to that of Benjamin, ‘Des Tours de Babel’ risks reinscribing the seminal logic that ‘Die Aufgabe des Übersetzers’ arguably displaces. Even though Derrida is, of course, sympathetic to the translation of the site of reproduction from nature to language, <b>my</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the hymeneal discourse effecting this turn hampers the style of translation as intercourse. Rather than seek to correct, or to discipline, the translation of ‘The Task of the Translator’, this paper contributes to its afterlife bearing in mind the somewhat divergent readings offered by Derrida, Carol Jacobs, and Paul de Man...|$|E
