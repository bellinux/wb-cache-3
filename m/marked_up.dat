5|$|What {{would become}} part of MD 2 was {{originally}} planned as two different state roads in 1909. The portion between Solomons and Annapolis was built as a gravel road called Solomons Island Road between 1910 and 1915. The portion of road between Annapolis and Glen Burnie was built {{as part of the}} BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard, a road authorized in 1910 to connect Baltimore and Annapolis and was completed in 1924 with the construction of a bridge over the Severn River leading to Annapolis. A state road between Glen Burnie and Baltimore was completed in 1911. MD 2 was designated in 1927 between Solomons and Baltimore, using Solomons Island Road, streets through Annapolis, the BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard, and the state road between Glen Burnie and Baltimore. MD 2 was <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> to US 1 in Baltimore in 1939. In the 1930s, MD 2 was realigned onto the four-lane Governor Ritchie Highway between Annapolis and Baltimore, the former routing along BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard became MD 648. Ritchie Highway became a divided highway in 1950. Between the 1930s and the 1950s, several upgrades and realignments occurred to the portion of MD 2 between Solomons and Annapolis. MD 2 was realigned to bypass Annapolis on the US 50 freeway in 1955, with MD 450 replacing the route through Annapolis. The route between Solomons and Sunderland became concurrent with MD 416 in 1960, which was renumbered to MD 4 in 1965. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, MD 2/MD 4 between Solomons and Sunderland was widened into a divided highway, with the bypassed former alignments becoming multiple sections of MD 765. The Ritchie Highway portion of the route was originally the main route between Annapolis and Baltimore until Interstate 97 (I-97) was completed in the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} value added <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> tend to be pro {{cyclical}} in manufacturing and counter cyclical in market services. However, at the sectoral level value added <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> may be misinterpreted if intermediate input variations are ignored. This is particularly true {{in the case of}} the manufacturing sectors, although less so in that of market services. In fact, this is the main explanation for the (pro cyclical) behaviour of relative services manufacturing <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> which, in turn, play an important role in their relative price dynamics of these sectors. In addition, fluctuations in demand also play a role. In the case of services, <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> depend negatively on current output and positively on future output; hence in periods when demand is recovering (declining) <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> widen (narrow). By contrast, in the manufacturing sectors <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> depend positively on the current output gap and negatively on future expected demand, i. e. when demand is recovering (declining) current <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> fall (rise). sectoral mark-ups, gross output, aggregation, intermediate inputs...|$|R

However, it is generally perceived in heterodox economics that competition does {{play an important role}} in the economy. This theme is discussed in conjunction with the going business enterprise. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{first two}} Messerschmitt Me 210 fighter-bombers to be {{destroyed}} over the British Isles fell to the guns of Typhoons in August 1942. During a daylight raid by the Luftwaffe on London on 20 January 1943, four Bf 109G-4s and one Fw 190A-4 of JG 26 were destroyed by Typhoons. As soon as the aircraft entered service, it was apparent {{the profile of the}} Typhoon resembled a Fw 190 from some angles, which caused more than one friendly fire incident involving Allied anti-aircraft units and other fighters. This led to Typhoons first being <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> with all-white noses, and later with high visibility black and white stripes under the wings, a precursor of the markings applied to all Allied aircraft on D-Day.|$|E

Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands, {{but for the most part}} protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls.

The empirical evidence suggests that rela-tive price movements are well explained by relative productivity and variations in <b>mark</b> <b>ups.</b> Unlike the original Balassa-Samuelson model, aggregate demand could affect the real exchange rate by changing the <b>mark</b> <b>ups.</b> Empirical results show that aggregate demand fluctuations lead to changes on the <b>mark</b> <b>ups...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{keeping with}} Brooks' own tradition, each ticket sold {{for the tour}} is the same price, {{regardless}} of location in the venue. An issue that arose beginning with the first concerts on the tour has been high ticket resale prices. For example, tickets for the seven-show residency in Dallas were being resold online for an average price 21% higher than face value. Because of Ticketmaster's anti-resale policies, Brooks chose the company to be the official ticket sales company for the tour. Despite the optimism {{for a lack of}} extreme resale prices, Ticketmaster's partner resale sites and services began allowing individuals to sell <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> tickets anyway. In the first weeks of the tour, Atlanta tickets were posted for sale on TicketsNow for as much as nearly 470% higher than face value (i.e. a $71.50 ticket being sold for $405). Brooks, a long-time proponent of banning increased price ticket resales, called out those marking up ticket prices, saying his ultimate goal is making concerts affordable regardless of seat location.|$|E
25|$|Stravinsky {{formed a}} {{business}} and musical relationship with the French piano manufacturing company Pleyel. Pleyel essentially acted as his agent in collecting mechanical royalties for his works and provided him with a monthly income and a studio space at its headquarters in which he could work and entertain friends and business acquaintances. Under the terms of his contract with the company, Stravinsky agreed to arrange (and to some extent re-compose) many of his early works for the Pleyela, Pleyel's brand of player piano. He did {{so in a way}} that made full use of all of the piano's eighty-eight notes, without regard for human fingers or hands. The rolls were not recorded, but were instead <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> from a combination of manuscript fragments and handwritten notes by Jacques Larmanjat, musical director of Pleyel's roll department. Among the compositions that were issued on the Pleyela piano rolls are the Rite of Spring, Petrushka, the Firebird and Song of the Nightingale. During the 1920s, Stravinsky recorded Duo-Art rolls for the Aeolian Company in both London and New York, not all of which have survived.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, the {{election}} of {{several members of the}} labor-friendly Tennessee Farmers' Alliance among them Governor John P. Buchanan to the state government emboldened miners in the Coal Creek Valley to make several demands. One of the key demands was payment in cash rather than company scrip, which could either be used only at company-owned stores with <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> prices or redeemed for cash at a percentage of its value. Miners also demanded they be allowed to use their own checkweighmen the specialists who weighed the coal and determined how much a particular miner had earned instead of checkweighmen hired by the company. Since state laws already barred scrip payment and company-hired checkweighmen, most mine owners accepted the demands, though they {{were in the midst of}} an economic downturn. However, the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC), which operated a mine near Briceville, rejected the demands, and on April 1, 1891, shut down operations. Two months later, the company demanded its miners sign an iron-clad contract before returning to work. The miners refused.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Pike Place Market in 1907, local Seattle area farmers sold their goods to the public in a three-square block area called The Lots, located at Sixth Avenue and King Street. Most produce sold at The Lots would then be brought to commercial wholesale houses on Western Avenue, which became known as Produce Row. Most farmers, due to the amount of time required to work their farms, were forced to sell their produce on consignment through the wholesalers on Western Avenue. The farmers typically received a percentage of the final sale price for their goods. They would sell to the middleman on commission, as most farmers would often have no time to sell direct to the public, and their earnings would be on <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> prices and expected sales. In some cases, the farmers made a profit, but just as often found themselves breaking even, or getting no money at all due to the business practices of the wholesalers. During the existence of the wholesale houses, which far predated the Market, there were regular rumors as well as instances of corruption in denying payment to farmers.|$|E

Short-run <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> vary countercyclically {{because of the}} impact of entry on competition. Long-run <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> are decreasing in the discount factor and in productivity, and increasing in the exit rate and in the entry costs. Dynamic inefficiency can emerge due to excessive entry under Cournot competition. Positive temporary shocks attract entry, which strengthens competition so as to reduce the <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> temporarily and increase real wages: this competition effect creates an intertemporal substitution effect which boosts consumption and employment.
