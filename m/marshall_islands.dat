40|$|Abstract — Ebja, {{sometimes}} {{written as}} Ebeye, is a one-of-a-kind city within the Republic of <b>Marshall</b> <b>Island</b> (RMI). With an inimitable cultural background and peaceful indigenes, <b>Marshall</b> <b>Island</b> {{has been known}} to house one of the most stable people in the world. Located {{in the middle of the}} Pacific Ocean and away from the rest of the world, this nation has become a highly interesting place for the United States. Not only has the US set up a rigid platform for the protection and defense of its friends and allies, but it has also signed an official treaty and compact agreement to provide for the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Island</b> people in terms of economic growth and development. While the symbiotic relationship between the two countries is thriving, there are silent protests and concerns amongst the hosts. Diplomatically, the US provides aid and assistance to <b>Marshall</b> <b>Island</b> while the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Island</b> government, in return, leases its land to the United States for ballistic missile tests and launches. However, due to economic, financial, societal and cultural differences between the RMI and the US, the relationship between the two countries has often been seen as unfair and unbalanced. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to examine the requirements and needs of the hosts (RMI) that, if met, would foster a better relationship between the two countries and promote growth and development on the atoll. A survey instrument was designed and validated as a special tool for conducting this research. The theory of Economic Growth, the Unified Theory of Economics and economic development theories provided the background for this study and offered a theoretical framework. Findings showed that: (a) the people of Ebja feel that American assistance will promote growth and development in the nation, (b) improvement of standards and quality of life of the people of Ebeye would improve the US-RMI relationship, (c) employment of the Marshallese by the Americans would serve the best interests of the two nations, and (d) provision of education an...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Marshall</b> <b>Islands</b> are a Micronesian island nation, {{located in}} the western Pacific Ocean midway between Hawaii and Australia.

5|$|The typhoon first {{affected}} the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Islands,</b> where 5,000people became homeless and heavy crop damage was reported. The nation's capital of Majuro experienced power and water outages during the storm. There were no fatalities among <b>Marshall</b> <b>Islands</b> citizens, although the typhoon killed a sailor {{traveling around the}} world. When Gay struck Guam, it became the sixth typhoon {{of the year to}} affect the island. Most of the weaker structures had been destroyed during Typhoon Omar earlier in the year, resulting in little additional damage from Gay. Because of its substantial weakening, the typhoon had a disrupted inner-core and produced minimal rainfall. However, strong winds scorched the plants on Guam with saltwater, causing extensive defoliation. Further north, high waves from the typhoon destroyed a house on Saipan, and heavy rainfall in Okinawa, Japan, caused flooding and power outages.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Gay first {{affected}} the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Islands,</b> striking several atolls in the archipelago with typhoon-force winds. On Mejit Island, the first island to be affected, the typhoon destroyed every wooden structure and left {{most of the}} islanders homeless. High winds downed all of the island's trees and destroyed 75% of the crops. Nearby, Ailuk Atoll experienced similar winds, though house damage was minor despite similar crop losses. The large wind field extended to the south, affecting Maloelap and Aur atolls with winds that damaged 30% of the houses and crops. Further south, the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Islands</b> capital city of Majuro experienced lightning strikes from the typhoon, which caused an island-wide power outage and cuts to the water supply and radio communication. Debris from the storm closed the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Islands</b> International Airport for two days. On Ujae Atoll, the typhoon destroyed an automated meteorological observing station that had been installed in 1989. The typhoon left over 5,000people homeless across the country, {{but there were no}} native deaths and only one injury in the archipelago owing to well-executed warnings and preparations. However, large waves from the typhoon sank a boat in a small lagoon, killing one of the boat's two sailors.|$|E
