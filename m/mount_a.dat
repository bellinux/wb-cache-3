5|$|With the {{internal}} weaknesses of fusionism now exposed, the Colorados moved to oust its supporters from the government. Their leader, Brigadier General Venancio Flores, a caudillo {{and an early}} proponent of fusionism, found himself without sufficient military resources to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> sustained revolt and resorted to asking for intervention by Argentina.|$|E
5|$|All these {{attempts}} to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> combined offensive between the Franks and Mongols were too little and too late. In May 1291, {{the city of}} Acre was conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Acre. When Pope Nicholas IV learned of this, he wrote to Arghun, again asking him to be baptized and {{to fight against the}} Mamluks. But Arghun had died on , and Pope Nicholas died as well in March 1292, putting an end to their efforts towards combined action.|$|E

5|$|Although the Polish {{division}} was defeated, the Russian forces did not pursue. This allowed the Poles to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> night counterattack. A single machine gun battalion attacked a position behind Radzymin. While ultimately unsuccessful, the battalion forced the Russian troops to remain stationary overnight, giving the Poles badly {{needed time to}} regroup and receive reinforcements, which {{came in the form}} of a single regiment from the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division. Instead of retreating to the third line of defences, the Poles remained outside the town, hoping to retake it the following day.|$|E
5|$|Brown put {{the odds}} for the {{existence}} of Planet Nine at about 90%. Greg Laughlin, one of the few researchers who knew in advance about this paper, gives an estimate of 68.3%. Other skeptical scientists demand more data in terms of additional KBOs to be analysed or final evidence through photographic confirmation. Brown, though conceding the skeptics' point, still thinks that there is enough data to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> search for a new planet.|$|E
5|$|He was {{expected}} {{by some to}} <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> challenge for promotion to the Premiership in 2005–06, which was the club's first season in the new Ricoh Arena. The team started out poorly, but improved {{in the second half}} of the season to rise up the table, with Adams making an inspired signing in Dennis Wise. However, despite excellent home form, he could only guide Coventry as high as 8th, missing out on a play-off place by only two league places, though several points adrift of that year's standard.|$|E

5|$|Heber was {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> direct attack on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E
5|$|In late 1938, another PanzerI {{was sent}} to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> 45mm gun, {{captured}} from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|Lamason's {{leadership}} {{boosted the}} airmen's spirits {{and gave them}} hope while instilling a level of discipline and bearing. One of the first assignments Lamason gave was to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> guard detail, both day and night, to prevent pilfering by other inmates, which had begun during their first night at camp. During their incarceration, Lamason insisted the airmen march, parade and act as a military unit.|$|E

5|$|On March 11, General Ngô Quang Trưởng ordered General Trần Văn Nhựt to {{mobilise}} the 2nd Division (South Vietnam), the 12th Ranger Group, {{elements of}} the 11th Armoured Squadron and one regional force battalion to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> counter-attack from Tuan Duong to Cam Khe and Duong Con. General Trưởng also ordered the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment (3rd Infantry Division) to depart from Da Nang, and protect Tam Kỳ, so that General Nhut's forces could be free up to fight the North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|The New York stage {{has seen}} two {{productions}} {{derived from the}} film. A musical based on the film opened on Broadway on 14 December 1969, but closed after one performance. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson, was so impressed by Giulietta Masina's work in La Strada that she attempted to obtain theatrical rights to the film in order to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> stage production in New York. After traveling to Rome in an unsuccessful attempt to meet with Fellini, she created a one-woman play, In Search of Fellini.|$|E

5|$|The US Army's 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, a {{newly formed}} unit {{consisting}} mostly of inexperienced new arrivals, {{was ordered to}} move to the South Korean village of Hadong to hold the pass there from advancing forces of the North Korean People's Army. Unprepared for combat, the American forces walked into an ambush in which most of the battalion's command staff was killed in the pass, leaving lower-ranking soldiers to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> disorganized defence against North Korean troops occupying prepared positions on higher ground.|$|E
5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{believed they had}} destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale thanks to their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict. UN troops were looking ahead to Operation Chromite, their amphibious assault far behind North Korean lines {{at the port of}} Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate the North Koreans would <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> serious offensive before then.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a success for the Poles at both the {{tactical}} level (the battle of Radzymin itself) and the strategic level (its role {{in the battle of}} Warsaw). After several days of constant fighting for the town of Radzymin and its immediate vicinity, the Russian attack was repelled and the Poles were able to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> successful counteroffensive, forcing the Russian armies out of Poland and in the end destroying them completely.|$|E

5|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} fort is the circular keep. This was modeled on the reduit de surete of the Lunette d'Arçon, and it also bears similarities to the tour-reduits built in Malta in the early 18th century (the only surviving example is Vendôme Tower). It had two rows of musketry loopholes, and its roof contained a parapet with four embrasures. The latter was replaced with a sloping parapet to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> single gun in the 1860s. The keep also contains the main gate, above which is a commemorative plaque.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Apatosaurus was {{confused}} {{with that of}} Camarasaurus and Brachiosaurus until 1909, when the holotype of A. louisae was found, and a complete skull just a few meters away {{from the front of}} the neck. Henry Fairfield Osborn disagreed with this association, and went on to <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> skeleton of Apatosaurus with a Camarasaurus skull cast. Until 1970, Apatosaurus skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to Diplodocus were more likely from Apatosaurus.|$|E
5|$|When the Seanchan {{attack the}} White Tower, its {{fractured}} state prevents an effective defense.

They find her so exhausted that she cannot protest when they extract her against her orders.
