A <b>machine</b> <b>independent</b> language is always superior -- even for writing machine dependent code (it's easier to find trained programmers) -- {{so long as the}} overhead can be endured.

50|$|The use of {{intermediate}} code enhances portability of the compiler, {{because only}} the machine dependent code (the interpreter or the code generator) of the compiler itself {{needs to be}} ported to the target machine.

We present a system that aims to detect bot-infected <b>machines,</b> <b>independent</b> of any prior information about the command and control channels or propagation vectors, and without requiring multiple infections for correlation. Our system relies on detection models that target the characteristic fact that every bot receives commands from the botmaster to which it responds in a specific way. These detection models are generated automatically from network traffic traces recorded from actual bot instances. We have implemented the proposed approach and demonstrate that it can extract effective detection models for a variety of different bot families. These models are precise in describing the activity of bots and raise very few false positives...|$|R

Machines and workers are constraining resources in the hypothetical shop. The organizational structure of the shop consists of divisions comprised of work centers that contain machines and workers.

Mean flow-time, flow-time variance and worker transfers between divisions and work centers are used as measures of shop performance. Labor flexibility is shown to have a major effect on shop performance. The effectiveness of interdivisional labor flexibility as a management variable is found to be concentrated in the region of high flexibility while intradivisional labor flexibility is most effective in the region of low flexibility. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Since IO {{performance}} on HPC machines strongly depends on machine characteristics and configuration, {{it is important}} to carefully tune IO libraries and make good use of appropriate library APIs. For instance, on current petascale <b>machines,</b> <b>independent</b> IO tends to outperform collective IO, in part due to bottlenecks at the metadata server. The problem is exacerbated by scaling issues, since each IO library scales differently on each machine, and typically, operates efficiently to different levels of scaling on different machines. With scientific codes being run on a variety of HPC resources, efficient code execution requires us to address three important issues: (1) end users should be able to select the most efficient IO methods for their codes, with minimal effort in terms of code updates or alterations; (2) such performance-driven choices should not prevent data from being stored in the desired file formats, sinc...|$|R
