50|$|<b>Moroxydine</b> is an {{antiviral}} drug that was originally developed in the 1950s as an influenza treatment. It has potential applications against a number of RNA and DNA viruses. Structurally <b>moroxydine</b> is a heterocyclic biguanidine.|$|E
50|$|It was {{reported}} in March 2014 that three kindergartens in two provinces of China had {{been found to be}} secretly dosing their students with <b>moroxydine</b> hydrochloride to try to prevent them from becoming ill. The kindergartens are paid only for the days that pupils attend and wanted to ensure that they maximised their earnings.|$|E
40|$|The {{data of the}} {{population-based}} Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities between 1980 and 1996 were evaluated. The {{objective of}} the study was to check the effect of oral <b>moroxydine,</b> a biguanide antiviral drug during pregnancy for birth outcomes. First, the prevalence of <b>moroxydine</b> use in the mothers of cases with and controls without congenital abnormalities was compared. Of 38, 151 pregnant women who delivered newborn infants without any defects (control group), 14 (0. 04 %), while of 22, 843 pregnant women who had fetuses or newborns with congenital abnormalities, 13 (0. 06 %) were treated with the oral tablet of <b>moroxydine</b> (POR with 95 % CI: 1. 6, 0. 7 - 3. 3). The teratogenic potential of oral <b>moroxydine</b> treatment cannot be excluded because a higher use of <b>moroxydine</b> during the second-third month of pregnancy was found in the mothers of multi malformed cases and of anencephalic fetuses, though these possible associations were based only on two-two cases. Second, control newborn infants without any defect born to mothers with or without <b>moroxydine</b> treatment were compared. A somewhat larger mean birth weight (3. 532 ± 426 vs. 3. 276 ± 511, adjusted t = 1. 8; p = 0. 07) and a reduction of low birth weight (0 vs. 9. 2 %) was found in control newborn infants of the mothers with <b>moroxydine</b> treatment. The weak teratogenic potential and some birth weight promotion effect of <b>moroxydine</b> treatment during pregnancy may deserve some attention...|$|E
40|$|Through field experiments, {{which were}} {{conducted}} in Zhaodong County of Heilongjiang Province, Zhulou County of Henan Province and Jurong County of Jiangsu Province, the degradation dynamics of <b>moroxydine</b> hydrochloride in rice plant and field water were investigated. The detection was performed by tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization in positive mode(ESI+). The {{results showed that the}} average recoveries of rice plant and field water at three spiked levels (0. 005, 0. 05, 0. 5 mg·kg - 1) were found in the range of 92. 50 %- 109. 20 % with RSD 6. 10 %- 6. 90 % and 86. 40 %- 107. 2 % with RSD 0. 73 %- 3. 10 %, respectively. Limits of detection(LOD) of plant and water were 0. 005 mg·kg - 1. The degradation kinetic equation showed that the half-life of <b>moroxydine</b> hydrochloride in rice plant and field water was 1. 2 - 4. 7 d, 1. 0 - 3. 5 d, respectively. The <b>moroxydine</b> hydrochloride was proved to be an easily degradable pesticide...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of a novel class of HCV inhibitors is described. The new amidinourea compounds were designed as isosteric analogues of the antiviral drug <b>moroxydine.</b> The two derivatives 11 g and 11 h showed excellent HCV inhibition activity and viability and proved to inhibit a step(s) of the RNA replication. The new compounds have been synthesized in only three synthetic steps from cheap building blocks and in high yields, thus turning to be promising drug candidates {{in the development of}} cheaper HCV treatments...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} liquid chromatography–tandem mass spec-trometry {{method was}} developed for the simultaneous determination of metformin (MET) and pioglitazone (PIO) in dogs. To increase {{the reliability of the}} method, <b>moroxydine</b> (IS- 1) and rosiglitazone (IS- 2) were used as internal standards for MET and PIO, respectively. The analytes were extracted from beagle dog plasma by a one-step protein precipitation. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Phenomenex Synergi POLAR-RP 80 A column (2503 4. 6 mm, 4 mm). The total chromatographic run time was 8. 0 min, with reten-tion times of 3. 0 and 2. 9 min for MET and IS- 1, respectively, and 6. 1 and 4. 9 min for PIO and IS- 2. The lower limit of quantitation values were 2 and 1 ng/mL for MET and PIO, respectively. The re-coveries ranged from 96. 4 to 112. 8 % for MET and 102. 1 to 104. 5 % for PIO...|$|E
40|$|Bamboo mosaic disease occurs {{widely in}} bamboo {{plantation}} in Taiwan. The affected bamboo usually shows mosaic symptoms on leaves. On green bamboo (Bambusa oldhanii), the mosaic symptoms are also observed on young culms and brown streaks may appear on branches and older culms. Symptoms on Taiwan giant bamboo (Dendrocalamus latiflorus) also include brown lesions on interior tissues of shoot and brown streaks on culms and shoot sheath. from twenty counties of Taiwan, eighty three virus isolates were isolated from mosaic affected samples of thirteen bamboo species. Based on host plant reactions they {{were divided into}} two groups. There were eighty isolates in group I, while other three isolates were group II. Those isolates in group I could induce local lesions on Chenopodium spp. and Gomphrena flobosa. In group I, B- 7, B- 17 and B- 1 isolates which isolated from Taipei, Taichung and ingtung, respectively were selected for further characterization. The thermal inactivation point of B- 7 and B- 17 isolates was 75 - 80 C, While that of B- 1 isolate was 80 - 85 C. The dilution end point of B- 7 and B- 17 isolates was 10 - 5 - 10 - 6 and that of B- 1 was 10 - 6 - 10 - 7. All three isolate remained infectious after stored at 24 oc for one month. They were flexuous rod-shaped particles of 500 * 15 nm. There were three isolates in group II. They were isolated from severe necrotic shoot sheath of Taiwan giant bamboo. B- 81 isolate was selected for further studies. It was flexuous rod-shaped particle of 600 - 630 * 15 It induced local lesions on Chenopodium spp. but not on Gomphrena flobosa. The local lesions formed on Chenoppdium spp. Were significantly different from those induced by those isolated in group I. Polyclonal antiserum was produced against group I B- 1 isolate. In ochterlony tests, the results showed that group I B- 1, B- 7, B- 17 isolates and group II B- 81 isolates were serological identity. However, B- 1 isolate was not serologically related to Cymbidium mosaic virus, Cassava common mosaic virus, cactus virus X and Potato virus X. ELISA was used to detect BoMV. A combination of 1 ug/ml of r-globulin and 10 - 3 dilution of enzyme-conjugated r-globulin was the optmium condition for ELISA test. Under which, it could detect purified BoMV at concentration of 100 ng/ml. Bamboo mosaic virus distributed unevenly in different parts of bamboo shoot. Concentrations of bamboo mosaic virus also differed in different leaf position or leaf parts. The contents of BoMV in leaves of green bamboo and Taiwan giant bamboo rised from July and reached a maximum on November. The virus could survive in roots of green bamboo for 6 weeks. The enzyme-conjugated immunoglobulin prepared by maleimide method was 5. 5 fold more sensitive than that of the conjugated immunoglobulin prepared by glutaraldehyde method. It could detect the BoMV at the concentration of 10 ng/ml. Antiviral chemicals idoxuridine, amantading, <b>moroxydine</b> and ribavirin have been incorported into green bamboo shoottip culture medium to eradicate BoMV. The result showed that applying ribavirin at concentra- tion of 20 - 100 ug/ml could obtain 7 - 46 % BoMV-free bud. However, applying ribavirin at 100 ug/ml appeared to be slightly phytotoxic to green bamboo culture. The growth rate of bud in culture was decreased. 竹嵌紋病普遍發生於臺灣各地竹園，除造成葉片嵌紋病徵外，尚會在綠竹上引起竹稈 嵌紋及褐條斑，以及在麻竹上造成竹稈褐色條斑，筍籜出現黑褐色條紋，筍肉內散生 黃色至褐色斑點呈縱向延伸．因而導至罹病竹出筍率降低，同時竹筍木質化，品質不 良． 由臺灣二十個縣市，十三種竹類嵌紋病害標本上分離得到 83 個單斑分離株，又依其在 寄主上的反應差異可歸納兩類，第一類共八十個分離株屬之，再由此選用台北（代號 B- 7 ） ，台中（B- 17 ），屏東（B- 1 ）三分離株為代表，測試其寄主範圍及理化性質 反應，三者皆能在藜科植物及千日紅葉片形成局部斑，B- 7 、B- 17 、B- 1 三者之稀釋終 點分別為 （圖表省略） 而耐熱性則分別為 75 ∼ 80 ℃， 75 ∼ 80 ℃，及 80 ∼ 85 ℃， 24 ℃下三者之活性皆可維持一 個以上．病毒粒子形態三者大小皆為 500 × 15 nm， 屬相同病毒．第二類共有三分離株 屬之,主要來自麻竹以代號B- 81 為代表，其寄主範圍和第一類所不同處為不感染千日 紅，但皆感染番杏，在奎藜上斑點形態也相異．病毒粒子形態雖然亦為絲狀，較第一 類為長，大小為 600 ∼ 630 × 15 nm． 選用南部分離株B- 1 為代表，純化病毒為抗原製備抗血清，以此抗血清對B- 1 、B- 7 、 B- 17 及B- 18 進行瓊脂雙擴散反應測試，發現對不同分離株之抗原皆能產生相互融合而 無spur的沈降帶出現，由上述所得結果，認為B- 81 應為BoMV的麻竹系統．另外以同樣 方法以B- 1 抗血清測試同屬PVX 群的Cymbidium mosaic virus, Cassava common mosaic virus, Cactus virus X 及Potato virus X等四種Potexvirus群病毒，並 無抗原抗體反應出現，而知本病毒異於此四種potexvirus． ELISA 試驗，以純化免疫球蛋白濃度 1 ug/m 1 連抗體稀釋 （圖表省略） 倍之反應條件最適當，有效偵測到 100 ug/m 1 濃度之嵌紋病毒，而田間竹類病葉汁液雖 稀釋至 （圖表省略） 倍在波長 405 nm 下尚有吸收值．綠竹、麻竹不同葉序，以及同一葉序的不同部位組織 中的嵌紋病毒含量雖然有所差異．但尚不至於影響ELISA 對病毒的偵測．罹病綠竹、 麻竹的各部位病毒含量也各不相同，用 1, 000 倍稀釋連抗體偵測 150 支筍的結果， 病毒檢出率以筍尖之 70 ％∼ 78 ％及筍芽 56 ％∼ 65 ％∼較高，無病徵筍肉最低僅 5 ％∼ 10 ％，一年中罹病綠竹、麻竹葉片中嵌紋病毒含量變化由 7 月急速上升，至 11 月達到 最高．為了將來罹病竹園的更新所需，測試本病毒在綠竹根系中殘存時間為六週．調 查本省 15 屬， 62 （品）種竹類中，有 2 屬， 14 種受嵌紋病毒為害．且以篷萊竹屬的 13 種居大多數．為了要改進目前所採用的戊二醛標誌抗體易造成相互結合的缺失，以便 提高對莖頂組織培養所得培植體中，所含微量病毒之偵測，利用馬來西工胺法製備所 得鹼性磷酸連抗體使用雙層抗體連反應比較時，其靈敏度高出目前的戊二醛法所 製連體 5. 5 倍，且前者能偵測之病毒濃度下限可達 10 ng/m 1 ，而後者僅至 100 ng/m 1 ．不同濃度之四種抗病毒藥劑idoxuridine ，amantadine，moroxydine及ribavirin 添加於綠竹莖頂組織培養之培養基中以治療組織中之竹嵌紋病毒，結果僅ribavirin 一種從 20 ug/m 1 有治療效果，其效果隨ribavirin 濃度之增加及培養時間之延長，其 無毒率亦可由 7 ％增加到 46 ％．但是當vibavirin 濃度達到 100 ug/m 1 ，則對培植體有 輕微抑制植株伸長之毒化作用，導至芽的生長速率減緩． ///////目錄 壹、緒言 貳、往昔研究 參、材料與方法 肆、結果 伍、討論 陸、引用文獻 柒、中文摘要 捌、英文摘要 玖、附...|$|E
