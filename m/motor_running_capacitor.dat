50|$|Run {{capacitors}} {{are designed}} for continuous duty while the motor is powered, which is why electrolytic capacitors are avoided, and low-loss polymer capacitors are used. Run capacitors are mostly polypropylene film capacitors and are energized the entire time the <b>motor</b> is <b>running.</b> Run <b>capacitors</b> are rated {{in a range of}} 1.5 to 100 µF, with voltage classifications of 370 V or 440 V.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the value of <b>running</b> <b>capacitor</b> on the {{performance}} of a single-phase induction motor is studied through the evaluation of the efficiency, power factor and vibration of the machine for different values of this capacitor choosing unsuitable value of the <b>running</b> <b>capacitor</b> worsen the performance of the motor and it may even damage the motor as a consequence of increasing auxiliary winding current. In this research, a computer program has been developed for finding an optimum <b>running</b> <b>capacitor</b> for the induction motor. Experimental results has been obtained in the laboratory and compared with the computer results for validation. The {{effect of the}} <b>running</b> <b>capacitor</b> on <b>motor</b> vibration has also been obtained and measured. Although this study was performed on a certain two-phase induction motor, the same developed computer program may be used to obtain the optimum value of the <b>running</b> <b>capacitor</b> for any single phase IM of known parameters. </p...|$|R

5000|$|By 1929, Victor {{were making}} three models of bonnetted van, all with similar basic dimensions, but differing in {{the length of}} the rear storage area. They were 5 ft wide, with a {{wheelbase}} of 10 ft. The Model A was designed for a 20 cwt payload, and formed the basis for a number of vans supplied to the General Post Office in 1929. It came with a [...] <b>motor</b> <b>running</b> at 48 volts. The Model B had a larger [...] <b>motor</b> <b>running</b> at 40 volts, and was supplied with a 192 Amp-hour battery as standard, but extra batteries could be fitted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, which carried 23 cwt. The Model C was the largest, with a [...] <b>motor</b> <b>running</b> at 80 volts. The batteries under the bonnet were supplemented by others which were either mounted under the driver's seat, or at the rear. The payload was 30 cwt. In 1931 they introduced a 27 cwt vehicle designed for the Dairy industry, with forward control and a walk-through cab having no doors. The 40-cell, 168 Ahr battery, manufactured by D P Kathanode, was located over the front axle, and supplied current to a Metro-Vick motor. The vehicle was designed to be driven while standing up, with the controls only enabled when the driver was standing on a spring-loaded floor button. The controls were also interlocked with the hand brake.|$|R
