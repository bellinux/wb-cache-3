Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding.

Cells respond by switching to anaerobic <b>metabolism,</b> causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative <b>metabolism.</b>|$|E

"May 2012 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Sulfur is a central element in deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems, and many thermophiles isolated from these environments have sulfur-based <b>metabolisms.</b> However, it is not known what role organic sulfur compounds might play in deep-sea vent microbial ecology. Geochemical models are used to predict fluid compositions resulting from mixing of end-member hydrothermal fluids from the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) with bottom seawater. These fluid compositions combined with estimated activities of dimethylsulfide and methanethiol are used to evaluate the potential for organic sulfur-based <b>metabolisms</b> under hydrothermal conditions. The transition temperature at which aerobic <b>metabolisms</b> outcompete anaerobic <b>metabolisms</b> varies (from ~ 75 ˚C to > 200 ˚C) with end-member vent fluid chemistry. Aerobic respiration has the highest energy yields (> 575 kJ/mol C) at lower temperatures, while anaerobic <b>metabolisms</b> such as sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are favored at higher temperatures (~ 100 ˚C to 200 ˚C). Enrichment cultures targeting organic sulfur-based <b>metabolisms</b> inoculated with ELSC chimney slurries were successfully established. The cultures contained species of Thermococcales, ε-Proteobacteria, Thermales, and Aquificales as well as 2 novel bacterial sequences. These data suggest that organic sulfur-based <b>metabolisms</b> may be viable within deep-sea hydrothermal vents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background More {{and more}} {{completely}} sequenced fungal genomes are becoming available {{and many more}} sequencing projects are in progress. This deluge of data should improve {{our knowledge of the}} various primary and secondary <b>metabolisms</b> of Fungi, including their synthesis of useful compounds such as antibiotics or toxic molecules such as mycotoxins. Functional annotation of many fungal genomes is imperfect, especially of genes encoding enzymes, so we need dedicated tools to analyze their metabolic pathways in depth. Description FUNGIpath is a new tool built using a two-stage approach. Groups of orthologous proteins predicted using complementary methods of detection were collected in a relational database. Each group was further mapped on to steps in the metabolic pathways published in the public databases KEGG and MetaCyc. As a result, FUNGIpath allows the primary and secondary <b>metabolisms</b> of the different fungal species represented in the database to be compared easily, making it possible to assess the level of specificity of various pathways at different taxonomic distances. It is freely accessible at [URL]. Conclusions As more and more fungal genomes are expected to be sequenced during the coming years, FUNGIpath should help progressively to reconstruct the ancestral primary and secondary <b>metabolisms</b> of the main branches of the fungal tree of life and to elucidate the evolution of these ancestral fungal <b>metabolisms</b> to various specific derived <b>metabolisms.</b> </p...|$|R

5|$|Carbon <b>metabolism</b> in {{bacteria}} {{is either}} heterotrophic, where organic carbon compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy <b>metabolism</b> of bacteria is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E
