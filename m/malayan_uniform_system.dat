40|$|We {{define a}} family of Distributed Hash Table systems whose aim is to combine routing {{efficiency}} of the randomized networks — i. e. average path length O(log n / log log n) vs. the O(log n) average path length of the deterministic system — with the programmability and startup efficiency of a <b>uniform</b> <b>system</b> — that is {{a system in which}} the overlay network is transitive, and greedy routing is optimal. It is known that Ω(log n) is a lower bound to the average path length for <b>uniform</b> <b>systems</b> with O(log n) degree. The proposed family is parameterized with a positive integer c which measures the amount of randomness that is used. Indeed, edges are partitioned into c equivalence classes. Varying the value c, the system goes from the deterministic case (c = 1) to an “almost <b>uniform</b> ” <b>system.</b> Increasing c to relatively low values allows routing with optimal average path length while retaining most of the advantages of a <b>uniform</b> <b>system,</b> such as easy programmability and quick bootstrap of the nodes entering the system. We also provide a matching lower bound for the average path length of the family of routing schemes for any c. Moreover, we show how to extend the result to other overlay networks. ...|$|R
