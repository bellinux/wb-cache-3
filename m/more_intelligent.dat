5|$|Stratton wrote Social Psychology for International Conduct {{for social}} science {{teachers}} {{who wanted to}} use psychology to analyze international affairs. The book's first part evaluated races. Stratton concluded the Caucasoid and Mongoloid races were innately <b>more</b> <b>intelligent</b> enabling them to build strong cultures. He also stated the prejudice of other people was from {{the social and political}} advantages it brought. Stratton saw nations as made up of individuals and possessing a national character similar to what individuals had. Reviewing the book in the American Journal of Sociology, Ellsworth Faris objected to the author concluding the Northern and Central Europeans were <b>more</b> <b>intelligent</b> than Southern and Eastern Europeans, noting intelligence measures correlated also with length of stay in America.|$|E
5|$|Close to Lakefield and off {{the road}} in their own {{enclosure}} were three dwellings known as Lakefield Cottages. Mr. Rogerson, a gardener and caretaker at Lakefield, lived {{in one of the}} cottages, and eventually his wife's two pedigree Pomeranians– Darkie and Duchess– would become the models for Potter's fictional Duchess. Darkie had a fine black mane, but Duchess was <b>more</b> <b>intelligent</b> and could sit up with a lump of sugar balanced on her nose.|$|E

Additionally, fancy rats are quite independent, loyal and easily trained, earning them comparison to both cats and dogs. This comparison is merited given fancy rats are considered <b>more</b> <b>intelligent</b> than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E

An unknown {{creature}} attacks and kills the boat crew, forcing Ben to detach the line; he and Eric drift towards the island. On the mainland, Dr. Alan Grant has become famous after his involvement at Jurassic Park, while Ellie Sattler is married and has two children. Grant discusses with Sattler how raptors are far <b>more</b> <b>intelligent</b> than they had previously believed. At a dig site, Grant's assistant, Billy Brennan, demonstrates how he can use a 3D printer to replicate a Velociraptor larynx.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few <b>more</b> <b>intelligent</b> did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{legacies}} of colonial rule in Kasai was the arbitrary redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite the shared language (Tshiluba) {{and culture of the}} two groups, colonial administrators believed the inhabitants of the Lulua river area to be ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be <b>more</b> <b>intelligent,</b> hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and stupid. As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.|$|E

5|$|StarCraft {{focuses around}} three {{distinct}} interstellar species: the psionic Protoss, the adaptable Terrans, and the insectoid Zerg. The game revolves around players collecting resources {{to construct a}} base, upgrade their militaries, and ultimately conquer opponents. Brood Wars gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged from that of StarCraft, although it made small alterations to unit costs and some abilities, and added some new units. These changes make rushing tactics—a factor that gained some criticism in the original StarCraft—less practical. The single-player campaign has an increased difficulty; missions are no longer entirely linear, and a greater focus on strategy is needed to complete missions. In addition, the game's artificial intelligence (AI) has been augmented so that AI-controlled players are <b>more</b> <b>intelligent</b> and tend to use tactics more effectively.|$|E
5|$|EA debuted {{the game}} at the 2003 E3 event in May, announcing that {{compared}} to Two Towers, Return of the King had more playable characters, larger and less linear levels, multiple narrative paths, bigger and <b>more</b> <b>intelligent</b> bosses, interactive environments, and a co-op mode. Footage from the films and parts of Howard Shore's score would feature, {{and members of the}} film's cast would lend their voices and likenesses to the game. On 15 May, a playable demo was made available for the PS2, featuring the first Minas Tirith level along with a non-playable demo of the co-op gameplay in a customized level specifically designed for E3. EA also revealed they were working on having Gollum as a playable character, although this ultimately did not happen, except in the GBA version.|$|E
5|$|The {{tenure of}} Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger as Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee {{was set to}} expire in May 1966, and a {{replacement}} had to be selected from the service chiefs. The Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, had among defence and military circles been assumed to be the natural successor. However, mounting speculation arose from late 1965 over who was to be selected for the position as it became known Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies preferred McNicoll for the post, as did Secretary of the Department of Defence Sir Ted Hicks, who thought McNicoll <b>more</b> <b>intelligent</b> and objective than his army counterpart. McNicoll lobbied ardently for the position, and was supported by his wife, Frances, who actively campaigned on her husband's behalf. By December 1965, Scherger's replacement had still not been decided upon and Menzies chose to delay the decision until the new year. However, Menzies retired in January 1966 and was succeeded by his deputy, Harold Holt. Holt and the newly appointed Minister for Defence, Allen Fairhall, preferred Wilton and ultimately selected him to succeed Scherger. In any event, McNicoll was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1966 New Year Honours for his service as CNS.|$|E
