Both transmit continuous real-time images; one {{shows the}} paleontology {{lab at the}} Condon Center and the other depicts Sheep Rock and nearby features. In June 2011, work was finished on a new ranger residence in the Painted Hills Unit that makes the unit almost carbon-neutral. Solar panels generate enough electricity to power the house {{as well as the}} ranger's electric vehicle, on loan from its manufacturer for a year. The project is part of ongoing efforts to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> park carbon-neutral.|$|E
5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E

25|$|Natural gas {{has been}} used {{almost as long as}} crude oil in Canada, but its {{commercial}} development was not as rapid.

25|$|The {{industrial}} web {{theory was}} {{based on the idea that}} the economic strength of an industrial nation is composed of interdependent sectors such as manufacturing, mining, utilities and transportation. Any one of the sectors could be targeted with bombs to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> system suffer breakdowns and shortages. From 1935, instructors such as Robert M. Webster and Muir S. Fairchild at ACTS studied the industrial interdependence of the United States as a model for targeting an aggressor enemy state. They drew up lists of optimal targets that would produce the greatest disruption for the least expenditure of bombs. Transportation and electric power industries were seen as vital targets, as well as iron ore mining and steel manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|On these central {{invasion}} beaches, it {{was vital}} that the Canadians hold the Casino as its capture would <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the shoreline untenable. When {{the signal to}} withdraw was sent and the time arrived, The Royal Navy started to move in to extricate the Canadians and the RAF began to lay smoke. Flights of LCAs and LCM(Mk 1)s came in and suffered heavy casualties but the Royal Navy managed to extricate several hundred Canadian troops before the Canadians withdrew from the Casino and the beach became impossible to defend. At 12:20, the Naval Force Commander gave the order to stop the evacuation as the beach was virtually all in enemy hands. The German garrison ceased firing at 13:58 after LCA 186, the last craft to return from Dieppe, quit the beach.|$|E
500|$|Minear {{initially}} {{had trouble}} conceptualizing his idea, noting that [...] "it {{might be a}} good idea for a short story, but how do you <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing work visually?" [...] To combat this issue, Minear decided to make the remote viewer blind. He sought to make the blind woman [...] "not Audrey Hepburn", a reference to the 1967 film Wait Until Dark, in which Hepburn played the part of an innocent but terrorized blind woman. He later said, [...] "I wanted to make [...] a bitch, because the fact is that disability doesn't necessarily ennoble a person." [...] After several meetings with fellow writers John Shiban, Vince Gilligan, and Frank Spotnitz—who provided storyboard support—Minear was allowed to begin work on the episode.|$|E

500|$|From late 1936 to 1939 Trenchard {{spent much}} of his time {{travelling}} overseas on behalf of the companies who employed him as a director. [...] During one visit to Germany in the summer of 1937, he was hosted at a dinner by Hermann Göring, the Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe. [...] Although the evening started in a cordial fashion, it ended in Göring's opinion that [...] "one day German might will <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world tremble". [...] Trenchard replied that Göring [...] "must be off his head". [...] In 1937 Newall was appointed Chief of the Air Staff and Trenchard did not hesitate in criticising the new air chief. [...] As an ardent supporter of the bomber, Trenchard found much to disagree with in the air expansion programme, its emphasis on defensive fighter aircraft. [...] Trenchard took to writing directly to the Cabinet and eventually Newall was reduced to imploring Trenchard to exercise some discretion. [...] Trenchard offered his services to the Government on at least two occasions but they were not accepted.|$|E
500|$|In {{his early}} short fiction, Gibson is {{credited}} by Rapatzikou in The Literary Encyclopedia with effectively [...] "renovating" [...] science fiction, a genre {{at that time}} considered widely [...] "insignificant", influencing {{by means of the}} postmodern aesthetic of his writing the development of new perspectives in science fiction studies. In the words of filmmaker Marianne Trench, Gibson's visions [...] "struck sparks in the real world" [...] and [...] "determined the way people thought and talked" [...] to an extent unprecedented in science fiction literature. The publication of Neuromancer (1984) hit a cultural nerve, causing Larry McCaffery to credit Gibson with virtually launching the cyberpunk movement, as [...] "the one major writer who is original and gifted to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> movement seem original and gifted." [...] Aside from their central importance to cyberpunk and steampunk fiction, Gibson's fictional works have been hailed by space historian Dwayne A. Day as some of the best examples of space-based science fiction (or [...] "solar sci-fi"), and [...] "probably the only ones that rise above mere escapism to be truly thought-provoking".|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, the Al Green-styled [...] "Thinking of You", was {{one that}} the group {{conceived}} and recorded together at 3 a.m. in Saadiq's Pookie Labs studio. As he remembered it, [...] "I was just playing around and started singing {{off the top of}} my head. I never wrote anything down, it was just what came out." [...] "Annie May", one of Wiggins' songs for House of Music, had Saadiq's backing vocals pre-recorded and then overdubbed to the track's final mix. One of Saadiq's songs for the album, [...] "Me and the Blind Man", was excluded from the final mix because, as Saadiq told Yahoo! Music, [...] "they didn't want anybody playing favorites, so one of my songs had to come off." [...] The recording was a moody blues piece with surrealistic lyrics about lust, longing, and a fictitious blind man's secret powers. Saadiq wanted to show [...] "a darker side... some depth" [...] to listeners with the song. [...] "To me songs like 'Blind Man,' <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> sound, the House of Music", he remarked. It was featured on an album sampler sent by the group's label to music journalists.|$|E

500|$|WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth and WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain {{received}} more positive reviews from both IGN and GameSpot, {{both of whom}} cited the expanded season mode as an improvement, although flaws were still visible in the mode. It improved from the previous three WWF SmackDown! games, as {{it was written by}} actual WWE storyline writers. Both games also featured generic music, though the quality of it had improved. Shut Your Mouth featured little improvement to the commentary, which was then removed completely from Here Comes the Pain. WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW received a more positive review than previous games, as GameShark stated that it was [...] "a wonderful new edition to the SmackDown! family, serving up slick graphics, vastly enhanced gameplay, and lots of other bells and whistles that <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> package shine." [...] WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 received a positive review and a 9.2/10 rating by IGN due to the additions of matches, the General Manager mode, and the ability to defend championships in exhibition mode. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 {{received more}} negative reviews due to lack of an appealing season mode and little improvement of features, with the exceptions of the [...] "Ultimate Control moves," [...] "Struggle system," [...] and the ECW Extreme Rules matches.|$|E
500|$|Empire City was {{designed}} to marry with Cole's new-found superpowers. The city was built with a [...] "crime ecosystem", where petty crimes or calls for help were always occurring outside of the main story, requiring the player to decide to stop to help or not to resolve them. A portion of the team was devoted to implementing {{the behavior of the}} citizens of the city and how that behavior would change as the state of the city altered due to the player's actions. Climbing buildings was considered to be an important aspect of the game, both as part of the superhero motif and because it was considered [...] "fun to do", and Sucker Punch set out to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> city climbable. Many details of every building have been modeled to allow the player to climb the buildings, [...] "down to the last window frame, lighting sconce and storefront", however, Fox noted that getting the climbing system [...] "just right" [...] was the most challenging aspect of development. One employee was dedicated to making sure the entire city was climbable. Fleming noted that during Infamous's development, both Crackdown and Assassin's Creed, two games with alternative takes on the climbing aspect, were released; the team felt that each of the games' climbing systems had their own strengths and weaknesses. To reflect the nature of change of the city as the player interacts with it—either restoring power or taking it away—the developers created a [...] "deferred shading" [...] rendering engine that would render the effects of moving and damaged light sources.|$|E
500|$|Henkes and Bindervoet {{generally}} summarise {{the critical}} consensus when they argue that, between the thematically indicative {{opening and closing}} chapters, the book concerns [...] "two big questions" [...] which are never resolved: {{what is the nature}} of protagonist HCE’s secret sin, and what was the letter, written by his wife ALP, about? HCE's unidentifiable sin has most generally been interpreted as representing man's original sin as a result of the Fall of Man. Anthony Burgess sees HCE, through his dream, trying [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of history swallow up his guilt for him" [...] and to this end [...] "HCE has, so deep in his sleep, sunk to a level of dreaming in which he has become a collective being rehearsing the collective guilt of man." [...] Fargnoli and Gillespie argue that although undefined, [...] "Earwicker's alleged crime in the Park" [...] appears to have been of a [...] "voyeuristic, sexual, or scatological nature". [...] ALP's letter appears a number of times throughout the book, in a number of different forms, and as its contents cannot be definitively delineated, it is usually believed to be both an exoneration of HCE, and an indictment of his sin. Herring argues that [...] "he effect of ALP's letter is precisely the opposite of her intent [...] the more ALP defends her husband in her letter, the more scandal attaches to him." [...] Patrick A. McCarthy argues that [...] "it is appropriate that the waters of the Liffey, representing Anna Livia, are washing away the evidence of Earwicker's sins as [...] for (they tell us) she takes on her husband's guilt and redeems him; alternately she is tainted with his crimes and regarded as an accomplice".|$|E

On August 3, 2010, Bain claimed that [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{is one of the}} videos that should have been nominated for Video of the Year at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, and she later said on September 8, 2010, that the clip for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] should have been nominated instead that of [...] "Video Phone", in the category for Best Female Video at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] also made number nine in Rap-Ups Best Videos of 2010. In February 2012, Kat George of VH1 placed the video at number one on her list of [...] "The 6 Best Sets of Devastated Raccoon Eyes in Music Video History", writing, [...] "Beyoncé wins best panda eyes on the strength of melodrama... and because she looks really hot in vintage style lingerie.
