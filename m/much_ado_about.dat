5|$|Tracy and Hepburn reunited {{on screen}} {{for the first}} time in five years for the office-based comedy Desk Set (1957). Berg notes that it worked as a hybrid of their earlier romantic-comedy successes and Hepburn's {{spinster}} persona, but it performed poorly at the box-office. That summer, Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice in <b>Much</b> <b>Ado</b> <b>About</b> Nothing. The shows were positively received.|$|E
5|$|Gielgud {{continued}} to try, without much success, {{to find new}} plays that suited him as an actor, but his direction of Peter Shaffer's first play, Five Finger Exercise (1958), received acclaim.

Most of the New York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan's The Browning Version for CBS and N C Hunter's A Day by the Sea for ITV. He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television {{over the next four}} decades.|$|E

5|$|Kathrin Romary Beckinsale (born 26 July 1973) is an English actress.

She followed those with appearances in The Aviator (2004) and Click (2006).|$|E
5|$|Subsequent names, {{rather than}} {{continuing}} the airy spirits theme (only Puck and Mab continued the trend), {{have focused on}} Herschel's source material. In 1949, the fifth moon, Miranda, was named by its discoverer Gerard Kuiper after a thoroughly mortal character in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The current IAU practice is to name moons after characters from Shakespeare's plays and The Rape of the Lock (although at present only Ariel, Umbriel, and Belinda have names drawn from the latter; all the rest are from Shakespeare). At first, the outermost moons were all named after characters from one play, The Tempest; but with Margaret being named from <b>Much</b> <b>Ado</b> <b>About</b> Nothing that trend has ended.|$|E
