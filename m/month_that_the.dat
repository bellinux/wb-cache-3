5|$|Kane's {{style of}} play has been {{compared}} to that of former Tottenham forward Jürgen Klinsmann, a comparison Kane called flattering in February 2015. In March 2015, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke named Kane as the benchmark for clubs producing young English players. Shearer said that <b>month</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> three best strikers playing in the league were Kane, Diego Costa and Sergio Agüero. In November 2015, a writer for the Daily Mail theorised that Kane could be the striker in a spine of Tottenham players in the England team, alongside Eric Dier and Dele Alli.|$|E

As {{part of this}} reduction, Nos.76 and 82 Squadrons were slated for disbandment, leaving No.77 Squadron as the sole RAAF fighter unit in the country. No.82 Squadron conducted further training and exercises until September, and was disbanded at Iwakuni on 29October 1948.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Primosole Bridge {{did not lead}} to the {{expected}} rapid advance, as by this time the Germans had gathered their forces and established a defensive line. It was not until early the following <b>month</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Eighth Army captured Catania. By this time the 1st Parachute Brigade had been withdrawn to Malta and took no further part in the conquest of Sicily.

5|$|It was {{reported}} the following <b>month</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> developer {{was planning to}} create the game for Sony's PlayStation 2, perhaps {{to coincide with the}} console's release. Ultimately, however, the developer became involved with Sega's Dreamcast through Visual Concepts—a Sega developer in charge of third-party game development. Johnson and Voorsanger began development of the third game with the intention to re-make ToeJam & Earl; according to Johnson, the game would include the same elements as the first game, but with improved graphics. However, this notion was curtailed by Visual Concepts, who felt that the result would be too old-fashioned, and too niche in appeal. Johnson later said that he was unsure, at the time, whether to cater to fans who wanted a remake of the original or attempt to capture a new audience.|$|E
5|$|During 1982, the U.S. Army {{initiated}} the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) {{program with the}} aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter. During October 1988, it was revealed that two separate teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's name had been changed from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). During April 1991, the U.S. Army decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeing–Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and evaluation phase. It was in that same <b>month</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> helicopter received its official designation, that being RAH-66 Comanche, issued by the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|Key staff {{recruited}} {{to work at}} Fort Halstead included John Challens, who commenced on 1 January 1948. By mid-1948, {{it became clear that}} Penney's initial estimate that he would require 220 staff was wide of the mark, and that he would need nearly 500. This meant not only taking personnel from other projects, but scrapping some entirely. In October 1948, Penney submitted a request for developing a new, separate site for HER on grounds of safety, security and economy. This was approved, but it took another six months to locate a suitable site. An airbase, RAF South Cerney in Gloucestershire was chosen, but the RAF refused to relinquish the site. A former airbase, RAF Aldermaston, was then selected. At the same time, it was decided to separate HER from the Armaments Research Establishment (ARE). This resulted in a painful bureaucratic battle over personnel like Challens, whose expertise was wanted for research on both nuclear weapons and guided missiles. In the end, HER kept 25 of the 30 key personnel that ARE wanted, including Challens. The site was taken over on 1 April 1950. Penney became Chief Superintendent High Explosive Research (CSHER). The first stage of work at Aldermaston was completed in December 1951, but the plutonium processing building was only handed over in April 1952, the <b>month</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first plutonium was due to arrive from Windscale. At the peak of construction in 1953, over 4,000 personnel were working on the site.|$|E

From 1941 to 1945, the USO hosted 35,000 uniformed visitors a week. Recently renovated with sensitivity to its historic character, the Hannah Block Historic USO (HBHUSO) lobby serves as a museum where World War II memorabilia and other artifacts are displayed. The building itself was rededicated in Ms. Block's name in 2006 and restored to its 1943 wartime character in 2008. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The World War II Wilmington Home Front Heritage Coalition, an all volunteer 501(c)(3) preservation organization, is the de facto preservationist of the building's history and maintains the home front museum.|$|E
25|$|Columbushaus was {{completed}} and opened in January 1933, the same <b>month</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) came to power. Hitler had big plans for Berlin, to {{transform it into}} the Welthauptstadt (World Capital) Germania, to be realised by his architect friend Albert Speer (1905–81). Under these plans the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz would have got off fairly lightly, although the Potsdamer Bahnhof (and the Anhalter Bahnhof a short distance away) would have lost their function. The new North-South Axis, the linchpin of the scheme, would have severed their approach tracks, leaving both termini stranded {{on the wrong side}} of it. All trains arriving in Berlin would have run into either of two vast new stations located on the Ringbahn to the north and south of the centre respectively, to be known as Nordbahnhof (North Station) and Südbahnhof (South Station), located at Wedding and Südkreuz. In Speer's plan the former Anhalter Bahnhof was earmarked to become a public swimming pool; the intended fate of the Potsdamer Bahnhof has not been documented.|$|E
