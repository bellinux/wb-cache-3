40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{the hypothesis}} that an inability to fully participate in an immigrant parent’s first language as a <b>minority</b> <b>community</b> <b>language,</b> and associated pressures this can put on the individual’s sense of personal identity and self-esteem, can be a contributing factor to the profound alienation that has been implicated {{in the rise of}} Islamic extremist violence. Studies of Islamic extremism have sought to identify common factors in the backgrounds of self-styled jihadists; however, they have proved to be a fairly heterogeneous group. One factor that stands out is that, in Europe and North America, the so-called home-grown terrorist is frequently a second- or third-generation immigrant. Education in the majority community language and a desire to assimilate not infrequently lead to an incomplete acquisition, and subsequent attrition of a ‘home’ language. This can separate the second/third-generation immigrant from the minority community, while discrimination forms a barrier to acceptance by the majority community. This paper briefly examines some of the background literature in Applied Linguistics and Counter Terrorism Studies, before turning to sources that tend to support the hypothesis. Finally, a case is made for further study and some possible approaches suggested...|$|E

40|$|With {{more than}} 64, 500 members, the Bangladeshi {{community}} in London {{is one of}} the largest in the UK. Originating from a wave of immigration during the 1970 s, a considerable part of the community now consists of a second, UK-born generation. This explorative study seeks to address, first, the extent of the intergenerational language shift from Bangla to English, and second, the patterns in Ethnolinguistic Vitality (EV) perceptions amongst a group of educated second-generation Bangladeshis. This study is located within the theoretical framework of EV. A questionnaire was used to elicit information on language usage patterns and perceptions of EV. The results suggest a strong shift from a very Bangla-centric first generation to a second generation that shows strong preferences for the use of English across all communicative domains. Bangla language maintenance seems to play a limited role even in the home/family domain – a domain that has traditionally been seen as a stronghold of <b>minority</b> <b>community</b> <b>languages.</b> This raises issues with regard to heritage language transmission from the second to the third generation...|$|R

The research suggests that the arguments in favour of minority language promotion are most widely accepted for the Māori language, followed by New Zealand Sign Language, then Pacific <b>languages,</b> and finally <b>community</b> <b>languages.</b> While representatives of groups at the lower levels of the hierarchy often accept arguments advanced in relation to languages nearer the top, {{this is not the case}} in the other direction.

40|$|In {{recent years}} British {{education}} policy for school-aged children has stressed an inclusive agenda for all. For pupils from ethnic/linguistic minorities {{this means that}} {{they are to be}} included in the underdefined but unproblematically imagined ‘mainstream’ educational processes, where all students should be enabled to benefit from the publicly funded educational provision. (For a collection of policy statements, see for example, DES 1985; SCAA 1996; TTA 2000 and QCA 2000.) At the same time there is also recurring anxiety over persistent racism and ethnic minority ‘under-achievement’; these concerns are seen as a manifestation of ‘exclusion’ of minority groups from the rhetorically constructed accessible inclusive whole. And yet, minority languages and cultural practices are often sidelined (for instance, the very peripheral curriculum status conferred on <b>minority</b> <b>community</b> <b>languages).</b> In other words, the mainstream curriculum and educational practices are selectively inclusive and ambiguously exclusive at the same time. This reflects an unresolved tension in both policy discourse and policy analysis. Against this backdrop we discuss how this policy (and discourse) of inclusiveness works out in specific instances of teachers addressing issues of ethnic diversity and language pedagogy for minorities. We focus on two specific aspects of school education policy: multiculturalism and English as an additional language (EAL). The discussion will first look at policy as an interpretive process (and not as a fixed meaning). We then adopt this perspective to discuss some of the ways multiculturalism and EAL policies are interpreted and taken up by teachers involved in two studies (Creese 2001; Davies and Leung 2001). We will reflectively comment on some of the epistemological reasons for the interpretive approach we have adopted at appropriate points in the discussion. We conclude by making some brief comments on professional responses to policy and their implications in terms of future professional development. 17 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{shifting}} terrain of pride, profit and power relations in <b>minority</b> <b>language</b> <b>communities</b> under contemporary globalisation. While “pride” associates linguistic-cultural heritage with identity and preservation, “profit” views these {{as sources of}} economic gain. In contemporary late capitalism, “pride” seems to be increasingly giving way to “profit”. Arguing that this transformation needs to be interrogated in terms of complexity and that a detailed, multilayered semiotic analysis can open a privileged window for such an inquiry, this study combines critical multimodal discourse analysis and an ethnographic approach to analyse processes of semiotic commodification in handicraft production in the indigenous <b>minority</b> <b>language</b> <b>community</b> of the Sámi in northern Lapland. The investigation focuses on the activities of an innovative Sámi artist and entrepreneur, and within these a range of paper notebooks, which are, although designed by the Sámi artist and sold in her handicraft shop in Lapland, produced by women living at the border of Thailand and Laos. The investigation illuminates two critical shifts: how the move towards profit can open up space to contest the ownership of pride within an ethnic community. Second, how this move makes way for new, globalised modes of production of ‘indigenous handicrafts’ and creates global vectors of power, engaged in both empowerment and exploitation, {{in the production of}} both pride and profit. The study thereby contributes {{to the understanding of the}} increasingly complex power relations and the ambivalence and multiple effects of practices constituting the apparent shift from “pride” to “profit”...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} data that consider {{the complexity of}} language interplay involved in <b>minority</b> ethnocultural <b>communities</b> experiencing <b>language</b> shift. A revival of interest in religio-cultural poetry and song, primarily evidenced within the younger generation of Muslim multilinguals of Pakistani-heritage living {{as part of the}} South Asian Diaspora in a northern city of the UK, is encouraging an accompanying interest by the same young people in the community’s prestigious varieties of Urdu, H-Punjabi, and also in its religious classical, Arabic. What this might mean for reversing language shift is considered together with the extra but associated question of the use of English (Yish) in religio-cultural practices traditionally carried out in <b>community</b> <b>languages.</b> Particular attention is given to the way Web 2. 0 platforms are increasingly providing real and virtual networks for these young practitioners in the exploration of the languages of their songs and poems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we expand our {{understanding}} of language endangerment by shifting the focus from small <b>language</b> <b>communities</b> to <b>minority</b> <b>language</b> <b>communities</b> with speaker populations in the millions. We argue for a methodological shift toward examining language shift scenarios more broadly and quantitatively for two main reasons: 1) {{it is becoming increasingly}} clear that a large speaker population does not protect against language shift (Anderbeck 2013); 2) we need to make a distinction between the symptoms and the causes of language shift, where factors such as a dwindling number of child speakers should be seen as symptoms of language shift that are caused by other factors (Himmelmann 2010). In this paper we use Indonesia as a case study and analyze a sample of the 2010 census. We treat language choice as a sociolinguistic variable and analyze the correlation between six social factors and language choice (local languages vs. the national language, Indonesian). These results provide a starting point for creating more comprehensive models of the sociolinguistics of language shift...|$|R

40|$|Many <b>minority</b> <b>language</b> <b>communities</b> in Southeast Asia use the segment-based Latin alphabet. In {{order to}} provide ease of {{literacy}} acquisition, national governments may encourage or {{require the use of}} the partially segmental, partially syllable-oriented Brahmi-based national syllabet in minority literacy development. Evidence from research on biliteracy in other languages and scripts suggests that alphabetic reading skills provide a strong foundation for learning to read a syllabet once a threshold of linguistic competency has been reached. Use of the mother tongue for early literacy also supports successful learning through strong home-school relationships. This study suggests that secondary orthographies based on national or dominant scripts for school-based literacy may not support and possibly even inhibit literacy acquisition due to motivational sociolinguistic factors. Research to confirm these findings specifically in the Southeast Asian context is still needed...|$|R
50|$|The {{requirement}} for considerable interest was interpreted in Saulnier v.

In Professional Institute of the Public Service v.
