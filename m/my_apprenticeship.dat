30|$|During <b>my</b> {{linguistic}} <b>apprenticeship</b> in Copenhagen {{under the}} direction of the celebrated Louis Hjelmslev (1899 – 1965), one of the most zealously defended tenets of the extreme structuralist brand of linguistics known as ‘glossematics’ was that one never should indulge in ‘squinting grammar’. This term, whose origin goes back to another famous Danish linguist, Otto Jespersen, was used to methodologically disqualify those linguists who looked at one language when describing another. Typically, this was the case in what used to be called ‘school grammar’, where the Latin terms for the various cases (nominative, accusative, and so on) were uncritically transferred to languages that either had no such morphological formations (or at most, very few). This was how the English, Scandinavian, or German substantive forms ending in -s, came to be called ‘genitives’, whereas pronominal forms such as English me, Danish mig, Norwegian meg, German mir and mich could be described as either datives or accusatives, inasmuch as they corresponded to the Latin and Greek forms with the same function: mihi or me, (e)moi or (e)me.|$|R

A boy on The Road, on the other hand, no matter how green he is, is never a gay-cat; he is a road-kid or a [...] "punk," [...] and if he travels with a [...] "profesh," [...] he is known possessively as a [...] "prushun."

But closer acquaintance on the part of those that suspected me quickly disabused their minds, and in a short time I acquired the unmistakable airs and ear-marks of the blowed-in-the-glass profesh. And be it known, here and now, that the profesh are the aristocracy of The Road.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this MPhil in Performance Practice Research was to investigate Karolos Koun and the Hellenic Art Theatre via Stanislavsky’s work and influence, in order to reveal potential relationships through practice-based labour. This was done {{with a view to}} developing a contemporary actor-training approach for modern staging of ancient Hellenic drama. This research explores through fieldwork interviews, existing scholarship and practical investigation Karolos Koun’s approach to the actor, acting and actor training, in relation to Stanislavsky and contemporary Hellenic theatre practice. I have drawn on <b>my</b> own <b>apprenticeship</b> as a student and my professional experience as an actor, teacher, director and researcher. Based on these areas, my intention was to investigate and reveal the Koun – Stanislavsky relationship (connections, influences, similarities, differences, material and tools usage), both theoretically and practically, supported by interviews I conducted about Koun and the Art Theatre practices he evolved, with people involved with Koun and the Art Theatre from different periods. Discoveries in the research-as-practice workshops about Koun’s use of Stanislavsky allows us a deeper understanding of contemporary Hellenic actor training and practice, and may assist future practitioners and researchers to consider for their working scope. The research also revealed the significance and influence of Koun for contemporary Hellenic theatre and the value of this research in understanding a Hellenic tradition of actor-training.

40|$|This {{presentation}} explores {{my experience}} as a full-time on-campus doctoral candidate involved in an international postgraduate exchange. My doctoral work, concerned {{with the use of}} networks as a policy mechanism to understand and manage risk for young people, is being completed within an ARC Linkage Project. As such, my doctoral journey is undertaken collaboratively with an industry partner and alongside a community of academics. This stands in contrast to the more common experience of the part-time off-campus Education doctoral candidate largely isolated from an academic community and interacting, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, with only a principal and/or associate supervisor. Lave and Wenger 2 ̆ 7 s (1991) theory of legitimate peripheral participation explores the nature of situated learning, moving the focus from the observation and imitation that occurs between the master/apprenticeship to the learning that occurs within the community of which the master forms a part and in which learning occurs as access to practice. The idea of communities of practice is further developed by Wenger (1999) to include both questions of practice, including meaning, community, learning, boundaries and locality and questions of identity including identity in practice, participation, modes of belonging, identification and negotiability. My doctoral process as a disembodied experience of situated learning within a community of practice was highlighted by the opportunity to witness aspects of the academic apprenticeship of higher degree students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. That comparative experience provides new understandings about the distinctive model of research training that constitutes <b>my</b> academic <b>apprenticeship</b> within Australian higher education. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{exhibits}} {{the results}} of <b>my</b> PhD <b>Apprenticeship</b> Program, carried out at the “Marposs S. p. a. ” firm, in the electronic research division, and at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the Bologna University, in the INFN's electronics laboratories of the ATLAS group. During these three years of research, I worked on the development and realization of electronic boards dedicated to flexible data acquisition, designed to be applied in several contexts, that need to share high performance FPGAs and high-speed serial communications. The thesis describes the successful application of high-speed configurable electronic devices to two different fields, firstly developed in the particle physics scenario, and then the industrial measurement of mechanical pieces, reaching the main goal of the PhD Apprenticeship Program. The common denominator {{is the development of}} high speed electronics based on FPGAs for demanding data acquisition and data processing applications. The thesis describes the contribution to the luminosity monitor of LHC at CERN and illustrates a multi-camera system developed for automatic inspection of mechanical pieces made by a machine tool. The Apprenticeship Program allowed me to continue my academic course in parallel with my working activity, giving me the opportunity to finalize the project started during my internship and thesis for my master degree. It also allowed me to achieve a higher level in education and training in two different contexts of excellence, i. e. the industrial company and the academic research, where I concretely learned the best technical knowledge. The chance of bringing together two distant worlds was the most enthusiastic aspect of this PhD research. The world of industry and academic research face similar problems but with different points of view and goals. I had the opportunity to explore pure academic research, and also to apply the knowledge acquired in these years to the industrial research...|$|R
6000|$|And yet, {{when one}} has said this, one {{has failed to}} express the {{national}} Geist in all its subtlety. In brief, the great American sport {{was not so much}} to win the game as to beat it; the evasion of rules challenged our ingenuity; and having won, we set about devising methods whereby it would be less and less possible for us winners to lose in the future. No better illustration of this tendency could be given than the development which had recently taken place in the field of our city politics, hitherto the battle-ground of Irish politicians who had fought one another for supremacy. Individualism had been rampant, competition the custom; you bought an alderman, or a boss who owned four or five aldermen, and then you never could be sure you were to get what you wanted, or that the aldermen and the bosses would [...] "stay bought." [...] But now a genius had appeared, an American genius who had arisen swiftly and almost silently, who appealed to the imagination, and whose name was often mentioned in a whisper,--the Hon. Judd Jason, sometimes known as the Spider, who organized the City Hall and capitalized it; an ultimate and logical effect--if one had considered it--of the Manchester school of economics. Enlightened self-interest, stripped of sentiment, ends on Judd Jasons. He ran the city even as Mr. Sherrill ran his department store; you paid your price. It was very convenient. Being a genius, Mr. Jason did not wholly break with tradition, but retained those elements of the old muddled system that had their value, chartering steamboats for outings on the river, giving colossal picnics in Lowry Park. The poor and the wanderer and the criminal (of the male sex at least) were cared for. But he was not loved, as the rough-and-tumble Irishmen had been loved; he did not make himself common; he was surrounded by an aura of mystery which I confess had not failed of effect on me. Once, and only once during <b>my</b> legal <b>apprenticeship,</b> he had been pointed out to me on the street, where he rarely ventured. His appearance was not impressive....|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} based on a period of ethnographic {{research}} among approximately thirty tradesmen, apprentices, supervisors and related personnel at a medium-sized precision engineering company in Hamilton, New Zealand. The company specialises in high quality niche products and machinery for the dairy, aviation and medical technology industries. Its work involves a wide variety of engineering crafts and practices. My aim was to better understand the work that was done there, the elements of skilled and expert practice involved in it; how these skills were learned and from whom, and what they meant to those who held them. I wanted to find out which people and what conditions and environments best enabled the acquisition of skills and a good learning experience. By way of comparison to this main group, I interviewed a smaller number of craftspeople in the wider community: a fine furniture maker, a printmaker, a ceramicist and two luthiers, all of whom worked independently. This ethnography is located within a wider literature on apprenticeship, skill and education, and {{about what it means to}} be a “maker of things” (e. g. Beeby 1992; Biesta 2006; De Munck, Kaplan and Soly 2007; Dormer 1994, 1997; Keep 2007, 2009; Sennett 2008). I also draw on ethnographic discussions by other scholars who have described skilled practices and ways of learning in diverse social and cultural contexts (e. g. Coy 1989; Crawford 2009; Eraut 2001, 2002; Keller and Keller 1996; Lave 1988, 2011; Marchand 2003, 2010). My ethnographic data provides a rich description of a contemporary industrial workplace where learning involves both practical and theoretical knowledge and creative ability. The findings demonstrate that successful learning on the shop floor (and in the other examples given) is the result of a complex amalgam of disparate elements. The learning and teaching in these workplaces are sometimes structured and sometimes serendipitous. They are embedded in and arise from the processes of creativity, analysis, manufacture and reflection. They involve not only what takes place at the worksites but also the qualities and dispositions and histories of learning, both formal and informal, that the participants bring to their work. The development of skill and the acquisition of knowledge are shown to be complex and deeply personal and individual phenomena that are best nurtured in environments rich in materials, opportunity and experience, and in cooperation with interested, capable and expert “others”. This complexity is not easily represented in or catered for by current forms of educational assessment in New Zealand. A further and largely unexpected dimension of the study was my growing awareness of <b>my</b> own <b>apprenticeship</b> as a practitioner of ethnography, including my location as a participant observer in the actual field of study. This experience invariably led me to reflect further on the processes of apprenticeship, education and learning...|$|R
