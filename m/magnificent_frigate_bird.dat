40|$|This GRID {{survey was}} done at the beach of Playa de Coco - near a {{globally}} relevant sea turtle nesting beach (La Flor). Playa el Coco (latitude 11. 15382, longitude 85. 80051, geographic datum WGS 84) is situated at the Pacific Ocean in southwestern Nicaragua, approx. 20 km far from San Juan Del Sur and approx. 30 km far from the Costa Rican border, just adjacent to La Flor. We did our grid-based habitat survey on 8 th and 9 th of July in 2013. The GRID points are geo-referenced by latitude and longitude (decimal degrees, WGS 84, +- 10 meters acuracy) and were visited only once (no 3 repeats because it consists of sand and private property) and no species information (mostly empty sand beach). From 25 regular GRID points 9 were inaccessable because of private land holdings or very bushy forests. We took photos for every point (horizontal, vertical, sky), more details can be seen there. This grid {{can be used for}} change detection, shoreline location, develeopment, and beach erosion questions over time for turtle nest habitat, for instance. Known sea turtles for this region are predominately Olive`s Ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea, TSN 17384), other species could potentially occur too. On the beach, we also detected Black-throated Magpie-Jay Calocitta colliei 558992, Balck Vulture Coragyps atratus 175272, Groove-billed Ani Crotophaga sulcirostris 177839, Great Kiskadee Pitangus sulphuratus 178301, <b>Magnificent</b> <b>Frigate</b> <b>Bird</b> Fregata magnificens 174763, Black Oystercatcher Haematopus bachman 176475, Sooty Tern Onychoprion fuscatus 824105, Brown Pelican Pelecanus occidentalis 174685, Neotropical Cormorant Phalacrocorax brasilianus 554375 and Banded Wren Thryothorus pleurostictus 563460).

50|$|Great Tobago {{contains}} the Caribbean's third largest population of nesting seabirds, including <b>Magnificent</b> <b>Frigate</b> <b>Birds,</b> Long-tailed Tropic Birds, Terns, Pelicans, and other species. Though it's legal to snorkel and dive around the island, {{it is illegal}} to anchor because all potential anchoring locations are coral reefs that would be destroyed by an anchor. Large fines can occur if you violate this no-anchor zone, which is frequently patrolled by the BVI Marine Police.|$|R
50|$|North Seymour {{was created}} by seismic uplift, rather than being of {{volcanic}} origin. The island has a flat profile with cliffs only a few meters from the shoreline, where swallowtail gulls and tropicbirds sit perched in ledges. A tiny forest of silver-grey Palo Santo trees stand just above the landing, usually without leaves, waiting for rain to bring them into bloom. The island is teeming with life. While visiting the island, one may have {{to give way to}} a passing sea lion or marine iguana. Flocks of pelicans and swallow-tailed gulls feed off shore, and seasonally, Nazca boobies can also be seen.North Seymour is an extraordinary place for breeding birds, and is home to one of the largest populations of nesting blue-footed boobies and <b>magnificent</b> <b>frigate</b> <b>birds.</b> Pairs of blue-footed boobies can be seen conducting their mating ritual as they offer each other gifts, whistle and honk, stretch their necks towards the sky, spread their wings, and dance—showing off their bright blue feet. Magnificent frigatebirds perch in low bushes, near the boobies, while watching over their large chicks. The frigates are huge, dark aerobats with a 90 in wingspan. Male frigates can puff up their scarlet throat sacks to resemble giant red balloons. Boobies and frigates have an interesting relationship. Boobies are excellent hunters and fish in flocks. The frigates by comparison are pirates, they dive bomb the boobies to force them to drop their prey. Then, the aerobatic frigate swoops down and picks up the food before it hits the water.|$|R

50|$|<b>Frigate</b> <b>birds</b> {{are built}} for flying; they rarely swim and cannot walk but can manage to climb around {{the trees and}} bushes in which they nest. They have a very light {{skeleton}} and long narrow wings and are masters of the air. Their name probably derives {{from the fact that}} they harass other sea birds such as boobies and tropicbirds as they return to their nests from feeding, forcing them to disgorge their catch, which is then swooped upon and caught by the <b>frigate</b> <b>birds</b> before it reaches the water below. This practice seems to be more common among female <b>frigate</b> <b>birds,</b> but probably only accounts for a fairly small proportion of the diet, which mainly consists of squid and flying fish scooped up {{from the surface of the}} sea.|$|R

60|$|Of {{food they}} had little. Nothing grew on the Rock, and its sides, covered with {{shellfish}} {{at sea level}} where the surf thundered in, were too precipitous for access.

40|$|Extract] Seabirds {{are highly}} visible, charismatic predators in marine {{ecosystems}} that feed primarily or exclusively at sea. They have {{a range of}} relatively unique life-history characteristics associated with this predominantly marine lifestyle. Many of these characteristics are directly linked with having to forage over large distances to obtain sufficient food to breed. In general, seabirds are long-lived species that have deferred sexual maturity, small clutch sizes, slow chick growth rates and extended fledgling periods. For example, crested terns may live 18 - 20 years, sooty terns up to 32 years and larger species such as boobies and <b>frigate</b> <b>birds</b> even longer. Most seabird species do not become sexually mature or return to breed for between 5 to 12 years after fledging and the nestling period for some species, such as <b>frigate</b> <b>birds,</b> can be up to six months long...|$|R
