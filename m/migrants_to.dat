5|$|Dhondup Wangchen (born 17 October 1974) is a Tibetan filmmaker {{imprisoned by}} the Chinese {{government}} in 2008 on charges {{related to his}} documentary Leaving Fear Behind. Made with senior Tibetan monk Jigme Gyatso, the documentary consists of interviews with ordinary Tibetan people discussing the 14th Dalai Lama, the Chinese government, the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and Han Chinese <b>migrants</b> <b>to</b> the region. After smuggling the tapes of the interviews out of Tibet, however, Dhondup Wangchen and Jigme Gyatso were detained during the 2008 Tibetan unrest.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of Ireland in {{particular}} has seen large-scale immigration, with 420,000 foreign nationals as of 2006, about 10% of the population. A quarter of births (24 percent) in 2009 were to mothers born outside Ireland. Chinese and Nigerians, along with people from other African countries, have accounted for {{a large proportion of}} the non–European Union <b>migrants</b> <b>to</b> Ireland. Up to 50,000 eastern and central European migrant workers left Ireland in response to the Irish financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Parsi and Marwaris Migrant {{communities}} owned {{majority of the}} industry and trade enterprises in the city, while the white-collar jobs were mainly sought by the South Indian <b>migrants</b> <b>to</b> the city. The Shiv Sena party was established on 19 June 1966 by Bombay cartoonist Bal Thackeray, out of a feeling of resentment about the relative marginalization of the native Marathi people in their native state Maharashtra. In the 1960s and 1970s, Shiv Sena fought for rights of native Marathis. In the late 1960s, Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade were reclaimed and developed. During the 1970 there were Bombay-Bhiwandi riots. During the 1970s, coastal communication increased between Bombay and south western coast of India, after introduction of ships by the London-based trade firm Shepherd. These ships facilitated the entry of Goan and Mangalorean Catholics to Bombay.|$|E
5|$|The Absaroka and Beartooth Mountains {{are partly}} in the {{northern}} section of the forest. The Wind River Range is in the southern portion and contains Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming. Yellowstone National Park forms part of the boundary to the west; south of Yellowstone, the Continental Divide separates the forest from its neighbor Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The eastern boundary includes privately owned property, lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Wind River Indian Reservation, which belongs to the Shoshone and Arapahoe Indians. Custer National Forest along the Montana border is on the northern frontier. The Oregon Trail, the 19th century covered wagon route, passes {{just south of the}} forest, where broad and gentle South Pass allowed the <b>migrants</b> <b>to</b> bypass the rugged mountains to the north.|$|E

5|$|Tradition and old records {{assert that}} {{southern}} Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was inhabited very early by hunter-gatherers of Khoisan descent. Although {{most of these}} early inhabitants {{are believed to have}} been either overwhelmed, driven away or, in some cases, assimilated by later <b>migrants</b> <b>to</b> the area, physical traces of their occupation survive in certain ethnic minority groups inhabiting modern-day Jubaland {{and other parts of the}} south. The latter descendants include relict populations such as the Eile, Aweer, the Wa-Ribi, and especially the Wa-Boni. By the time of the arrival of peoples from the Cushitic Rahanweyn (Digil and Mirifle) clan confederacy, who would go on to establish a local aristocracy, other Cushitic groups affiliated with the Oromo (Wardai) and Ajuuraan (Ma'adanle) had already formed settlements of their own in the sub-region.|$|E
5|$|From one {{settlement}} in year 1, the Han Dynasty's {{involvement in the}} Minyue region grew into several counties. There were many Chinese counties in the area by the 4th century AD. The Minyue had been culturally assimilated {{by the time the}} Han Dynasty collapsed, and Chinese civilization was undergoing a transition to the Three Kingdoms period of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. Political upheaval in the north, such as Wang Mang's usurpation, had caused Han <b>migrants</b> <b>to</b> resettle in the south. The Han Dynasty's military expansion widened its commercial ties in addition acquiring large amounts of new territories. The empire's conquest of Minyue and Nanyue spoke of its vast size that it bordered the ancient kingdoms of Southeast Asia. Economic ties with the Han and subsequent dynasties affected the trajectory of maritime trade of Southeast Asia, where goods have been excavated made in styles resembling that of the ancient Han Chinese. Maritime trade and the Silk Road also linked China with Ancient Rome, India, and the Near East.|$|E
5|$|Indiana became {{politically}} {{influential and}} {{played an important}} role in the Union during the American Civil War. Indiana was the first western state to mobilize for the war, and its soldiers participated in almost every engagement during the war. Following the Civil War, Indiana remained politically important as it became a critical swing state in U.S. Presidential elections. It helped decide control of the presidency for three decades. During the Indiana Gas Boom of the late 19thcentury, industry began to develop rapidly in the state. The state's Golden Age of Literature began in the same time period, increasing its cultural influence. By the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong manufacturing state and attracted numerous immigrants and internal <b>migrants</b> <b>to</b> its industries. It experienced setbacks during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, expansion of the auto industry, urban development, and two wars contributed to the state's industrial growth. During the second half of the 20thcentury, Indiana became a leader in the pharmaceutical industry due to the innovations of companies such as Eli Lilly.|$|E

5|$|Monroe {{was born}} Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926 {{as the third}} child of Gladys Pearl Baker (née Monroe, 1902–1984). Gladys, the {{daughter}} of two poor Midwestern <b>migrants</b> <b>to</b> California, was a flapper {{and worked as a}} film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, Gladys married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917–1933) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met {{her for the first time}} as an adult. In 1924, Gladys married her second husband—Martin Edward Mortensen—but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe by a different man; they divorced in 1928. The identity of Monroe's father is unknown and Baker was most often used as her surname.|$|E
5|$|A {{site for}} the London {{terminus}} near Waterloo had been suggested by Sir Richard Broun. Its proximity to the River Thames meant that bodies could be cheaply transported to the terminus by water from much of London, while being situated near three major Thames bridges meant that the area was easily accessed from both {{north and south of}} the river by road. The arches of the huge brick viaduct carrying the LSWR into Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo station) were easily converted into mortuaries. Broun also felt that the journey out of London from Waterloo Bridge would be less distressing for mourners: while most of the rail routes out of London ran through tunnels and deep cuttings, or through densely populated areas, at this time the urban development of what is now south London had not taken place and the LSWR route ran almost entirely through parkland and countryside. The LNC also contemplated taking over the LSWR's former terminus at Nine Elms railway station (which following the 1848 opening of the much more convenient Waterloo Bridge station was used only for goods traffic, chartered trains taking <b>migrants</b> <b>to</b> North America, and the private trains of the royal family) as either the main or a secondary terminus. Despite objections from local residents concerned about the effects of potentially large numbers of dead bodies being stored in a largely residential area, in March 1854 the LNC settled on a single terminus in Waterloo and purchased a plot of land between Westminster Bridge Road and York Street (now Leake Street) for the site.|$|E

Architect William Tite and engineer William Cubitt drew up a design for a station, which was approved in June 1854.|$|E
