3000|$|The Bundestag has {{a series}} of {{instruments}} and measures at his disposal to scrutinize {{the work of the}} government. This means, above all, that parliamentarians are able to inform themselves about the work and intentions of the government and put critical questions. The rules of procedures of the German parliament allow all parliamentarians to formally submit questions on important policy issues and government positions which are known as ‘major and minor interpellation’. In March 2011, the social democrats submitted a <b>minor</b> <b>interpellation</b> (Bundestag 2011) that consists of 66 written questions, asking, among others, about the formal role of the CTFD: ‘How does the increasing use of Citizens’ Dialogues by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research relate to the fundamental understanding of our parliamentary democracy {{and the role of the}} members of the German parliament as the democratically elected representatives of the people?’ 20 [...]...|$|E
30|$|The next {{relevant}} {{question is}} what kinds of comments are given by the objectors {{and what kind of}} effects the objections have. No systematic research has been done into this issue in Germany, there is merely some evidence. The state government of Brandenburg answered a <b>minor</b> <b>interpellation</b> in 2002 : “Most of the objections in procedures conducted by the agencies for immission control and the state environment agency relate to concerns due to the immediate neighbourhood to the projects seeking permission. Very personal concerns {{play a major role in}} the objections, such as health issues, loss of value of real estate etc. The objections are as diverse as the planned projects and the local conditions. There are three issues that are of utmost relevance for all facilities listed in the 4 th Federal Immission Control Ordinance: noise, dust (ingredients of the dust) and odours”. 16 A study on the practice of environment impact assessment of 2001 did research into the effects of public participation, too. In his empirical analysis on 120 approval procedures, the author asked explicitly about the correlation between the number of objections and the extent of local and environment protection relevant modifications resp. the extent of general project modifications. He concludes that “the bigger the number of objections by the public and the § 29 (acknowledged environment) organisations, 17 the larger is the extent of spatial project modifications and environment protection relevant variants as well as technological modification of general kind (technological, spatial and renunciation of parts of the project) included in planning decisions” (Wende 2001 : 171). The author concedes, however, that even though this correlation is deducible, the modifications due to objections by the public “are of very little weight in the project modifications” (Wende 2001 : 171). Further relevant research on the influence of objections and comments on environment-relevant approval procedures is not on record in Germany.|$|E
