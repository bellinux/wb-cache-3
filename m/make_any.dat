5|$|Abu-Jamal did not <b>make</b> <b>any</b> public {{statements}} about Faulkner's murder until May 2001. In {{his version of}} events, he claimed that {{he was sitting in}} his cab across the street when he heard shouting, then saw a police vehicle, and heard the sound of gunshots. Upon seeing his brother appearing disoriented across the street, Abu-Jamal ran to him from the parking lot and was shot by a police officer. Abu-Jamal's brother William Cook, who had been stopped by the police officer, did not testify or <b>make</b> <b>any</b> statement until April 29, 2001. At that time {{he said that he had}} not seen who had shot Faulkner.|$|E

5|$|Bonfiglioli often bought {{material}} from writers without an established reputation; {{he did not}} <b>make</b> <b>any</b> special effort to acquire stories from well-known names.

5|$|By October 1906, Charles Parham {{was invited}} to speak {{for a series of}} {{meetings}} at Azusa Street but was quickly un-invited.

5|$|Five {{weeks before}} the {{outbreak}} of World War II, on 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to representatives of French and British military intelligence, which {{had been unable to}} <b>make</b> <b>any</b> headway against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and-technology transfer would give the Allies an unprecedented advantage (Ultra) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of World War II.|$|E

Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.

5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet.

Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E

5|$|Never Say Never Again had {{its origins}} in the early 1960s {{following}} {{the controversy over the}} 1961 Thunderball novel, which led to Kevin McClory becoming producer of the Eon Productions film of the same name.

5|$|The JNA {{launched}} repeated {{assaults on}} Vukovar {{but failed to}} <b>make</b> <b>any</b> progress.
