50|$|<b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> {{has both}} a general {{business}} application {{and a business}} intelligence application. General business exceptions are cases that deviate from the normal behavior in a business process {{and need to be}} cared for in a unique manner, typically by human intervention. Their cause might include: process deviation, infrastructure or connectivity issues, external deviation, poor quality business rules, malformed data, etc. <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> here is the practice of investigating, resolving and handling such occurrences by using skilled staff and software tools. Good management can contribute to efficiency of business processes. Often in these cases the process will be called exception management, as exceptional cases are not the sole focus of the managerial policy, and exception management (as opposed to <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception)</b> denotes a more moderate application of the process.|$|R
50|$|<b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> is a {{style of}} {{business}} management that focuses on identifying and handling cases that deviate from the norm, recommended as best practice <b>by</b> the project <b>management</b> method PRINCE2.|$|R
50|$|<b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (MBE), {{when applied}} to {{business}} is a style of management that gives employees the responsibility to take decisions and to fulfill their work or projects by themselves. It consists of focus and analysis of statistically relevant anomalies in the data. If an unusual situation or deviation in the recorded data appears, which could cause difficulties for the business and can’t be managed by the employee at his level, the employee should pass the decision {{on to the next}} higher level. For example, if all products are selling at their expected volumes for the quarter, except one particular product which is underperforming or overperforming at a statistically relevant margin, only the data for that product will be presented to the managers for further investigation and discovery of the root cause. <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> can bring forward business errors and oversights, ineffective strategies that need to be improved, changes in competition and business opportunities. <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> is intended to reduce the managerial load and enable managers to spend their time more effectively in areas where it will have the most impact.|$|R

Expatriate managers in Malaysian 5 -star hotels, {{may have a}} different approach from local managers, hence the levels of the job satisfaction of middle managers may differ too. Information is still lacking {{on the influence of}} expatriate managers leadership styles on employees’ job satisfaction in Malaysian 5 -star hotels. The purpose of this paper was twofold, to shed light on employees’ job satisfaction under the leadership of expatriate managers as well as the differences in leadership styles of local and expatriate managers. Results showed that transformational leadership styles such as; idealized influence (behavior), intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation had a significant positive effect on employees job satisfaction. Even transactional leadership styles of expatriates such as contingent reward produced significant positive effect on employees job satisfaction. However transactional leadership of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (passive) of expatriate managers had a significant negative effect on job satisfaction. The combination of five leadership styles of expatriate managers, was able to produce 92. 2 % of employees’ job satisfaction. Except for <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (passive), the other four leadership styles had a positive effect on job satisfaction. Results further revealed that expatriate managers have different leadership styles, with higher individual consideration, and contingent reward score, but lower <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (passive) score compared to local managers.

As a theoretical approach, the study adopts the concept of organizational culture as variable; the concepts of transformational and transactional leadership; {{and the relationship between}} organizational culture and leadership. Using a questionnaire, we investigate the relationship between four types of organizational culture – clan, adhocracy, market, and hierarchy – and transformational leadership (in terms of four categories: idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration). We also examine the relationship between those four types of culture and transactional leadership (focusing in three dimensions: contingent reward leadership, <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception,</b> and absence of leadership). We found a negative correlation between the dimension of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> and adhocracy culture, and between the dimension of individualized consideration and hierarchy culture.

40|$|Spacecraft {{management}} {{is becoming more}} human intensive as spacecraft become more complex and as operations costs are growing accordingly. Several automation approaches have been proposed to lower these costs. However, most of these approaches are not flexible enough in the operations processes and levels of automation that they support. This paper presents a concept called the Virtual Mission Operations Center (VMOC) that provides highly flexible support for dynamic spacecraft management processes and automation. In a VMOC, operations personnel can be shared among missions, the operations team can change personnel and their locations, and automation can be added and removed as appropriate. The VMOC employs a form of on-demand supervisory control called <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> to free operators from having to actively monitor their system. The VMOC extends <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception,</b> however, so that distributed, dynamic teams can work together. The VMOC uses work-group computing concepts and groupware tools to provide a team infrastructure, and it employs user agents to allow operators to define and control system automation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between transformational and transactional leadership, and labour flexibility within small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Using a sample comprising 755 employees, rating 121 supervisors within 50 Dutch small and medium-sized companies, the authors examined the relationship between transformational and transactional leadership on the one hand, and temporal and functional flexibility on the other. Further, to test whether the expected associations could be perceived as a social exchange between supervisor and employees, this study investigated the mediating role of affective organisational commitment. Design/methodology/approach – Because data were nested, the authors used multilevel analysis for hypothesis testing. Findings – Both dimensions of transformational leadership, visionary leadership and coaching, were positively related to temporal flexibility; also two dimensions of transactional leadership, contingent reward and active <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception,</b> were also positively associated with temporal flexibility. All of these associations were mediated by affective organisational commitment, indicating social exchange relationships. As opposed to expectations, passive <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception,</b> representing poor transactional leadership, was positively related to temporal and functional flexibility. Affective commitment did not mediate these relationships. Practical implications – SMEs are therefore advised to improve visionary leadership, coaching skills, contingent reward, and active <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception.</b> Originality/value – The paper shows that, remarkably, labour flexibility can be increased by both effective and poor leadership. On the one hand, effective leadership seems to promote temporal flexibility by creating employees’ commitment to the organisation. Poor leadership, on the other hand, does not call for people's affective commitment and thus seems to be forcing employees into demonstrating flexible behaviours, as a way of compensating for bad managemen...|$|R

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> is that problematic issues are identified rapidly and managers {{are able to}} use their time and energy more wisely for important issues rather than for less important ones that could provoke delays in their daily operations. Additionally, managers need to work less on statistics {{and the frequency of}} making decisions becomes less, which saves time. As managers take fewer decisions, employees have more responsibility, which increases their motivation.|$|R

This article reports on one experiment {{in a series of}} studies that empirically explored the cognitive work underlying <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> in air traf®c control. Active practitioners (controllers, pilots, dispatchers) were prepared on the rules of the envisioned system and presented with a series of future incidents, each of which they were required to jointly resolve. <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> turns out to trap human controllers in a double bind, where intervening early seems appealing but is dif®cult to justify (airspace throughput) and carry out (controller workload problems).

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to test {{constituents}} as well as complete theories of Transactional and Transformational Leadership behaviour of salesman on customer relationship marketing behaviour in Indian Banking scenario. For Transactional Leadership {{it was hypothesized that}} contingency reward system and <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> of salesperson positively affect customer trust, customer commitment and together they contribute to customer relationship behaviour. For transformational Leadership it was hypothesized that idealized influence behaviour, individualized considerate, Intellectual stimulation, Inspirational motivation behaviour of salespersons positively affect customers’ trust, customers’ commitment, customer assumptions and customers optimistic engagement. Non-Probabilistic sampling methods were used. A survey was conducted among 61 sales persons and their customers in the Indian banking sector, and the regression analysis was performed to test hypotheses. Conclusion shows that contingency reward system influence customer relationship up to a certain extent while <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exceptions</b> is not so appropriate for maintaining the relationship with customer though it is showing correlation, while in case of transformational leadership idealized influence behaviour of salespersons positively influences customer trust, individualized consideration of salespersons, in turn influences customer commitment, Intellectual stimulation encourage creativity and changes earlier assumptions of customer and Inspirational Motivation influences optimistic engagement of customers. It was also found that the combined effect of all the constituent of Transformational Leadership theories are positively related with customers’ relationship commitment.

40|$|Continuing {{demand for}} the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has put {{increasing}} pressure on operations in civil airspace. The need to fly UAS in the National Airspace System (NAS) in order to perform missions vital to national security and defense, emergency management, and science is increasing at a rapid pace. In order to ensure safe operations in the NAS, operators of unmanned aircraft, like those of manned aircraft, may be required to maintain separation assurance and avoid loss of separation with other aircraft while performing their mission tasks. This experiment investigated the effects of varying levels of automation on UAS operator performance and workload while responding to conflict resolution instructions provided by the Tactical Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) during a UAS mission in high-density airspace. The {{purpose of this study was}} not to investigate the safety of using TCAS II on UAS, but rather to examine the effect of automation on the ability of operators to respond to traffic collision alerts. Six licensed pilots were recruited to act as UAS operators for this study. Operators were instructed to follow a specified mission flight path, while maintaining radio contact with Air Traffic Control and responding to TCAS II resolution advisories. Operators flew four, 45 minute, experimental missions with four different levels of automation: Manual, Knobs, <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>Exception,</b> and Fully Automated. All missions included TCAS II Resolution Advisories (RAs) that required operator attention and rerouting. Operator compliance and reaction time to RAs was measured, and post-run NASA-TLX ratings were collected to measure workload. Results showed significantly higher compliance rates, faster responses to TCAS II alerts, as well as less preemptive operator actions when higher levels of automation are implemented.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} implementation of a novel Flight Management System (FMS) to ensure onboard passenger safety of commercial aircraft in the event of an emergency scenario where the pilot must relinquish control of the aircraft (e. g. hijacking or loss of cabin pressure). In such situations, the flight management system autonomously pilots the aircraft to a predefined destination whilst taking into account potential hazards such as terrain (in low altitude scenarios), aircraft dynamic constraints, and flight objectives with real-time constraints present. Furthermore, the FMS must ensure that the Human Decision Maker (HDM) (e. g. Air Traffic Control or ATC) has sufficient time to intervene if they do not agree with automated onboard decisions. The proposed FMS shows that the inclusion of intelligent planning capabilities onboard commercial aircraft can assist in improving safety for the aircraft and onboard passengers in the event of emergencies by allowing the aircraft to continue operating autonomously in a <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> paradigm.
