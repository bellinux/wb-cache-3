40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} determination {{as to whether}} the <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance</b> Payment is actually necessary in the Sri Lankan construction industry, its effect on contractors' cash flow and whether it is a motivation for the contractors. Accurate cash flow forecasting is essential to all contractors in the construction Industry for successful operation and existence in the long run. At initial stages of a project the cash flow aspect of the contractor is negative. The main role of project financing is to cover up this negative flow in a beneficial, cost effective manner. <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance</b> Payment enhances the quality and productivity in the construction industry. It improves the performance and cost efficiency of the contractors as well as the clients. Cash data in relation to thirty projects were collected. Three criteria, no <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance,</b> 20 % of the initial contract sum as the <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance</b> paid at the inception of the project and 20 % of the initial contract sum as <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance</b> given in stages, were identified to determine the differences in the effects of cash flow. The effect of these different criteria on the cumulative cash flow was examined. Further Scheduled Performance Index was calculated for further analysis. Results show and confirm that <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance</b> Payment has a big bearing on the contractors' existence and their motivation towards attaining objectives of the project. Research confirms that <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance</b> Payment is a necessity in the Sri Lankan construction industry. Further it can be confirmed that the provision of <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance</b> Payment is very essential for the Sri Lankan contractors.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Obtaining {{funds for}} {{executing}} work on contracts {{is a huge}} burden for construction contractors. In essence, project finance is required to bridge the time between expenditures and revenues. The <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance</b> is a monetary payment made by the client to the contractor for initial expenditure in respect of site mobilization, and a fair proportion of job overheads or preliminaries. <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance</b> Payment (MAP) reduces contractors ’ need for working capital. It is practised in few third world countries like Sri Lanka. However, very scant {{attention has been given}} to systematically study this topic. Therefore, this paper aim to analyze {{the pros and cons of}} <b>mobilization</b> <b>advance</b> payment as a financial mechanism, which has been practised for more than two decades in the Sri Lankan construction industry. The main objectives are to answer ‘is <b>mobilization</b> <b>advance</b> payment necessary for the Sri Lankan construction industry?’; and ‘what is the effect of <b>mobilization</b> <b>advance</b> payment on contractors cash flow’. To answer these questions, research was conducted using four case studies. The actual cash–in and cash-out data were obtained from the financial records of the contractors. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among four project participants and two head office based officers for each case study after analyzing the cash flow. In this context, this paper reports the findings of this research highlighting, important role that the <b>mobilization</b> <b>advance</b> payment plays within the typical construction context, positive effects of <b>mobilization</b> <b>advance</b> payment on contractor’s cash flow and negative aspects of <b>mobilization</b> <b>advance</b> payment...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{plays an important}} role in any economy, and its activities are vital to the achievement of the socio-economic development goals of a nation. In Ghana, the construction and housing industry plays an immeasurable role in the national developmental agenda. What however, appears to be debatable is whether the industry wields the much expected driving force required to pronounce its vital contribution towards accelerated national growth in terms of infrastructural development. This paper assesses the extent to which <b>Mobilization</b> <b>Advance</b> Payment (MAP) contribute to the output of small scale contractors in the Tamale metropolis.

This lack of <b>mobilization</b> of the <b>advanced</b> psychiatric nurse as a resource person in the mental health services, is associated with her supervisors who are the psychiatric nurse managers. The purpose of this research was to develop and describe a model that could be implemented to guide the <b>mobilization</b> of the <b>advanced</b> psychiatric nurse as a resource person in the mental health services in order to facilitate her mental health. The research also focused on developing guidelines for the implementation of the model for the <b>mobilization</b> of the <b>advanced</b> psychiatric nurse as a resource person. The model: "Mobilization of the advanced psychiatric nurse as a resource person: an interactive process", together with its operational guidelines was developed by using a theory generative design, that is, qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual in nature. This model was developed according to Chinn and Kramer's (1995) approach to theory generation, namely: identification of the central concepts for the model by conducting a field study to explore and describe the views of the advanced psychiatric nurse and those of the psychiatric nurse managers with regard to the <b>mobilization</b> of the <b>advanced</b> psychiatric nurse as a resource person in the mental health services of Gauteng; analysing the data gathered through focus groups interviews from the sample of the advanced psychiatric nurses and form the sample of psychiatric nurse managers using Strauss and Corbin's (1990) open, axial, and selective coding approach to guide data analysis; analysing the data by identifying, defining, classifying the concepts and placing them into relationship with each other to form relationship statements as the conceptual framework for the model; describing the model using strategies proposed by Chinn and Kramer (1995) and then subjecting the model to evaluation by experts in theory generation; describing the guidelines for the implementation of the model in the clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|Whereas {{previous}} {{scholarship on}} popular mobilization {{has focused on}} its sources or causes, this study redirects attention to its effects on participants—in particular, to the subjective consequences of different modes of collective action. In dialogue with a rich theoretical tradition focused on the tension between workplace/production versus community/citizenship as competing sources of class formation, my central research question is: How do contrasting patterns of collective action differentially transform working-class consciousness and subjectivity? To answer this question I compare what I conceptualize as “economic” versus “political” logics of collective action as empirically represented, respectively, by a workplace strike at a small auto parts manufacturer in the industrial Midwest and a community-based campaign to secure a “living wage” in Chicago. Drawing primarily on in-depth interviews, and comparing respondents from the two cases {{in a way that}} accounts for the possibility of selection bias, the project analyzes how these two modal types of collective action yield distinct forms of consciousness and subjectivity. The key difference that emerges in the two cases is the development of a “perpetual struggle orientation” where conflict and protest are perceived as ongoing. Although Chicago’s living wage campaign was profoundly diverse, participants nevertheless developed an expansive solidarity with other workers and a long-term commitment to struggle on their behalf. In contrast, the striking autoworkers—despite their structural power, denser social networks, and immediate success against their employer—failed to develop any such orientation toward future struggle or understanding of their place as part of a wider social class. These findings challenge our usual assumptions about the divisive dynamics of diversity, about the solidity of concrete networks, and {{about the role of the}} workplace in working-class life. More generally, the analysis demonstrates how key features of collective action—constituency, emotion, duration, and type of leverage used—are constitutive of distinct working-class identities and understandings of struggle. This study traces how solidarity with other workers, an activist identity, and a sense of collective efficacy emerge as participants are transformed through <b>mobilization,</b> <b>advancing</b> our theoretical understanding of group formation, collective action, social movements, and social change...|$|R
50|$|Advances in the {{surgical}} techniques allow surgeons {{to perform the}} surgery under local anesthesia with assistance from intravenous sedation. Dr. Raffaini introduced this technique in 2002 after a four-year study done with local anesthesia and assistance from intravenous sedation. Prior to this, surgeons would fully sedate patients, hospitalizing them shortly after the surgery for a 2-3 day recovery, specifically from the anesthesia. Advancements allow surgeons to expand {{the use of an}} osteotomy on more parts of the jaws with faster recovery time, less pain, and no hospitalization, making the surgery more effective with respect to time and recovery.The procedure, which is strictly used for a mandibular (jaw) deformity and <b>mobilization,</b> has <b>advanced</b> from similar, very effective procedures performed since 1985. The original mandible and maxilla osteotomy procedure still remains almost unchanged, as it is the simplest and still the most effective for dentofacial deformity correction.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{proceeding}} militarily against Nasr, Anushtakin secured {{an agreement}} with the Byzantine Empire, Nasr's ostensible protector; the 1035 Byzantine-Fatimid truce forbade any Fatimid aggression against Mirdasid Aleppo, [...] "for it was a town subject to Byzantine tribute". Thus, Anushtakin requested permission from the Byzantine emperor, Michael IV, to [...] "save Aleppo from Nasr", promising to continue the Mirdasids' annual tribute to the Byzantines. After gaining the Byzantines' blessing, Anushtakin confirmed his alliance with the Bedouin tribes around Aleppo, namely the Kalb, Tayy and part of the Kilab. In 1038, he mobilized his Fatimid and Bedouin troops, and advanced northward against the Mirdasid realm. Nasr, meanwhile, was made aware of Anushtakin's <b>mobilization</b> and <b>advanced</b> southward with his army and allies from Kilab. The two sides fought west of Salamiyah, and Anushtakin forced Nasr to retreat and regroup. Anushtakin proceeded to sack Mirdasid-held Hama and continued northward. The two sides met again on 22 May 1038 at Tell al-Fas, a hill just outside of Latimin, northwest of Hama. In the middle of the fighting, Nasr's brother and rival, Mu'izz al-Dawla Thimal, abandoned Nasr's camp and headed for Aleppo to seize the city for himself. This reduced Nasr's force and he was defeated and killed. Nasr's head was delivered to Anushtakin, while his body was hanged on the gates of Hama's citadel.|$|R

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in specialized niches within the bone marrow during steady state, maintaining lifelong blood cell production.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{raises the}} {{question}} of how knowledge creation is organized in the area of HIV prevention and how this concatenation of expertise, resources, at-risk people and viruses shapes the knowledge used to impede the epidemic. It also seeks to trouble the discourses of biomedical pre-eminence in the field of HIV prevention by examining the claim for treatment as prevention, looking at evidence constructed through the biomedical frame and through the lens of the sociology of science. These questions lie within a larger socio-historical context of lagging worldwide attention and funding to prevention in the HIV area and, in particular, neglect of populations at greatest risk. Much contemporary HIV prevention research relies on a population science divided over an epistemic fault line from the communities and individuals who must make sense of the intrusion of a life-threatening disease into their pursuit of pleasure and intimacy. There are, nevertheless, lessons to be learned from prevention success stories among sex workers, injection drug users, and gay and bisexual men. The success stories point to a need for a robust social science agenda that examines: the ways that people are socially organized and networked; the popular strategies and folk wisdoms developed in the face of HIV risk; socio-historical movement of sexual and drug cultures; the dynamics of popular <b>mobilization</b> to <b>advance</b> health; the institutional sources of HIV discourses; and popular understandings of HIV technologies and messages. </p...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesOur {{goal was}} to examine the role of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in lipolysis {{regulation}} in heart failure (HF) patients. BackgroundEnhanced adipose tissue lipolysis can contribute to myocardial lipid overload, insulin resistance, and cachexia in advanced HF. Natriuretic peptides were recently recognized to stimulate lipolysis in healthy subjects. MethodsTen nondiabetic HF patients (New York Heart Association functional class III, 50 % nonischemic etiology) and 13 healthy subjects (control subjects) of similar age, sex, and body composition underwent a microdialysis study of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. Four microdialysis probes were simultaneously perfused with 0. 1 μM BNP 1 – 32, 10 μM BNP 1 – 32, 10 μM norepinephrine (NE) or Ringer's solution. Outgoing dialysate glycerol concentration (DGC) was measured as an index of lipolysis. ResultsSpontaneous lipolysis was higher in HF patients compared with control subjects (DGC: 189 ± 37 μmol/l vs. 152 ± 35 μmol/l, p < 0. 01). Response to NE was similar (p = 0. 35) in HF patients and control subjects (DGC increase of 1. 7 ± 0. 2 -fold vs. 1. 7 ± 0. 4 -fold). BNP 1 – 32 10 μM markedly increased lipolysis in both HF patients and control subjects (DGC increase of 2. 8 ± 0. 5 -fold vs. 3. 2 ± 0. 3 -fold), whereas the response to 0. 1 μM BNP 1 – 32 was more pronounced in HF patients (p = 0. 02). In HF patients, spontaneous lipolysis positively correlated with insulin resistance and the response to BNP 1 – 32 negatively correlated with adiposity. ConclusionsBNP 1 – 32 exerts strong lipolytic effects in humans. Despite marked elevation of plasma immunoreactive BNP, the responsiveness of adipose tissue to BNP 1 – 32 is not attenuated in HF, possibly reflecting a deficiency of endogenous bioactive BNP. Lipolytic effects of BNP can contribute to excessive fatty acid <b>mobilization</b> in <b>advanced</b> HF...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionInternal herniae, {{although}} rare, {{can give}} rise to potentially serious morbidity and mortality. The protrusion and entrapment of the small bowel through an embryological or iatrogenic mesenteric aperture {{within the confines of}} the peritoneal cavity can be difficult to diagnose, and delay treatment (operative). Timely intervention must be achieved to minimize small bowel ischemia and infarction. Case presentationIn this case, a young lady who had a previous laparoscopic total colectomy and ileostomy developed an unusual internal hernia. Small bowel was passing behind the lesser curvature of the stomach causing the stomach to be rotated to form of a tight “band” trapping bowel. The herniated small bowel was reduced, hence, avoiding resection; the defect closed by interupted 4 - 0 PDS. “Prompt” surgery avoided small bowel length resection and sacrifice of the ileoanal pouch reconstruction. DiscussionIt is theorized that a laparoscopic approach results in a more <b>advanced</b> <b>mobilization</b> of the mesentery right up to the small bowel origin, and with less adhesion formation may in fact promote unusual internal hernia and volvulus. ConclusionThe case presented highlights the difficulty in making the diagnosis, and the pictures clearly indicate an unusual hernia passing directly behind the stomach and involving a large section of the small bowel. The lead up history of several admissions with sub acute small bowel obstruction suggested the underlying problem was adhesional but quite clearly there was a well defined internal hernia. Without timely surgery she would have been at high risk of losing her pouch...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to obtain information on variation between dairy cows in muscle and fat tissue mobilization around parturition and to study the association between protein and fat mobilization and serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations (hyperketonemia) in this period. Thirty-four cows kept under similar conditions at a university dairy farm (no experimental treatments) were monitored from 4 wk before until 8 wk after calving. Mobilization of muscle protein was investigated by analysis of plasma 3 -methylhistidine concentrations (3 -MH, analyzed by a recently developed HPLC tandem mass spectrometry method) and ultrasound measurements of longissimus muscle thickness. Mobilization of fat tissue was monitored by serum nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations and ultrasound measurements of backfat thickness. Large variation was observed between cows in onset and duration of periparturient protein and fat mobilization. Plasma 3 -MH concentrations and muscle thickness profiles indicated that protein mobilization started, on average, before parturition and continued until approximately wk 4 of lactation. Serum NEFA concentrations and backfat thickness profiles showed that fat mobilization occurred from parturition until the end of the study. Thus, muscle protein <b>mobilization</b> occurred in <b>advance</b> of fat <b>mobilization</b> in most cows from this study. We hypothesized that this might be due to a prepartum amino acid deficiency in the absence of negative energy balance. The incidence of hyperketonemia in this study was 16 / 34 = 47 %. With the exception of 3 cows defined as having severe hyperketonemia, cows with lower 3 -MH concentrations had higher serum BHBA concentrations. A possible explanation for this observation might be that higher mobilization of protein around calving might restrict ketone body production due to the higher availability of glucogenic precursors in the period of most severe negative energy balance and highest fat mobilization. The validity of this hypothesis needs to be confirmed, but data from this study indicate that further research on the role of protein mobilization in the etiology of hyperketonemia in dairy cows is needed...|$|R
