Data obtained by the Ulysses magnetometer and solar wind anlayzer have been combined to study the properties of such magnetic holes in the solar wind between 1 AU and 5. 4 AU and to 23 deg south latitude. In order to avoid confusion with decreases in field strength at interplanetary discontinuities, the study has focused on linear holes across which the field direction changed by less than 5 deg. The holes occurred preferentially, but not without exception, in the interaction regions on the leading edges of high-speed solar wind streams.

We will reexamine past spacecraft observations to demonstrate the observational {{similarities and differences between}} these magnetic and plasma structures. MM structures in planetary magnetosheaths, cometary sheaths, and the heliosheath have the following characteristics: (1) the structures have little or no changes in the magnetic field direction across the magnetic dips; (2) the structures have quasiperiodic spacings, varying from similar to 20 proton gyroradii (r(p)) in the Earth's magnetosheath to similar to 57 r(p) in the heliosheath; and (3) the magnetic dips have smooth edges. Magnetosheath MM structures are generated by the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> where beta(perpendicular to) /beta(parallel to) > 1 + 1 /beta(perpendicular to) (beta is the plasma thermal pressure divided by the magnetic pressure). In general, the sources of free energy for the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> are reasonably well understood: shock compression, field line draping, and, in the cases of comets and the heliosheath, also ion pickup. The observational properties of interplanetary MDs are as follows: (1) there is a broad range of magnetic field angular changes across them; (2) their thicknesses can range from as little as 2 - 3 r(p) to thousands of r(p), with no "characteristic" size; and (3) they typically are bounded by discontinuities. The mechanism(s) for interplanetary MD generation is (are) currently unresolved, although at least five different mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. Tsurutani et al.

We impose an initial ambient magnetic field perpendicular to the simulation box, and we start with a spectrum of large-scale, linearly-polarized, random-phase Alfvenic fluctuations which have energy equipartition between kinetic and magnetic fluctuations and vanishing correlation between the two fields. A turbulent cascade rapidly develops, magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a Kolmogorov-like power-law spectrum at large scales and a steeper spectrum at sub-ion scales. The imposed expansion (taking a strictly transverse ambient magnetic field) leads to generation of an important perpendicular proton temperature anisotropy that eventually drives the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability.</b> This instability generates large-amplitude, nonpropagating, compressible, pressure-balanced magnetic structures in a form of magnetic enhancements/humps that reduce the perpendicular temperature anisotropy.

40|$|In recent years, we have {{experienced}} increasing {{interest in the}} understanding of the physical properties of collisionless plasmas, mostly because of the large number of astrophysical environments (e. g. the intracluster medium (ICM)) containing magnetic fields that are strong enough to be coupled with the ionized gas and characterized by densities sufficiently low to prevent the pressure isotropization with respect to the magnetic line direction. Under these conditions, a new class of kinetic instabilities arises, such as firehose and <b>mirror</b> <b>instabilities,</b> which have been studied extensively in the literature. Their role in the turbulence evolution and cascade process in the presence of pressure anisotropy, however, is still unclear. In this work, we present the first statistical analysis of turbulence in collisionless plasmas using three-dimensional numerical simulations and solving double-isothermal magnetohydrodynamic equations with the Chew-Goldberger-Low laws closure (CGL-MHD). We study models with different initial conditions to account for the firehose and <b>mirror</b> <b>instabilities</b> and to obtain different turbulent regimes. We found that the CGL-MHD subsonic and supersonic turbulences show small differences compared to the MHD models in most cases. However, in the regimes of strong kinetic instabilities, the statistics, i. e. the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of density and velocity, are very different. In subsonic models, the instabilities cause an increase in the dispersion of density, while the dispersion of velocity is increased by a large factor in some cases. Moreover, the spectra of density and velocity show increased power at small scales explained by the high growth rate of the instabilities. Finally, we calculated the structure functions of velocity and density fluctuations in the local reference frame defined by the direction of magnetic lines. The results indicate that in some cases the instabilities significantly increase the anisotropy of fluctuations. These results, even though preliminary and restricted to very specific conditions, show that the physical properties of turbulence in collisionless plasmas, as those found in the ICM, may be very different from what has been largely believed. Implications can range from interchange of energies to cosmic ray acceleration. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

The collisionless kinetic theory in a guiding center approximation, {{modified}} for {{accounting of the}} finite ion Larmor radius effects, is used as the starting point. The model equation governing the nonlinear dynamics of mirror waves near instability threshold is derived. In the linear approximation it describes the classical <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> that is valid for a wide class of the velocity distribution functions. In the nonlinear regime the mirror waves form solitary structures that have the shape of magnetic holes. The formation of such structures and their nonlinear dynamics has been analyzed both analytically and numerically. It is suggested that the main nonlinear mechanism responsible for <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> saturation is associated with modification (flattening) of {{the shape of the}} background ion distribution function in the region of small parallel particle velocities. The width of this region is of the order of the particle trapping zone in the mirror hole. Near the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> threshold the saturation arises before its width reaches the ion thermal velocity. The nonlinear mode coupling effects in this approximation are smaller and unable to take control over evolution of the space profile of saturated mirror waves or lead to their magnetic collapse. This results in the appearance of quasi-stable solitary mirror structures having the form of deep magnetic depressions. A phenomenological description of this process is formulated. The relevance of the theoretical results to recent satellite observations is stressed. ...|$|E

The waves generally move sunward at velocities ~ 10 km s − 1 with the background plasma convection flow. Wavelengths range from 6700 to 23 300 km, corresponding to azimuthal wavenumbers m from 18 to 76. Wave periods decrease with increasing radial distance. Having determined the parameters describing the waves, we consider three previously proposed explanations: generation by substorm injection, generation by bounce or drift-bounce instabilities, and generation by the drift-mirror instability. The interval was quiet geomagnetically, arguing against any relationship to substorm injections. We found that ions with low energies of 69 – 628 eV or high energies of 28 – 615 keV would have been required to account for drift-bounce resonance during this interval, but inspection reveals ion fluxes at these energies near background levels during the time period considered.

With the aim to {{understand}} {{the origin of the}} pressure-balanced magnetic structures in the form of holes and humps commonly observed in the solar wind and planetary magnetosheaths, high-resolution hybrid numerical simulations of the Vlasov-Maxwell (VM) equations using both Lagrangian (particle in cells) and Eulerian integration schemes are presented and compared with asymptotic and phenomenological models for the nonlinear mirror mode dynamics. It turns out that magnetic holes do not result from direct nonlinear saturation of the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> that rather leads to magnetic humps. Nevertheless, both above and below threshold, there exist stable solutions of the VM equations in the form of large-amplitude magnetic holes.

This model belongs to the class of gradient type systems for which the free energy can only decrease in time. It reveals a behavior typical for subcritical bifurcations: below the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> threshold, all localized stationary structures are unstable, while above threshold, the system displays a blow-up behavior. It is shown that taking the electrons into account (non-zero temperature) does not change the structure of the asymptotic model. For bi-Maxwellian distribution functions for both electrons and ions, the model predicts the formation of magnetic holes. The second part contains original results concerning two-dimensional steady mirror structures which can form in the saturated regime. Based on Grad-Shafranov-like equations, a gyrotropic plasma, where the pressures in the static regime are only functions of the amplitude of the local magnetic field, is shown to be amenable to a variational principle with a free energy density given by the parallel tension. This approach is used to demonstrate that small-amplitude static holes constructed slightly below the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> threshold identify with lump solitons of KPII equation and turn out to be unstable. It is also shown that regularizing effects such as finite Larmor radius corrections cannot be ignored in the description of large-amplitude mirror structures. Using the gradient method, which is based on a variational principle for anisotropic MHD taking into account ion finite Larmor radius effects, we found both one-dimensional magnetic structures in the form of stripes and two-dimensional bubbles when the magnetic field component transverse to the plane is increased. These structures realize minimum of the free energy. Comment: 14 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1312. 0373, arXiv: 0710. 4428, arXiv: 1210. 429...|$|E

While the dynamics of the instability and the effect of trapped particles have been studied extensively in theoretical models and numerical simulations, only spurious observations of the trapped ions were published to date. In this work we used data from the Cluster spacecraft to perform the first detailed experimental study of ion velocity distribution associated with mirror mode oscillations. We show a conclusive evidence for the predicted cooling of resonant ions at small parallel velocities and heating of trapped ions at intermediate pitch angles...|$|E
40|$|Kinetic {{mechanisms}} {{for the growth}} and saturation of the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> are described using one-dimensional hybrid simulations. Two parameter regimes are considered. In the first regime, a relatively small ion anisotropy excites a slowly growing instability that produces small-amplitude waves; most ions respond to the waves as an adiabatic fluid. In the second regime a large anisotropy excites a rapidly growing instability that generates large-amplitude waves; the response of many ions {{in this case is}} nonadiabatic. The difference in ion response is due to the relative importance of two ion populations, resonant and nonresonant. Resonant ions, those ions with low velocities parallel to the background magnetic field, contribute to the growth of the instability {{as a result of their}} gyrointeractions with the noncoplanar component of the waves electric field and respond to the mirror waves nonadiabatically. Nonreasonant ions, those with large parallel velocities, respond as an adiabatic fluid. In both regimes, ion anisotropy is reduced by means of the magnetic mirror force; in the second regime, the anisotropy reduction reduces the free energy available for wave growth and leads to the saturation of the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability...</b>|$|E

(1970), special {{attention has been}} paid to static pressure-balanced structures in the form of magnetic holes or humps observed in regions of the solar wind and of planetary magnetosheaths where the β parameter is relatively large and the ion perpendicular temperature exceeds the parallel one. Although alternative interpretations have been proposed, these structures are usually viewed as associated with the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> discovered in 1957 by Vedenov and Sagdeev. After reviewing observational results provided by satellite missions, high-resolution numerical simulations of the Vlasov [...] Maxwell equations together with asymptotic and phenomenological models of the nonlinear dynamics near the instability threshold are discussed. The constraining effect of the <b>mirror</b> <b>instability</b> on the temperature anisotropy associated with a dominant perpendicular ion heating observed in the solar wind is reported, and recent simulations of this phenomenon based on an elaborated fluid model including low-frequency kinetic effects are briefly mentioned.

The growth rate at the instability threshold depends on the derivative of the distribution for zero parallel energy.
