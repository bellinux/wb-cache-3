The style encourages building input processors from a user-extensible set of primitives by chaining, layering, pairing and other modes of compositions. The programmer is still able, where needed, to precisely control look-ahead, the allocation of buffers, file descriptors and other resources. The style is especially suitable for processing of com-munication streams, large amount of data, and data undergone several levels of encoding such as pickling, compression, chunking, framing. It {{has been used for}} programming high-performance (HTTP) servers and web frameworks, in computational linguistics and financial trading. We exposit programming with iteratees, contrasting them with Lazy IO and the Handle-based, stdio-like IO. We relate them to online parser com-binators. We introduce a simple implementation as free monads, which lets us formally reason with iteratees. As an example, we validate several equational laws and use them to optimize iteratee programs.

40|$|Spatial {{datasets}} are {{an important}} source of context for computer applications in Sentient Computing. However, heterogeneous sensor networks present location and orientation telemetry in differing formats, with incompatible interpretation semantics, and subject to contrasting measurement and quantisation errors. Applications consume data in another set of frames of reference and are generally confined to operating in rooms and office spaces that are sensed by a single, homogeneous suite of sensors under the same ownership and administrative control. This thesis presents Scalable, Distributed Spatial Indexing (SDSI), a unifying framework designed to capture the semantics of sensor technologies and autonomously transform, re-write, and otherwise <b>massage</b> <b>data</b> so as to interface to application-level software and decouple applications and sensor hardwares to support seamless mobility. Translation Functions perform the mathematical operations necessary to convert raw sensor data to other formats. The SDSI framework ensures the preservation of the mathematical and scientific rigour associated with the interpretation of each telemetry data stream. Uncertainties and errors are also converted by Translation Functions and allow client applications to determine the accuracy and precision suitability of any sensor data for individual purposes. SDSI builds on long-standing database theory to provide security and privacy controls, allowing users to restrict access to sensitive data streams without requiring multiple, isolated data handling systems. Caching techniques are used to maintain processing throughput and network distribution provides scalable, inter-site communication through the global Internet. The evaluation includes a substantial investigation of Driveable Computing—the scope for Sentient Computing in private motor vehicles—in which spatial frames of reference are required to interpret cartographic data, interact with human occupants using natural language, interface with positioning hardware, and so forth. The conclusion, that the proposed framework is suitable and applicable to Sentient Computing, is extremely positive and poses several avenues and opportunities for continued research in the field.

40|$|Abstract Various {{problems}} in machine learning, databases, and statistics involvepairwise distances among {{a set of}} objects. It is often desirable for these distances to satisfy the properties of a metric, especially the triangle in-equality. Applications where metric data is useful include clustering, classification, metric-based indexing, and approximation algorithms forvarious graph problems. This paper presents the Metric Nearness Problem: Given a dissimilarity matrix, find the &quot;nearest &quot; matrix of distancesthat satisfy the triangle inequalities. For `p nearness measures, this pa-per develops efficient triangle fixing algorithms that compute globally optimal solutions by exploiting the inherent structure of the problem. Empirically, the algorithms have time and storage costs that are linear {{in the number of}} triangle constraints. The methods can also be easilyparallelized for additional speed. 1 Introduction Imagine that a lazy graduate student has been asked to measure the pairwise distancesamong a group of objects in a metric space. He does not complete the experiment, and he must figure out the remaining numbers before his adviser returns from her conference. Obviously, all the distances need to be consistent, but the student does not know very much about the space in which the objects are embedded. One way to solve his problem is to findthe &quot;nearest &quot; complete set of distances that satisfy the triangle inequalities. This procedure respects the measurements that have already been taken while forcing the missing numbersto behave like distances. More charitably, suppose that the student has finished the experiment, but [...] measurementsbeing what they are [...] the numbers do not satisfy the triangle inequality. The student knows that they must represent distances, so he would like to <b>massage</b> the <b>data</b> so that it corre-sponds with his a priori knowledge. Once again, the solution seems to require the &quot;nearest &quot; set of distances that satisfy the triangle inequalities.

The <b>data</b> were subjected to content analysis with a qualitative approach. It was identified that some mothers have little knowledge about the disorder of their children. Regarding the participation of children and adolescents, it was related a positive response, an immediate valuable result, with improved communication with family, more tranquility after the massage, restful sleep, improved mood and better performance school. The caregivers of children and adolescents related that their participation in the Tui Na massage sessions was productive, with acceptance by them with positive changes in daily and family life. The study participants pointed that daily difficulties of ADHD approach them to their son, decreasing anxiety and improving the quality life for the whole family. Sharing information between health professionals and family of children and adolescents about ADHD is important to understand the pathology, as well as for monitoring and further treatment...|$|R
40|$|Myofascia Trigger Point Syndrome (MTrPs) is {{trigger point}} muscle happens in musculoskeletal. Factors which {{strengthen}} and trigger the emerge of MTrPs are the muscle contraction which happens continuously, poor body position, wrong body position or movement, poor occupation activity and unsuitable workplace arrangement {{that affect the}} unergonomic work behavior. The objective of this reseacrh is to reveal the effectivity of  integrated neuromuscular  inhibition techniques (init) and massage efflurage in decreasing pain and disability in myofasial trigger point of upper trapesius muscle. The subjects this research are 34 people which are taken randomly in Puskesmas 2 Kartosuro, Surakarta with 17 samples of each group. Group 1 is integrated neuromuscular inhibition techniques (init) and group 2 is <b>massage</b> efflurage. The <b>data</b> used in this research is NDI scale taken before and after therapy. The data collected is processed by using differential test through computer base of SPSS 15. 0 version. The data analysis by using paired sample t-test, in group 1 the data resulted before therapy is 48, 35 ± 6, 68 and the data resulted after therapy is 25, 94 ± 5, 87 with p = 0, 000 (p < 0, 05).

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays {{particular}} {{emphasis is placed}} on the developmental aspects of premature infants care. Massage therapy is one of the best-known methods of caring. Due to the minimal touch policy in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), massaging is not usually performed on premature infants. However, there is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that newborn infants with complex medical conditions should not be massaged. This study aimed {{to determine the effects of}} massage with coconut and sunflower oils on oxygen saturation of infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial on 90 newborns who were admitted to Alzahra Hospital (Tabriz, Iran). The infants were divided into control and massage therapy groups (massage with coconut and sunflower oils). Data was collected using a hospital documentation form. A 15 -minute daily massage was performed for 3 days. Respiratory rate (RR), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) and oxygen saturation were measured 5 minutes before the massage, 3 times during the massage, and 5 minutes after the <b>massage.</b> The collected <b>data</b> was analyzed using a mixed model. Results: In comparison to coconut oil and control groups, mean oxygen saturation of sunflower oil group was improved. In addition, the coconut massage group showed lower oxygen saturation than the control group but was all values were within the normal range. Although massage decreased oxygen saturation, there was no need to increase FiO 2. Conclusion: Massage therapy can provide developmental care for infants treated with NCPAP...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that client expectations influence client outcomes, a valid and reliable scale for measuring the range of client expectations for both massage therapy and the behaviors of their massage therapists does not exist. Understanding how client expectations influence client outcomes would provide insight into how massage achieves its reported effects. Purpose: To develop and validate the Client Expectations of Massage Scale (CEMS), a measure of clients’ clinical, educational, interpersonal, and outcome expectations. Setting: Offices of licensed massage therapists in Iowa. Research Design: A practice-based research methodology was used to collect data from two samples of massage therapy clients. For Sample 1, 21 volunteer <b>massage</b> therapists collected <b>data</b> from their clients before the massage. Factor analysis was conducted to test construct validity and coefficient alpha was used to assess reliability. Correlational analyses with the CEMS, previous measures of client expectations, and the Life Orientation Test–Revised were examined to test the convergent and discriminant validity of the CEMS. For Sample 2, 24 massage therapists distributed study materials for clients to complete before and after a massage therapy session. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the construct, discriminant, and predictive validity of the CEMS. Participants: Sample 1 involved 320 and Sample 2 involved 321 adult massage clients. Intervention: Standard care provided by licensed massage therapists. Main Outcomes: Numeric Rating Scale for pain and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule– Revised (including the Serenity subscale). Results: The CEMS demonstrated good construct, convergent, discriminant and predictive validity, and adequate reliability. Client expectations were generally positive toward massage and their massage therapists. Positive outcome expectations had a positive effect on clients’ changes in pain and serenity. High interpersonal expectations had a negative effect on clients’ changes in serenity. Conclusions: Client expectations contribute to the nonspecific effects of massage therapy...|$|R
