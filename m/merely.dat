5|$|For Havelock, Plato's {{rejection}} of poetry was <b>merely</b> the realisation {{of a cultural}} shift {{in which he was}} a participant.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aforesaid}} {{record of}} the military actions conducted in 1044, √çmar is <b>merely</b> named {{as the son of}} Aralt, a fact which could indicate that this was how he was known to his contemporaries. If correct, the patronym preserved by the Chronicle of Mann could <b>merely</b> be a garbled form of this style.|$|E
5|$|Marceline's father moves {{throughout}} Ooo, consuming {{the souls}} of all living creatures that he can find. Finn and Marceline first try to crush him with a rock, but the resulting skirmish between father and daughter <b>merely</b> infuriates Hunson Abadeer. He assumes that Marceline is trying to kill him {{to take over the}} Nightosphere, but she <b>merely</b> wants her bass guitar back.|$|E
5|$|A Sudoku {{will remain}} valid under {{the actions of}} the Sudoku {{preserving}} symmetries (see also Jarvis). Some Sudokus are special in that some operations <b>merely</b> have the effect of relabelling the digits; several of these are listed below.|$|E
5|$|A {{real risk}} {{is not to}} be equated with a serious or grave risk, but <b>merely</b> {{something}} more than a de minimis, remote or fanciful risk.|$|E
5|$|A {{secret trust}} must be contrasted with <b>merely</b> placing a moral {{obligation}} upon the beneficiary {{to deal with the}} legacy in particular way (as in Re Snowden) and must impose a binding obligation, without discretion to act within its terms or not.|$|E
5|$|According to Capeci, {{the murder}} of Sciascia soured {{relations}} between the Bonanno and Rizzuto families. Originally considered <b>merely</b> a Canadian Bonanno crew, the Rizzutos responded by taking even less heed from New York.|$|E
5|$|After a brief spell as a printer's apprentice, Griswold {{moved to}} Syracuse where, with some friends, {{he started a}} {{newspaper}} called The Porcupine. This publication purposefully targeted locals for what was later remembered as <b>merely</b> malicious critique.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Constantinople, Basiliscus {{hid in the}} church of Hagia Sophia to escape {{the wrath of the}} people and the revenge of the Emperor. By the mediation of Verina, Basiliscus obtained the Imperial pardon, and was punished <b>merely</b> with banishment to Heraclea Sintica, in Thrace.|$|E
5|$|Although in the English {{language}} borscht refers {{almost invariably}} to a beet-based soup, in some culinary cultures there exist soups {{with the same}} or similar names where beetroots are absent or <b>merely</b> optional. The principal common trait among them is a tart flavor obtained by adding various sour-tasting ingredients.|$|E
5|$|An {{event of}} grave {{embarrassment to the}} Soviet Union came in October 1981 when one of its {{submarines}} ran aground near the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona. As this was a militarily sensitive location, Sweden took an aggressive stance on the incident, detaining the Whiskey-class sub for two weeks as they awaited an official explanation from Moscow. Eventually it was released, but Stockholm refused to accept Soviet claims that this was <b>merely</b> an accident, especially since numerous unidentified submarines had been spotted near the Swedish coast. Sweden also announced that radiation had been detected emanating from the submarine and they believed it to be carrying nuclear missiles. Moscow would neither confirm nor deny this and instead <b>merely</b> accused the Swedes of espionage.|$|E
5|$|Applying ROT13 to a {{piece of}} text <b>merely</b> {{requires}} examining its alphabetic characters and replacing each one by the letter 13 places further along in the alphabet, wrapping back to the beginning if necessary.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain {{to be a viable}} investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was <b>merely</b> good public relations, and any revenue that arose from the sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as <b>merely</b> extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E
5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and <b>merely</b> sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, {{and the lives of}} <b>merely</b> sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, will be explored in Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|Furtwangler {{notes that}} as the series grew, this plan was {{somewhat}} changed. The fourth topic expanded into detailed coverage of the individual articles of the Constitution and the institutions it mandated, while the two last topics were <b>merely</b> touched on in the last essay.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{remarked that}} here Darwin {{anticipated}} the modern {{concept of an}} ecological niche. He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but <b>merely</b> more adapted to their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In February of 2016, Konnan {{stated that}} he had lost his {{creative}} position in AAA and was now <b>merely</b> a consultant for the promotion. He then levelled several accusations at AAA regarding non-payment of talent.|$|E
5|$|In social circles, Aspasia {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser rather than <b>merely</b> an object of {{physical}} beauty. Plutarch writes that despite her immoral life, friends of Socrates brought their wives to hear her converse.|$|E
5|$|In the ending, Dwight {{shows up}} to the office imitating Jim, but Jim is <b>merely</b> {{impressed}} with {{the accuracy of the}} impersonation.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated <b>merely</b> as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used <b>merely</b> {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never <b>merely</b> a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers {{and other}} {{representatives of the}} {{entertainment}} industry, including Michael Ayers, an attorney for Toshiba Corporation, expressed surprise at Digg's decision, but suggested that a suit aimed at Digg might <b>merely</b> spread the information more widely.|$|E
5|$|Mike Huben {{has argued}} that were Assassination Politics ever to be {{accepted}} then governments would <b>merely</b> operate secretly (critiques of libertarianism). Almost all commentary so far {{has focused on the}} first nine parts of the essay and there is little on part 10.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} issues raised on appeal was that the defendants' {{political}} advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead <b>merely</b> promoted revolution as an abstract concept.|$|E
5|$|Persons {{listed below}} are not {{necessarily}} known to have epilepsy nor indicate a scholarly consensus in favour of epilepsy; <b>merely</b> that such a diagnosis has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's second theme (the B {{section of}} the rondo) indulges in a long {{harmonic}} and melodic excursion, going through the keys of the subdominant and flat submediant. Beethoven's more traditional short and simple theme <b>merely</b> consists of alternating tonic and dominant harmonies.|$|E
5|$|The Brars {{handed over}} {{management}} of the theatre to Magic Lantern Theatres in June 1998, <b>merely</b> 18 months after purchasing it. Rick Ostapchuk immediately took over double duty as {{the manager of the}} recently renovated Garneau Theatre, as well as the Princess.|$|E
5|$|The Chaldean myth the Epic of Gilgamesh, Utnapishtim {{releases}} a dove and a raven to find land; the dove <b>merely</b> circles and returns. Only then does Utnapishtim send forth the raven, {{which does not}} return, and Utnapishtim concludes the raven has found land.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks in}} the Tory periodicals, soon {{extended}} to other works by Hazlitt, killed not <b>merely</b> the sales of Characters of Shakespear's Plays but, as far {{as much of the}} general public was concerned, his reputation as a literary critic.|$|E
5|$|The bright primary {{star has}} the {{multiple}} star designation WDS19508+0852A and has three faint visual companion stars, WDS19508+0852B, C, and D. Component B is not physically close to A but <b>merely</b> appears {{close to it}} in the sky.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} a real number might have two {{different}} decimal representations is <b>merely</b> {{a reflection of the}} fact that two different sets of real numbers can have the same supremum.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} objects (observed by Cassini) {{have not}} been confirmed as solid bodies. It {{is not yet clear}} if these are real satellites or <b>merely</b> persistent clumps within the F Ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{literature}} of antiquity and {{the form of the}} ancient book reciprocally conditioned each other. The context of publication enveloped and modified literary creativity. The dividends of these investigations will thereby far exceed the satisfaction of <b>merely</b> antiquarian pleasures.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Ben takes Sawyer {{for a walk}} to high ground. Sawyer {{learns that}} he has no pacemaker; it was <b>merely</b> a con to prevent Sawyer from leaving, and Ben shows him the same rabbit from the day before, which had been <b>merely</b> sedated. Ben reveals to Sawyer that they are on a {{completely}} different island approximately twice the size of Alcatraz that overlooks the main island; escape is impossible. Upon asking why he was conned, Ben tells Sawyer that in order to gain a con artist's respect, they must be conned themselves.|$|E
5|$|The song drew {{accusations of}} racism, which the band has denied. The band members are often {{asked about the}} accusations in interviews, and have stated {{numerous}} times {{that they do not}} condone racism and are <b>merely</b> interested in the subject.|$|E
5|$|These points can {{be applied}} to the {{structure}} of The Waste Land, though there is not necessarily a fulfilment of these but <b>merely</b> a longing or discussion of them.|$|E
5|$|This is <b>merely</b> a {{heuristic}} characterization. The Dirac delta is not {{a function}} {{in the traditional sense}} as no function defined on the real numbers has these properties. The Dirac delta function can be rigorously defined either as a distribution or as a measure.|$|E
