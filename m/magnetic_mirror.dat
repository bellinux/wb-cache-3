25|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> dominates in low beta designs. Both ions and {{electrons}} {{are reflected}} from high to low density fields. This {{is known as}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> effect. The polywell's rings are arranged so the densest fields are on the outside, trapping electrons in the center. This can trap particles at low beta values.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>Mirror</b> One {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement {{is with the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices that try to use this effect. The most famous was the <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> machines, which {{was a series of}} large, expensive devices built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from the 1960s to mid 1980s. Some other examples include the magnetic bottles and Biconic cusp. Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second direct conversion energy capture, was easier to implement. As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|In high beta conditions, {{the machine}} may operate with cusp confinement. This is an {{improvement}} over the simpler <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror.</b> The MaGrid has six point cusps, each located {{in the middle of}} a ring; and two highly modified line cusps, linking the eight corner cusps located at cube vertices. The key is that these two line cusps are much narrower than the single line cusp in <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> machines, so the net losses are less. The two line cusps losses are similar to or lower than the six face-centered point cusps.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of advocacy, the cold war, and the 1970s energy crisis a massive <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> program {{was funded by the}} US federal {{government}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This program resulted in a series of large <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> devices including: 2X, Baseball I, Baseball II, the Tandem Mirror Experiment, the Tandem mirror experiment upgrade, the Mirror Fusion Test Facility and the MFTF-B. These machines were built and tested at Livermore from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s. A number of institutions collaborated on these machines, conducting experiments. These included the Institute for Advanced Study and the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. The last machine, the Mirror Fusion Test Facility cost 372 million dollars and was, at that time, the most expensive project in Livermore history. It opened on February 21, 1986 and was promptly shut down. The reason given was to balance the United States federal budget. This program was supported from within the Carter and early Reagan administrations by Edwin E. Kintner, a US Navy captain, under Alvin Trivelpiece.|$|E
25|$|For many decades, cusped {{confinement}} never behaved experimentally as was predicted. Sharply bent {{fields were}} used by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{in a series of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> machines from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. After hundreds of millions were spent, the machines still leaked plasma at the field ends. Many scientists shifted focus onto looping the fields, into a tokamak. Eventually it was thought that cusped confinement effect did not exist.|$|E
25|$|The polywell {{is a type}} {{of nuclear}} fusion reactor that uses an {{electric}} field to heat ions to fusion conditions. It is closely related to the fusor, the high beta fusion reactor, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror,</b> and the biconic cusp. A set of electromagnets generates a magnetic field that traps electrons. This creates a negative voltage, which attracts positive ions. As the ions accelerate towards the negative center, their kinetic energy rises. Ions that collide at high enough energies can fuse.|$|E

40|$|We propose {{generalized}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{that can}} be achieved by excitations of sole electric resonances. Conventional approaches to obtain <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirrors</b> rely heavily on exciting the fundamental magnetic dipoles, whereas here we reveal that besides magnetic resonances, electric resonances of higher orders can be also employed to obtain highly efficient <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Based on the electromagnetic duality, it is also shown that electric mirrors can be achieved by exciting magnetic resonances. We provide direct demonstrations of the generalized mirrors proposed in a simple system of one-dimensional periodic array of all-dielectric wires, which may shed new light to many advanced fields of photonics related to resonant multipolar excitations and interferences.

25|$|A May 2010 paper {{discussed}} a small device's ability to capture electrons. The paper posited that the machine had an ideal magnetic field strength that maximized {{its ability to}} catch electrons. The paper analyzed magnetic confinement in the polywell using analytical solutions and simulations. The work linked the magnetic confinement in the polywell to <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> theory. The 2011 work used Particle-in-cell simulations to model particle motion in polywells with a small electron population. Electrons behaved {{in a similar manner}} to particles in the biconic cusp.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, fusion {{researchers}} have investigated various confinement concepts. The early {{emphasis was on}} three main systems: z-pinch, stellarator and <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror.</b> The current leading designs are the tokamak and inertial confinement (ICF) by laser. Both designs are being built at very large scales, most notably the ITER tokamak in France, and the National Ignition Facility laser in the USA. Researchers are also studying other designs that may offer cheaper approaches. Among these alternatives there is increasing interest in magnetized target fusion and inertial electrostatic confinement.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1960s ZETA was not {{the only}} {{experiment}} to suffer from unexpected performance problems. Problems with plasma diffusion across the magnetic fields plagued both the <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> and stellarator programs, at rates that classical theory could not address. Adding more fields did not appear to correct the problems in any of the existing designs. Work slowed dramatically as teams around the world tried to better understand the physics of the plasmas in their devices. Pfirsch and Schluter were the first to make a significant advance, suggesting that much larger and more powerful machines would be needed to correct these problems. An attitude of pessimism took root across the entire field.|$|E

50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>mirrors</b> play an {{important}} role in other types of magnetic fusion energy devices such as tokamaks, where the toroidal magnetic field is stronger on the inboard side than on the outboard side. The resulting effects are known as neoclassical. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>mirrors</b> also occur in nature. Electrons and ions in the magnetosphere, for example, will bounce back and forth between the stronger fields at the poles, leading to the Van Allen radiation belts.|$|R
25|$|As an {{electron}} enters a magnetic field, it feels a Lorentz force and corkscrews. The radius of this motion is the gyroradius. As it moves it loses some energy as x-rays, {{every time it}} changes speed. The electron spins faster and tighter in denser fields, as it enters the MaGrid. Inside the MaGrid, single electrons travel straight through the null point, due to their infinite gyroradius in regions of no magnetic field. Next, they head towards {{the edges of the}} MaGrid field and corkscrew tighter along the denser magnetic field lines. This is typical electron cyclotron resonance motion. Their gyroradius shrinks and when they hit a dense magnetic field they can be reflected using the <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> effect. Electron trapping has been measured in polywells with Langmuir probes.|$|E

40|$|Among the {{different}} proposed mechanisms for generating parallel electric fields, <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirroring</b> of charged particles {{seems to be}} the most plausible. In the present paper, it is suggested that <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirroring</b> is the basic cause of parallel electric fields in the magnetosphere and that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirroring</b> effect may be able to form the basis of an auroral theory that can remove a major portion of the ambiguity of observations. In the model proposed, the parallel electric field is due to a magnetic confinement of a negatively charged hot collision-free plasma. A transfer of electron gyroenergy into wave energy tends to weaken this confinement; if this energy transfer becomes too strong, the parallel potential gradient will break down. Hence, from this model, in contrast to certain other models of parallel electric fields, {{only a small fraction of}} the total auroral particle energy may be expected to be transformed into electromagnetic wave energy during the acceleration process...|$|R
