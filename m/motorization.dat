Before the advent of <b>motorization,</b> it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches {{in the fields and}} for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and it was not uncommon for farmers in the region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAcoustic {{feedback}} {{inside a}} car is composed of different sources, which give information on the drivers actions and the dynamic state of the car. This acoustic feedback influences the drivers perception of movement in a multisensory integration. The development of electric <b>motorizations</b> brings new balance between noise sources inside the car, due {{to the loss of}} engine sound that is present in traditional internal combustion engine cars. To study the influence of this modified noise source balance on driving, we focused on speed perception. A car simulator was used for this purpose. 24 participants were asked to accelerate up to a given target speed, while the speedometer was hidden. We studied the speed they actually reached with three acoustic feedbacks (engine, electric motor, no sound), in two visual conditions (night and day). We found out that acoustic feedback can alter the drivers speed perception...|$|R

A combination of high percentage of public transport use, existence of para-transit, poor service quality to respond with high level of <b>motorizations</b> are some of the features of urban public transport in East Asian developing cities. Data from Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul, Taipei, Ho Chi Minh City, Manila, Jakarta, and Bangkok are analyzed to develop a thorough understanding on the specific features of public transport in the East Asian Mega-cities. Several reform policies and strategies are proposed, including promoting public transport technology to shift the competition from costs to quality, fare integration, suitable financing options, and an appropriate implementation timing, as well as developing a public transport hierarchy to suit the increasing demand for urban mobility...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: A new {{approach}} {{for the implementation}} of quality philosophy Zero Quality Defects with usage of the Poka-Yoke method in the polish organization has been presented. Design/methodology/approach: The possibility of usage of mistake proofing device is connected with monitoring and improvement of operations in the process. Findings: At the present time the organizations should implement quality tools, techniques, methods which support the prevention strategy and should pay attention to improving each element and operations in the process. Research limitations/implications: Generally activity aim at prevent defects has been described. The Poka-Yoke method of preventing errors by putting limits on how operation can be performed in order to force the correct completion of the operation has been presented.

40|$|Electrical drives {{are more}} and more used with {{embedded}} applications (automotive, aeronautics, space, …) in place of conventional <b>motorizations.</b> The specific constraints imposed to the volume and power of such systems lead to optimize the utilization of all components of the electric power train. The rated functioning zones are then shifted to-wards their limits, which induces to run the drive very often at voltage and current limits. Finally, the necessity of fault tolerant characteristics associated to cost constraints leads to the choice of intrinsic fault-tolerant systems, avoiding then the use of several identical systems. This context leads to the use of multi-phase inverter-machine systems (having more than three phases) working at voltage and current limits. Some laboratories work on this field of research and collaborations have already been initiated with Liverpool (LJMU) and Malaga (UMA) universities. One of the challenging methods consists in using Model Predictive Control. However, due to the very short time constant of such drives, very high constraints are impose {{in order to be able}} to use such algorithm in real time.

25|$|<b>Motorization</b> of the 1930s {{raised a}} number of concerns, {{starting}} {{with the need to}} secure a continuous fuel supply. The new formations had a significantly larger footprint on the march: the 1932 French motorized division took up 52 kilometers of road space compared to 11.5 kilometers for a horse-mounted formation, raising concerns about control and vulnerability. The Spanish Civil War and other conflicts of 1930s did not provide definite solutions and the issues remained unresolved until the onset of World War II. Only the German blitzkrieg achieved in the Battle of France finally persuaded the militaries of the world, including the United States, that the tank had replaced the horse on the battlefield.|$|E

In 1937, he graduated from the Red Army Military Academy of Mechanization and <b>Motorization.</b> Rudkin transferred to become a department head of the NKVD troops in Ukraine and Crimea in November, but was transferred to the reserve in October 1938.

25|$|Another factor {{prompting}} <b>motorization</b> was {{the decline}} of national horse stocks and the inability to restore them in reasonable time. Of all the major powers, only the United Kingdom, weakened {{by the loss of}} Ireland, was in part compelled to motorize for this reason; horse stocks in Germany, the United States and the Soviet Union remained sufficient for at least their peacetime armies. In 1928 the United Kingdom became the first nation to begin the replacement of horse cavalry with motorized troops and by 1939 had become the first to motorize their national army, although some Yeomanry regiments plus regular cavalry units serving overseas remained mounted. British experimental armored units had performed impressively since 1926, but, facing resistance from the traditional branches of service, remained unpopular among top brass until the Battle of France.|$|E

25|$|Beginning on June 1, 1940 {{under the}} mayoral {{administration}} of Fiorello H. La Guardia, the Board of Transportation {{took over the}} assets of the IRT and BMT for municipal operations in an event referred to as unification. The event placed the three rapid transit systems − IRT, BMT, IND − under a single operator. The BOT also inherited the BMT's extensive surface transit network in Brooklyn and Queens, which consisted primarily of streetcar lines along with a few electric trolley coach and diesel-powered bus routes. The BOT proceeded to close the IRT-operated Second and Ninth Avenue elevated lines in Manhattan, and the BMT-operated Third and Fifth Avenue elevateds in Brooklyn. On December 15, 1940, the IND's second Manhattan trunk line − the IND Sixth Avenue Line − was completed. In 1941, the BOT began motorizing the former BMT streetcar lines in Brooklyn and Queens into diesel bus routes or trolley coach routes. The further <b>motorization</b> of surface lines, and the completion of the IND system, however, was delayed due to World War II. Unification made the Board of Transportation the largest public transit operator in North America, in addition to being one of the few systems under public ownership at the time.|$|E

While German infantry divisions generally had a strength of 15,000–17,000 soldiers {{at the start of}} World War II, this had gradually been reduced to an official (table of organization) size of 12,500, and by November 1944, the average actual strength of a Heer division was 8,761 men. In an attempt to cope with the manpower shortages plaguing the Wehrmacht, the Volksgrenadier divisions were created in 1944. Their average total strength was just over 10,000 men per division. Although about [...] of these were experienced veterans, half were fresh conscripts and convalescents, while the remainder were transferees from the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine. These divisions often received the newest small-arms, but were deficient in artillery and <b>motorization,</b> severely limiting their tactical usefulness. In the case of LXXXI Corps, the 183rd Volksgrenadier Division, though overstrength by 643 men, had only been activated in September, meaning that the division had not had time to train as a unit. The 246th Volksgrenadier Division was in a similar state, many of its personnel having received fewer than ten days of infantry training.
