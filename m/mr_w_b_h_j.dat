50|$|Lanesborough {{was founded}} in 1930 by Mr A. E. J. Inglis and <b>Mr</b> <b>W.</b> <b>H.</b> <b>B.</b> Walker. Both were former {{assistant}} masters at Dulwich College. An initial advertisement stated ‘Boys will be prepared for Public School and the Royal Navy.’ There were only 19 pupils but, {{by the end of}} the year, numbers had risen to 55 boys. By 1935 there were 90 boys including a dozen or so boarders. The school continued to function during the war, and in 1949, Mr Stuart Swayne who had been serving in the armed forces returned to become joint headmaster. When Mr Inglis retired in 1953, Mr Swayne took over with Mr. Walker. Mr. Walker retired in April 1955. Expansion continued in 1952 when the pre-prep department took occupancy of Braganza, a house in Aldersey Road. In 1964 another property in Aldersey Road called Kitano, became the Head’s house. Its grounds were donated as extra school playing fields. The grounds became their present size when they were further extended by the acquisition of gardens of Markham House in 1970.|$|R
