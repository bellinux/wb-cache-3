5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|Mafiosi {{generally}} do not involve themselves {{in the management of}} the businesses they protect or arbitrate. Lack of competence is a common reason, but <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> is to divest themselves of any interests that may conflict with their roles as protectors and arbitrators. This makes them more trusted by their clients, who need not fear their businesses being taken over.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with her}} theosophical activities, Besant {{continued}} to actively participate in political matters. She {{had joined the}} Indian National Congress. As the name suggested, this was originally a debating body, which met each year to consider resolutions on political issues. <b>Mostly</b> <b>it</b> demanded more of a say for middle-class Indians in British Indian government. It had not yet developed into a permanent mass movement with local organisation. About this time her co-worker Leadbeater moved to Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Sugarcane smut infects all {{sugarcane}} species {{unless the}} species is resistant. The damage caused depends on the susceptibility of the species. Sugarcane fields are planted using vegetative cuttings from mother plants so {{they have the same}} genetic make-up of the parent plant. Seeds are not used in propagation because sugarcane is a multi-species hybrid and therefore is difficult to breed. Sugarcane smuts can also infect some other grass species outside of sugarcane. However, <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> remains on plants of the genus Saccharum.|$|E
25|$|Moneylending {{during this}} period was largely a matter of private loans {{advanced}} to persons persistently in debt or temporarily so until harvest time. <b>Mostly,</b> <b>it</b> was undertaken by exceedingly rich men prepared {{to take on a}} high risk if the profit looked good; interest rates were fixed privately and were almost entirely unrestricted by law. Investment was always regarded as a matter of seeking personal profit, often on a large scale. Banking was of the small, back-street variety, run by the urban lower-middle class of petty shopkeepers. By the 3rd century, acute currency problems in the Empire drove such banking into decline. The rich who were in a position {{to take advantage of the}} situation became the moneylenders when the increasing tax demands in the last declining days of the Empire crippled and eventually destroyed the peasant class by reducing tenant-farmers to serfs. It was evident that usury meant exploitation of the poor.|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave a {{negative}} review. He disliked {{the characterization of}} Chuck Barris and commented that [...] "with its multiplicity of over-stylized looks and slick gimmicks, Dangerous Mind was doubtless more stimulating to direct than {{it will be for}} audiences to experience." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli wrote a mixed critique. [...] "George Clooney is eager to show how much he has learned {{at the hands of the}} A-list filmmakers he has toiled under. So we get a style that is about 50% Steven Soderbergh and 50% Coen brothers.

2500|$|... "a shrewd {{bargain for}} the United States. It bet, in effect, on England rather than France as the hegemonic European {{power of the}} future, which proved prophetic. It {{recognized}} the massive dependence of the American economy on trade with England. In a sense it was a precocious preview of the Monroe Doctrine (1823), for it linked American security and economic development to the British fleet, which provided a protective shield of incalculable value throughout the nineteenth century. <b>Mostly,</b> <b>it</b> postponed war with England until America was economically and politically more capable of fighting one." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kirshbaum, {{over the}} years the Israeli Government has {{continued}} to cancel and modify some of the Defence (Emergency) Regulations of 1945, but <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> has added more as it has continued to extend its declared state of emergency.

2500|$|While {{the style}} of Amarone has existed in the region for centuries, it was very rarely made as a {{deliberate}} wine style. <b>Mostly</b> <b>it</b> was produced in warm vintages when batches of wines destined for sweet recioto were unintentionally allowed to ferment completely dry. The modern concept of Amarone {{has its roots in}} the early 1950s when producers [...] "rediscovered" [...] the style and began deliberately using yeast strains that could ferment the high levels of sugars in the wine completely into alcohol. The first completely dry Amarones that were commercially marketed were the 1953 vintages produced by Bolla and Bertani. In 2009, the production of Amarone wine in the Valpolicella zone achieved DOCG status. During the petitioning process, the wine producers in the region established several quality control regulations including quotas on the amount of grapes grown in the fertile plains that could be used in Amarone production. Another measure was the 2003 removal of Molinara from the list of mandatory blending grapes.|$|E
2500|$|Co-written by Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall, Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera was a three-hour-long {{musical comedy}} (Vivian {{called it a}} [...] "comic opera"), {{produced}} by Ki, directed by Vivian (working with both actors and orchestra at the same time), and performed on the Old Pro over a two-week run up to Christmas in December 1985.

Its conception {{was based on a}} series of tales Ki wrote about a New York City alley cat and on Vivian's life as a Bonzo frontman. In its final form, it was a surreal and dazzling cross-cultural mix of music hall, Broadway, and Thirties screwball comedies. But <b>mostly,</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "just being itself," [...] as Vivian would say. It played to sell-out audiences every single night of its run, attracted people from Scotland to the USA, and it garnered wonderful, if slightly puzzled, reviews from not only the Bristol press, but The Guardian and The Times.|$|E
