40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 153 - 155) Active Noise Control (ANC) {{in three}} dimensional space {{is the basis}} for investigations presented in this work. In an effort to expand and broaden the applicability of active noise control, new concepts of an integrated audio / ANC system are devised and explored. The expansion of ANC to include audio capabilities allows for re-examination of tradition error-path modeling schemes. An introduction to the concept of ANC is shown through the one dimensional single channel ANC system. It is also an introductory goal to describe the adaptive algorithms necessary in ANC. Multiple channel extensions to the single channel ANC system are derived to make the transition from the simplified one dimensional system to the relatively more complicated three dimensional ANC system. Acoustical considerations are given, so that three dimensional ANC algorithms may be developed to interface successfully with their acoustical environment. Performance expectations of the three dimensional ANC system are given to complete the acoustical evaluations, and more concretely show the interdependence of algorithm development and acoustical phenomena in three dimensional enclosures. Review of error-path modeling precedes the Musical Interference Suppression (MIS) algorithm used to successfully integrate audio to the ANC system. It is further shown that the <b>MIS</b> <b>process</b> provides new opportunities to off-line, or partial on-line model the time varying error-paths. The evolution to a full digital ANC / audio system allows migration to digital audio signal processing, whereby system hardware resources are fully shared to accommodate both facets of the integrated system. Several digital audio signal processing algorithms are developed; the most relevant to this thesis is adaptive inverse equalization. Multiple point adaptive equalization uses a similar algorithm structure as the multi-channel ANC system. This new audio processing technique is very sophisticated by audio standards, but is a familiar re-application of the multiple error LMS algorithm derived for three dimensional active noise control.

50|$|Modulation {{instability}} (MI), {{leads to}} the breakup of a continuous wave (CW) or quasi-continuous wave fields, which becomes a train of fundamental solitons. It is important to stress that the solitons generated in this regime are fundamental, as several papers on CW and quasi-CW supercontinuum formation have accredited short wavelength generation to soliton fission and dispersive wave generation as described above. In a similar manner to the soliton fission regime, the long wavelength side of the continuum is generated by the solitons undergoing intra-pulse Raman scattering and self-frequency shifting to longer wavelengths. As the <b>MI</b> <b>process</b> is noise driven, a distribution of solitons with different energies are created, resulting in different rates of self-frequency shifting. The net result is that MI driven soliton-Raman continua tends to be spectrally much smoother than those generated in the fission regime. Short wavelength generation is driven by four-wave mixing, especially for higher peak powers in the quasi-CW regime. In the pure CW regime, short wavelength generation has only recently been achieved at wavelengths shorter than those of a 1 μm pump source. In this case soliton trapping {{has been shown to}} play a role in short wavelength generation in the MI driven regime.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{activity}} of neuronal populations in the primary motor cortex (<b>MI),</b> <b>processed</b> by the population vector method, faithfully predicts upcoming movements. In our previous studies we found that single neurons responded differently during movements of one arm vs. combined movements of the two arms. It was, therefore, not clear whether the population vector approach could produce reliable movement predictions also for bimanual movements. This study tests this question by comparing the predictive quality of population vectors for unimanual and bimanual arm movements. We designed a bimanual motor task that requires coordinated movements of the two arms, in which each arm may move in eight directions, and recorded single unit activity in the MI of two rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys during the performance of unimanual and bimanual arm movements. We analysed the activity of 212 MI cells from both hemispheres and found that, despite bimanual related activity, the directional tuning and preferred directions of most cells were preserved in unimanual and bimanual movements. We demonstrate that population vectors, constructed from the activity of MI cells, predict accurately the direction of movement both for unimanual and for bimanual movements even when the two arms move simultaneously in different directions...|$|R

After <b>MI</b> surgery, 2 weeks of treatment with the H 2 S donor NaHS alleviated ischaemic injury. Meanwhile, in ischemia myocardium, three H 2 S-producing enzymes, cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), and 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3 -MST) significantly increased. Plasma H 2 S levels were also elevated. In vitro, NaHS treatment protected cardiomyocytes from hypoxic injury and raised CBS levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Different from in vivo results, however, CSE or 3 -MST expression did not change. NaHS treatment increased the activity of CSE/CBS but not of 3 -MST. When CSE was either knocked down (in vitro) or knocked out (in vivo), H 2 S levels significantly decreased, which subsequently exacerbated the ischaemic injury. Meanwhile, the expressions of CBS and 3 -MST increased due to compensation. Conclusions. Exogenous H 2 S treatment changed the expressions of three H 2 S-producing enzymes and H 2 S levels after MI, suggesting a new and indirect regulatory mechanism for H 2 S production and its contribution to cardiac protection.

40|$|The {{consequences}} {{of losing the}} ability to move a limb are traumatic. One approach that examines the impact of pathological limb nonuse on the brain involves temporary immobilization of a healthy limb. Here, we investigated immobilization-induced plasticity in the motor imagery (MI) circuitry during hand immobilization. We assessed these changes with a multimodal paradigm, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural activation, magnetoencephalography (MEG) to track neuronal oscillatory dynamics, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess corticospinal excitability. fMRI results show a significant decrease in neural activation for MI of the constrained hand, localized to sensorimotor areas contralateral to the immobilized hand. MEG results show a significant decrease in beta desynchronization and faster resynchronization in sensorimotor areas contralateral to the immobilized hand. TMS results show a significant increase in resting motor threshold in motor cortex contralateral to the constrained hand, suggesting a decrease in corticospinal excitability in the projections to the constrained hand.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Questions remain {{about how}} brief motivational {{interventions}} (BMIs) for unhealthy alcohol use work, and addressing these questions {{may be important}} for improving their efficacy. Therefore, we assessed the effects of various characteristics of BMIs on drinking outcomes across 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Audio recordings of 314 BMIs were coded. We used the global rating scales of the Motivational Interviewing Skills Code (MISC) 2. 1 : counselor's acceptance, empathy, and motivational interviewing (MI) spirit, and patient's self-exploration were rated. MI proficiency was defined as counselor's rating scale scores ≥ 5. We also used the structure, confrontation, and advice subscale scores of the Therapy Process Rating Scale and the Working Alliance Inventory. We examined these process characteristics in interventions across 1 U. S. RCT of middle-aged medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use (n =  124) and 2 Swiss RCTs of young men with binge drinking in a nonclinical setting: Swiss-one (n =  62) and Swiss-two (n =  128). We assessed the associations between these characteristics and drinks/d reported by participants 3 to 6  months after study entry. RESULTS: In all 3 RCTs, mean MISC counselor's rating scales scores were consistent with MI proficiency. In overdispersed Poisson regression models, most BMI characteristics were not significantly associated with drinks/d in follow-up. In the U. S. RCT, confrontation and self-exploration were associated with more drinking. Giving advice {{was significantly associated with}} less drinking in the Swiss-one RCT. Contrary to expectations, MI spirit was not consistently associated with drinking across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Across different populations and settings, intervention characteristics viewed as central to efficacious BMIs were neither robust nor consistent predictors of drinking outcome. Although there may be alternative reasons why the level of <b>MI</b> <b>processes</b> was not predictive of outcomes in these studies (limited variability in scores), efforts to understand what makes BMIs efficacious may require attention to factors beyond intervention process characteristics typically examined...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: While {{research}} indicates that Motivational Interviewing (MI) is effective for reducing substance use, {{little is known about}} whether brief MI-based interventions reduce drug use in a primary care setting, or what processes impact outcomes. Mixed findings in <b>MI</b> <b>process</b> studies have led investigators to call for research exploring alternative process variables that may predict outcomes. The current study is a secondary data analysis using coded audio-recordings from a randomized controlled trial that tested the efficacy of two brief MI-based interventions as part of the `Assessing Screening Plus brief Intervention's Resulting Efficacy to stop drug use' (ASPIRE) trial. It was hypothesized that skill in affirming clients and enhancing self-efficacy (also assessed as a composite self-enhancement variable) would be associated with lower frequency of drug use at 6 weeks and 6 months after controlling for baseline drug use and indicators of general MI proficiency. METHODS: Audio-recordings from two intervention conditions [Enhanced Motivational Intervention (EMI; N= 176) and Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI; N= 174) ] were coded with behavior counts and global interventionist skill ratings using an established coding system for MI and a study-specific coding manual. A series of negative binomial regression models were conducted that were stratified by intervention due to the different goals and characteristics of the two interventions. Secondary and tertiary analyses examined moderators including MI Spirit and patient baseline ratings of self-efficacy. RESULTS: There were no significant findings for the main effects models (Incidence Rate Ratio range. 71 - 1. 29). Only patient self-efficacy moderated the relationship between self-enhancement composite and 6 week outcome in the BNI condition; Self-enhancement composite was associated with lower frequency of drug use at 6 weeks in the BNI condition for those with low self-efficacy at baseline. Discussion: Overall, the results provided little support for the view that therapist skill in affirmation or enhancing self-efficacy was predictive of drug use outcomes in one-session interventions in primary care. The restricted range of interventionist skill ratings may account, in part, for these intervention process findings. Future work should explore the role of these interventionist variables on proximal indicators of change (i. e., intention) and drug use in MI-based interventions with demonstrated efficacy...|$|R

40|$|CMC {{materials}} offer {{a unique}} combination of properties at high {{as well as}} at medium and low temperatures, which can not be achieved by any other materials like metals or monolithic ceramics. However, CMC materials are also very expensive materials due to high raw material and process cost. These drawback could be cut down partially by adding melt infiltration as an economically manufacturing process to well established CVI and PIP / LPI. <b>MI</b> <b>processes</b> are characterised by the use of low cost matrix precursors and carbon fibres, which, in some cases, even {{do not have to be}} coated, as well as by short process times. The SiC-matrix is build up almost simultaneously in the whole volume of the part in one single process step and no multiple infiltration cycles are needed to densify C- as well as SiC fibre reinforced CMC. Therefore, even very large, complex shaped and thin walled lightweight structures as well as very thick walled components can be realized in near net shape technique. Compared to CMC materials derived from CVI and LPI, MI based C/SiC, C/C-SiC and SiC/SiC materials offer significantly lower open porosities, leading to higher shear strength and thermal conductivity. However, lower tensile strength of C/SiC and C/C-SiC as well as limited lifetime of SiC/SiC materials caused by free Si in the matrix, attacking the fibres in long term use at high temperatures are still a challenge. After more than 20 years of development and of gaining operational experiences in first aerospace applications, MI-CMC materials have just found their way out of the laboratories into high performance products for industrial market. Typical application areas are TPS structures for spacecraft, hot structures for rocket propulsion, gas turbines and nuclear reactors, thermally stable structures and friction materials. The introduction of C/SiC automotive brake disks in serial production is a breakthrough and an important milestone in CMC technology, offering a high potential for further applications of C/SiC and C/C-SiC materials in other industrial areas. The further development will not only be focused on low cost processes and the improvement of material properties and environmental barrier coatings, but will also concentrate on providing design and simulation tools in combination with convincing, non destructive evaluation methods. With the later, scientists and engineers should be able to reliable calculate lifetime as well as damage and failure behaviour, which is a basic prerequisite for future applications of CMC components in very promising, but challenging, safety critical applications fields. ...|$|R

However, in multi-modal medical image registration, MI-based methods with Gaussian pyramid may suffer from the problem of short capture ranges especially at the lower resolution levels. This paper proposes a novel and straightforward multimodal image registration method based on wavelet representation, in which two matching criteria are used including sum of difference (SAD) for improving the registration robustness and MI for assuring the registration accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains a longer capture range than the traditional MI-based Gaussian pyramid method meanwhile maintaining comparable accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|Insulator-to-metal (MI) phase {{transition}} in vanadium dioxide (VO 2) thin films with controlled lattice distortion was investigated by thermopower measurements. VO 2 epitaxial films with different crystallographic orientations, grown on (0001) alpha-Al 2 O 3, (11 - 20) alpha-Al 2 O 3, and (001) TiO 2 substrates, showed significant decrease of absolute value of Seebeck coefficient (S) from ~ 200 to 23 microV K- 1, {{along with a}} sharp drop in electrical resistivity (rho), due to the transition from an insulator to a metal. The MI transition temperatures observed both in rho (Trho) and S (TS) for the VO 2 films systematically decrease with lattice shrinkage in the pseudo-rutile structure along c-axis, accompanying a broadening of the MI transition temperature width. Moreover, the onset TS, where the insulating phase starts to become metallic, is much lower than onset Trho. This difference is attributed to the sensitivity of S for the detection of hidden metallic domains in the majority insulating phase, which cannot be detected in rho-measurements. Consequently, S-measurements provide a straightforward and excellent approach for {{a deeper understanding of the}} <b>MI</b> transition <b>process</b> in VO 2.

40|$|Communication, Ocean And Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (<b>MI)</b> {{images are}} <b>processed</b> for radiometric and {{geometric}} correction from raw image data. When intermediate image data are matched and compared with reference landmark {{images in the}} geometrical correction process, various techniques for edge detection can be applied. It is essential to have a precise and correct edged image in this process, since its matching with the reference {{is directly related to}} the accuracy of the ground station output images. An edge detection method based on neural networks is applied for the ground processing of MI images for obtaining sharp edges in the correct positions. The simulation results are analyzed and characterized by comparing them with the results of conventional methods, such as Sobel and Canny filters...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundBone marrow {{transplantation}} (BMT) {{is commonly}} used in experimental studies to investigate the contribution of BM-derived circulating cells to different disease processes. During studies investigating the cardiac response to acute myocardial infarction (MI) induced by permanent coronary ligation in mice that had previously undergone BMT, we found that BMT itself affects the remodelling response. Methods and resultsCompared to matched naive mice, animals that had previously undergone BMT developed significantly less post-MI adverse remodelling, infarct thinning and contractile dysfunction as assessed by serial magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiac rupture in male mice was prevented. Histological analysis showed that the infarcts of mice that had undergone BMT had a significantly higher number of inflammatory cells, surviving cardiomyocytes and neovessels than control mice, as well as evidence of significant haemosiderin deposition. Flow cytometric and histological analyses demonstrated a higher number of alternatively activated (M 2) macrophages in myocardium of the BMT group compared to control animals even before MI, and this increased further in the infarcts of the BMT mice after <b>MI.</b> ConclusionsThe <b>process</b> of BMT itself substantially alters tissue macrophage phenotype and the subsequent response to acute MI. An increase in alternatively activated macrophages in this setting appears to enhance cardiac recovery after MI...|$|R
