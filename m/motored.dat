25|$|The second {{generation}} (DSB class MM-FU-MU-FS) was built from 1967 to 1978 by Frichs A/S (<b>motored</b> cars) and Scandia (trailer cars). They saw {{the introduction of}} the signature red colour that was to characterize subsequent generations of rolling stock.|$|E
25|$|The {{specification}} {{for rolling}} stock {{is based on}} stainless steel-bodied three-car formations, a trailer between two <b>motored</b> driving units. Internal wide gangways provide ease of passenger movement and assist in load distribution. Trains are air-conditioned throughout with designated space for disability access.

50|$|Beta <b>motor</b> neurons (β <b>motor</b> neurons), {{also called}} beta motoneurons, are {{a kind of}} lower <b>motor</b> neuron, along with alpha <b>motor</b> neurons and gamma <b>motor</b> neurons. Beta <b>motor</b> neurons {{innervate}} intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles with collaterals to extrafusal fibers (type of slow twitch fibers). Axons of beta <b>motor</b> neurons (as alpha and gamma <b>motor</b> neurons) are myelinated. Alpha, gamma and beta <b>motor</b> neurons are all efferent neurons that originate from the anterior grey column of the spinal cord and travel to skeletal muscles. Alpha <b>motor</b> fibers have a larger diameter and higher conduction velocity than beta and gamma <b>motor</b> fibers.|$|R
25|$|Each {{train is}} made up of two 4-car units of the {{configuration}} Driving Motor - Trailer - Non Driving Motor - Uncoupling (Shunting) Non Driving Motor, which are coupled back-to-back. The trains are maintained at the Victoria line's Northumberland Park Depot, with Bombardier staff on site for warranty parts replacement. They were originally intended to have all-motored axles as in the 1992 Stock, so that they would have enough traction and acceleration for faster running times; however, it was later decided that 75% of <b>motored</b> axles would be sufficient, which reduced project costs by around £10 million (about 3.5% of the overall cost). They have mechanical-only Scharfenberg couplers.|$|E
25|$|The Shinkansen {{has used}} the {{electric}} multiple unit configuration from the outset, with the 0 Series Shinkansen having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations (e.g. Talgo used the locomotive configuration with the AVE Class 102 and continues with it for the Talgo AVRIL {{on account of the}} fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of the Talgo Pendular system). In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of <b>motored</b> axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.|$|E

The yacht Clwyd was swamped and eventually overturned when the keel fell off, the crew were rescued by Nynja Go then transferred to the radio relay vessel. The NZ yacht Swuzzlebubble VIII was rolled 360 degrees by a breaking wave, turtled, dismasted and swamped. On deck crew harnessed on were all recovered. The crew then cut the rig off, put out a No 3 headsil as a sea anchor and bailed her out while other yachts stood nearby. They managed to start the engine and <b>motored</b> into Eden. Meanwhile, Prime Factor of Adelaide came off a big wave at speed when the mast and the main bulkhead to which it was fastened pulled {{straight out of the}} deck of the boat and disappeared over the side. Two crew members of Advantaged were injured when the yacht capsized, snapping the mast off at the base, four crew were flung overboard but quickly recovered. The navigator was thrown through a bulkhead, head first. On Atara the mast slammed through the port side and it began taking water, but reached Eden where many sought shelter and carried out repairs. Brindabella a new Jutson 75 was retired with delamination at the bow, possibly after hitting a whale. By the end of 28 December 56 yachts had retired, a further 11 by the 30th see list below. At least one of the smallest yachts sheltered in NSW ports during the worst conditions and managed to complete the race within time.|$|E
50|$|Repulsion <b>motors</b> are wound-rotor {{single-phase}} AC <b>motors</b> {{that are}} a type of induction <b>motor.</b> In a repulsion <b>motor,</b> the armature brushes are shorted together rather than connected in series with the field, as is done with universal <b>motors.</b> By transformer action, the stator induces currents in the rotor, which create torque by repulsion instead of attraction as in other <b>motors.</b> Several types of repulsion <b>motors</b> have been manufactured, but the repulsion-start induction-run (RS-IR) <b>motor</b> has been used most frequently. The RS-IR <b>motor</b> has a centrifugal switch that shorts all segments of the commutator so that the <b>motor</b> operates as an induction <b>motor</b> once it is close to full speed. Some of these <b>motors</b> also lift the brushes out of contact with source voltage regulation. Repulsion <b>motors</b> were developed before suitable <b>motor</b> starting capacitors were available, and few repulsion <b>motors</b> are sold as of 2005.|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} changes of cortical hand <b>motor</b> representation and <b>motor</b> recovery of the affected hand in subacute stroke. Methods. 17 patients with <b>motor</b> impairment of the affected hand were enrolled in an in-patient neurological rehabilitation program. Hand <b>motor</b> function tests (Wolf <b>Motor</b> Function Test, Action Research Arm Test) and neurophysiological evaluations (resting <b>motor</b> threshold, <b>motor</b> evoked potentials, <b>motor</b> map area size, <b>motor</b> map area volume, and <b>motor</b> map area location) were obtained from both hands and hemispheres at baseline and two, four, and six weeks of in-patient rehabilitation. Results. There was {{a wide spectrum of}} hand <b>motor</b> impairment at baseline and hand <b>motor</b> recovery over time. Hand <b>motor</b> function and recovery correlated significantly with (i) reduction of cortical excitability, (ii) reduction in size and volume of cortical hand <b>motor</b> representation, and (iii) a medial and anterior shift of the center of gravity of cortical hand <b>motor</b> representation within the contralesional hemisphere. Conclusion. Recovery of <b>motor</b> function of the affected hand after stroke is accompanied by definite changes in excitability, size, volume, and location of hand <b>motor</b> representation over the contralesional primary <b>motor</b> cortex. These measures may serve as surrogate markers for the outcome of hand <b>motor</b> rehabilitation after stroke...|$|R

30|$|<b>Motor</b> {{primitives}} {{are very}} important, {{given that the}} UAVs fly by selecting and performing <b>motor</b> primitives repeatedly. <b>Motor</b> primitives decide {{the quality of the}} UAVs. Therefore, the way to define <b>motor</b> primitives is very important. Traditionally, <b>motor</b> primitives are defined by setting the values of <b>motor</b> primitives linearly, which means that UAVs only fly according to the predefined path. However, because of dynamic environments, {{it is very hard to}} perform selected <b>motor</b> primitives completely. The <b>motor</b> primitives that reflect dynamic environments are demanded. In this paper, <b>motor</b> primitives are expressed by graph, which means that graph-based <b>motor</b> primitives are performed completely more than linear <b>motor</b> primitives. Therefore, graph-based <b>motor</b> primitives are proper to dynamic environments. In the future, the way to perform graph-based <b>motor</b> primitives needs to be handled.|$|R

40|$|One {{physiological}} {{method for}} estimating the <b>motor</b> unit number in a muscle depends on dividing into the maximum compound muscle action potential, the potential {{average of the}} first few <b>motor</b> unit potentials excited by a <b>motor</b> nerve stimulus above <b>motor</b> threshold. To be valid, such an average unit potential size must {{be representative of the}} whole <b>motor</b> unit population. This assumption may not be justified. The present study has shown that there are single <b>motor</b> units in healthy and abnormal, thenar, and EDB <b>motor</b> unit populations, many times larger than any <b>motor</b> unit excited close to the <b>motor</b> threshold. This finding suggests that previously reported <b>motor</b> unit estimates may not only be an overestimate of the true <b>motor</b> unit population number, but have excluded much larger <b>motor</b> units with higher thresholds. Low <b>motor</b> unit estimates in neuropathies may result from a change in the order of activation of <b>motor</b> units with the appearance of larger <b>motor</b> units, normally of higher threshold among the first few just above the <b>motor</b> threshold...|$|R
