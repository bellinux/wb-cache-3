5|$|The {{morphology}} of Proto-Central-Semitic shows {{significant changes}} compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and {{is much like}} in Classical Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (nominative), /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (but never in the construct state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: nunation (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, mimation (final /-m/) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in <b>meaning.</b> <b>In</b> other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun {{is not in the}} construct state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain <b>meaning,</b> <b>in</b> an occurrence of the word urušalemim (Jerusalem) as given in an Egyptian transcription.|$|E

5|$|The term {{metalloid}} originally {{referred to}} nonmetals. Its more recent meaning, {{as a category}} of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties, became widespread in 1940–1960. Metalloids are sometimes called semimetals, a practice that has been discouraged, as the term semimetal has a different <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> physics than in chemistry. In physics it more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance.|$|E

Though intelligent and well read, Perowne feels he has little influence over political events.|$|E

5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> this context is real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

5|$|Atwood's use of myths follows archetypal {{literary}} criticism and specifically {{the work of}} Northrop Frye and his Anatomy of Criticism.

5|$|In {{the era of}} the {{influential}} linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E
5|$|Jahanpanah was {{the fourth}} medieval city of Delhi {{established}} in 13261327 by Muhammad bin Tughlaq (1321–51), of the Delhi Sultanate. To address the constant threat of the Mongols, Tughlaq built the fortified city of Jahanpanah (<b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> Persian: “Refuge of the World”) subsuming the Adilabad fort that had {{been built in the}} 14th century and also all the establishments lying between Qila Rai Pithora and Siri Fort. Neither the city nor the fort has survived. Many reasons have been offered for such a situation. One of which is stated as the idiosyncratic rule of Mohammed bin Tughlaq when inexplicably he shifted the capital to Daulatabad in the Deccan and came back to Delhi soon after.|$|E
5|$|Lochlann, {{originally}} Laithlinn or Lothlend, {{the land}} where Amlaíb's father was king, is often identified with Norway, {{but it is not}} universally accepted that it had such a <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> early times. Several historians have proposed instead that in early times, and certainly as late as the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, Laithlinn refers to the Norse and Norse-Gael lands in the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, the Northern Isles and parts of mainland Scotland. Whatever the original sense, by the twelfth century, when Magnus Barefoot undertook his expedition to the West, it had come to mean Norway.|$|E

5|$|The Undiscovered Countrys Cold War allegory and {{references}} to literary history were recognized among researchers and cultural historians. According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, The Undiscovered Country has more references to William Shakespeare {{than any other}} Star Trek work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1. Meyer had originally intended The Wrath of Khan to be called The Undiscovered Country. Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in Hamlet (and its intended <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> The Wrath of Khan) is death, Star Trek VIs use of the phrase refers to a future where Klingons and humans coexist in peace.|$|E
