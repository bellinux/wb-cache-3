50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard high school curricula, the school {{offers a variety of}} elective classes including drawing, color and design, painting, photography, pottery, sculpture, wood technology, <b>metal</b> technology, <b>drafting,</b> and a wide array of courses in agriculture.|$|R
50|$|Dual axis linear motors also exist. These {{specialized}} {{devices have}} been used to provide direct X-Y motion for precision laser cutting of cloth and sheet <b>metal,</b> automated <b>drafting,</b> and cable forming. Also, linear induction motors with a cylindrical secondary {{have been used}} to provide simultaneous linear and rotating motion for mounting electronic devices on printed circuit boards.|$|R

50|$|Vaux Hall (1960) was {{constructed}} as the industrial arts center. Named for two Quaker financial {{supporters of the}} Institute, George Vaux, Sr. and George Vaux, Jr. Both men furthered Humphreysâ€™ bequeath for the Institute for Colored Youth, including the Emlen Trust via vigorous fundraising. Vaux Hall served <b>metal</b> technology, <b>drafting</b> and CAD applications, photography, radio and broadcast sciences and printing graphics technology which was a staple of Cheyney University through the early 1990s. Vaux continues in its importance today to the fine arts, and information technology.|$|R

50|$|The school offers Advanced Placement {{courses to}} earn college credit. Foreign {{languages}} offered include French, Spanish, and Latin. Cape Elizabeth {{is well known}} for its substantial music department supporting a Wind Symphony, Symphonic Band, Concert Choir, Select Choir, and a Treble Choir. A broad selection of elective courses are also offered, ranging from the more unusual, such as motion picture production, boat building, <b>metal</b> working, <b>drafting,</b> and digital design, to more standard fare like art fundamentals, ceramics, photography, painting and drawing, illustration and design, art studio, and typing.|$|R
40|$|The Heavy-Section Steel Irradiation Program was {{established}} to quantitatively assess the effects of neutron irradiation on the material behavior of typical reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels. During this period, fracture mechanics testing of specimens of the irradiated low upper shelf (LUS) weld were completed and analyses performed. Heat treatment of five RPV plate materials was initiated to examine phosphorus segregation effects on the fracture toughness of the heat affected zone of welds. Initial results show that all five materials exhibited very large prior austenite grain sizes {{as a consequence of}} the initial heat treatment. Irradiated and annealed specimens of LUS weld material were tested and analyzed. Four sets of Charpy V-notch (CVN) specimens were aged at various temperatures and tested to examine the reason for overrecovery of upper shelf energy that has been observed. Molecular dynamics cascade simulations were extended to 40 keV and have provided information representative of most of the fast neutron spectrum. Investigations of the correlation between microstructural changes and hardness changes in irradiated model alloys was also completed. Preliminary planning for test specimen machining for the Japan Power Development Reactor was completed. A database of Charpy impact and fracture toughness data for RPV materials that have been tested in the unirradiated and irradiated conditions is being assembled and analyzed. Weld metal appears to have similar CVN and fracture toughness transition temperature shifts, whereas the fracture toughness shifts are greater than CVN shifts for base <b>metals.</b> <b>Draft</b> subcontractor reports on precracked cylindrical tensile specimens were completed, reviewed, and are being revised. Testing on precracked CVN specimens, both quasi-static and dynamic, was evaluated. Additionally, testing of compact specimens was initiated as an experimental comparison of constraint limitations. 16 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R
50|$|Outside {{of public}} transportation, {{vertical}} linear motors {{have been proposed}} as lifting mechanisms in deep mines, {{and the use of}} linear motors is growing in motion control applications. They are also often used on sliding doors, such as those of low floor trams such as the Citadis and the Eurotram. Dual axis linear motors also exist. These specialized devices have been used to provide direct X-Y motion for precision laser cutting of cloth and sheet <b>metal,</b> automated <b>drafting,</b> and cable forming. Most linear motors in use are LIM (linear induction motor), or LSM (linear synchronous motor). Linear DC motors are not used due to higher cost and linear SRM suffers from poor thrust. So for long run in traction LIM is mostly preferred and for short run LSM is mostly preferred.|$|R
50|$|The Rizal Technological University - Laboratory High School, {{also known}} as RTU-LHS, is the high school {{department}} of the RTU and it is situated inside the main campus in Mandaluyong City. The RTU - Laboratory High School provides secondary curriculum with added technology-based subjects such as electronics, civil technology, <b>drafting,</b> <b>metal</b> works and machine shop, business technology for boys and girls, food trades and garment trades for girls only. The RTU - Laboratory High School also serves as the training for teacher education programs of the college student-teachers of the College of Education. The levels are Grades 7 to 12.|$|R
