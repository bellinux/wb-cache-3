It is assumed that the proposed coil should be easier to implant to the chest wall and is less prone to possible misalignments of the outer and internal coils, easier to isolate with a biocompatible material and most important, the feasibility of a much better heat dissipation scenario. What type of waveform; triangular, square or sinusoidal, is best transformed from the outer coil to the inner on?. Furthermore, investigate the effect of different tissues separating the coils from each other. Different coils with various radiuses and number of turns and shapes were tried in this experimental study. Results from the <b>multi-bundle</b> concentric coils were compared to results from single bundle coils and found to be better if not equal. and shape in terms of power transfer and safety {{issues such as the}} values of the induced charging current and the levels of the dissipated heat. The internal coil could, also, report on the charging levels and the status of the implanted device. 2. Methods The <b>multi-bundle</b> coil was constructed using a thin single wire wound 20 times in a bundle and then continues to be wound again in another similar bundle but with one centimeter larger radius and so on to form one coil with four concentric bundles, each having an increased two centimeters diameter from the previous one.

40|$|When peritrichously flagellated cells such as normal, curly, paralysed-curly and small-amplitude {{strains of}} Salmonella abortusequi are {{suspended}} in 0. 5 % methylcellulose solution, flagellar bundles can be clearly seen by electron microscopy. In a bundle, {{five or more}} of the component flagella are tightly united in parallel with each other, and the bundle formed into a helix with a shape characteristic for each strain, These figures reveal the struc-tural detail of the flagellar bundle observed under a dark-field microscope. Ten minutes after the cells were suspended in methylcellulose solution, bundled flagella could be seen in approximately 70 yo of the cells of normal, curly and paralysed-curly strains; the remaining 30 yo were dispersed, At this time among the normal cells, some were single-bundled and others were <b>multi-bundled.</b> The fraction of single-bundled cells was larger in both motile and paralysed curly-flagellated cells than in normal cells. The fraction of normal cells having single bundles increased with time. Methylcellulose was therefore presumed to enhance aggregation of flagella and/or to inhibit the dispersio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The ligaments of {{the knee}} consist of fiber bundles with {{variable}} orientations, lengths and mechanical properties. In concept, however, these structures were too often seen as homogeneous structures, which are either stretched or slack during knee motions. In previous studies, we proposed a new structural concept of the ligaments {{of the knee}}. In this concept, the ligaments were considered as <b>multi-bundle</b> structures, with nonuniform mechanical properties and zero force lengths. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to verify this new concept. For this purpose, laxity characteristics of a human knee joint were compared as measured in an experiment and predicted in a model simulation study. In the experiment, the varus-valgus and anterior-posterior laxities of a knee-joint specimen containing the ligaments and the articular surfaces only, were determined. From this knee-joint, geometric and mechanical parameters were derived to supply the parameters for a three-dimensional quasi-static knee-joint model. These parameters included (i) the three-dimensional insertion points of bundles, defined in the four major knee ligaments, (ii) the mechanical properties of these ligament, as functions of their relative insertion orientations and (iii) three-dimensional representations of the articular surfaces. With this model the experiments were simulated. If knee-model predictions and experimental results agree, then the <b>multi-bundle</b> ligament models are validated, at least with respect to their functional role in anterior-posterior and varus-valgus loading of the joint...|$|E

40|$|While the {{increasing}} demand for smaller packages and low-cost platforms aggressively drives the interconnect density per unit area, crosstalk noise due to capacitive and inductive coupling limits the achievable interconnect density. As an alternative, we investigate multimode signaling where n signals are transmitted by exciting all fundamental modes {{on a group of}} n closely coupled lines called a bundle. Even though crosstalk is ideally zero in a single bundle, practical implementation of this idea for a typical input/output (IO) bus requires multiple closely-placed bundles. Thus, inter-bundle crosstalk may be an issue. In this paper, we analyze the inter-bundle crosstalk starting with the analytical expressions for the modal conversion from one bundle to another. Frequency domain simulations for both frequency-dependent and frequency-independent terminations are performed to compare performance vs. density benefits of <b>multi-bundle</b> multi-mode interconnects to those provided by conventional single-ended and differential signaling...|$|E

For this purpose, laxity characteristics of a human knee joint were compared as measured in an experiment and predicted in a model simulation study. In the experiment, the varus-valgus and anterior-posterior laxities of a knee-joint specimen containing the ligaments and the articular surfaces only, were determined. From this knee-joint, geometric and mechanical parameters were derived to supply the parameters for a three-dimensional (3 D) quasi-static knee-joint model. These parameters included (i) the 3 D insertion points of bundles, defined in the four major knee ligaments, (ii) the mechanical properties of these ligament, as functions of their relative insertion orientations and (iii) 3 D representations of the articular surfaces. With this model the experiments were simulated. If knee-model predictions and experimental results agree, then the <b>multi-bundle</b> ligament models are validated, at least with respect to their functional role in anterior-posterior and varus-valgus loading of the joint. The model described the laxity characteristics in AP-translation and VV-rotation of the cadaveric knee-joint specimen reasonably well. Both display the same patterns of laxity changes during knee flexion. Only if a varus moment of 8 Nm was applied and if the tibia was posteriorly loaded, did the model predict a slightly higher laxity than that measured experimentally. From the model-experiment comparisons it was concluded that the proposed structural representations of the ligaments and their mechanical properly distributions seem to be valid for studying the anterior-posterior and varus-valgus laxity characteristics of the human knee-join...|$|E
40|$|During {{knee-joint}} motions, {{the fiber}} bundles {{of the knee}} ligaments are nonuniformly loaded in a recruitment pattern, which depends on successive relative orientations of the insertion sites. These fiber bundles vary with respect to length, orientation and mechanical properties. As a result, the stiffness characteristics of the ligaments as a whole are variable during knee-joint motion. The {{purpose of the present}} study is to characterize this variable mechanical behavior. It is hypothesized that for this purpose it is essential to consider the ligaments mechanically as <b>multi-bundle</b> structures in which the variability in fiber bundle characteristics is accounted for, rather than as one-dimensional structures. To verify this hypothesis, bone-ligament-bone preparations of the ligaments were subjected to series of unidirectional subfailure tensile tests in which the relative insertion orientations were varied. For each individual test specimen, this series of tensile tests was simulated with a mathematical ligament model. Geometrically, this model consists of multiple line elements, of which the insertions and orientations are anatomically based. In a mathematical optimization process, the unknown stiffness and recruitment parameters of the line elements are identified by fitting the variable stiffness characteristics of the model to those of the test series. Thus, lumped parameters are obtained which describe the mechanical behavior of the ligament as a function of the relative insertion orientation. This method of identification was applied to all four knee ligaments. In all cases, a satisfactory fit between experimental results and computer simulation was obtained, although the residual errors were lower for the cruciate ligaments (1. 0 - 2. 4 %) than for the collateral ligaments (3. 7 - 8. 1 %). It was found that models with three or less line elements were very sensitive to geometrical parameters, whereas models with more than 7 line elements suffered from mathematical redundancy. Between 4 and 7 line elements little difference was found. It is concluded that the present ligament models can realistically simulate the variable tensile behavior of human knee ligaments. Hereby the hypothesis is verified that it is essential to consider the ligaments of the knee as <b>multi-bundle</b> structures in order to characterize fully their mechanical behavio...|$|E
