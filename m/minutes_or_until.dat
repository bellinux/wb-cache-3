6000|$|... "Write, Miles--write, Rupert," [...] {{said the}} sobbing girls leaning {{forward from the}} wharf, as we shoved off. It was not so dark but we could see their dear forms for several <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> {{a bend in the}} creek put a dark mass of earth between us and them.|$|E
50|$|During a {{qualification}} round-robin, bouts last {{a maximum}} of three <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> one athlete has scored five hits. There is then a knockout phase, in which bouts last {{a maximum of}} nine minutes (three periods of three <b>minutes),</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> one athlete has scored 15 hits.|$|E
50|$|The tournament {{started with}} a group phase {{round-robin}} followed by a knockout stage. During a qualification round-robin, bouts last a maximum of three <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> one athlete has scored five hits. There is then a knockout phase, in which bouts last a maximum of nine minutes (three periods of three <b>minutes),</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> one athlete has scored 15 hits.|$|E

50|$|Alternatively, {{the noodles}} can be drained and dry roasted. This {{gets rid of}} the bitterness. It also makes the noodles have a more pasta-like consistency. Dry {{roasting}} is done by placing noodles in a non-stick skillet on high for a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> you hear a slight squeaking noise when moving them around. After that {{they are ready to}} be added to soup stock or have a sauce added to them.|$|R
50|$|You {{are served}} with a clay pot filled with broth. When the broth is boiling, then you first add the vegetables. This will lower the {{temperature}} in the pot a little and you should wait until it boils again before putting a piece of meat in the pot using your chopstick, and cook the meat for just less than one <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> it’s cooked, then enjoy the meat by dipping it into the sauce (nam chim).|$|R
5000|$|Add ½ cup {{of vinegar}} {{and simmer for}} 25-30 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> it thickens. Taste and adjust the level of {{sweetness}} or sourness of the syrup.|$|E
50|$|During a {{qualification}} round-robin, bouts {{lasted a}} maximum of three inutes, or until one athlete had scored five hits. There was then a knockout phase, in which bouts lasted {{a maximum of}} nine minutes (three periods of three <b>minutes),</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> one athlete had scored 15 hits.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next step}} is roasting. The soaked and dried rice is roasted with an oven or a {{mechanical}} roaster. The rice is then transferred on long trays approximately 1.3 cm deep to a 90°-200 °C environment for 30-60 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the rice become light brown.|$|E
5|$|Hero. A {{version of}} the team deathmatch where a hero is {{randomly}} selected on both sides for one <b>minute,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the hero dies. The hero gets a health boost, damage boost, and every weapon in the game (which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute). The key difference between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing the Hero or when the Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total.|$|R
2500|$|A {{panellist}} scores {{one point}} {{for making a}} correct challenge against whoever is speaking, or the speaker gets a point if the challenge is deemed incorrect. If a witty interjection amuses the audience, but is not a correct challenge, at the chairman's discretion the challenger can nevertheless be awarded an extra point (the [...] "bonus point" [...] rule). A player who makes a correct challenge takes over the subject {{for the remainder of}} the <b>minute,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> he <b>or</b> she is successfully challenged. The person speaking when the whistle blows after 60 seconds also scores a point. An extra point is awarded if a panellist speaks for the entire minute without being challenged.|$|R
5000|$|First Impression Part 2 {{can also}} {{be heard in the}} intro of the Episode [...] "Career Day" [...] in Season 1 of That '70s Show, the song goes for about 10 seconds and can be faintly heard for the first <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> so <b>until</b> it stops {{completely}} once Eric leaves the basement.|$|R
50|$|The top eight {{teams from}} each conference {{qualified}} for the play-offs. Division winners were awarded the top two seeds.In each conference quarterfinals, semifinals and finals will be played and the conference winners play for the Gagarin Cup. Conference quarterfinals were best-of-five series, the remaining rounds best-of-seven series. Overtime periods last 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the sudden death goal.|$|E
50|$|Warm baths are {{recommended}} {{for reducing the}} itching, pain and discomfort associated with conditions such as hemorrhoids and genital problems. An ordinary bathtub can be filled with 3 to 4 in of hot water (about 110 F), and sat in for 15-20 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the water cools down. Alternatively, a large basin can be used, and there are specially built devices that fit into toilet bowls.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} get the longest life out of a reed, the reed should be soaked in water for 2 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> fully moist, but not soaked. They should be played for about 5 minutes the first day, 15 minutes the second, and 45 minutes on a third day. After this, they should {{continue}} to be soaked in water, but can be played as long as needed.|$|E
60|$|Sophy, {{with a great}} effort, {{controlled}} herself, and sat very quiet. The colour {{had faded}} from her cheeks now, and the marks of care seemed to come back again very plain and deep; then, after waiting a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, <b>until</b> she felt herself quite quiet, she laid {{one hand on the}} cheek of her sleeping baby, and looked up appealingly into Dr. Ashleigh's face.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{scheduling}} conflicts for the booking {{of studio}} time and broadcast time, The Lone Shark was often recorded {{within an hour}} of its actual broadcast, with little or no time to edit the program. Many times, the just-recorded program tapes were literally run {{down the hall to the}} broadcast facility with only <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> seconds <b>until</b> the program’s on-air broadcast time. The Lone Shark was basically being broadcast as a taped-but-unedited live program.|$|R
60|$|The old {{merchant}} was honestly moved, and {{his voice}} quivered as he spoke. He stood motionless for a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> so <b>until</b> the heavy door slammed, and then he threw open the window and gazed sorrowfully down {{the street at the}} disappearing cab. His whole attitude expressed such dejection that his ward, who had just entered the room, felt more drawn towards him than she had ever done before. Slipping up to him she placed her warm tender hand upon his sympathetically.|$|R
5000|$|A gift delay condition, {{in which}} the {{experimenter}} presented the children with a bag and told the children not to peek inside of it while he or she went to get a bow. There were hidden cameras set up to tape the children’s reactions while the experimenter was away. After three <b>minutes</b> (<b>or</b> <b>until</b> the child had peeked into the bag) the experimenter {{came back into the}} room.|$|E
50|$|Matta rice is {{traditionally}} double cooked. The rice is washed {{in a large}} pan and left to soak from 1 hour to overnight. The rice is drained and simmered with 4 to 8 parts water for 30 minutes. It is then covered and left for 15-20 minutes. The rice is then salted and boiled for another 15-20 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> cooked. It is finally drained and left covered for a further 10-15 minutes before serving.|$|E
50|$|The dish is {{traditionally}} prepared by first frying chicken drumsticks or thighs. Afterwards, water {{is mixed with}} the cooking oil, tomato sauce, flour, garlic and onions until the sauce reaches a boiling point, {{at which point the}} chicken is added and left to boil for another fifteen <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the sauce gains a thick consistency. Before serving, parsley is sprinkled on top. Mămăligă (polenta) is typically used as a side dish, together with a light salad.|$|E
25|$|Some attacks {{require an}} {{expensive}} preprocessing stage {{after which the}} cipher can be broken in <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> seconds. <b>Until</b> recently, the weaknesses have been passive attacks using the known plaintext assumption. In 2003, more serious weaknesses were identified which can be exploited in the ciphertext-only scenario, or by an active attacker. In 2006 Elad Barkan, Eli Biham and Nathan Keller demonstrated attacks against A5/1, A5/3, or even GPRS that allow attackers to tap GSM mobile phone conversations and decrypt them either in real-time, or at any later time.|$|R
50|$|In {{the heat}} of the day, the male D. {{carolina}} take flight and hover, clicking their wings in a courtship display to attract females. Males court females by producing a calling signal by stribulating with hindlegs and wings, the hindlegs are used alternately to rub against the tegmen in a behaviour called alternate stridulation. The male sits horizontally on sunlit bare ground and may continue to stridulate for 5 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> more <b>until</b> he is successful in attracting a female. She moves towards the male and when she is close enough he approaches her and mounts. If he is acceptable to the female they copulate and may remain copulated for as long as 16 hours.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{preparation}} of fried green tomatoes begins by cutting the tomatoes into approximately 1/4-inch (~0.6 cm) slices. They are then seasoned {{with salt and}} pepper, coated with plain, coarse cornmeal, and shallow fried in bacon fat for a few <b>minutes</b> each side, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> golden brown. Shallow frying is preferred, as the tomatoes do not float in the oil, which allows {{the weight of the}} tomato to press the cornmeal to the underside of the tomato. This negates the need for a 'wash' (see below).|$|R
5000|$|He {{is known}} for {{communicating}} displeasure with a single look or the [...] "silent treatment". One of his interrogating techniques is to sit and glare at the suspect for twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the suspect buckles under pressure. Gibbs' [...] "steely gaze can cool a room by five degrees". In direct contrast, when enraged, Gibbs will often slam his hands down on the interrogation room table very violently and rattle a tight-lipped suspect with the sudden outburst.|$|E
50|$|The USA {{team won}} {{many of the}} early games easily. In the 3x3 rules, the game ends after 10 <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> one team reaches 21 or more points. The USA team reached 21 or more points {{in each of the}} first seven games. The semi-final and final games were much closer. In the semi-final game, the USA prevailed over Australia 19-18. In the final game against France, the USA team fell behind 7-2, but again won by a single point, 17-16.|$|E
50|$|Pocket dialing (also {{known as}} pocket calling or butt dialing) {{refers to the}} {{accidental}} placement of a phone call while a person's mobile phone or cordless phone is in the owner's pocket or handbag. The recipient of the call typically hears random background noise when answering the phone. If the caller remains unaware, the recipient will sometimes overhear whatever {{is happening in the}} caller's vicinity. A pocket-dialed call can continue for many <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the recipient's voice mail system ends the call.|$|E
6000|$|Cuthbert {{thought for}} some time, and then said, [...] "Cnut, you shall {{undertake}} this enterprise. You shall fill a cart high with faggots, {{and in it}} shall conceal a dozen of your best men. You, dressed as a serf, shall drive the oxen, and when you reach the castle shall say, in answer to the hail of the sentry, that you are bringing in the tribute of wood of your master the franklin of Hopeburn. They will then lower the drawbridge and open the gates; {{and when you have}} crossed the bridge and are under the portcullis, spring out suddenly, cut loose the oxen so that they will not draw the cart further in, cut the chains of the drawbridge so that it cannot be drawn off, and hold the gate for a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two <b>until</b> we arrive." ...|$|R
50|$|The boiled {{nuts are}} used in the UK as a bait for carp. The nuts have to be {{prepared}} in a prescribed manner to prevent harm to the fish. The nuts are soaked in water for 24 hours and then boiled for 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> longer <b>until</b> fully expanded. Some anglers then leave the boiled nuts to ferment for 24-48 hours, which can enhance their effectiveness. If the nuts are not properly prepared, however, they can be extremely toxic to the carp. This was originally thought to have been the cause of death of Benson, a very large and very famous carp. The 54-lb. fish was found floating dead in a fishing lake, with a bag of unprepared tiger nuts lying nearby, empty, on the shore. An examination of the fish by a taxidermist concluded tiger nut poisoning was not, in the end, the cause of death.|$|R
40|$|We observe non-monotonic {{aging and}} memory effects, two {{hallmarks}} of glassy dynamics, in two disordered mechanical systems: crumpled thin sheets and elastic foams. Under fixed compression, both systems exhibit monotonic non-exponential relaxation. However, when {{after a certain}} waiting time the compression is partially reduced, both systems exhibit a non-monotonic response: the normal force first increases over many <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> even hours <b>until</b> reaching a peak value, and only then relaxation is resumed. The peak-time scales linearly with the waiting time, indicating that these systems retain long-lasting memory of previous conditions. Our results and the measured scaling relations are in good agreement with a theoretical model recently used to describe observations of monotonic aging in several glassy systems, suggesting that the non-monotonic behavior may be generic and that a-thermal systems can show genuine glassy behavior.

50|$|If {{the female}} is {{receptive}} then she will run {{in front of}} the male a few steps then freeze her body. The female when then exhibit lordosis behavior. In response, the male will typically groom the female hamster's rear, then mount the female. Mating lasts several seconds. After mating, the male may groom himself or the female. Then he will mount the female again. The mating pair should be left to repeat this for 20-30 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> one of the hamsters loses interest.|$|E
5000|$|The 16 top-ranked fencers in FIE rankings {{are exempt}} from the {{qualification}} phase and access directly the table of 64. All other competitors fence in pools of 7 fencers, or a mix of pools of 6 and pools of 7 {{if the number of}} fencers is not divisible by 7. The composition of the pools takes into account FIE rankings and the nationality of the fencers. Pools bouts last 3 <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> a fencer has scored 5 hits. Fencers are ranked according to, successively: ...|$|E
50|$|Quetschentaart, {{a popular}} Luxembourg speciality, {{is an open}} fruit tart with zwetschgen or damson plums. Traditionally, it is a {{seasonal}} dish served in the autumn after the local plums have ripened in September. The dough for the pastry base consists of flour, yeast, milk, and butter. It is kneaded and allowed to rise for half an hour. The base is then basted with egg, sprinkled with sugar, placed in a baking dish, and covered with halved plums (no stones) arranged in circles. It is baked at 180 C for some 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> ready.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{splashing}} ceased suddenly, {{and there}} was {{for a few moments}} a tense and almost intolerable silence, during which he stood still with one hand clenched until a clamor rose from the midst of the river, and he heard the dull thud of a flintlock gun. It was answered by a clear ringing crash of riflery, and then while the flintlocks and Sniders joined in, thin pale flashes blazed amidst the reeds and in the sliding mist. This lasted for, perhaps, a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, <b>until</b> it became evident that the rebels were splashing back again. Ormsgill could see them streaming out of the mist, and as he watched them another patter of riflery broke out upon the higher ground behind him. A bugle rang shrilly, and he fancied he heard a white man's voice calling in the bush. Then looking round as one of the boys touched him, he saw that his guards were no longer there. They had evidently fled and left him to shift for himself. He stood a minute considering, with the boys clamoring about him, and then made up his mind. The rebels were streaming back up the gorge, and it seemed to him just possible that if he separated himself from them he might slip away unobserved in the press of the pursuit. Once across the river he might still reach the coast.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{synchronizers}} {{that use}} variable speed reading are generally preferred in professional applications. The control of audio delay is generally more accurate and more easily accomplished. Pitch errors in lower performance devices are uncompensated and {{kept to a}} level generally not perceived by the average viewer, by limiting the amount of change of reading speed. Typically the change limit is {{in the order of}} 0.2%. Unfortunately, this limits the rate of delay change and when large video delay changes occur the slow tracking rate of these uncompensated synchronizers can cause the audio video sync to be off for several seconds <b>or</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>until</b> the audio delay catches up with the video delay. Additionally, listeners with excellent pitch perception may notice and be annoyed by even these small pitch errors.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had better}} {{go up and}} have a look, Dinah," [...] and Nat started to ascend. He found that, as she had said, it was much easier than it looked. The first four or five steps, indeed, were so shallow {{that he could not}} get much foothold, but above there were holes for the feet some six or eight inches deep, and three or four feet apart, these being hidden from the sight of anyone passing below by a {{projecting}} ledge beneath. The holes were much wider than necessary, the corners had been filled with earth and tufts of coarse grass planted there, and these completely hid the openings from sight. He soon reached the clump of bushes. Behind them was a fissure some three feet wide and four feet high. He crawled into this, and found that it widened into a cave. He was here able to stand up, remaining motionless for a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two <b>until</b> his eyes became accustomed to the dim light. Then he saw that it was of considerable height, some twelve feet wide and about twenty feet deep. This was indeed an admirable place of refuge, and he felt sure that no one, unless previously acquainted with its existence, would be likely to discover it. He went to the entrance and looked out. Myra was sitting down by the side of a little pool. She had taken her shoes and stockings off, and was bathing her blistered feet.|$|R
