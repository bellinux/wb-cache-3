5|$|Nerve-endings {{similar to}} the Pacinian corpuscle, found in the <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane</b> of the tongue, in pits on the beak and {{in other parts of}} the bodies of birds. They differ from Pacinian corpuscles in being smaller and more elongated, in having thinner and more closely placed {{capsules}} and in that the axis-cylinder in the central clear space is encircled by a continuous row of nuclei.|$|E
5|$|The {{permanganate}} {{exhibits a}} higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane.</b> For example, the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only {{a limited amount}} is absorbed by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, {{at the age}} of 90, Feller was one of the {{starting}} pitchers at the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame Classic, which replaced the Hall of Fame Game at Cooperstown, New York. Feller was treated for leukemia in August 2010. By October, Feller was fitted with a pacemaker and was diagnosed with pneumonia and thrush, an infection of the <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane</b> lining the mouth and throat. He was transferred on December 8 from the Cleveland Clinic to hospice care. On December 15, Feller died of complications from leukemia at 92.|$|E

5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane</b> called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.|$|E
5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane</b> {{consisting of}} a tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane</b> exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E

25|$|Hearing {{impairment}} {{is particularly}} prevalent {{in children with}} cleft palate. The tensor muscle fibres that open the eustachian tubes lack an anchor to function effectively. In this situation, when {{the air in the}} middle ear is absorbed by the <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane,</b> the negative pressure is not compensated, which results in the secretion of fluid into the middle ear space from the <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane.</b> Children with this problem typically have a conductive hearing loss primarily caused by this middle ear effusion.|$|E

25|$|The {{anterior}} tongue is, at its apex (or tip), {{thin and}} narrow, it is directed forward against the lingual {{surfaces of the}} lower incisor teeth. The posterior part is, at its root, directed backward, and connected with the hyoid bone by the hyoglossi and genioglossi muscles and the hyoglossal membrane, with the epiglottis by three glossoepiglottic folds of <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane,</b> with the soft palate by the glossopalatine arches, and with the pharynx by the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane.</b> It also forms the anterior wall of the oropharynx.|$|E

Other example vesiculobullous diseases include pemphigus vulgaris, <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane</b> pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA disease, and epidermolysis bullosa.|$|E
25|$|Many STIs are (more easily) {{transmitted}} through the mucous membranes of the penis, vulva, rectum, urinary tract and (less often—depending on type of infection) the mouth, throat, respiratory tract and eyes. The visible membrane covering {{the head of}} the penis is a <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane,</b> though it produces no mucus (similar to the lips of the mouth). Mucous membranes differ from skin in that they allow certain pathogens into the body. The amount of contact with infective sources which causes infection varies with each pathogen but in all cases a disease may result from even light contact from fluid carriers like venereal fluids onto a <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane.</b>|$|E
