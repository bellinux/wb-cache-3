The structural {{behavior of the}} screw connections were studied by varying {{the thickness of the}} steel sheets, number and arrangement of screws for each connection.

40|$|The {{stability}} of steel storage racks, {{which are often}} unbraced, may depend solely on the pallet beam to upright connector and on the stiffness of the base plate to floor connection. This paper presents experimental results from cyclic tests performed on portal beam to upright bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> intended for cold-formed steel drive-in and drive-through storage racks. In storage racks, portal beams are typically connected to uprights by "tab connectors", which are costly to manufacture and experience initial looseness. By simply bolting the portal beams to the uprights, bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> may represent a cost-effective alternative to "tab connectors". A literature review shows that bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> between cold-formed steel members are economical and feasible. However, experimental results show {{a significant amount of}} looseness in the connection after an initial high moment-rotational stiffness. Being slender structures, storage racks are sensitive to the second-order P-? effect, and international racking specifications require the initial looseness of the tab connectors to be considered when analysing the {{stability of}} the rack in the down-aisle direction (sway motion). The non-linear cyclic behaviour of bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> is presented and explained herein. Based on finite element results, it is shown that, for drive-in and drive-through racks, the looseness in bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> can be ignored in ultimate limit states design.

40|$|An {{extensive}} experimental {{investigation on}} bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> between cold-formed steel sections was carried out, {{and a total}} of 16 internal and external beam-column sub-frames with various connection configurations were tested under lateral loads. It is found that for those six beam-column sub-frames with large bolt pitches and thick gusset plates in the connections, flexural failure of connected sections is always critical. The moment resistances of the connections attain at least 85 % of the moment capacities of the connected sections. This paper presents a theoretical investigation for predicting the structural behaviour of bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> between cold-formed steel sections. An analysis and design method for internal force distribution of the connections is presented, and hence a set of design rules for section failure of connected sections under combined bending and shear is proposed. Moreover, a non-linear finite element model of the beam-column sub-frames incorporating the effect of semi-rigid joints is also presented. On the basis of the measured moment joint rotation curves of the bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections,</b> the overall lateral load-deflection curves of the sub-frames are predicted, and they are found to follow closely the curves obtained from tests. Furthermore, a semi-empirical formula for flexibility prediction of the bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> is also proposed after careful calibration against test data. It is demonstrated that the proposed rules are highly effective for predicting the structural performance of cold-formed steel frames with bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections.</b> Hence, structural engineers are encouraged to design and build cold-formed steel structures with bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> to achieve practical and efficient construction.

Other purposes are to develop the numerical procedure of determining the fracture strength of the steel <b>moment</b> <b>connection</b> using linear elastic fracture mechanics, and the probabilistic analyses of brittle fractures of connections. The steel <b>moment</b> <b>connection</b> failures during the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the design philosophy are reviewed and the post-Northridge earthquake experimental and analytical researches are examined. Possible causes of the steel <b>moment</b> <b>connection</b> failures are categorized into welding-related factors, design-related factors, and material-related factors. For the analyses, the idealizations of the steel moment connections considering each factor are studied. The stress concentration and the sate of stress of the connection are investigated using an idealized five-plate <b>moment</b> <b>connection</b> model. The brittle fracture strength of the welded-flange bolted web connection with backing bars is studied using linear elastic fracture mechanics. Post-Northridge connection tests are simulated using the finite element method. An edge crack is assumed at the column-weld interface to represent crack-like defects and other adverse effects. The energy release rate at the front of the edge crack at the failure load of the test is studied using the J-integral method. From post-Northridge connection test results and a finite element model, the effective fracture toughness of the column-weld interface is investigated. The effective fracture toughness is the maximum energy release rate of the material at the front of the crack at the failure load. A new method of calculating the brittle fracture strength of the connection is suggested using the effective fracture toughness. The validity of the suggested method is investigated through numerical examples. Based on the suggested method, the probability of brittle fracture of the connection is investigated using a sample weld defect distribution and a yield stress distribution. In addition, possible applications of this method are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study that investigates the strength and stiffness of a blind-bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connection</b> to a concrete-filled circular column. In this beam-to-column connection, double built-up tees are bolted to the circular hollow section and to the top and bottom flanges of a universal steel beam. In order to limit the out-of-plane deformations of the thin tube wall under tension, cogged extensions are provided to the blind bolts, hence improving the rigidity of the connection. The advantage of this type of <b>moment</b> <b>connection</b> is easy fabrication and installation compared to welded moment connections using external and internal diaphragms. The experimental setup, connection details and material properties are described briefly. The results and observations are presented and key aspects of behaviour are discussed. The detailed response of the tested connection is evaluated in terms of the moment-rotation relationship, failure mode, and displacement distributions within critical components. A simplified component model is developed to predict the initial stiffness of this blind-bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connection.</b> The joint is divided into basic elements in tension and compression zones which are simulated by individual springs with a defined force-displacement relationship. The tension zone stiffness comprises blind bolt stiffness, curved endplate stiffness, cogged extension stiffness, membrane stiffness of circular hollow section, bearing stiffness of the tube wall around the bolt hole, and stiffness of flange plate connection. The compression zone stiffness comprises stiffness of curved endplate and tube wall bearing on concrete core and stiffness of concrete in the compression zone.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental and analytical study into a new bolted <b>moment</b> <b>connection</b> between unfilled hollow section columns and open section beams, referred to herein as the extended T-stub connection with back face support. The connection is comprised of T-stubs connecting the top and bottom flanges of the beam to the face of the column and channels connecting the T-stubs to a backplate at the back face of the hollow section column. The addition of the channels to a standard T-stub connection helps to distribute the beam flange tension load to the back face of the hollow section column thus reducing demand on the flexible column face which often will compromise the stiffness of the connection. The extended T-stub connection with back face support was found to be comparable to a previously tested side connection and is much stiffer than a typical face connection. Comparison of the test results and three dimensional finite element (F E) model indicates that F E analysis can be used to predict the connection behaviour with sufficient accuracy.

After all, chairs are normally held together by <b>moment</b> <b>connections,</b> such as those joining the legs to the seat. Glass is a notoriously bad material for forming <b>moment</b> <b>connections,</b> it is brittle, and quickly snaps if you subject it to bending.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using reduced flange plates (RFPs) or rib plates for seismic response of steel moment connections was investigated through cyclic testing of six full-scale specimens. The first scheme utilized RFPs {{to connect the}} beam flanges to the column, without any direct connection of the beam flange to the column. Plastic hinges were forced to form in the RFPs instead of the steel beam due to strong beam-weak RFPs, so the weakened <b>moment</b> <b>connection</b> eliminated buckling of the beam and reduced cost of repairing after earthquakes. The second scheme was to strengthen a connection, which was removed from an existing 33 -story steel building, by welding rib plates between the column face and inner side of the beam flanges. Test results of the weakened connections showed that (1) the connections developed beam plastic moment and reach more than an interstory drift of 4 % without strength degradation, (2) the RFP was effective in dissipating energy before buckling, and (3) no buckling of the beam was observed.

40|$|Hollow {{structural}} sections (HSS) {{make up a}} significant portion of the steel market, where the typical uses in building structures are as column members, bracing members, exposed structural steel, cladding supports, concrete filled tube sections, and truss members. Recent seismic steel research focused on improvements to wide-flange seismic moment resisting frame (SMRF) systems. HSS members provide a possible means of improving the performance of SMRF systems in low- to mid-rise structures based on their high strength-to-weight ratio, good compression and bending properties, and high torsional stiffness. However, an understanding of the behavior of HSS under cyclic bending loads is required along with detailing requirements of HSS-to-HSS <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> to ensure proper ductility and strength is achieved. An experimental and analytical program is undertaken to characterize the ability of HSS beam members to withstand large plastic rotations with minor degradation of the maximum moment capacity. Experimental testing of eleven full-scale HSS beam members is carried out. These experimental results are used to calibrate a finite element model for analysis of 133 different beam members. The models account for section geometry, material properties, and local buckling. Local buckling limits the ability of these members to form stable plastic hinges and the behavior is highly dependent on the width-thickness (b/t) and the depth-thickness ratio (h/t). With an understanding of the limiting b/t and h/t ratios for HSS beam members, a connection design methodology is derived for both unreinforced and reinforced fully welded HSS-to-HSS <b>moment</b> <b>connections.</b> A finite element model parametric study is undertaken to better understand the effect of different parameters on the connection performance under cyclic loads typical of an earthquake. Experimental testing of two unreinforced HSS-to-HSS connections with unmatched and matched beam and column widths are also cyclically tested to failure. The hysteretic behavior shows that these connections are limited in their ability to isolate inelastic behavior in the beam member and panel zone region and suggest that unreinforced HSS-to-HSS <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> cannot achieve a strong column-weak beam mechanism. Based on the finite element model and the experimental study results, recommendations are provided for the design of HSS-to-HSS seismic <b>moment</b> <b>connections...</b>|$|R

This observation {{led to the development}} of truss analogy for the connection designs in contrast to the commonly used beam theory...|$|R
40|$|Test {{results on}} <b>moment</b> <b>connections</b> of heavy {{sections}} are presented. Flange thickness {{are up to}} 32 mm in beams and up to 97 mm in columns. Different beam to column moment ratios, shear panel design, method of connecting shear tab, welding methods and consumables are considered. Fracture of the welds, cracking of the shear tab weld, ductile tearing from weld access holes and buckling of the beam flange are ob-served. Practical conclusions are derived. Peer reviewe...|$|R
