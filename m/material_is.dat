5|$|Compared {{with most}} sauropods, a {{relatively}} large amount of juvenile <b>material</b> <b>is</b> known from Apatosaurus. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of Apatosaurus; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile <b>material</b> <b>is</b> from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish Apatosaurus from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.|$|E

5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the <b>material</b> <b>is</b> processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible <b>material</b> <b>is</b> channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium {{tantalate}} (LuTaO4) is the densest known stable {{white material}} (density 9.81 g/cm3) and therefore {{is an ideal}} host for X-ray phosphors. The only denser white <b>material</b> <b>is</b> thorium dioxide, with density of 10 g/cm3, but the thorium it contains is radioactive.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the <b>material</b> <b>is</b> finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning <b>material</b> <b>is</b> an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand {{is probably the most}} effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E
