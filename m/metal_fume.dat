5|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have been reviewing cadmium's bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity. The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds. Inhalation of cadmium fumes can result initially in <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> fever but may progress to chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and death.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{itself is}} non-toxic; {{however it is}} {{hazardous}} to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass {{is close to the}} boiling point of zinc. Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized (zinc plated) steel, can result in a nervous malady called <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> fever. For this reason, typically galvanized steel is not welded, or the zinc is removed first.|$|E
25|$|Zinc {{chloride}} {{is extremely}} {{detrimental to the}} lungs, and pulmonary exposure to zinc chloride smoke resulted in ten fatalities. Inhalation of fumes of zinc, zinc oxide, or zinc chloride leads to pulmonary edema and <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> fever. Onset occurs within 4–6 h and may be delayed up to 8 h. Symptoms include rapid breathing, dyspnea, cough, fever, shivering, sweating, chest and leg pain, myalgias, fatigue, metallic taste, salivation, thirst, and leukocytosis, which can last from 24 to 48 h. In cases of fume inhalation, cortisone preparations should be applied immediately (e.g., by inhalation of Auxiloson) to avoid development of lung edema.|$|E
50|$|The most {{plausible}} metabolic {{source of}} the symptoms is a dose-dependent release of certain cytokines, an event which occurs by inhaling <b>metal</b> oxide <b>fumes</b> that injure the lung cells. This is not an allergic reaction, though allergic reactions to <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> can occur.|$|R

40|$|Increased {{mortality}} from infectious pneumonia after {{occupational exposure}} to inorganic dust, <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> and chemicals Kjell Torén, 1, 2 Ingemar Qvarfordt, 2 Ingvar A Bergdahl, 3 Bengt Järvholm 3 Objectives There are epidemiological studies indicating {{that exposure to}} <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> is {{a risk factor for}} infectious pneumonia. Whether occupational exposure to other agents, such as inorganic dust or chemicals, also increases the risk for infectious pneumonia is not clear. The aim {{of the present study was}} to elucidate whether occupational exposure to respiratory pollutants and irritants increases the risk for infectious pneumonia. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Swedish male construction workers. Participants 320 143 male construction workers exposed to inorganic dust (asbestos, man-made mineral fibres, dust from cement, concrete and quartz), wood dust, <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> and chemicals (organic solvents, diisocyanates and epoxi resins) or unexposed. Main outcome measures The cohort was followed from 1971 to 2003 and the main outcome measures were mortality to infectious pneumonia, lobar pneumonia or pneumococcal pneumonia. RRs were obtained by the person-years method and from Poisson regression models, adjusting for baseline values of age and smoking habits. Results Among men aged 20 e 64 years there was increased mortality from infectious pneumonias among construction workers exposed to <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> (RR 2. 31, 95 % CI 1. 35 to 3. 95), inorganic dust (RR 1. 87, 95 % CI 1. 22 to 2. 87) and chemicals (RR 1. 91, 95 % CI 1. 37 to 3. 22). The mortality was also increased from both lobar pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia. Among men aged 65 e 84 years the occupational exposure to inorganic dust and chemicals was associated with slightly increased mortality from infectious pneumonia. Among groups with mutually exclusive exposures there was increased mortality from infectious pneumonias among construction workers exposed to inorganic dust, but not among those exposed to wood dust or chemicals. There were no cases among workers exposed only to <b>metal</b> <b>fumes.</b> Conclusions Our findings indicate that exposure to inorganic dust increases the mortality from infectious pneumonias, especially lobar pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia. The mechanism is unclear, but the effect may be mediated through induced airways inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} exposure to pesticides, polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons, diesel exhaust, <b>metal</b> dust, <b>metal</b> <b>fumes,</b> and mineral oil in relation to prostate cancer incidence in a large prospective study. Methods: This cohort study was conducted among 58279 men in the Netherlands. In September 1986, cohort members (55 - 69 year) completed a self-administered questionnaire on potential cancer risk factors, including job history. Follow up for prostate cancer incidence was established by linkage to cancer and 2335 subcohort members. A blinded case-by-case expert exposure for each potential carcinogenic exposure. Results: In multivariate analyses {{there was a significant}} negative association for pesticides (RR 0. 60; 95 % CI 0. 37 to 0. 95) when comparing the highest tertile of exposure to pesticides with no exposure. No association was found for occupational exposure to PAHs (RR 0. 75; 95 % CI 0. 42 tot 1. 31), diesel exhaust (RR 0. 81; 95 % CI 0. 62 to 1. 06), metal dust (RR 1. 01; 95 % CI 0. 72 tot 1. 40), <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> (RR 1. 11; 95 % CI 0. 80 to 1. 54), or mineral oil (RR 0. 99, 95 % CI 0. 66 to 1. 48) when comparing the highest tertile of exposure with no exposure. In subgroups ananlysis, with respect to tumour invasiveness and morphology, null results were found for occupational exposure to pesticides, PAH, diesel exhaust, <b>metal</b> dust, <b>metal</b> <b>fumes,</b> and mineral oil. Conclusions: These results suggest a negative association between occupational exposure to pesticides and prostate cancer.

50|$|Diagnosis is {{primarily}} anecdotal, that is, {{it depends upon}} a good occupational history.

Welding <b>fume</b> <b>metals</b> and irritant gases nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3) were sampled for thirty-eight workers. Personal exposure air samples for welding <b>fume</b> <b>metals</b> were collected on 37 mm open face cassettes and nitrogen dioxide and ozone exposure samples were collected with diffusive passive samplers. Samples were analyzed for metals using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and welding <b>fume</b> <b>metal</b> exposure concentrations were defined as the sum of welding-related metals mass per volume of air sampled. Welding <b>fume</b> <b>metal</b> exposures were highly variable among similar types of welding while NO 2 and O 3 exposure were less variable. Welding <b>fume</b> <b>metal</b> exposures were significantly higher 474 µg/m 3 for welders than non-welders 60 µg/m 3 (p= 0. 001). Welders were exposed to higher concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 than non-welders but the differences were not statistically significant. Welding <b>fume</b> <b>metal</b> exposure concentrations for welders performing gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) were higher than welders performing gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW).

Specifically, this report consists of the following five chapters: Chapter 1. Executive Summary; Chapter 2. Metal Capture by Various Sorbents; Chapter 3. Simultaneous Metal and Sulfur Capture; Chapter 4. Sorption and Desorption of Mercury on Sorbents; and Chapter 5. Project Conclusions. In summary, the metals involved in the project were arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and selenium and the sorbents tested included bauxite, zeolite and calcined limestone. The three sorbents have been found to have various degree of metal capture capability on arsenic, cadmium, chromium and lead. Among them, calcined limestone is capable of simultaneouely capturing metals and sulfur. Mercury and selenium, however, can not be effectively retained by these sorbents under the combustion conditions. Mercury adsorption by sorbents at low temperatures was also investigated and the developed mass transfer model for mercury absorption appears to describe reasonably well the experimental results.
