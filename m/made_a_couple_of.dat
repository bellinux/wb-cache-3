25|$|Next up was the Derby d'Emilia away to Bologna. Daniele Galloppa {{returned}} from suspension, but goalkeeper Mirante was still sidelined through injury as Donadoni {{took charge of}} his second match. Despite the number one's absence, Parma's goal was again well guarded thanks to Nicola Pavarini, who <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> fine saves, including one against former Parma man Marco Di Vaio. The second half proved a feisty affair, typical of a derby, as the game petered out into a goalless draw.|$|E
25|$|After the {{way they}} had left the AWA Michaels and Jannetty could not just return like nothing had happened, instead the Midnight Rockers started working for the AWA {{affiliated}} Championship Wrestling Association (CWA) in Memphis, Tennessee. The team had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> appearances in the CWA in the past as part of their working agreement with the AWA but now they were in Memphis full-time. Their first feud in Memphis was against a recently formed team known as The Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs) whom they faced in several brutal matches all over the CWA territory. After The Nasty Boys, The Rockers got involved in a feud with “The Nightmares” (Danny Davis and Ken Wayne). Their villainous personas were that of self-obsessed, glory seeking ”superstars”, the same persona Michaels would later adopt as ”The Hearbreak Kid”. Their feud with the RPMs saw the Midnight Rockers defeat Lane and Davis to win the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on October 26, 1987. Jannetty and Michaels lost then regained the Southern Tag Team title as the Midnight Rockers / RPMs feud raged on.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> forced {{changes for}} the second Test, with Brendon McCullum keeping wicket {{in place of the}} injured BJ Watling, Martin Guptill filling Watling's role with the bat, while Doug Bracewell came in for spinner Bruce Martin to form a four-man seam attack. The first day was {{completely}} washed out by rain, which, although there were some breaks in the cloud, was never away long enough to allow the toss to be made. With play abandoned before 4p.m., the match was effectively turned into a four-day game. After losing Compton (1) early on day 2, England recovered well, with Cook and Trott putting on another 50 runs before both were dismissed in consecutive balls in the last two overs before lunch; however, this only brought Joe Root to the crease, and he proceeded to add 104 more runs for his maiden Test century, becoming the first Yorkshireman to do so at Headingley. Root was out to the first delivery with the new ball, but not before he and fellow Yorkshireman Jonny Bairstow had added 124 for the fifth wicket. Bairstow (64) went next, followed by Broad for a second-ball duck, but Prior and Swann combined to get England to 337/7 {{by the end of the}} day. England's tail only lasted another nine overs on day 3, enough to round the innings off for 354 runs. Trent Boult took the last two wickets of Finn (6) and Anderson (0) to complete a five-wicket haul.|$|E

500|$|CSKA manager Valery Gazzaev praised {{his players}} despite their loss and hinted that {{injuries}} {{may have been}} a factor in the loss: [...] "The game was satisfactory – we had followed the plan we set out, but still we made two mistakes. On the whole I think our team played very well but of course it is a shame we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E

So it's really both of their brainchild." [...] Tarantino has stated, [...] "I can't imagine doing Grindhouse with any other director in the way me and Robert did it because I just had complete faith and trust in him. So much so that we didn't actually see each other's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened.

500|$|... "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{features}} the first appearance of Cynthia Watros as Libby in Lost since the character {{was murdered in}} the second season. Despite a promise by writer's assistant Matt Ragghianti {{that there would be}} an episode in the second season in which flashbacks would focus on Libby, Watros became the first main cast member to never play the central role in a Lost episode. Following Libby's death, Co-creator/executive producer/writer Damon Lindelof revealed plans to tell her story in the third season. Libby's story was later postponed again—Lindelof stated that her back story would be told through flashbacks of a new character introduced in the fourth season. Executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse further explained that these flashbacks would unfold over multiple episodes. This failed to materialize; however, Watros <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> appearances via hallucinations in Michael's flashbacks in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". The writers asserted that while they had yet to shed light on the character's past, they would finally in their fifth year. The writers later made further revisions, with Cuse concluding that Libby's part in the show is [...] "pretty much finished." [...] When Watros returned to Lost for [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", she did not receive the [...] "special guest star" [...] credit, as was customary for former main cast members of Lost. She was instead billed simply as a guest star, although her name appeared with that of frequent guest star M.C. Gainey ahead of the remainder of the episode's guest cast, who were listed alphabetically on-screen. Gainey explained that [...] "just because they kill you on this show, don't mean they don't need you anymore 'cause everybody's got a past." [...] Damon Lindelof said that [...] "it was sort of like a walk down memory lane for the dead", as it not only included Tom and Libby, but also Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) and George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens), two characters from the freighter who had met their demises earlier in the season.|$|E

500|$|Vikram did {{not sign}} up to a film for sixty {{five days after the}} release of Sethu, to ensure that he made the right career move. Vikram spent time {{completing}} projects he had agreed to feature in before the release of Sethu and hence <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> appearances in the Malayalam films, Red Indians and the horror film Indriyam. He also played a leading role in Siragugal, a rare Tamil telefilm produced and featuring Radhika Sarathkumar, which was shot entirely in the suburbs of London. Furthermore, he also completed two Telugu films during the period; 9 Nelalu and Youth. 9 Nelalu featured Vikram as the husband of the character played by Soundarya, who faces the challenges of being a surrogate mother. The film won positive reviews, with a critic mentioning that Vikram gave a [...] "controlled performance; while Vikram's newfound popularity in Tamil films saw the film dubbed into Tamil soon after as Kandane Seethayai, with an inserted comedy track by comedian Vivek. His next release was Rajakumaran's Vinnukum Mannukum, alongside Sarath Kumar, Kushboo and Devayani, which revolved around an ordinary boy falling in love with an actress. Vikram has since mentioned his displeasure at being a part of the film, claiming that he had arguments with the director for every single shot and that [...] "everything in that film, right from the first shot was wrong"; the film became a failure commercially. His next film was Dhill where he played an aspiring police officer, Kanagavel, who tackles a corrupt policeman. To appear trim {{in the role of the}} aspiring police officer, Vikram went on a strict diet eating only fruits and drinking juice. The film opened to positive reviews with a critic from The Hindu claiming that [...] "Vikram has the ability and potential" [...] and that [...] "Vikram has once again proved that his success in Sethu was not a fluke". Dhill subsequently went on to become Vikram's first success in the masala film genre and led the way for more such films in the same genre for him. Vikram's portrayal of a blind folk singer in Vinayan's Kasi won him the Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award and the film also did well commercially. For the movie, he sunbathed on the terrace of his beachside home in Chennai for a sunburnt look and got dizzying headaches while practising to look blind. Again, Vikram's performance won positive reviews from critics with a reviewer describing it as an [...] "extraordinarily detailed performance" [...] and that [...] "as the blind singer, he brings laughter, tears and a lump in one's throat".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2010–11 season, Morison handed in {{a written}} {{transfer}} request amid speculation about a move to newly promoted Premier League side Norwich City. Millwall subsequently rejected the transfer request. A day later, Morison revealed [...] "Norwich have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> bids that have been turned down so I've done what I've done. I want to play in the Premier League, I might not get another opportunity". On 2 June 2011, Millwall accepted an offer from Norwich City for Morison after the two clubs agreed a fee for the player, it was the fourth bid Norwich had made for Morison. He signed for the club on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 6 June. Morison made his Norwich City debut against Wigan Athletic during the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, playing 75 minutes of the match in a 1–1 draw. He was crucial in Norwich's equalising goal, beating Adrián López Rodríguez on the right wing and providing a cross that was ultimately turned in by Wes Hoolahan. He scored his first goal for the club in Norwich's first home win of the season, a 2–1 victory against Sunderland on 26 September. The goal came shortly after half-time, with Morison heading in Marc Tierney's cross to give Norwich a two-goal lead. Morison scored his second goal for Norwich in a 3–3 draw against Blackburn Rovers on 29 October, with the goal being described as a [...] "stunning strike" [...] {{from the edge of the}} area. A week later, he scored a header from an acute angle in Norwich's 3–2 away defeat against Aston Villa. Morison's fourth goal of the campaign came in a 2–1 home defeat to Arsenal on 19 November, scoring the opening goal of the game after he stole the ball from Per Mertesacker before calmly beating Wojciech Szczęsny in the Arsenal goal. He scored his fourth goal in five Premier League appearances on 3 December, beating Gaël Clichy at the back post to powerfully head the ball past Joe Hart in the Manchester City goal. Morison's goal was a minor consolation in a 5–1 defeat at the City of Manchester Stadium. Morison was also on target for the Canaries in the club's 4–2 home win over Newcastle United on 10 December, scoring Norwich's third goal when he powerfully headed in Andrew Crofts' cross from 12-yards out. He scored in Norwich's first three games of 2012 despite featuring as a substitute in two of the matches, scoring once in the FA Cup in a 4–1 victory over Burnley, as well as netting late goals in 2–1 away victories against Queens Park Rangers and West Bromwich Albion respectively. After his goal at West Brom, Morison did not find the scoresheet for another three months [...] – eventually scoring his tenth goal of the campaign in a 3–3 draw away to Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on 5 May 2012. Morison's late strike from a tight angle drew Norwich level after they had trailed 3–2 with five minutes remaining. During his first season at the club, he scored ten goals in 37 appearances.|$|E
