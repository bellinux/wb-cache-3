5|$|Players use melee attacks, firearms, and {{explosives}} to fight enemies, and <b>may</b> <b>run,</b> jump, and occasionally swim to navigate through the locations. Melee attacks {{can be used}} to silently take down enemies without being detected. Alternatively, players can ambush enemies, which often results in an intense firefight between the two parties.|$|E

5|$|The usual form of {{locomotion}} is hopping, {{with both}} feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously. However, birds <b>may</b> <b>run</b> when performing the rodent-run display. Its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.|$|E

Consequently, those games using the engine <b>may</b> <b>run</b> on the platforms the titles were not officially released on.|$|E
5|$|Current {{sea level}} rise, {{increased}} cyclonic activity, increased ambient temperatures, and increasingly fickle precipitation patterns are {{effects of global}} warming that have affected or are projected to impact India. Thousands {{of people have been}} displaced by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low-lying islands in the Sundarbans. Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing Himalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, and other major rivers; the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands of}} farmers depend on these rivers. A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report states that the Indus River <b>may</b> <b>run</b> dry for the same reason.|$|E

5|$|No.285 Squadron {{generally}} holds two {{pilot and}} navigator conversion courses per year. Each six-month course includes approximately 120 {{hours in the}} FFMS and 30 hours in flying aircraft. It culminates in an airborne operation module, which includes formation flying, airdrops, night landings with night-vision goggles, and simulated combat utilising the C-130's self-defence systems to prepare the aircrew for conditions in Middle East deployments. Following this exercise, the new C-130 aircrew are posted to No.37 Squadron. No.285 Squadron <b>may</b> <b>run</b> 30 or more courses each year for ground support staff; these courses can last {{from one day to}} five weeks.|$|E
5|$|Players <b>may</b> <b>run,</b> jump or use {{vehicles}} {{to navigate the}} game's world. In combat, auto-aim {{can be used as}} assistance against enemies. Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups. Body armour can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops, and players respawn at the nearest hospital, at the expense of losing all weapons and armour, and an amount of money.|$|E
5|$|The House of Councillors of Japan (参議院) is the Upper house, {{with half}} {{the members of the}} house being elected once every three years, for a six-year term.

Of these, 73 are elected from the 47 prefectural districts, by single non-transferable votes, and 48 are elected from a {{nationwide}} list by proportional representation with open lists. The House of Councillors cannot be dissolved by the Prime Minister. Members of the house must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 30 years and older <b>may</b> <b>run</b> for office in the upper house.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and <b>may</b> <b>run</b> up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E
5|$|The player <b>may</b> <b>run,</b> jump, {{or drive}} {{vehicles}} {{to navigate the}} game's world. The player uses melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons such as the Colt Python, an M60 machine gun and a Minigun. The game's three-dimension environment allows a first-person view while aiming with the sniper rifle and rocket launcher. In addition, the game's combat allows the player to commit drive-by shootings by facing sideways in a vehicle. The game provides the player {{a wide variety of}} weapon options—they can be purchased from local firearms dealers, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.|$|E
5|$|Tracing its {{heritage}} to 1841 when Oregon pioneers {{selected a}} Supreme Judge with probate powers, {{the court has}} grown from a single judge to its current make up of seven justices. Justices of the court serve six-year terms upon election, however vacancies are filled by appointments of the Governor of Oregon until the next general election when any qualified candidate <b>may</b> <b>run</b> for the position, including the appointee. These seven justices then select one member to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice. The court’s Chief Justice is not only responsible for assigning cases to the other justices to write the court’s opinions, but is also {{the chief executive of the}} Oregon Judicial Department.|$|E

5|$|The House of Representatives of Japan (衆議院) is the Lower house, {{with the}} members of the house being elected once every four years, or when dissolved, for a {{four-year}} term. As of December 24, 2014, it has 475 members. Of these, 180 members are elected from 11 multi-member constituencies by a party-list system of proportional representation, and 295 are elected from single-member constituencies. 238 seats are required for majority. The House of Representatives is the more powerful house out of the two, it is able to override vetoes on bills imposed by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority. It can, however, be dissolved by the Prime Minister at will. Members of the house must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 25 years and older <b>may</b> <b>run</b> for office in the lower house.|$|E
5|$|The game blends investigative {{elements}} with fast-paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights. Players use melee {{attacks and}} firearms to fight enemies, and <b>may</b> <b>run,</b> jump or use vehicles {{to navigate the}} world. In combat, auto-aim and a cover system {{can be used as}} assistance against enemies. Should player characters take damage, the character's health will gradually regenerate. Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, players have the option to skip directly to the destination by nominating their partner as the driver. Players can also ask the partner for directions. In addition to storyline cases, players may engage in an optional 40 side-investigations, known as Street Crimes, that are not related to the case that they are working on. Some street crimes will feature characters from previous cases.|$|E
5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not use cryptic {{stalking}} but displays by moving quickly and smoothly. In P. fimbriata from Queensland, contests between males usually are very brief and do no damage. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and the victor may evict a loser and then eat the loser's eggs – but victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losing female. If a P. fimbriata male from Queensland displays to a female, she <b>may</b> <b>run</b> away or she may charge at him. If the pair reach agreement after this, they will copulate if she is mature, and if she is sub-adult he will cohabit in her nest until she finishes moulting, and then they copulate. P. fimbriata typically copulates much quicker than other jumping spiders. Unlike in other Portia species, females of P. fimbriata do not eat their mates during courting, nor during or after copulation.|$|E
50|$|Insulated wires <b>may</b> be <b>run</b> in one {{of several}} forms between {{electrical}} devices. This may be a specialised bendable pipe, called a conduit, or one of several varieties of metal (rigid steel or aluminium) or non-metallic (PVC or HDPE) tubing. Rectangular cross-section metal or PVC wire troughs (North America) or trunking (UK) may be used if many circuits are required. Wires <b>run</b> underground <b>may</b> be <b>run</b> in plastic tubing encased in concrete, but metal elbows {{may be used in}} severe pulls. Wiring in exposed areas, for example factory floors, <b>may</b> be <b>run</b> in cable trays or rectangular raceways having lids.|$|R

5|$|The Pact of Olivos {{diminished the}} electoral {{strength}} of the UCR, leading {{to the rise of}} the Frepaso. Both parties united in a political coalition, the Alliance, which defeated the PJ in the 1997 midterm elections. It was the PJ's first national defeat since 1985. The parties held open primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections. De la Rúa stood for the UCR; the whole party, including Alfonsín, supported him. The Frepaso candidate was Graciela Fernández Meijide, who had defeated Peronism in the populous Buenos Aires province. De la Rúa won the primary elections by a wide margin. In the primaries, De la Rúa was voted for by more people than those who voted for the UCR in 1995. Despite his victory, Alfonsín was still the president of the UCR. They disagreed on the vice president for De la Rúa's ticket; he thought that it should be Meijide because she took part in the primary elections and came from a different district than him. Alfonsín preferred the popular Carlos Álvarez, leader of the Frepaso, saying he could attract more voters and had more political expertise. It was also a result of the internal politics of the Alliance: except for Meijide, the Frepaso did not have a political figure who <b>may</b> <b>run</b> with good chances for governor of the Buenos Aires province. Had she run for vicepresident, Frepaso would have had to resign that candidacy to a radical candidate.|$|E
