50|$|Multi-leaf springs {{are widely}} used for the {{suspension}} of cars, trucks and railway wagons. A multi-leaf spring consists {{of a series of}} flat plates, usually of semi-elliptical shape. The flat plates are called leaves of the spring.The leaf at the top has maximum length. The length gradually decreases from the top leaf to the bottom leaf. The longest leaf at the top is called <b>master</b> <b>leaf.</b> It is bent at both ends to form the spring eyes. Two bolts are inserted through these eyes to fix the leaf spring to the automobile body. The leaves are held together by means of two U-bolts and a center clip. Rebound clips are provided to keep the leaves in alignment and prevent lateral shifting of the leaves during operation. At the center, the leaf spring is supported on the axle. Multi-leaf springs are provided with one or two extra full-length leaves in addition to the <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> and the graduated length leaves. The extra full-length leaves are provided to support the transverse sheer force.|$|E
40|$|The main {{component}} of leaf spring is <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> {{and it is}} subjected to cyclic loading. There are many causes of <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> failure. The maximum stress induced in the <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> is at support. Due to non geometric linearity and large deflection behavior the stress may be occurred at any section over the span of leaf spring. Hence inthis work evaluation of stresses in <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> over the span is studied using finite element method and strain gauge technique. The stress analysis of half cantilever <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> of leaf spring with and without extra full length leave is carried out. The result of finite element method is verified with experimental and analyticalcalculations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A pot-grown {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effect of limited irrigation on growth, storage water amount of every organ and water use of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings. Four watering treatments were designed in the study, i. e. (W 1 : 0. 3 θf, W 2 : 0. 5 θf, W 3 : 0. 7 θf, W 4 : 0. 9 θf, θf is the field capacity). Results show that Jatropha curcas L. seedlings has the higher resistance ability to drought-stress, it can survival in lower soil moisture (0. 3 θf), and has certain growth potential. Dry mass of every organ in plant shows that shoot＞branch and master rod＞leaf＞root＞petiole. Storage water capability of unit dry mass for every organ in plant shows that petiole＞branch and master rod or shoot＞leaf＞root. Compared to W 4 treatments, W 2 reduced irrigation water by 27. 1 %, mean leaf area of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings for W 2 reduced by 25. 8 %, but root-shoot ratio increased by 6. 1 %, meanwhile, mean storage water capability of unit root, lateral branch and <b>master</b> rod, <b>leaf,</b> shoot and total plant dry mass of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings for W 2 increased by 15. 4 %, 1. 3 %, 7. 4 %, 0. 6 % and 1. 8 %, respectively. But mean root, shoot and total plant dry mass accumulation of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings for W 2 only reduced by 11. 4 %, 17. 7 %, 15. 8 %, respectively, therefore, irrigation water use efficiency and total water use efficiency of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings for W 2 increased by 15. 5 %, 14. 9 %, respectively. It is clear that W 2 treatment not only increased water use efficiency, but increased regulation storage water capability, thus W 2 treatment’s Jatropha curcas L. seedlings improved water regulation and controlled water balance capability and resistance ability to drought-stress...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that in a loaded {{structural}} member, redistribution of stresses occur near a discontinuity, thus increasing the induced stress value significantly over the nominal stress value. The paper presents an experimental study on existence of stress concentration in the vicinity of drill hole present in <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> of a leaf spring bundle. For the purpose of experimentation a leaf spring testing rig is set up and <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> of an automobile leaf spring is procured. To investigate the state of stress field produced in the <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> spring, load-deflection behavior of the <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> is first studied experimentally. Experimental stress concentration factors are obtained by mounting strain gauges at different locations, around the central drill hole of the <b>master</b> <b>leaf.</b> In corresponding theoretical analysis, the <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> spring is modeled as a curved beam with a circular hole on its centre line subjected to combined bending and stretching. Theoretical and experimental stress concentration factors are reported in an appropriate form which will facilitate to undertake rigorous theoretical analysis of stress distribution around geometric discontinuities in beam under different loading conditions...|$|E
40|$|Leaf springs {{are one of}} the {{frequently}} used oldest suspension components. They are used in conventional and commercial vehicles. The past literature review shows that leaf springs are designed as forces are generalized on the elements where orientation of the axle mounting gives the reaction forces in the chassis attachment Positions. Modelling is done using CATIA V 5 R 19 and Analysis is done by using ANSYS 14. 0 software. This paper describes static analysis of conventional structural steel leaf spring (<b>master</b> <b>leaf)</b> with support plate provided at the centre of leaf. Also the provision of change in eye section area is made...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental study on large deflection behavior of initially curved cantilever beams subjected to {{various types of}} loadings. The physical system as a straight cantilever beam subjected to a tip concentrated load is considered in this study. Nonlinear differential equations are obtained for large deflection analysis of such a straight cantilever beam, and this problem is known to involve geometrical nonlinearity. The equations are solved numerically {{with the help of}} MATLAB® computational platform to get deflection profiles of the concerned problem. These results are imposed subsequently on the center line of an initially curved beam to get theoretical load-deflection behavior of curved beam problems. To verify the theoretical model, experiment is carried out with the <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> of a leaf spring bundle by modeling it as an initially curved cantilever beam. The effects of initial clamping and geometry variations in the eye-region are observed from experimental investigation which is commonly neglected in the mathematical formulation. Comparisons of the theoretical results with the experimental results are quite good, but the avenues for further improvement are also reported. The proposed approach is further extended to study large deflection behavior of an initially curved cantilever beam subjected to distributed and combined load. These results are successfully validated with existing results for straight beams and some new results are furnished for initially curved cantilever beams...|$|E
