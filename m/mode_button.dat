50|$|The {{remote control}} has 7 action buttons, an 8-way {{directional}} pad, and 2 <b>mode</b> <b>buttons.</b> The remote also {{functions as a}} flashlight. The Strafe/Lazer/Cannon functions allow Roboboa to send commands to other WowWee robots such as other Roboboas, Robosapien, Robosapien v2, Roboreptile, Roboraptor, Robopet, or Roboquad.|$|R
50|$|In Switch <b>Mode</b> or <b>button</b> <b>Mode,</b> the map has {{one or more}} {{switches}} on it. A player claims a switch for their team by touching it. A team wins by gaining control of all the switches.|$|R
5000|$|Some common {{additions}} to the standard pad include shoulder buttons (also called [...] "bumpers") and triggers placed {{along the edges of}} the pad (shoulder buttons are usually digital, i.e. merely on/off, while triggers are usually analog); centrally placed start, select, and <b>mode</b> <b>buttons,</b> and an internal motor to provide force feedback.|$|R
5000|$|Some models also {{received}} the [...] "Auto Adaptive" [...] gearbox, which supposedly assesses the driver's driving style, then switches {{to the most}} appropriate of approximately 6 onboard programmes. This gearbox was further enhanced by a [...] "Sport" [...] <b>mode</b> <b>button</b> (in addition to the sports button for the suspension), which shortened the gear change times, therefore offering a more responsive experience. The final new upgrade effecting the driving experience saw {{the introduction of a}} [...] "Snow Mode" [...] button, located next to the new sport <b>mode</b> <b>button.</b> Although rarely used in some countries, this was a surprisingly effective addition to the driver's arsenal; during any notable falls of snow that may affect the road ahead, a simple push of this button commands the gearbox to only accelerate from 2nd gear and up, and not to rev the engine too high, thus preventing any loss of traction.|$|E
5000|$|Popular Mechanics {{refers to}} the large display of the watch which {{makes it easy to}} read {{multiple}} outputs without having to scroll using the <b>mode</b> <b>button</b> and adds that [...] "While this may be useful for climbers who have their hands full gripping cliff faces, it could be just as practical for strap-hanging subway riders who are jammed between fellow commuters".|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 2007, iDrive added {{programmable}} buttons (6 USA/Japan, 8 in Europe) to the dashboard, breaking {{tradition of}} having the entire system operated via the control knob. Each button can be programmed to instantly access any feature within iDrive (such as a particular navigation route, or one's favorite radio station). In addition, a dedicated AM/FM button, and a <b>Mode</b> <b>button</b> (to switch between entertainment sources) were added (only United States) ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Microsoft SideWinder gamepad had {{a digital}} directional pad, six fire buttons, two trigger buttons, and a [...] "Mode" [...] and [...] "Start" [...] button. The original gameport version had a pass-through, so additional joypads or joysticks {{could be used}} without unplugging the SideWinder, and also allowed the connection of up to four SideWinder gamepads working simultaneously. Newer USB versions of the SideWinder gamepad have a round digital directional pad instead of the more traditional cross-shaped directional pad, and lack the <b>mode</b> <b>button.</b> The Microsoft SideWinder's button layout {{is very similar to}} that of the Sega Saturn controller, which was released over the same time period.|$|E
50|$|With {{the change}} of {{hardware}} from Neo Geo to Atomiswave, the number of buttons is now increased to five. In addition to the standard four attack buttons used in the previous games, a fifth button is now added {{which is used to}} activate the Heat Mode. Heat Mode will cause the character to blink red and increase their offensive strength, with the side effect being that the character's health will begin to drain. The player will return to normal after getting hit by the opponent or by pressing Heat <b>Mode</b> <b>button</b> again to deactivate it, and the player must wait until you lose a round to activate it again. The player cannot use Heat Mode when the life gauge is low.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{advancement}} {{included on}} the 2009 model was D-Mode Throttle Control Valve Mapping, which allows a rider to choose between three distinct maps depending on the rider’s environment. Each mode of operation controls YCC-T characteristics, changing how the R1 reacts to rider input. The first mode is Standard Mode, which delivers performance {{for a wide variety}} of driving conditions. The second mode is [...] "A" [...] mode which will give a rider more available power in the lower to mid RPM range. The third mode is [...] "B" [...] mode, which is a dial back of the previous mode, designed to soften throttle response in inclement weather and heavy traffic. D-Mode throttle control is controlled by the rider through a forward <b>mode</b> <b>button</b> near the throttle. The instrument panel is more comprehensive than previous models, and the 2009/2010 Yamaha YZF-R1 model had a gear indicator as standard.|$|E

5000|$|The Logitech Cordless Action {{controller}} is an officially licensed {{wireless controller}} for the PlayStation 2 made by Logitech. It features {{all of the}} inputs found the standard DualShock 2 controller, i.e. ten analog (pressure-sensitive) buttons ( [...] , , , , L1, R1, L2, R2, Start and Select), three digital button (L3, R3 and the analog <b>mode</b> <b>button)</b> and two analog sticks. As its buttons are pressure-sensitive, the controller is compatible with games which require a DualShock 2. The controller also features two vibration motors for haptic feedback, which are compatible with DualShock/DualShock 2 enabled games. As a power saving measure, the vibration may be turned on or off by the user {{by way of a}} button on the controller's face. It is powered by two AA batteries. It communicates with the console using a proprietary 2.4 GHz RF protocol wireless by way of a dongle which connects to the PS2's controller port in a similar manner to Nintendo's WaveBird wireless controller.|$|E
5000|$|The Sixaxis {{features}} finer analog sensitivity {{than the}} DualShock 2, increased to 10-bit precision from the 8-bit precision of the DualShock 2. The controller also uses both analog and digital signals simultaneously {{at all times}} during gameplay. The frame beneath the L2 and R2 buttons has been omitted and these buttons have been made trigger-like, with the range of travel determining the degree of analog input rather than the range of pressure. In {{the place of the}} [...] "Analog" [...] <b>mode</b> <b>button</b> of previous Sony dual analog controllers (Dual Analog, DualShock and DualShock 2) is a jewel-like [...] "PS button" [...] with the PlayStation logo, which can be used to access the home menu or XMB (after system software version 2.40), switch controller inputs and turn the console or the controller on or off. It fulfills a similar function to the [...] "Guide" [...] button featured on Microsoft's Xbox 360 controller, or the [...] "Home" [...] button on the Wii Remote.|$|E

The syntax coloring (demo jpeg at [URL] distinguishes commands, variables, macros, simple and compound quoted strings (and unquoted string literals), and different kinds of comments. This includes macros inside of strings, strings in expressions in macro functions, etc. Mata syntax coloring inlcuded. On the integration side, added bits allow a line, selection, or separately defined section of code (as well as the whole file) to be run in Stata with a keystroke. Semi-colon delimited, and Mata, lines are recognized from context and run correctly. In addition, the code can be run in "do" "run" or "trace" modes, as determined by a <b>mode</b> <b>button</b> in jEdit. Multi-line commands (ie, split with triple-slashes) are also recognized and run as a whole without the need to select all lines. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{measures}} have been suggested to mitigate the problem of button BPM trapped mode heating. A test fixture, {{using a combination of}} commercial-off-the-shelf and custom machined components, was assembled to validate the simulations. We present details of the fixture design, measurement results, and a comparison of the results with the simulations. A brief history of the trapped <b>mode</b> <b>button</b> heating problem and a set of design rules for BPM button optimization are presented elsewhere in these proceedings. Here we present measurements on a test fixture that was assembled to confirm, if possible, a subset of those rules: (1) Minimize the trapped mode impedance and the resulting power deposited in this mode by the beam. (2) Maximize the power re-radiated back into the beampipe. (3) Maximize electrical conductivity of the outer circumference of the button and minimize conductivity of the inner circumference of the shell, to shift power deposition from the button to the shell. The problem is then how to extract useful and relevant information from S-parameter measurements of the test fixture...|$|E
40|$|Aluminum alloy sheets {{have been}} widely used to build the {{thin-walled}} structures by mechanical clinching technology in recent years. However, there is an exterior protrusion located on the lower sheet and a pit on the upper sheet, which may restrict the application of the clinching technology in visible areas. In the present study, an improved clinched joint used to join aluminum alloy sheets was investigated by experimental method. The improved clinching process used for joining aluminum alloy evolves through four phases: (a) localized deformation; (b) drawing; (c) backward extrusion; and (d) mechanical interlock forming. A flat surface can be produced using the improved clinching process. Shearing strength, tensile strength, material flow, main geometrical parameters, and failure mode of the improved clinched joint were investigated. The sheet material was compressed to flow radially and upward using a punch, which generated a mechanical interlock by producing severe localized plastic deformation. The neck thickness and interlock of the improved clinched joint were increased by increasing the forming force, which also contributed to increase the strength of the clinched joint. The improved clinched joint can get high shearing strength and tensile strength. Three main failure modes were observed in the failure process, which were neck fracture <b>mode,</b> <b>button</b> separation mode, and mixed failure mode. The improved clinched joint has better joining quality to join aluminum alloy sheets on the thin-walled structures...|$|E
30|$|In general, {{because of}} {{geographical}} distances between producers and consumers demand for goods transportation has raised (Chopra and Meindl 2001). Transportation, especially in long distances, {{is a world}} class business which cannot be accomplished through roads only due to availability and cost concerns. So {{there is a need}} for other transportation modes or a combination of them (i.e., multimodal transportation). European Conference of Ministers of Transport in 2001 defined multimodal transportation as “movement of goods in one and the same loading unit or vehicle, which uses successively two or more modes of transport without handling the goods themselves in changing modes”. Multimodal transportation has experienced an increased importance during recent years and now multimodal transportation is competing with single-mode transportation. In this regard, many transportation companies have established multimodal transportation services. The second point is that, multimodal transportation is becoming an important policy for organizations because of its advantages in terms of cost and coordination between modes in large-scale cargoes (OECD 1997). The third point is that, in references and handbooks of transportation, multimodal transportation is treated as an independent and well-separated transportation <b>mode</b> (<b>Button</b> 1994). Last but not least, since 1990, the number of papers on multimodal transportation follows a growing trend (Bontekoning et al. 2004). Some researchers have reviewed the related literatures (SteadieSeifi et al. 2014). To sum up, multimodal transportation is a relatively new field of research, with its increasing importance during recent years.|$|E
