40|$|I {{report the}} results of {{observational}} and theoretical studies of the tidal and residual circulation in Long Island Sound. This estuary is near resonant at the semidiurnal frequency, has substantial variations in cross-sectional area along its length, and has spatially variable and seasonally modulated density stratification. These physical characteristic of the Sound lead to strong tidal and residual circulation that are coupled by vertical mixing and may have {{a major role in}} controlling the development of hypoxia in the western Sound in the summer. I provide the first detailed description of the vertical and horizontal structure of the circulation in the western Sound by combining both moored and ship <b>mounted</b> <b>profiling</b> current meter observations obtained over a three year period. I show that the vertical structure of the principal component (M 2) amplitude is strongly sheared and that this structure cannot be reproduced by a classic model with time-invariant eddy viscosity. Seasonal variations in stratification do not influence the vertical structure of the M 2. Strong over-tides at the M 4 and M 6 frequencies were detected with M 6 amplitudes that increase to the west. I demonstrate that this is inconsistent with a weakly non-linear vertically and horizontally averaged model driven by semidiurnal tides in a converging channel with bottom friction, likely due to neglected channel geometry and time-variant bottom friction. The observations also reveal a weaker, but persistant, non-tidal circulation. In combination with hydrography obtained during short high resolution cruises and from data archives, I examine the importance of each term in the momentum balance both along- and across- channel, and put these into context using longer-term (but more spatially sparse) velocity, wind and hydrographic data. I develop a novel application of inverse methods that utilizes data measurements to test model validity and infer unknown data parameters when the appropriate model is chosen. ...|$|R

40|$|The design {{allows for}} the low-stress {{mounting}} of fragile objects, like thin walled glass, by using particular ways of compensating, isolating, or releasing the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) differences between the mounted object and the mount itself. This <b>mount</b> <b>profile</b> is lower than true full kinematic mounting. Also, this approach enables accurate positioning of the component for electrical and optical interfaces. It avoids the higher and unpredictable stress issues that often result from potting the object. The mount has been built and tested to space-flight specifications, and has been used for fiber-optic, optical, and electrical interfaces for a spaceflight mission. This mount design is often metal and is slightly larger than the object to be mounted. The objects are optical or optical/electrical, and optical and/or electrical interfaces are required from the top and bottom. This requires the mount to be open at both ends, and for the object s position to be controlled. Thin inside inserts at the top and bottom contact the housing at defined lips, or edges, and hold the fragile object in the mount. The inserts can be customized to mimic the outer surface of the object, which further reduces stress. The inserts have the opposite CTE of the housing material, partially compensating for the CTE difference that causes thermal stress. A spring washer is inserted at one end to compensate for more CTE difference and to hold the object against the location edge of the mount for any optical position requirements. The spring also ensures that any fiber-optic or optic interface, which often requires some pressure to ensure a good interface, does not overstress the fragile object. The insert thickness, material, and spring washer size can be traded against each other to optimize the mount and stresses for various thermal and vibration load ranges and other mounting requirements. The alternate design uses two separate, unique features to reduce stress and hold the object. A release agent is applied to the inside surface of the mount just before the binding potting material is injected in the mount. This prevents the potting material from bonding to the mount, and thus prevents stress from being applied, at very low temperatures, to the fragile object being mounted. The potting material mixing and curing is temperature- and humidity-controlled. The mount has radial grooves cut in it that the potting material fills, thus controlling the vertical position of the mounted object. The design can easily be used for long and thin objects, short and wide objects, and any shape in between. The design s advantages are amplified for long and thin fragile objects. The general testing range was 45 to + 45 C, but multiple mounts were successfully tested down to 60 and up to 50 C and the design can be adjusted for larger ranges...|$|R

Convergence to the state estimate solution is carried out by systematically adjusting the control variables (atmospheric state and initial conditions) using the adjoint model. A cost function compares the model state to in situ observations (Argo float profiles, CTD synoptic sections, SEaOS instrument <b>mounted</b> seal <b>profiles,</b> and XBTs), altimetric observations (ENVISAT, GEOSAT, Jason, TOPEX/Poseidon), and other data sets (e. g. infrared and microwave radiometer observed sea surface temperature and NSIDC sea-ice concentration). Costs attributed to control variable perturbations ensure a physically realistic solution. The state estimate {{is found to be}} largely consistent with the individual observations, as well as with integrated fluxes inferred from previous static inverse models. The transformed Eulerian mean formulation is an elegant way to theorize about the Southern Ocean. Current researchers utilizing this framework, however, have been making assumptions that render their theories largely irrelevant to the actual ocean. It is shown that theories of the overturning circulation must include the effect of pressure forcing. This is true in the most buoyant waters, where pressure forcing overcomes eddy and wind forcing to balance a poleward geostrophic transport and allows the buoyancy budget to be closed. Pressure forcing is also lowest order at depth. Indeed, the Southern Ocean's characteristic multiple cell overturning is primarily in geostrophic balance.

Three different nose <b>profiles</b> <b>mounted</b> on a cylindrical body were tested in a supersonic wind tunnel and numerically simulated by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. The conical and hemispherical nose profiles tested were found to generate shock waves of sufficient strength to separate the boundary layer on the cylinder, while the shock wave generated by the ogival profile did not separate the boundary layer. For the separated flow, separation was found to occur predominantly on the windward side of the cylinder with the lee-side remaining shielded from the direct impact of the incident shock wave. A thickening of the boundary layer on the lee-side of all the profiles was observed. In the conical and hemispherical cases {{this leads to the}} re-formation of the incident shock wave some distance away {{from the surface of the}} cylinder. A complex reflection pattern off the shock wave/boundary layer interaction (SWBLI) was also identified for the separated flow cases. For comparative purposes an inviscid simulation was performed using the hemispherical profile. Significant differences between the viscous and inviscid results were noted including the absence of the boundary layer leading to a simplified shock wave reflection pattern forming. The behaviour of the incident shock wave on the lee-side of the cylinder was also affected with the shock wave amalgamating on the surface of the cylinder instead of away from the surface as per the viscous case. Test data from the wind tunnel identified two separation lines present on the cylindrical surface of the hemispherical SWBLI generator. The pair of lines were not explicitly evident in the original CFD simulations run, but were later identified in a high resolution simulation...|$|R
