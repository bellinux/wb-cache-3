And the student of Comenius will find in him an active and sensitive mind responding with a most interesting similarity to our own responses, to the similar conditions of his time. He has been distressed and dismayed--as most of us have been distressed and dismayed--by a rapid development of violence, by a great release of cruelty and suffering in human affairs. He felt none of the security that was felt in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}} of the certainty of progress. He realized as we do that the outlook for humanity is a very dark and uncertain one unless human effort is stimulated and organized. He traced the evils of his time to human discords and divisions, to our political divisions, and the mutual misconceptions due to our diversity of languages and leading ideas. In all that he might be writing and thinking in 1921. And his proposed remedies find an echo in a number of our contemporary movements. He wanted to bring all nations to form one single state. He wanted to have a universal language as the common medium of instruction and discussion, and he wanted to create a common Book of Necessary Knowledge, a sort of common basis of wisdom, for all educated men in the world.|$|E

The school {{represented}} by Mr. Rossetti's picture and adopted {{for his own}} by Mr. Holman Hunt, professed, necessarily, to be a learned one; and to represent things which had happened long ago, in a manner credible to any moderns {{who were interested in}} them. The value to us of such a school necessarily depends on the things it chooses to represent, out of the infinite history of mankind. For instance, David, of the first Republican Academe, was a true master of this school; and, painting the Horatii receiving their swords, foretold the triumph of that Republican Power. Gérôme, of the latest Republican Academe, paints the dying Polichinelle, and the morituri gladiators: foretelling, in like manner, the shame and virtual ruin of <b>modern</b> <b>Republicanism.</b> What our own painters have done for us in this kind has been too unworthy of their real powers, for Mr. Rossetti threw more than half his strength into literature, and, in that precise measure, left himself unequal to his appointed task in painting; while Mr. Hunt, not knowing the necessity of masters any more than the rest of our painters, and attaching too great importance to the externals of the life of Christ, separated himself for long years from all discipline by the recognized laws of his art; and fell into errors which wofully shortened his hand and discredited his cause--into which again I hold it no part of my duty to enter. But such works as either of these painters have done, without antagonism or ostentation, and in their own true instincts; as all Rossetti's drawing from the life of Christ, more especially that of the Madonna gathering the bitter herbs for the Passover when He was twelve years old; and that of the Magdalen leaving her companions to come to Him; these, together with all the mythic scenes which he painted from the Vita Nuova and Paradiso of Dante, are of quite imperishable power and value: as also many of the poems to which he gave up part of his painter's strength. Of Holman Hunt's [...] "Light of the World," [...] and [...] "Awakening Conscience," [...] I have publicly spoken and written, now for many years, as standard in their kind: the study of sunset on the Egean, lately placed by me in the schools of Oxford, is not less authoritative in landscape, so far as its aim extends.|$|E

In the 1980s, Jürgen Habermas opposed the Ritter-School for being leading representatives of German neo-conservatism.

50|$|Anti-monarchism {{became more}} strident in the Dutch Republic {{during and after}} the Eighty Years' War, which began in 1568. This anti-monarchism was more {{propaganda}} than a political philosophy; most of the anti-monarchist works appeared in the form of widely distributed pamphlets. This evolved into a systematic critique of monarchy, written by men such as Johan Uytenhage de Mist, Radboud Herman Scheel, Lieven de Beaufort and the brothers Johan and Peter de la Court. These writers saw all monarchies as illegitimate tyrannies that were inherently corrupt. These authors were more concerned with preventing the position of Stadholder from evolving into a monarchy, than with attacking their former rulers.

Critiquing the ‘malleability of memory’, it interrogates attempts at remoulding the memory of the ‘Loughgall Martyrs’ in tandem with ‘memory politics’ in <b>modern</b> Irish <b>republicanism</b> and transitioning Northern Ireland. It examines the reinterpretation of the Loughgall memory by Sinn Fein to support their current strategy in the transition of Northern Ireland and conversely how traditionalists use the resilience of memory to contest reinterpretation. Particular examination is given to the emergence of the 1916 societies as a platform for localised resistance to political use of the memory of the men by Sinn Fein. It also examines how the memory of the ‘Loughgall Martyrs’ has been imbibed with assertions of victimhood that feed into wider contestation over the past in the North of Ireland...|$|R
50|$|Since Thomas Hobbes, at {{the core}} of republicanism is the concept of the social contract. Although <b>modern</b> <b>republicanism</b> {{rejected}} monarchy (whether hereditary or otherwise autocratic) in favour of rule by the people, classical republicanism treated monarchy as one form of government among others. Classical republicanism was rather aimed against any form of tyranny, whether monarchic, aristocratic, or democratic (tyranny of the majority). The notions of what constituted an ideal republic to classical republicans themselves depended on personal view. However, the most ideal republic featured form of mixed government and was based on the pursuit of civility.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} argued that Machiavelli was not a {{classical}} republican, since he described mostly medieval political relations. Indeed, Machiavelli's innovation, addition, or transformation of classical republicanism more likely marks a turning point, and the dawn of modern republicanism; Machiavelli's particular brand of republicanism has been dubbed [...] "rapacious republicanism" [...] by a collection of scholars. At any rate, that classical republicanism actually refers to a philosophy developed primarily in the early modern period is acknowledged by many scholars to be confusing; therefore, some now use the term early <b>modern</b> <b>republicanism</b> to cover this branch of political thought.

Their ideas were also influenced by classical and <b>modern</b> <b>republicanism,</b> particularly the works of Aristotle and Machiavelli, and by the 'Common Sense' philosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment. This philosophy led the societies to oppose many of the Federalist Party policies. The societies advocated both a system of publicly funded and locally controlled education for all classes and a broadening of the franchise. Standing to Jefferson's ideological left, they advocated a much more democratic political agenda than he supported, including attempts to create a permanent organization of popular dissent directed against the federal government and an educational philosophy based on a dialectical and democratic approach to learning.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{progress}} of contemporary republican theory from its civic roots to its <b>modern</b> conception. <b>Republicanism</b> is a paradigm of liberty, and the transformation of this theory of liberty from concepts of self-government and civic virtue through to contemporary ideas of non-domination and political autonomy will be examined. Using Andrew Fletcher's particular brand of civic-humanist republicanism as a critical model, this thesis will show that republicanism is vital for addressing the issues an increasingly interdependent and unjust global system brings about. This thesis considers Andrew Fletcher's contribution to republican political theory and demonstrates that his unique approach to liberty, peace and the European political order is {{an important contribution to}} the canon of political thought used in contemporary scholarship to understand the political ordering of society. Furthermore, his contribution to the debate surrounding the Treaty of Union is a relevant starting point for consideration of the current Scottish Independence question. It shows that Fletcher's civic-humanist republican theories are both relevant and necessary for the contemporary understanding of the republican theory of liberty, narrowing the gap between the dominant ideologies. Where communitarianism lays {{at one end of the}} spectrum, and libertarianism the other, Fletcher's own brand of civic-humanist republicanism narrows this broad spectrum...|$|R
40|$|European Contexts for English Republicanism offers new {{perspectives}} on early <b>modern</b> English <b>republicanism</b> through {{its focus on}} the Continental reception of and engagement with seventeenth-century English thinkers and political events. Looking both at political ideas and at the people that shaped them, the collection examines English republican thought in its wider European context during the later seventeenth and eighteenth century. In a number of case studies, the contributors assess the {{different ways in which}} English republican ideas were not only shaped by the thought of the ancients, but also by contemporary authors from all over Europe, such as Hugo Grotius or Christoph Besold. They demonstrate that English republican thinkers did not only act in dialogue with Continental authors and scholars, their ideas in turn also left a long-lasting legacy in Europe as they were received, transformed and put to new uses by thinkers in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. Far from being an exclusively transatlantic affair, as much of the established scholarship suggests, English republican thought also left its legacy on the European Continent, finding its way into wider debates about the rights and wrongs of the English Civil War and the nature of government, while later translations of English republican works also influenced the key thinkers of the French Revolution and the liberals of the nineteenth century. Bringing together a range of fresh and original essays by British and European scholars in the field of early modern intellectual history and English studies, this collection of essays revises a one-sided approach to English republicanism and widens the scope of study beyond linguistic and national boundaries by looking at English republicans and their continental networks and legacy...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the republican}} {{revival of the}} last few decades, the ideal of freedom as non-domination has become an {{important}} point of convergence among republican theorists, especially among those associated with neo-Roman republicanism. Furthermore, all neo-Roman theorists argue that a legitimate republican polity in contemporary societies must take a democratic form to overcome the aristocratic and elitist features pervasive in classical and <b>modern</b> <b>republicanism.</b> This study argues that the emerging concept of republican democracy remains essentially contested despite the increasing agreement on the ideal of liberty being constitutive of the republican tradition. It posits that the meaning of the concept of republican democracy becomes unstable in the transition from the normative ideal to the institutional level of neo-republican reasoning, which is evidenced by the fact that neo-Roman theorists embrace the ideal of non-domination but disagree on the characteristics of the institutional design capable of realizing that ideal. To substantiate this argument, the study compares three recent models of democracy that are somehow associated with neo-Roman republicanism&# 8212;the electoral-contestatory model, the political constitutionalism model, and the Machiavellian democracy model, championed by Philip Pettit, Richard Bellamy, and John McCormick, respectively...|$|E

D.) : Bilkent University, Department of Political Science and Public Administration, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2016. This thesis examines {{the status of}} the military in modern normative republican theory. In classical republicanism there is a strong relation between the republic and the military, which was envisaged to perform three critical internal functions in a republic: preventing executive tyranny, promoting civic virtue and providing the best civic engagement for the citizens that produces common good. However, a study of <b>modern</b> <b>republicanism</b> reveals a diminishing emphasis on the role of military. Some prominent advocates of contemporary republican theory have little or no role for it in their conceptualization, while there are still some advocates who believe either military itself or its civic alternatives can and should contribute to effective functioning of the republican system. I argue that military may not be central as it was before, but if a modern state needs to keep military, it can still contribute to motivational and institutional challenges of republicanism. These contributions will only be possible if military can be established as a democratically-controlled institution that will not abuse its power to de-politicize the political realm and thwart citizens’ capacity for self-rule. In addition, I also argue that removing the central concept of citizen-army from republican theory will create inconsistency unless same functions are performed by other means. by Ali Nedim Karabulut.

40|$|A common {{perception}} of Spinoza casts {{him as one}} of the precursors, perhaps even founders, of modern humanism and Enlightenment thought. Given that in the twentieth century, humanism was commonly associated with the ideology of secularism and the politics of liberal democracies, and that Spinoza has been taken as voicing a “message of secularity” and as having provided “the psychology and ethics of a democratic soul” and “the decisive impulse to… <b>modern</b> <b>republicanism</b> which takes it bearings by the dignity of every man,” it is easy to understand how this humanistic image developed. Spinoza’s deep interest in, and extensive discussion of, human nature {{may have contributed to the}} emergence of this image as well. In this paper, I will argue that this common {{perception of}} Spinoza is mistaken and that Spinoza was in fact the most radical anti-humanist among modern philosophers. Arguably, Spinoza rejects any notion of human dignity. He conceives of God’s - and not man’s - point of view as the only objective perspective through which one can know things adequately, and it is at least highly questionable whether he allows for any genuine notions of human autonomy or morality. 	The notions of ‘humanism’ and ‘anti-humanism’ have been discussed extensively -mainly among continental philosophers - since the end of World War II. Because these notions carry a variety of historical, ideological, and philosophical meanings, it is important to provide at the outset at least a rudimentary clarification of my use of these two terms. By ‘humanism’ I mean a view which (1) assigns a unique value to human beings among other things in nature, (2) stresses the primacy of the human perspective in understanding the nature of things, and (3) attempts to point out an essential property of humanity which justifies its elevated and unique status. This definition of philosophical humanism has only little in common with the historical notion of Renaissance humanism, and seems to match quite well the common understanding of philosophical humanism suggested by current philosophical dictionaries and encyclopedias. 	This notion of humanism should be understood in contrast to two competing positions. On the one hand, in contrast to the theocentric position that considers humanity to be radically dependent upon God, humanism affirms at least some degree of human independence. On the other hand, in contrast to the naturalist position which endorses the scientific examination of human beings just like any other objects in nature, humanists affirm the existence of a metaphysical and moral gulf between humanity and nature. This gulf assigns a special value to humanity and does not allow us to treat human beings like any other things in nature. For many humanists the nature/humanity gulf does not allow the application of the methods of natural sciences to the disciplines of the humanities. 	Humanism does not begin with modernity. In order to see how far back we can trace this position, we may recall Protagoras’ saying: “Man is the measure of all things, of things that are, that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not. ” In modern philosophy, the humanistic position had regained dominant status since the Renaissance, and variants of this position were vigorously argued for by prominent thinkers such as Pico della Mirandola, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Fichte, and finally, Hegel. 	In this paper, I will argue that Spinoza was a foe, and not a friend, of this tradition. I suggest that, in contrast to these humanist philosophers, Spinoza considers man as a marginal and limited being in nature, a being whose claims and presumptions far exceed its abilities. “To what length will the folly of the multitude not carry them? [...] [T]hey imagine Nature to be so limited that they believe man to be his chief part. ” Arguably, Spinoza locates the origin of our most fundamental metaphysical and ethical errors in a human hubris which not only tries to secure humanity an exceptional place in nature but also attempts to cast both God and nature in its own human image...|$|E
5000|$|Nineteenth-century {{historians and}} {{observers}} categorized the kongsi federations as republics or democracies. The Dutch sinologist Jan Jakob Maria de Groot {{was in favor}} of this interpretation, calling the kongsis [...] "village republics" [...] that partook in the [...] "spirit of a democracy." [...] In response to comparisons with Western republicanism, historian Wang Tai Pang has cautioned that [...] "such an approach to the history of kongsi is evidently Eurocentric." [...] He concedes that the federations were similar to Western democracies insofar as they involved the election of representatives. However, Wang argues that the uniquely Chinese characteristics of kongsi federations are overlooked when historians only emphasize the connection between kongsis and republicanism in the West. Instead, kongsis should be viewed as authentically Chinese democracies that developed independently from the influence of Western political institutions.

40|$|One of the {{foremost}} reasons {{for the success of}} the Northern Irish Peace Process has been the ability of the national leadership of the Provisional Republican Movement to bring the majority of their membership away from the armed campaign and towards the acceptance of peaceful politics. This dissertation analyses how they were able to achieve this. This is carried out by considering the processes of the four major splits in <b>modern</b> day Irish <b>republicanism</b> from 1969 to 1997. Each split was analysed so as to derive why the split took place and why one side was more successful than the other in the aftermath. The cases were used to test a stage-based process model of split designed by the author. The data from thirty-eight semi-structured interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). This analysis treated the three Provisional splits as three micro-processes within the macro-process of Provisional Republican involvement in the ‘Troubles’, as it did the two Official splits with respect to the Official macro-process of involvement. The results of the analysis showed that the success of the later Provisional leadership was significantly tied to their method of changing strategies, tactics and policies {{one step at a time}} rather than by attempting to implement a variety of substantial changes within a short space of time as the leadership of the 1960 s endeavoured to. This research outlines how the acceptance of peaceful politics for a terrorist organisation is a gradual stage-based process and that in order to be successful the significant changes must be implemented in a patient manner...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a normative {{account of the}} politics of multiculturalism within the paradigm of an anti-essentialist notion of culture while avoiding the pitfall of 'plural monoculturalism'. In so doing, it contributes to the ongoing critiques of essentialist notions of culture and attempts to overcome the normative deficiencies of Kymlicka's theory of liberal multiculturalism, which tends to lead to the subordination of post- immigration ethnic minorities in accessing common institutions and to collapse a multicultural society into plural monocultures. To overcome these deficiencies, this thesis draws upon Benhabib's critiques of essentialist notions of culture and seeks support in Dilthey's works, even though these are not the obvious point of reference for multiculturalism. However, they do help present a model of culture without ossifying individuals within culture and reifying culture. Dilthey's idea of meaning in history, along with Dworkin's account of well-being, allows us to develop a normative account of well-being without succumbing to reductionism, and thereby to argue - similarly to Benhabib's as well as Arendt's emphasis - that we must be concerned with the circumstances of injustice that affect human conditions within the problematic social world, rather than with a universal human nature. Based on this premise, this thesis shows that social justice is a prime parameter of the 'right circumstances' because unjust circumstances may prevent individuals from pursuing their well-being, which is constituted by engaging in meaningful activities in accord with their genuine convictions. It argues that social freedom is essentially 'agency- freedom' - the notion of freedom as non-domination that is central to modem republicanism - which is tied to social justice, and that an assault on one's capability to participate as a citizen of equal status negatively affects one's social freedom. Drawing from Sen's and Nussbaum's capability approaches, this thesis shows that multicultural social justice should be understood as minorities' 'capability to function' as citizens of equal status, especially in deliberating on claims for recognition as cultural practices are normatively contestable. It argues that the minimal and common normative conditions - social recognition and non-domination - rooted in self-respect must be met without reifying culture and identity. Moreover, it argues that social virtues are important to ensure the egalitarian reciprocity of treating one another as citizens of equal status. Based on this normative premise, the politics of multicultural integration needs to satisfy a set of criteria. The set of criteria developed as a main part of the thesis has the capacity to normatively discriminate in a principled manner among competing political approaches to multiculturalism and diversity. This thesis concludes that <b>modern</b> civic <b>republicanism,</b> mainly derived from Honohan's works, better fulfils the conditions of the normative criteria than liberalism or communitarianism...|$|R
