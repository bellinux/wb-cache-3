5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} how England was settled with Anglo-Saxon people between c. 450 and 1066 AD, making {{the country a}} land of villages.

5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him {{at least part of}} the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached <b>many</b> <b>with</b> the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E
5|$|Henry was {{probably}} born in England in 1068, {{in either the}} summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly {{in the town of}} Selby in Yorkshire. His father was William the Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy, who had invaded England in 1066 to become the King of England, establishing lands stretching into Wales. The invasion had created an Anglo-Norman elite, <b>many</b> <b>with</b> estates spread across both sides of the English Channel. These Anglo-Norman barons typically had close links to the kingdom of France, which was then a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under only the minimal control of the king. Henry's mother, Matilda of Flanders, was the granddaughter of Robert II of France, and she probably named Henry after her uncle, King Henry I of France.|$|E

5|$|Matilda {{was born}} to Henry I, King of England and Duke of Normandy, and his first wife, Matilda of Scotland, {{possibly}} around 7 February 1102 at Sutton Courtenay in Oxfordshire. Henry was the youngest son of William the Conqueror, who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales. The invasion had created an Anglo-Norman elite, <b>many</b> <b>with</b> estates spread across {{both sides of the}} English Channel. These barons typically had close links to the kingdom of France, which was then a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under only the minimal control of the king. Her mother Matilda was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland, a member of the West Saxon royal family, and a descendant of Alfred the Great. For Henry, marrying Matilda of Scotland had given his reign increased legitimacy, and for her it had been an opportunity for high status and power in England.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 2005, in an 84–56 {{defeat of}} Southern University, Rolle made his collegiate debut, playing 14minutes and scoring six points while also {{grabbing}} three rebounds. Rolle shot 4-of-8 {{from the field}} and contributed season bests in rebounds (10) and points (8) to help lead LSU past Nicholls State. He equaled his season high in points against the Vanderbilt Commodores on February 2, 2006, in only nine minutes of playing time. The Tigers surprised <b>many</b> <b>with</b> a Final Four run, and in that game Rolle led the team in rebounds with eight, recorded two points from 1-of-1 shooting, and blocked a shot, all in 14minutes of playing time. Despite this performance, LSU's opponent UCLA ultimately prevailed, 59–45. During the 2005–06 season, Rolle averaged 2.2points, 2.5rebounds, and 8.7minutes per game as a freshman, picking up 21 blocks on the year.|$|E
5|$|Structurally, Amir's {{early works}} are quite {{different}} from his later ones. The works compiled in Buah Rindu generally followed the traditional pantun and syair style of quatrains with tail rhymes, including <b>many</b> <b>with</b> rhyming couplets; some works, however, combined the two, or had additional lines or more words than traditionally acceptable, resulting in a different rhythm. Though these early works were not as detailed as Amir's later works, Teeuw writes that they did reflect the poet's mastery of the language and his drive to write poems. Works in this anthology repeated terms of sadness such as menangis (cry), duka (grief), rindu (longing), and air mata (tears), as well as words such as cinta (love), asmara (passion), and merantau (wander).|$|E
