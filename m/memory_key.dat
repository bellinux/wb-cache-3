40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{a system for}} {{encrypting}} data before storing in the Cloud. Adopting this system gives excellent security to stored data and complete control for accessing data by the client at different locations. The motivation for developing this personal encryption came about because of poor Cloud security and doubts over the safety of public encryption algorithms which might contain backdoors. However, side-channel attacks and other unwanted third-party interventions in Cloud security, probably contribute more to the poor security record history. These factors {{led to the development}} of a prototype for personalising security locally which defeats cryptanalysis. The key distribution problem associated with random binary sequences called one-time-pads, does not exist for one-to-Cloud applications, unlike bidirectional communications where it was a big issue. The random binary sequences were generated from chaotic analogue oscillators with initial conditions from a data receiver. A JavaScript application processed the one-time pad and data using modulo two arithmetic and applied the von Neumann bias-removal algorithm to increase the overall entropy. The one-time pad binary sequences applied the fifteen tests in the National Institute of Standards and Technology statistical suite of tests to test for randomness. The one-time pads are transported between locations in a <b>memory</b> <b>key</b> device and the prototype encoder should have dimensions similar to a typical <b>memory</b> <b>key</b> device...|$|E
