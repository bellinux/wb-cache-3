6000|$|The {{last few}} decades have been marked by a special {{cultivation}} of the romance of the future. We seem to have made up our minds to misunderstand what has happened; and we turn, {{with a sort of}} relief, to stating what will happen--which is (apparently) much easier. The modern man no longer presents the memoirs of his great grandfather; but is engaged in writing a detailed and authoritative biography of his great-grandson. Instead of trembling before the specters of the dead, we shudder abjectly under the shadow of the babe unborn. This spirit is apparent everywhere, even {{to the creation of a}} form of futurist romance. Sir Walter Scott stands at the dawn of the nineteenth century for the novel of the past; Mr. H. G. Wells stands at the dawn of the twentieth century for the novel of the future. The old story, we know, was supposed to begin: [...] "Late on a winter's evening two horsemen might have been seen--." [...] The new story has to begin: [...] "Late on a winter's evening two aviators will be seen--." [...] The movement is not without its elements of charm; there is something spirited, if eccentric, in the sight of so many people fighting over again the fights that have not yet happened; of people still glowing with the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>tomorrow</b> morning. A man in advance of the age is a familiar phrase enough. An age in advance of the age is really rather odd.|$|E
