This article sets out some reflections of the authors on those aspects of the OECD’s October 2015 final report on Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements (the Hybrids Report) that relate to revisions to the OECD Model to add a specific provision on fiscally transparent entities (as a new Article 1 (2)), and {{to build on the}} Commentaries already in place in this regard (the HR Proposals).

The authors conduct an extensive review of the issues and raise a number of interpretive and technical questions, as well as policy considerations.

40|$|The article argues that, {{despite the}} fanfare around it, {{the outcome of}} the BEPS project is {{unlikely}} to be dramatic, {{at least in the short}} term. Beyond a period of increased legal uncertainty and aggressive enforcement by some countries, it expects little substantive change in tax treaties. The challenges to the dominance of the OECD and the richest countries would likely be assuaged with marginal concessions, most or all of which not be affecting tax treaties. Yet, the article sees a silver lining in the non-substantive, structural, and instrumental outcomes of the BEPS project. It argues that even if unintended, these outcomes, including the <b>multilateral</b> <b>instrument,</b> the compact to intensify the use of arbitration, and the standardization of transfer pricing reporting will have the most meaningful impact on tax treaties, their content, and the future of the international tax regime...|$|E

Whether the [...] "chosen court" [...] will exercise jurisdiction, and whether courts not chosen will decline jurisdiction depends on the legislation of the state concerned, on whether the clause is in conformity with formal requirements (in many U.S. states a Choice of Court Agreement clause is only exclusive, when the word [...] "exclusive" [...] is explicitly mentioned) and the type of action.

40|$|In recent years, borders between {{countries}} have been opened gradually thanks to globalization, which is reflected in minimal barriers to the movement of persons and capital. This situation could be potentially abused by taxpayers willing to shift the capital to preferential tax jurisdictions. Due to facts aforementioned, several instruments for tax administrators have been introduced. Bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>instruments</b> are concluded with particular countries {{for the purpose of}} obtaining information about foreign residents staying abroad but also to avoid double taxation or double non‑taxation. In recent years there has been an increased number of companies in the Czech Republic whose owners come from preferential tax jurisdiction from 12, 676 up to 13, 167. This paper is focused on the Czech taxpayers’ reaction on concluding agreements concerning exchange of information in tax matters with preferential tax jurisdictions, the so‑called “Tax havens”. The Difference‑in‑Differences Method was carried out to predict the taxpayers’ behavior. The model shows that the agreements work well as a preventive tool. If the Czech Republic concludes the agreement with the tax haven, the taxpayers lose their anonymity. This results in their relocation into tax havens that are not covered by the agreement in order to keep their anonymity...|$|R
40|$|The initial post–World War II {{pursuit of}} capital account {{liberalization}} (CAL) by advanced economies was Europe-centric, with roots {{in a broader}} political—rather than economic—agenda of greater European integration. In continental Europe, CAL was addressed mostly through the adoption of <b>multilateral</b> <b>instruments</b> and codes. In contrast, CAL by the United States and United Kingdom was pursued unilaterally, motivated by their status as global reserve currency issuers and global financial centers. China’s situation is fundamentally different. China today has no equivalent to the European political motivation for CAL or the domestically driven financial motivation of the United States or the United Kingdom. And while China may have long-term aspirations to be a global reserve currency issuer, {{the extent to which}} it internationalizes its currency is constrained by powerful domestic economic and political interests that continue to benefit from an export-led growth model underpinned by a pegged and undervalued exchange rate, both of which are difficult to maintain with an open capital account. Alongside China’s overarching concern with the maintenance of financial and economic stability, these factors imply a different path for China than paths taken by advanced economies, with significant acceleration in the gradual pace of liberalization unlikely without accelerated development of domestic constituencies that traditionally support CAL.

40|$|Action 15 of the OECD/G- 20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) {{project is}} to "develop a <b>multilateral</b> <b>instrument</b> {{designed}} to provide an innovative approach to international tax matters" The authors turn to two areas of academic thought to clarify the choices faced by states when engaging in either bilateral or multilateral tax treaties. One is the field of international relations, and especially the "neoliberal" approach based on the economic self-interest of states. The other is political philosophy, and especially Brennan and Buchanan’s "veil of uncertainty". The authors argue that, as the economic gains of combating BEPS are uncertain, multilateral agreement {{will be easier to}} achieve on matters of design and concept, than on specific rules which have an uncertain distributive impact on states’ economies. The recommendations of the BEPS Final Report are, therefore, useful {{to the extent that they}} provide a starting point for reconsidering the architecture of international taxation, that is, for answering the question: "what would we want the taxation of multinational enterprise (MNE) profits to look like in 2025 ?...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Instrument</b> (MLI) can be {{regarded}} as the most innovative and far-reaching development in the area in the area of tax treaties in recent decades. The implementation of the tax treaty related Base Erosions and Profit Shifting (BEPS) measures through the MLI will have major consequences for the global network of bilateral tax treaties. The actual impact of the MLI on tax treaties depends to a large extent on the choices and reservations made by each participating state, especially with regard to provisions that do not reflect BEPS minimum standards.
