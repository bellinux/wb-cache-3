[...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for three years now, and I {{believe that it is}} <b>my</b> <b>fate</b> to be his wife. Whether or not I love him, I do not know, {{but it seems to me}} that I do.” [...] She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova’s family attended the wedding. The couple honeymooned in Paris, and there she met and befriended the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.|$|E

2500|$|The Tannaim {{are much}} {{divided on the}} {{question}} whether Baruch is to be classed among the Prophets.

Joshua served Moses, and the Holy Spirit rested upon him; Elisha served Elijah, and the Holy Spirit rested upon him. Why is it otherwise with me?" [...] God answered him: [...] "Baruch, of what avail is a hedge where there is no vineyard, or a shepherd where there are no sheep?" [...] Baruch, therefore, found consolation in the fact that when Israel was exiled to Babylonia there was no longer occasion for prophecy.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1894, Alexander III {{died and}} Nicholas mounted the throne as Emperor. At the time, Nicholas had no children, thus {{according}} {{to the laws of}} succession of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duke George became Tsarevich (formally Tsesarevich, denoting the heir presumptive or heir apparent to the throne as opposed to any son of the Tsar, although the latter title fell into disuse in 1721 and was gradually supplanted by the more specific use of Tsarevich). George's ill-health had forced him to relocate to Likani. It was impossible for him to return to St. Petersburg for the funeral of his father, Alexander III. The doctors had forbidden it. Nicholas wrote to his brother, [...] "... constantly pray to God to send you a full and speedy recovery, and to comfort you, because it is so much more difficult to be alone after such great sorrow than it is for us who are at least together!" [...] George also missed the christenings of Nicholas' elder daughters, Olga and Tatiana. Shortly after the birth of Nicholas' third daughter, Maria, in June 1899, George wrote to his brother, [...] "I am terribly sad that I have not yet been able to see your daughters and get to know them; but what can I do! It means it's not <b>my</b> <b>fate,</b> and everything is the will of God." ...|$|E

Zuo Ci openly mocked Cao Cao in court and Cao had him arrested; the guards beat Zuo cruelly, but the Taoist then fell asleep and slept soundly through the night. This enraged Cao Cao, who ordered Zuo Ci to be starved of food, this also failed as Zuo quite happily went seven days without food or water. After this Cao Cao could think of nothing else to punish Zuo Ci. When Zuo Ci appeared at Cao Cao's banquet, Cao tested him by asking to get, among other things, a dragon's liver, a peony, and perch from the Song River. Zuo Ci accomplished everything, which drew further suspicion from Cao Cao. Zuo Ci then offered a cup of wine to Cao Cao, who said that Zuo should taste first. Zuo Ci took a stick and divided the wine in half, and drank one half. Cao Cao was enraged.|$|E

2500|$|Spencer {{influenced}} literature {{inasmuch as}} many novelists and short story authors came to address his ideas in their work. George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Hardy, George Bernard Shaw, Bolesław Prus, Abraham Cahan, D. H. Lawrence, Machado de Assis, Richard Austin Freeman, and Jorge Luis Borges all referenced Spencer. Arnold Bennett greatly praised First Principles, {{and the influence}} it had on Bennett {{may be seen in}} his many novels. Jack London {{went so far as to}} create a character, Martin Eden, a staunch Spencerian. It has also been suggested that the character of Vershinin in Anton Chekhov's play The Three Sisters is a dedicated Spencerian. H.G. Wells used Spencer's ideas as a theme in his novella, The Time Machine, employing them to explain the evolution of man into two species. It is perhaps the best testimony to the influence of Spencer's beliefs and writings that his reach was so diverse. He influenced not only the administrators who shaped their societies' inner workings, but also the artists who helped shape those societies' ideals and beliefs. In Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim, the Anglophile Bengali spy Hurree Babu admires of Herbert Spencer and quotes him to comic effect: [...] "They are, of course, dematerialised phenomena. [...] Spencer says." [...] "I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to meet little thing like death, which is all in <b>my</b> <b>fate,</b> you know." [...] "He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there remained some valuables to steal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bach {{structured}} {{the inner}} movements, named [...] "versus" [...] (Latin for stanza), as five arias and two recitatives, using the {{voices from the}} lowest to the highest, increasing the instrumentation from continuo to obbligato instruments. He kept {{the structure of the}} text, two even parts, in all of these movements but the duet which shows a modified da capo form. The recitatives are kept simple, the first (versus 3) is secco, the second (versus 5) is accompanied by the strings. Versus 2 is introduced by a ritornello of the continuo on a theme which the bass picks up. Versus 4 is brightened by a virtuoso violin part, possible as an image of God's grace in [...] "Ich traue seiner Gnaden" [...] (I trust His grace). John Eliot Gardiner compares the writing for the violin to that in his sonatas and partitas for solo violin. The strings open versus 6 with motifs illustrating rest and motion, which is obvious when the alto sings: [...] "Leg ich mich späte nieder" [...] (Late do I lie me down), [...] "erwache" [...] (wake up), [...] "lieg oder ziehe fort" [...] (lie still or go forth). Versus 7 is set as a duet with continuo. The ritornello begins with a theme later also used by the voices and ends on a characteristic motif illustrating the resolution of [...] "... then will I uncomplaining unto <b>my</b> <b>fate</b> press on". In the last aria the oboes support the soprano singing in extended melismas [...] "I have surrendered myself to Him".|$|E

Red Shirt presented an image of Native Americans that Europeans could associate with progress, nobility, and civilization. Queen Victoria adored Chief Red Shirt and requested a special command performance. Red Shirt commented to The Brisbane Courier [...] on the future of Natives in the United States. [...] "The red man is changing in every season. [...] The Native of the next generation will not be the Native of the last. [...] Our buffaloes are nearly all gone, the deer have entirely vanished, and the white man takes more and more of our land. But the United States government is good. True, it has taken away our land, and the white man have eaten up our deer and our buffalo, but the government now gives us food that we may not starve. They are educating our children and teaching them to use farm implements. [...] Our children will learn the white man’s civilization and to live like him. [...] It is our only outlook in the future. [...] Now we are dependent upon the rations of the Government but we feel we are fully entitled to that bounty. [...] It {{is a part of the}} price they pay for the land they have taken from us, and some compensation to us for having killed off the herds upon which we subsisted. [...] For myself, I know it is no use fighting against the United States government. [...] I accept <b>my</b> <b>fate.</b> [...] The red man cannot kill all the white men that live in villages as big as the largest forests. [...] But some of our young men do not know this, and they may perhaps elect to die like their fathers with their tomahawks in their hands rather than starve to death like a dog upon the prairie." ...|$|E
