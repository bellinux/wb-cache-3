25|$|According to {{a report}} by WaterAid, “the {{resulting}} water projects were unsustainable and left a legacy of distrust among villagers for government programmes”. Villages were selected based on purely technical criteria by the district water department without consultation with communities. Deep boreholes were drilled and equipped with pumps and diesel engines that should have been maintained by the government using central funds. This did not work well and many of the pumps were inoperable. In subsequent years public services collapsed and a serious outbreak of cholera occurred in many urban areas between 1976 and 1980. In response to this failure Town and Municipal Councils were re-established in 1978, but remained without any revenue of their own and depended completely on central government funding. Public service provision remained poor. Although politicians and donors had recognized by that time that the policy of free rural water supply and centralized management had failed, it took them more than two decades from its inception to change that policy. A <b>mid-term</b> <b>review</b> of the RWSP conducted in 1985 showed that only 46% of the rural population had access to water supply services. Among the reasons were the lack of involvement by beneficiaries, the use of inappropriate technologies and an inadequate, overly centralized institutional framework.|$|E

40|$|Concept maps, a {{specific}} kind of mental model, are one method of representing and measuring an individual’s knowledge. They are an alternative tool for teaching through building relevant associations, and {{a method for}} measuring knowledge and recall over time. Concept maps provide a visual representation of conceptual and relationship knowledge within a particular domain. Concept maps look like a spider web, consisting of many nodes (i. e., key concepts) connected to one another by lines that indicate relationships. In the learning process, students can develop concept maps {{as an alternative to}} traditional note-taking by building associations of non-linear key concepts and organizing them to fit with their individual learning styles and frames of reference. The presence of concepts and relationships on a map can provide an instructor with a snapshot of student knowledge and understanding. The proximity and connection of key concepts provide insight for instructors attempting to evaluate how ideas from class were absorbed by students. Conversely, the absence of concepts or relationships, or inappropriate connections between unrelated concepts, provide clues about what information students failed to internalize or incorporate. Concept maps may aid the instructor in assessing what students understand and how they relate the material to the overall course goals. They are easily taught and can be incorporated in introductory units, <b>mid-term</b> <b>reviews</b> and assessments, or end-of-course reviews and assessments...|$|R

The NSW Office of Water (the Office) has used a staged methodological framework that is consistent with the socio-economic assessment guidelines for river, groundwater and water management committees developed by the Independent Advisory Committee on Socio-economic Analysis (IACSEA 1998). This framework is simple, relevant and cost effective. The case study presents socio-economic impact assessment of water sharing rules of the Coopers Creek Water Sharing Plan that commenced in 2004. The results of the case study indicate that the proposed rules could have significant negative or positive impacts on regional irrigated production and employment.

40|$|In a hard-hitting report {{released}} on the August 22 nd 2002, Oxfam UK criticised the EU sugar regime for destroying livelihoods {{in developing countries}} such as Mozambique (not a traditional beneficiary of ACP sugar preferences, although a recent beneficiary of EBA sugar access). While recognising the benefits gained by ACP countries from the existing EU sugar regime, the Oxfam report highlighted the anomaly {{of one of the}} least efficient sugar producers being one of the world's leading refined sugar exporters. The report argues that the EU's sugar export regime encourages the supply of high cost EU sugar to the world market (with the benefit of export refunds) in ways which depress the world market price and undermine the development of competitive sugar production and value added sugar processing in developing countries. The report also highlight the exceptionally high profits generated by sugar sector millers that are virtual monopoly producers in many EU member states. The case of British Sugar in the UK which, {{as a result of the}} current EU sugar regime, makes exceptionally high profits compared to other food-sector enterprises in the same corporate family, was highlighted. Oxfam's immediate call was for an end to subsidised EU sugar exports and for additional market access for LDC and ACP suppliers. The web site of the Sugar Traders Associations of the United Kingdom maintained that this demand was not 'inconsistent with keeping a higher price in Europe than on the world market in order to permit remunerative prices for sugar growers'. Comment: Oxfam's call to end subsidised exports needs to be seen against the background of the CAP <b>mid-term</b> <b>review's</b> renewed emphasis on moving over to an extended system of de-coupled farm support, which would cover a wide range of products and leave farmers involved in the scheme free to choose which crops to grow depending on market signals. Such an ultimate objective would inevitably require a substantial reduction in the EU sugar price, perhaps by amounts similar to those currently being proposed in the rice sector. While there is no suggestion that sugar should be included in this multi-product system in the short term, beyond 2007 it is evident that the European Commission would like to see sugar included in this single multi-product scheme of de-coupled farm support. The web site of the Sugar Traders Association of the UK draws an analogy between future developments in the EU sugar sector and current proposals for reform of the EU rice regime. With an established timetable for the phasing in of duty free access for least-developed-country sugar exports and a challenge to the EU sugar regime in the WTO being mounted which would limit the EU's capacity to dispose of sugar on world markets with the benefit of export refunds, an acute market situation similar to that currently faced on the EU rice market could in due course emerge in the EU sugar market. A shift towards increased direct aid-payments to EU sugar-beet farmers linked to a dramatic reduction in the EU sugar price beyond 2006 should not therefore be ruled out.

Methods: Between February 2002 and September 2006, seventeen dialysis-dependent patients underwent isolated CABG at our center. CABG was performed under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for all the patients. All cases had been maintained on hemodialysis and the duration of preoperative hemodialysis ranged from 6 to 24 months (mean 13. 4 ± 6. 4). The patients’ characteristics, clinical and operative data as well as perioperative and <b>mid-term</b> outcome were <b>reviewed.</b> Results: All patients were men {{with a mean age of}} 53 ± 8. 4 years. Mean preoperative ejection fraction was 45. 5 %± 10. 4 % (range 25 to 60 %). One internal mammary graft was used in 16 (94. 1 %) patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times were 71. 3 ± 18. 7 and 40. 5 ± 8. 3 minutes respectively. The more frequent complication was prolonged mechanical ventilation in 2 (11. 7 %), there was no perioperative mortality. In mid-term follow-up (mean time: 11. 8 ± 9. 5 months) the mid-term mortality rate was 20 % (3 patients).

The number of primary joint replacement operations have been steadily climbing. As a result, the number of revision procedures have also grown, accounting for 6 – 8 % of arthroplasties.  The problem of bone defects compensation remains one of the greatest challenges faced by the surgeon during revision TKA and usually requires a comprehensive approach, careful preoperative planning and preparation. The compensation of small, in depth and extent, bone defects (AORI Type I and II) does not present serious difficulties and their methods are well developed. Whereas the compensation of massive defects (Type 3) is extremely difficult. Until recently, structural allografts were the only method available to surgeons and still remain relevant and demonstrate good results. In recent years, as an alternative, it has become possible to use sleeves and cones made of porous metal, which are also showing very promising <b>mid-term</b> results.  This <b>review</b> demonstrates the results from recent studies of mid-term and long-term outcomes of revision TKA, in which different methods of bone defect compensation were used.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate a 13 -year single-centre experience of arch endovascular aortic repair using the hybrid approach. Between 1999 and 2013, 491 patients were treated with endografts for thoracic aortic pathologies. The aortic arch was involved in 179 (36. 5 %) patients (128 men; mean age 70. 2 ± 10. 8 years, range 27 – 84). A hybrid approach was performed for all Zone 0 and 1 procedures and in nearly half of Zone 2 procedures. Early and <b>mid-term</b> outcomes were <b>reviewed</b> retrospectively. Overall primary technical success (24 h) was achieved in 162 (90. 5 %) of the 179 cases; 2 deaths and 15 Type 1 endoleaks were observed. Clinical success at 30 days was achieved in 161 (89. 9 %) of the 179 patients, with a mortality rate of 4. 5 % (8 / 179). Short-term clinical success at 6 months was achieved in 169 (94. 4 %) of the 179 patients; the rates for the different landing zones did not differ significantly. At a mean follow-up of 27. 3 ± 15. 7 months (range 1 – 94), the mid-term clinical success was 165 (92. 2 %) of the 179 patients; the rates among the different proximal zones did not dif-fer significantly.

Pulmonary vein isolation with a cryoballoon is a new technique wich allows a circumferential PVI. Aimto assess the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of using a cryoballoon catheter to achieve pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Methods 67 patients with symptomatic AF (50 paroxysmal) were accepted for PVI with a cryoballoon. They were seen on an outpatient basis every three months or if they complained of AF-related symptoms. A 48 -hour Holter recording was used to document asymptomatic AF at 3 months. We compiled acute and <b>mid-term</b> results and <b>reviewed</b> complications and safety issues with regard to the procedure. Results 217 (85 %) veins were successfully isolated with a single cryoballoon application. The success of isolation depends on the extent of venous occlusion during application. The average procedure time was 178 minutes; the average fluoroscopy time, 43 minutes. Patients were followed for a median of 9. 7 months. Eighty-five percent were free from recurrent AF or arrhythmia-related symptoms. Freedom from AF results were more significant among patients with paroxysmal AF (90 % of patients Vs 60 % among patients with persistent AF). The phrenic nerve palsy (PNP) is the most frequent complication (6 cases), it is always reversible. Four patients have presented a minor pericardic effusion. Conclusionsdespite the occurrence of minor complications, PVI using a cryoballoon is feasible with a high rate of acute success and excellent mid-term results.
