25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left <b>my</b> <b>cup</b> of tea undrunk and rushed {{back to the}} office to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
500|$|Abby {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune commented, [...] "Whoever shows {{up as the}} next villain, chances are {{his or her work}} won't be easy. That's because at least one resident—Abby Ewing—knows how to dish nasty with the best of them. Only Alexis Carrington Colby Dexter, played by Joan Collins on Dynasty, and Angela Channing, portrayed by Jane Wyman on [...] Falcon Crest, rival Abby Ewing, played by Donna Mills, for best prime-time female villain." [...] When asked which character he wished he had created, Mike Kelly, the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap Revenge, said: [...] "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world." [...] Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said, [...] "While I readily admit Alexis will go down in soap history as the most famous of the 80's primetime soap vixens, she was never truly <b>my</b> <b>cup</b> of detergent. I much preferred the more subdued, methodical villainy of characters like Abby Fairgate (Donna Mills), who slept her way through Seaview Circle, and to the top of Corporate California on Knots Landing. God I miss that damn Cul-de-Sac!" ...|$|E

His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really <b>my</b> <b>cup</b> of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E

There are parts where I thought she sounded really great, {{but for the most}} part this song just wasn't <b>my</b> <b>cup</b> of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage." [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of [...] "Silly Love Songs", writing, [...] "Not only do they sound great , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode." [...] The Marquee Blog at CNN gave the music numbers a positive review. A notable segment reads: [...] "I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", as well as the casts' performances of [...] "P.Y.T."

She wrote, [...] "We were thoroughly entertained by Puck's attempt to win newbie Lauren Zizes over with his tribute to her larger figure. Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade—and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces.

2500|$|After {{several months}} of speech that is {{restricted}} to short utterances, children enter the [...] "telegraphic stage" [...] and begin to produce longer and more complex grammatical structures (O'Grady & Cho, 2011, p.347). This stage is characterized by production of complex structures as children begin to form phrases consisting of a subject and a complement in addition to use of modifiers and composition of full sentences. Children use mostly content words and their sentences lack function words. For example, a child may say [...] "fill cup water," [...] instead of saying, [...] "Fill <b>my</b> <b>cup</b> with water." [...] Subsequently, language acquisition continues to develop rapidly and children begin to acquire complex grammar that shows understanding of intricate linguistic features, {{such as the ability}} to switch the position of words in sentences.|$|E
2500|$|With the Conservative {{victory in}} 1951 Macmillan became Minister of Housing under Churchill, who {{entrusted}} him with fulfilling the pledge to build 300,000 houses per year (up {{from the previous}} target of 200,000 a year), made {{in response to a}} speech from the floor at the 1950 Party Conference.

2500|$|The {{film has}} an {{approval}} rating of 50% on Rotten Tomatoes based on twenty-eight reviews {{and an average}} score of 5.7/10. [...] Negative reviews focused generally on the surreal inscrutability of the plot and accusations of shallow pastiche; Tony Norman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called it [...] "all ambiance and no substance", and Joe Neumaier of The New York Daily News called it a boring failure. [...] Mark Feeney of The Boston Globe cited the atmosphere as initially being impressive but eventually becoming laughable, with the concept better suited to a short film. [...] Some mixed reviews, like William Goss of MSN, praised the film's surreal atmosphere and synth score, despite finding it [...] "not <b>my</b> <b>cup</b> of crazy", while Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle cited the movie as inexplicable and incomprehensible, while praising the visuals. Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times also gave a mixed review, highlighting the appeal to fans of midnight movies.|$|E
