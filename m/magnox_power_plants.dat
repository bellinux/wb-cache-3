25|$|The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), {{formed in}} April 2005 under the Energy Act 2004, oversees and manages the {{decommissioning}} and clean-up of the UK's older <b>Magnox</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> and the reprocessing facilities at Sellafield, which {{were transferred to}} its ownership from BNFL, and the former nuclear research and development facilities previously run by the UKAEA.|$|E
50|$|The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is {{responsible}} for the decommissioning of the UK <b>Magnox</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> at an estimated cost of £12.6 billion. There is currently debate about whether a 25 or 100 year decommissioning strategy should be adopted. After 80 years short-lifetime radioactive material in the defuelled core would have decayed to the point that human access to the reactor structure would be possible, easing dismantling work. A shorter decommissioning strategy would require a fully robotic core dismantling technique.|$|E
25|$|Chapelcross was a <b>Magnox</b> nuclear <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> {{located near}} Annan in Dumfries and Galloway in south west Scotland. It was the sister plant to the Calder Hall plant in Cumbria, England - both were {{commissioned}} and originally {{operated by the}} United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.|$|R
25|$|British Energy was {{established}} and registered in Scotland in 1995 {{to operate the}} eight most modern nuclear <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in the UK. It took the two AGR plants from Scottish Nuclear and five AGR and a sole PWR plant from Nuclear Electric. The residual <b>Magnox</b> <b>power</b> stations from these two companies were transferred to Magnox Electric which later became the generation division of British Nuclear Fuels. The company was privatised in 1996.|$|R

2500|$|The First Generation Magnox Storage Pond (FGMSP) {{was built}} to support {{reprocessing}} of fuel from UK <b>Magnox</b> <b>power</b> stations through the First Generation Reprocessing Plant, and was used for operations between 1960 until 1986.

5000|$|Wylfa Nuclear Power Station (Atomfa'r Wylfa) is {{a former}} <b>Magnox</b> <b>power</b> station {{situated}} west of Cemaes Bay {{on the island of}} Anglesey, North Wales. Construction of the two 490 MW nuclear reactors, known as [...] "Reactor 1" [...] and [...] "Reactor 2", began in 1963. They became operational in 1971. Wylfa was located on the coast because seawater was used as a coolant.|$|R
50|$|Trawsfynydd {{nuclear power}} station is a former <b>Magnox</b> <b>power</b> station {{situated}} in Snowdonia National Park in Gwynedd, Wales.
