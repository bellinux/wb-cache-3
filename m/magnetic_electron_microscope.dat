The magnetic strong-base anion exchange resin (MAER) was formed by quaternization of <b>magnetic</b> copolymer. Transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM) and scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM) were used for observation of prepared magnetic nano-particle and MAER, respectively.

To explore the potential application of MAER for natural organic matter (NOM) removal, completely-mixed (CMC) mode was used for humic acid (HA) adsorption.

We report a detailed {{investigation of the}} microstructure and the resulting magnetic anisotropy by <b>magnetic,</b> transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM) and MÃ¶ssbauer measurements of the electrospun Cu_ 1 -xZn_xFe_ 2 O_ 4 nanofibers. Our {{results show that the}} electrospun Cu_ 1 -xZn_xFe_ 2 O_ 4 nanofibers exhibit nearly isotropic magnetic anisotropy. TEM measurements indicate that the nanofibers are composed of loosely connected and randomly aligned nanograins. As revealed by the Henkel plot, these nanofibers and the nanograins within the nanofibers are dipolar coupled, which reduces the effective shape anisotropy leading to a nearly random configuration of the magnetic moments inside the nanofibers, hence, the observed nearly isotropic magnetic anisotropy can be easily understood.

40|$|Detailed rock <b>magnetic</b> and <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the magnetic signature of Neogene marine sediments from {{the east coast of}} New Zealand is dominated by the authigenic iron sulphide greigite. The greigite is present as a mixed population of stable single domain and superparamagnetic grains, which is consistent with authigenic growth from solution. This growth can result from pyritization reactions soon after deposition, which also leads to dissolution of most detrital magnetite; however, where constrained by field tests, our data suggest that remanence acquisition can occur > 1 Myr after deposition, and can vary in timing at the outcrop scale. Strong viscous overprints result from oxidation of the iron sulphides, probably during percolation of oxic ground water. This process can sometimes destroy any ancient remanent magnetization. This complex magnetic behaviour, particularly the presence of late-forming magnetizations carried by greigite, means that the remanence in New Zealand Cenozoic sediments, and in similar sediments elsewhere, cannot be assumed to be primary without confirmation by field tests. The reversals test should be employed with caution in such sediments, as patchy remagnetizations can lead to false polarity stratigraphies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} procedure {{to illustrate the}} problems introduced by ferromagnetic hysteresis present in <b>magnetic</b> lenses of <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes.</b> The <b>magnetic</b> flux density is not available as a measurable quantity. Hysteresis expresses itself in {{the relation between the}} input current applied to the lens-coil and the level of sharpness (defocus) of the resulting images. The familiar hysteresis loops are not available, instead we measure hysteresis in the so-called butterfly representation. The input-profiles are non-periodic and illustrate the difficulties with reproducibility in microscopy applications. Image based feedback control is impossible since 99 % of the input range yield unusable images. Analysis of the experiments is carried out using a qualitative model consisting of an interconnection of hysteresis representing the magnetic lens and a nonlinear function representing electron optics. Because this model introduces the intermediate magnetic field variable, it is possible to reconstruct and explain the results observed in the experiments...|$|R

Geochemical conditions favourable for formation and preservation of greigite and pyrrhotite {{appear to be a}} limited source of sulphide, whether it derives from microbially-driven sulphate reduction in the sulphate zone, in the AOM zone or in deep sediments undergoing AOM, so that pyritization reactions are not driven to completion. Our results indicate that rock magnetic identification of greigite and pyrrhotite should be useful for detecting ancient gas hydrate systems in the marine sedimentary record, because it can enable rapid screening of ancient sediments for potential horizons where methane and disseminated gas hydrates might have occurred. Formation of authigenic greigite and pyrrhotite at different depths within the gas hydrate stability zone also implies that the magnetization of the host sediments will have been acquired at variable times, which is likely to compromise paleomagnetic results from greigite- and pyrrhotite-bearing marine sediments. <br/...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution paleomagnetic secular {{variation}} (PSV) records bear great information of dynamics {{processes of the}} Earth's geomagnetic field, and can be further used for inter-profile correlation and for dating sediments. However, effects {{of changes in the}} depositional environment on PSV records have not been fully determined. This study constructed Holocene PSV records for the gravity piston core (ZSQD 34) obtained from the northern South China Sea. Rock <b>magnetic</b> and Transmission <b>Electron</b> <b>Microscope</b> (TEM) results indicate that single (SD) and PSD domain magnetites are the main carrier of the natural remanent magnetization. Comparable to the records derived from the freshwater lakes and the modeling results, we observed that direction curves from these two environments of contrasting salinity content are rather consistent. The direction curves are independent of the constructed salinity. However, the gradual increasing trend of relative intensity since about 5 kyr might be related to the decreasing sea surface salinity. Furthermore, on the centennial and millennial time scale, the relative intensity and salinity show some positive relation, suggesting a potential contribution of salinity to the paleomagnetic relative intensity recording processes.

40|$|In many anoxic {{sedimentary}} environments, {{the onset}} of sulfate reduction, and pyritization of detrital iron-bearing minerals, leads to a precipitous decline in magnetic mineral concentration during early diagenesis. The usefulness of the surviving paleomagnetic record in such environments is usually argued to depend on {{how much of the}} primary detrital magnetic assemblage survives diagenetic dissolution. Detailed rock <b>magnetic</b> and <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> analyses of rapidly deposited (~ 7 cm/kyr) latest PleistoceneâHolocene sediments from the continental margins of Oman (22 Â° 22. 4 ?N, 60 Â° 08. 0 ?E) and northern California (38 Â° 24. 8 ?N, 123 Â° 58. 2 ?W) demonstrate that pyritization during early diagenesis also leads to the progressive down-core growth of the ferrimagnetic iron sulfide greigite. Greigite growth begins with nucleation of large concentrations of superparamagnetic (SP) nanoparticles at the inferred position of the sulfateâmethane transition, which can explain the apparently paradoxical suggestion that diagenetically reduced sediments contain enhanced concentrations of SP particles. Looping of hysteresis parameters on a âDayâ plot records the dissolution of single domain (SD) (titano-) magnetite and the formation of SP greigite, which then slowly and progressively grows through its SD blocking volume and acquires a stable paleomagnetic signal. This looping trend is also evident in data from several published records (Oregon margin, Korea Strait, Japan Sea, Niger Fan, Argentine margin, and the OntongâJava Plateau), indicating that these processes may be widespread in reducing environments. Our observations have profound implications for paleomagnetic records from sulfate-reducing environments. The paleomagnetic signal recorded by greigite is offset from the age of the surrounding sediments by 10 's of kyr, and ongoing growth of greigite at depth results in smoothing of the recorded signal over intervals of 10 's to 100 's of kyr. We therefore expect the presence of greigite to compromise paleomagnetic records {{in a wide range of}} settings that have undergone reductive diagenesis...|$|R
