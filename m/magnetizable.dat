50|$|The use of {{magnetic}} tape for sound recording originated around 1930. <b>Magnetizable</b> tape revolutionized both the radio broadcast and music recording industries. It gave artists and producers {{the power to}} record and re-record audio with minimal loss in quality as well as edit and rearrange recordings with ease. The alternative recording technologies of the era, transcription discs and wire recorders, could not provide anywhere near this level of quality and functionality. Since some early refinements improved the fidelity of the reproduced sound, magnetic tape has been the highest quality analog sound recording medium available. As of {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, analog magnetic tape has been largely replaced by digital recording technologies for consumer purposes, although some still record audio by analog.|$|E
50|$|The heads {{themselves}} {{started out}} {{similar to the}} heads in tape recorders—simple devices made out of a tiny C-shaped piece of highly <b>magnetizable</b> material called ferrite wrapped in a fine wire coil. When writing, the coil is energized, a strong magnetic field forms in the gap of the C, and the recording surface adjacent to the gap is magnetized. When reading, the magnetized material rotates past the heads, the ferrite core concentrates the field, and a current is generated in the coil. In the gap the field is very strong and quite narrow. That gap is roughly equal to {{the thickness of the}} magnetic media on the recording surface. The gap determines the minimum size of a recorded area on the disk. Ferrite heads are large, and write fairly large features. They must also be flown fairly far from the surface thus requiring stronger fields and larger heads.|$|E
