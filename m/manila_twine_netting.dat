25|$|A baler is a {{piece of}} farm {{machinery}} used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as hay, straw, or silage) into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport and store. Several different types of balers are commonly used, each producing a different type of bales – rectangular or cylindrical (round), of various sizes, bound with <b>twine,</b> <b>netting,</b> or wire. The round hay baler was invented by Ummo F. Luebben of Sutton, Nebraska, which he conceived with his brother Melchior in 1903, and then patented in 1910. The invention of the round hay baler revolutionized the laborious task of haying into a one-man, low-cost operation with a machine that automatically gathered the hay, rolled into a round bale, and ejected it.|$|R

40|$|Visual stimuli of nets, which affect fishing selectivity, vary by twine diameter, color, and {{material}} under different light conditions and visual geometries. In this study, two cylindrical model codends of two mesh sizes, 28 and 43 mm, {{were made of}} high-contrast, dark brown polyethylene (PE) <b>netting</b> <b>twine</b> and low contrast, light-blue polyamid (PA) monofilament twine. Each model codend was filled with juvenile seabream and set in the water channel of a light-blue circular tank under a flow speed 0. 8 m/s for 30 min. Light conditions were set to relatively bright, dim, and dark. The resulting retention rates of juvenile seabream were 15 - 35 % lower for the low-contrast codend with PA monofilament than for the high contrast PE <b>twine</b> <b>netting</b> under bright and dim light conditions, while no difference was observed under dark conditions. The effects of mesh size and netting contrast on the retention rate were dependent on the light level, while the retention rate due to netting contrast was independent of mesh size. Therefore, low-contrast nets in the codend could help to reduce juvenile bycatch by disturbing the orderly optomotor response...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{tendency}} in some {{sectors of the}} fishing industry has been to use thicker and stiffer twines {{in the manufacture of}} netting material. This increases the mesh’s resistance to opening and, consequently, reduces the selective performance of fishing gears. The main characteristic of <b>netting</b> <b>twine</b> contributing to mesh resistance to opening is flexural rigidity (EI). We present a methodology for quantifying mesh resistance to opening {{through the use of a}} prototype called the resistance to opening and deflection meter (ROD-m). It incorporates four tension load cells and four stepping motors that are driven by four ministep bipolar chopper drives. Small panels of netting (3 3 meshes) can be mounted on ROD-m, which can measure the forces acting on the netting and the position of the knots. Estimates of the flexural rigidity of the <b>netting</b> <b>twine</b> can be made from these data. We present the results of the analysis of Mediterranean polyamide netting, and standard and Brezline polyethylene (PE) netting from the North Sea.

Being a "tactile" person, I enjoy the direct contact of touch and feel with materials as I create. I dream in color.

These factors, combined with other traits, past experiences and my education, dictate to me, sensibilities that encompass the manipulations of Basketry. Basketry, the earliest form of weaving, was common to primitive and tribal peoples throughout the world. Their baskets were created for utilitarian purposes and survival; they {{had to do with the}} mysteries of birth, life and death. Natural grasses and fibers, indigenous to their geographical regions, (reed, willow, seagrass, rush, raffia, etc.) were used for construction. Feather, hair, bone, beads, shells and natural dyes were often added for embellishment. Research of these cultures, promotes a quickening of insight and a feeling of kinship to their creativity. A study of basketry and its history opens doorways to the exploration of all other fiber traditions. My personal discovery of the basket, the mask, batik, varied looms, Peruvian weaving and all the other ramifications of the exploration became an inspiration for me. My work evolves from the excitement I experience as I assess the unlimited scope of fiber. Touching is a part of seeing, and as I "touch", I realize that fiber is a media through which I can fulfill my need for self-expression. It provides an ???open-end" for concept, composition and involvement with construction.

In the ends of each of the outer strips a hole is bored to receive the ends of a small branch of pliable wood, which is bent into a regular semicircular curve. These hoops are made of branches of spruce or hemlock, or of hardwood saplings, such as maple, birch, or ash, generally retaining the bark. Three of these similar frames, straight below and curved above, constitute the {{framework of}} each pot, one to stand at each end and one in the center. The narrow strips of wood, in general ordinary house laths of spruce or pine, which form the covering, are nailed lengthwise to them, with interspaces between about equal to the width of the lathe. On the bottom the laths are sometimes nailed on the outside and sometimes {{on the inside of the}} cross pieces. The door is formed by three or four of the laths running the entire length near the top. The door is hinged on by means of small leather strips, and is fastened by a single wooden button in the center, or by two buttons, one at each end. The openings into the pot ... are two in number, one at each end, are generally knit of coarse twine and have a mesh between three-fourths of an inch and 1 inch square. They are funnel-shaped, with one side shorter than the other, and at the larger end have the same diameter as the framework. The smaller and inner end measures about 6 inches in diameter and is held open by means of a wire ring or wooden hoop. The funnels are fastened by the larger ends to the end frames of the pot, with the shorter side uppermost, so that when they are in place they lead obliquely upward into the pot instead of horizontally. The inner ends are secured in position by one or two cords extending to the center frame. The funnels are about 11 or 12 inches deep, and therefore extend about halfway to the center of the pot. They taper rapidly and form a strongly inclined plane, up which the lobsters must climb in their search for the bait. A two-strand <b>manila</b> <b>twine</b> is most commonly used for the funnels.

50|$|A pea {{is a most}} {{commonly}} green, occasionally golden yellow, or infrequently purple pod-shaped vegetable, widely grown as a cool season vegetable crop. The seeds may be planted {{as soon as the}} soil temperature reaches , with the plants growing best at temperatures of 13 to 18 C. They do not thrive in the summer heat of warmer temperate and lowland tropical climates, but do grow well in cooler, high altitude, tropical areas. Many cultivars reach maturity about 60 days after planting.Peas have both low-growing and vining cultivars. The vining cultivars grow thin tendrils from leaves that coil around any available support and can climb to be 1-2 m high. A traditional approach to supporting climbing peas is to thrust branches pruned from trees or other woody plants upright into the soil, providing a lattice for the peas to climb. Branches used in this fashion are sometimes called pea brush. Metal fences, <b>twine,</b> or <b>netting</b> supported by a frame are used for the same purpose. In dense plantings, peas give each other some measure of mutual support. Pea plants can self-pollinate.|$|R

In order to be clear function changes in trap gear frameworks of this thesis were consisted of the following three steps by fishing gear constructions. 1) The <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> consisted of the fundamental part of a fishing gear may be changed the breaking strength and elongation. 2) The nettings consisted of the minimum unit of function of capture. 3) Pot fishing gears are considered to the simplest model of an actual fishing gear. On the other hand, {{it is important for}} establishing and carrying out of environment-friendly to improve the fishing technology. In fact, trap gear are well-known as never-overfishing gear. It has never studied to be clear the function changes in trap gear during operations. In the present study, the function changes in trap gear were studied with using material engineering and hydrodynamical methods. The results obtaind can be summarized as follows: 1. The breaking strength and elongation of <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> after soaked in the sea more than three years were measured. Nylon and polyethylene <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> having thickness of 220 - 1980 denier were used. The breaking strength and elongation were sharply decreased for the first 1 year after soaked in the sea, and became a constant during 2 - 3 years. The retained breaking strength and elongation after 3 years of all test <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> were about 70 % and 40 - 60 %, respectivly. 2. An encrusted condition of marine foulings on nettings for set nets which consider influence to measure a drag on the fouled plane netting by marine foulings were measured. The test netings were soaked around a set net fishing ground during the periods from 15 to 60 days and some water depthes (1. 5 to 15 m). The test netting consisted of polyester multi-filaments (0. 85 mm in diameter and 17 mm in bar length), which is commonly used for the set net fishing gear. The main marine foulings are fine attaching materials so-called "Nuta", Amphipoda, a kind of hydrozoans Tubulalia mesembryanthemum and a kind of moss animals Bugula neritina. 3. The drag per 1 m² for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing ratio of drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the initial (unused) netting. The mean ratio of drag on each soaking period, however, peaked 6. 5 times of the 30 th day net and then it scarcely changed till 60 th day net. 3. The drag per 1 m 2 for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing raito of the drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the unused net. However, the mean raito og drag on each soaking period peaked 6. 5 times of 30 days in soaking periods and then it scarcely changed till 60 days. The porosity (β) of the nettings before and after fouling changed from 76 to 16 %. The drag coefficient (CD) of fouled nettings can be expressed by the following equation; CD= 35. 98 (Rh) ⁻⁰. ⁴³(1. 7 × 10 ²<Rh< 1. 8 × 10 ³), where Rh is Reynolds number based on hydraulic mean depth of a fouled netting. However, the drag coefficient may be rather influenced the porosity for Rh< 5 × 10 ². The drag coefficient (CD) of a fouled netting was determined to be 1. 3 at 0. 6 <β< 0. 8 and 2. 2 atβ< 0. 5, respectively. The results suggest that the drag coefficient of a fouled netting is determined by its porosity. 4. To evaluate the preferable fishing ground for cuttlefish basket traps from bottom condition and CPUE (kg/trap/day) at two different fishing grounds (off Ariake and off Fukae) in Shimabara sound. The Md φ of off Ariake and off Fukae weres - 0. 3 to 3. 0 and 1. 0 to 1. 5, which were limited range against the whole Shimabara Sound (- 5. 4 to 5. 6). CPUE of off Fukae was 2 -fold greater than that of off Ariake. The significance of differences in CPUE between two fishing grounds was verified by taken together Mann-Whitney test (p< 0. 05). The results suggest that the medium sandy se﻿a bottom is more preferable for capturing of golden cuttlefish by the cuttlefish basket trap. 5. Catches were high at water temperature between 12 - 14 ℃. Daily catches varied periodically due to the change in the lunar cycle, and it became maximum at neap tide, or ebb, and minimum at spring tide. In this region, water temperature seems to be an important long-term factor affecting the main fishing period, and tidal current seems to be an important short-term factor controlling daily catch. The amount of catch might be controlled by both water temperature and tidal current, which is therefore the important factors in the cuttlefish basket trap fishery...|$|R

40|$|Many {{technical}} measures {{aimed at the}} conservation and recovery of fish stocks {{are based on the}} implementation of minimum mesh sizes to guarantee a certain level of fishing gear selectivity. At present, different methods are used to measure mesh opening, according to whether the measurement serves fisheries inspection, fisheries research or the manufacturing of netting for fishing nets. At the very least, this causes confusion but can also have more serious consequences such as the criminalization of well intentioned fishermen or the setting of inappropriate mesh size regulations. For example, the measurements made by fishery inspectors using the wedge gauge are generally larger than those made by scientists using the ICES gauge. As a result the cod-ends used by fishermen to satisfy the fishery inspectors will have a selectivity lower than that anticipated by the scientists who provided the advice that informed the relevant legislation. In 1999, owing to the wider range of <b>twines</b> and <b>netting</b> materials used by the fishing industry, ICES established the Study Group on Mesh Measurement Methodology (SGMESH) to refine mesh measurement procedures. At the same time the different stakeholders agreed that there was a need to consider the adoption of a standard mesh measurement method.

In October 2005, it was adopted by ICES as the new standard for mesh measurements and in June 2006 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recommended its use for scientific purposes. This review paper critically examines the different mesh measurement methodologies and their related problems, and introduces and describes a new objective mesh gauge (OMEGA) to replace the former less satisfactory gauges. Its adoption will result in researchers, fisheries inspectors and the netting industry using one standard gauge and one set of standard protocols to achieve consistent mesh-size measurements...|$|R

The overall {{aim of this study}} is to increase the understanding of how the bio fouling influence the hydrodynamic forces on the nets. More specifically the focus is on hydroid growth, and the use of models of <b>net</b> <b>twine</b> with artificial hydroid fouling. The models that were used ar made of two 1. 5 mm steel rods that are twisted together, with short pieces of 0. 32 mm multifilament fishing line fixed between them, similar to a test tube brush. The twisted steel rods were replicating a 3 mm twine, with the fishing lines acting as evenly distributed hydroid growth. Previously drag tests had been done with one and two of these models, with two parallel twines with variyng distance, and also a cross configuration. In the present study the goal was to investigate possible interaction effects between twines, by using various configurations with a higher number of twines; and also make small net sections and estimate the drag increase due to bio fouling. 16 twine models were made, and tests were done with a single twine; and 2, 4, 6 and 8 parallel twines; and also crossing twines, with the same numbers of twines in each direction. In total 18 different configurations were tested, with twine spacings of 12 mm and 24 mm. The experiments were done in a towing tank, with the twine models fixed in a frame, orthogonally to the direction of travel. The drag force was measured on the frame, and the contribution from the frame itself was subtracted from the total force to find the drag on the twine models. Then the drag coefficients were calculated and plotted in various diagrams to visualise any trends. All the configurations were tested at a range of velocities from 0. 05 m/s to 1. 4 m/s. Most of the results were consistent, except for the two lowest velocities (0. 05 m/s and 0. 1 m/s) were the precision error was significant. It was found that the drag coefficient for the fouled twine models were decreasing with increasing current velocity. At 0. 1 m/s (Re = 300) the drag coefficients were between 3. 5 and 4. 0, while for 1. 4 m/s (Re = 4200) they were approximately 3. 0. This is probably either because of deflection of the hydroids at higher velocities, or because the hydroids themselves have a smaller diameter, and hence are in a lower Reynolds number range (from Re = 32 to Re = 448), where the drag coefficient is dependent on the velocity. The variations in drag coefficients between the different model configurations were small, there were some consistent trends, but the magnitude were insignificant. This means that the interaction effects between the twines are relatively small, and it is likely that data from tests with few twines can be extrapolated to net panel applications. The drag coefficients for the net sections in the middle of the cruciform configurations were calculated. For the net sections with 12 mm spacing the results were inconclusive, while for 24 mm spacing the net drag coefficient varied between 0. 66 and 0. 59 for different velocities. This is twice as high as empirical data for a similar clean net. Several possibilities for further work were identified during the work with the thesis. One is to do more similar experiments, both with equivalent models to verify the results, and with either more or less hydroids, to study the influence of the amount of fouling. Another is to try to quantify the bending stiffness of real hydroids compared to the stiffness of the hydroid models (fishing line). The mechanical properties of real hydroids and the hydroid replicas have only been compared qualitatively in previous studies, so quantifying these would be useful both for validation of the models, and for improving them. Further investigations of the drag coefficient of the hydroid stems independently, with regards to the Reynolds number dependency of the drag coefficients of the whole models, would also be interesting...|$|R
