40|$|In 2003 World Health Assembly {{adopted an}} {{international}} treaty on tobacco control; FCTC, Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Five year later World Health Organization (WHO) declared the six effective approach for tobacco control, {{under the name}} of MPOWER. In the following years, WHO evaluated the level of implementation of MPOWER criteria in the countries. In this article, how Turkey implemented these six criteria will be discussed. Monitor tobacco use and prevention policies: Monitoring of tobacco use prevalence has been successfully <b>monitored</b> <b>in</b> <b>Turkey</b> through Global Adult Tobacco Survey, Global Youth Tobacco Survey and Health Professionals Tobacco Use Survey. Nevertheless, monitoring of tobacco industry activities was not successfully implemented. Protect people from tobacco smoke: Smoking was banned in most of the indoor public places <b>in</b> <b>Turkey</b> since 1996, and Turkey became a complete smoke-free country by the exposion of smoke-free places including the hospitality workplaces in 2008. Offer help to quit tobacco use: Although smoking cessation services has been a bit late <b>in</b> <b>Turkey,</b> availability of smoking cessation drugs and the establishment of free quitline services made <b>Turkey</b> successful <b>in</b> this regard. Warn about the dangers of tobacco: Since 1996, all TV channels have a duty of broadcasting programs on harms of tobacco use, not less than 90 minutes in a month and it has been implemented successfully. Additionally written messages indicating harms of tobacco has been printed on the packs since 1988 and pictures was added in 2010. But since the average surface area covered by the messages in less than 50 % of the total surface of the pack, Turkey was not regarded as to meet the requirement. Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship: All kinds of tobacco advertisement and promotion was banned by the Law in 1996. But the tobacco products was not in closed boxes at the sales points. Turkey was not found as successful in this regard. Raise taxes on tobacco: Total tax on the tobacco products is more than 75 % level which was recommended by WHO, Turkey meets this criteria. <b>In</b> conclusion, <b>Turkey</b> was regarded as meeting all the MPOWER criteria except the warning about the dangers of tobacco and enforcement of the advertisement ban. <b>In</b> conclusion, <b>Turkey</b> was regarded as meeting all the MPOWER criteria except the warning about the dangers of tobacco and enforcement of the advertisement ban.

40|$|The {{presence}} of turkey astrovirus (TAstV) was <b>monitored</b> <b>in</b> meat-type <b>turkey</b> flocks <b>in</b> Poland in 2008. Clinical samples (10 individual faecal swabs/flock) from 77 flocks aged 1 - 19  weeks {{were collected from}} {{different regions of the}} country. RT-PCR experiments were performed for detection and molecular characterization of TAstV using four sets of primers within the RdRp gene (ORF 1 b). The prevalence of astrovirus was 34 / 77 (44. 15 %) in the flocks tested. TAstV type 2 was associated with 30 of 77 infections (38. 9 %), either alone or in mixed infections; TAstV type 1 was detected in 9 of 77 flocks (11. 6 %), either alone or in mixed infections; ANV was detected only in one flock (1. 29 %) by sequence analysis during this study. Phylogenetic analysis revealed genetic variability in the TAstV strains that were isolated. Some of Polish TAstV- 2 strains were genetically related to the North American isolates; however, most of them formed a distinct subgroup of “European” isolates, suggesting their separate origin or evolution. Additionally, due to the high variability of the TAstV sequences, the most suitable method for TAstV typing seems to be sequencing...|$|R

Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) farming is a species economically relevant {{but the lack of}} efficient protocols for the evaluation of commercial turkeys prevents to measure the impact of industry practices on birds productivity and welfare. In order to identify potential molecular biomarkers for <b>monitoring</b> stress <b>in</b> <b>turkey’s</b> handling, we investigated by TaqMan qPCR the abundance of five circulating miRNA, namely miR- 22, miR- 155, miR- 181 a, miR- 204 and miR- 365, previously demonstrated to be involved in stress in chicken due to feed deprivation. Road transportation related procedures were selected as stressful model for this study. The serum of twenty healthy animals was collected before and after 2 h transportation. Our results demonstrated that miR- 22, miR- 155 and miR- 365 are statistically more expressed after road transportation. Receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to estimate the diagnostic value of these miRNAs to evaluate the stress in animals. The serum level of miR- 22, miR- 155 and miR- 365 can discriminate stressed from non-stressed animals with an AUC= 0. 763, 0. 710 and 0. 704, respectively, and the average expression of their combination has the same specificity (AUC= 0. 745). miR- 22, miR- 155 and miR- 365 are stress-specific markers and can be considered as suitable biomarkers to identify turkeys stressed by road transportation...|$|R

40|$|Hemorrhagic {{enteritis}} (HE) <b>in</b> <b>turkeys</b> is {{an acute}} infectious disease characterized by depression, intestinal bleeding, and death. HE occurs worldwide affecting 6 to 12 week-old turkeys and lasting 4 to 6 days. This economically important disease {{is caused by}} hemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV), a turkey adenovirus which is tentatively classified {{as a member of}} the group II avian adenoviruses. Serologically related HEV strains with marked differences <b>in</b> pathogenicity for <b>turkeys</b> have been described. Until recently, only 2 vaccines were available for the prevention of HE <b>in</b> <b>turkeys.</b> Both are live virus vaccines containing avirulent HEV (HEV-A) and both elicit protective immunity <b>in</b> <b>turkeys.</b> However, since the first vaccine is a crude extract prepared from spleens of turkeys infected with HEV-A, and the second vaccine is propagated in a transformed cell line contaminated with Marek's disease virus, their safety features are questionable. HEV is unique among the adenoviruses because it is not antigenically related with the mammalian or group I avian adenoviruses. Its classification as an adenovirus is based upon common physical, chemical, morphological and structural properties. An adenovirus is composed of 240 hexons and 12 pentons, outer capsid proteins which give the virus its characteristic icosahedral shape, capsid associated proteins, and core proteins associated with the double-stranded linear DNA genome with a molecular weight of 17 - 30 x 10 6 . Until recently, HEV and its structural proteins had been poorly characterized due to the lack of a suitable invitro system for virus propagation. In summary, there was a need for an improved vaccine for HE <b>in</b> <b>turkeys,</b> and the development of a such a vaccine would be facilitated by the discovery of a cell type suitable for HEV replication and by a more basic knowledge of the virus itself. The major goal of the research described in this dissertation was the development and testing of a safe and efficient vaccine for HE <b>in</b> <b>turkeys.</b> <b>In</b> order to achieve this goal, a cell culture system for virus propagation as well as methods to measure virus replication invitro and protection in immunized birds had to be developed. In addition, the knowledge of virus and viral components had to be expanded. The development and application of sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the quantitation of HEV antibodies <b>in</b> <b>turkey</b> sera and HEV antigen in tissue extracts is described in Chapter 2. The presence and decline of maternal antibody titers in sera of poults and seroconversion and induction of protective antibody titers <b>in</b> <b>turkeys</b> following immunization with HEV-A were determined by ELISA (Chapters 2 and 6). The ELISA for the titration of antigen was used to <b>monitor</b> protection <b>in</b> <b>turkeys</b> following immunization with HEV-A and challenge with virulent HEV (HEV-V) (Chapter 6). A strong antigenic relationship between HEV-A and HEV-V was measured with both ELISAs. The characterization of both HEV-A and HEV-V and their structural proteins, purified from spleens of infected <b>turkeys</b> is described <b>in</b> the Chapters 3 and 4. The electron microscopic data on the size (72 nm) and structure of the virion and its density in CsCl (ρ= 1. 34 g/cm 3), as well as the profile of the viral polypeptides in polyacrylamide gels showing molecular weights ranging from 96, 000 to 9, 500, justified the classification of HEV as an adenovirus. The major structural proteins were identified as hexon, penton, penton base, fiber, IIIa, and core proteins based on their structure observed by electron microscopy and/or recognition by specific antibodies. Free hexon and penton proteins, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies, had identical properties as their counterparts in the virus. The hexon was an important neutralizing antigen. The penton of HEV consisted of a single fiber attached to its penton base, a feature shared with the mammalian adenoviruses and the avian egg drop syndrome 1976 virus, but not with the fowl adenoviruses which have double fibers. In contrast to the many common properties of HEV-A and HEV-V, serological differences between the fibers of and differences in electrophoretic migration between the penton bases of both strains were observed. The IIIa, proteins of HEV and human adenovirus type 2 shared a common epitope. This is the first antigenic relationship detected between avian and mammalian adenoviruses. The propagation of HEV-A and HEV-V <b>in</b> <b>turkey</b> blood leukocyte cells is escribed in Chapter 5. The presence of HEV in the nuclei of non- adherent as well as in adherent cells was revealed by electron microscopy and by light microscopy, using a fluorescent antibody test. The non-adherent infected cells had the characteristics of immature mononuclear leukocytes while the adherent cells had monocyte-macrophage characteristics. HEV-A could be serially passed <b>in</b> <b>turkey</b> leukokcytes at least seven times. optimum conditions for virus propagation <b>in</b> <b>turkey</b> leukocyte cultures and harvest times were determined. HEV could not be produced in chicken leukocytes. HEV-A, propagated <b>in</b> <b>turkey</b> leukocyte cell cultures, was tested as a vaccine to prevent HE <b>in</b> <b>turkeys</b> <b>in</b> experimental and field trials (Chapter 6). Immunization of turkeys with live HEV-A resulted in protection against a challenge with HEV-V as measured by the serological response and the absence of clinical disease and HEV antigen in spleens. In the field trials, 19 out of 20 flocks seroconverted within 21 days after vaccination with live HEV-A distributed in the drinking water. The overall immune response of the <b>turkeys</b> <b>in</b> these flocks was 96 %. Most importantly, neither clinical nor other adverse effects caused by HEV-A vaccination were observed in any of the vaccinated <b>turkeys</b> <b>in</b> the experimental and field trials. The optimum time of the vaccination of poults was determined in relation to interference with maternal antibodies. ...|$|R
