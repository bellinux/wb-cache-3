5|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, particularly after de-Stalinization and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.|$|E

5000|$|One {{idea that}} many [...] "branches" [...] of Neo-Marxism share {{is the desire}} to <b>move</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the idea of open, bloody {{revolution}} to one of a more peaceful nature. <b>Moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{the violence of the}} Red revolutions of the past while keeping the revolutionary message. Neo-Marxist concepts can also follow an economic theory that attempts to <b>move</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the traditional accusations of class warfare and create new economic theory models, such as Hans-Jürgen Krahl did.|$|R
5000|$|The {{detached}} personality--one {{who needs}} to <b>move</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> people, expressing needs for independence, perfection and withdrawal. <b>Moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> people is characterized by people who behave in a detached manner. These are people who adopt a neurotic trend of purposely wanting to be left out.|$|R
5|$|In general, {{the show}} {{began to take}} on a more serious tone as a seriocomic (or dramedy) series, in which the focus was on the {{character}} rather than the character type, and <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> its status as a situation comedy.|$|E

5|$|When the Whiskers first {{formed in}} 1998, their main rivals were Young Ones, Lazuli, Elveera and Vivian. These were their main rivals for three years, then Gattaca formed {{north of the}} Whiskers {{territory}} and became their rivals. Over the next few years, Vivian <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Whiskers and Commandos became the Whiskers new rivals. Soon Elveera and Lazuli <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Whiskers and Aztecs form their territory next to the Whiskers. In 2007 Whiskers main rivals were Young Ones, Aztecs and Commandos. Then Young Ones died out, and Kung Fu formed next to Whiskers, Commandos moved away and the Sequoia formed. Today Whiskers main rivals are Toyota, Lazuli, Kung Fu and Sequoia.|$|E

5|$|A {{reviewer}} at RPGFan {{praised the}} game for its plot, its intimate scope, and its music, while a writer for Famitsu found the game's mood to be boring. As the science fiction elements were well received, later entries in the series gradually <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the dating theme and became more focused on science fiction. The PlayStation Portable version of the game was the 967th best selling video {{game of the year}} in Japan in 2009.|$|E
5|$|As Esther {{began to}} {{parallel}} the coastline, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal areas from Long Island to Provincetown, Massachusetts on September 20, and were extended to Eastport, Maine early on September 21. All hurricane watches were discontinued on September 21 as Esther <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the New England coast, and all hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings {{later that day}} as Esther passed near Nantucket and weakened to a tropical storm, and all warnings were discontinued on September 22 after the storm <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the coast. After Esther completed its anticyclonic loop over the northwestern Atlantic, a gale warning was again issued from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Eastport, Maine on September 25, and was discontinued the next day after Esther made its second landfall in Maine. Personnel on two offshore surveillance stations called the Texas Towers were evacuated; a third tower had collapsed during a storm in January 1961, prompting higher safety standards.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Havelock <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{the socialist}} organisations {{he had been}} {{associated}} with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the Ontario Classical Association. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for Greece, which had just been liberated from Nazi control. Havelock continued to write about politics, however, and his political and academic work came together in his ideas about education; he argued for the necessity of an understanding of rhetoric for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.|$|E

In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate. Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable {{for the growth of}} pure diamond.|$|E

Manning lead the party through seven-straight massive majorities, (although in 1955 his government received barely more seats than Aberhart had received in 1940, {{due to a}} strong but short-lived Liberal drive). After 24 years as premier, Manning resigned in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Etz Ahayem, was {{established}} in 1912 by Ladino speaking Sephardi Jews, particularly from Rhodes. The congregation grew slowly, and completed construction of its first building in 1927. In 1962 the congregation {{moved to a new}} building, but by the 1990s it had dwindled, as children of congregants <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Montgomery, and the synagogue had difficulty finding rabbis to lead it.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, {{approaches}} to Handel in German and English-speaking countries diverged further. In Leipzig in 1856, the musicologist Friedrich Chrysander and the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus founded the Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft {{with the aim}} of publishing authentic editions of all Handel's works. At the same time, performances in Britain and the United States <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Handel's performance practice with increasingly grandiose renditions. Messiah was presented in New York in 1853 with a chorus of 300 and in Boston in 1865 with more than 600.|$|E
5|$|Like most of South Korea's smaller cities, Gyeongju {{has seen}} a steady drop in {{population}} in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people. This is primarily due to the migration of workers seeking employment in the major South Korean cities. In 2007, about 1,975 more people <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the city each year than moved in. During the same period, births exceeded deaths by roughly 450 per year, a significant number {{but not enough to}} offset the losses due to migration.|$|E
