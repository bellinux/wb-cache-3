The temperature gradient along the bars is measured with a series of copper/constantan microthermocouples, spot welded to them. The assembly is held together by loading the bars to a desired pressure, via a pneumatic cylinder. Contact resistance at the boundaries between the specimen and the <b>meter</b> <b>bars</b> is minimized by using a Hg/In/Ga alloy film at the interface and sufficient loading force. The gradients determined for the <b>meter</b> <b>bars</b> then may be extrapolated to the boundaries yielding the temperature drop along the specimen. Using two different length specimens, the magnitude of the temperature drop across the interface can be computed, or the true gradient along the specimen can be obtained from the difference in overall temperature drops and lengths...|$|R

5000|$|One problem {{remains for}} such views: if God's own {{essential}} goodness {{does not depend}} on divine commands, then on what does it depend? Something other than God? Here the restricted divine command theory is commonly combined with a view reminiscent of Plato: God is identical to the ultimate standard for goodness. Alston offers the analogy of the standard <b>meter</b> <b>bar</b> in France. Something is a meter long inasmuch as it is the same length as the standard <b>meter</b> <b>bar,</b> and likewise, something is good inasmuch as it approximates God. If one asks why God is identified as the ultimate standard for goodness, Alston replies that this is [...] "the end of the line," [...] with no further explanation available, but adds that this is no more arbitrary than a view that invokes a fundamental moral standard. On this view, then, even though goodness is independent of God's will, it still depends on God, and thus God's sovereignty remains intact.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{has been}} designed and constructed to characterize thermal interface materials with unprecedented precision and sensitivity. The design of the apparatus is based upon a popular implementation of ASTM D 5470 where well-characterized <b>meter</b> <b>bars</b> are used to extrapolate surface temperatures and measure heat flux through the sample under test. Measurements of thermal resistance, effective thermal conductivity, and electrical resistance can be made simultaneously as functions of pressure or sample thickness. This apparatus is unique in that it takes advantage of small, well-calibrated thermistors for precise temperature measurements 0. 001 K and incorporates simultaneous measurement of electrical resistance of the sample. By employing precision thermometry, low heater powers and minimal temperature gradients are maintained through the <b>meter</b> <b>bars,</b> thereby reducing uncertainties due to heat leakage and changes in meter-bar thermal conductivity. Careful implementation of instrumentation to measure thickness and force also contributes to a low overall uncertainty. Finally, a robust error analysis provides uncertainties for all measured and calculated quantities. Baseline tests were performed to demonstrate the sensitivity and precision of the apparatus by measuring the contact resistance of the <b>meter</b> <b>bars</b> in {{contact with each other}} as representative low specific thermal resistance cases. A minimum specific thermal resistance of 4. 68 10 ? 6 m 2 K/W was measured with an uncertainty of 2. 7 % using a heat transfer rate of 16. 8 W. Additionally, example measurements performed on a commercially available graphite thermal interface material demonstrate the relationship between thermal and electrical contact resistance. These measurements further demonstrate repeatability in measured effective thermal conductivity of approximately 1...|$|R

Pound championed Antheil's music and asked his help in devising a system of micro-rhythms that would more accurately render the vitalistic speech rhythms of Villon's Old French for Le Testament. The resulting collaboration of 1923 used irregular meters that were considerably more elaborate than Stravinsky's benchmarks of the period, Le Sacre du Printemps (1913) and L'Histoire du Soldat (1918). For example, [...] "Heaulmiere", one of the opera's key arias, at a tempo of quarter note = M.M. 88, moves from 2/8 to 25/32 to 3/8 to 2/4 <b>meter</b> (<b>bars</b> 25-28), {{making it difficult for}} performers to hear the current bar of music and anticipate the upcoming bar.

After the Convention of the Metre had been signed in 1875, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Sèvres, France made 28 prototype line standards of platinum-iridium. The bars had a cross section shaped like a modified letter X, designed by Tresca, called the [...] "Tresca section". The Tresca section was designed to provide maximum stiffness. In addition, one surface of the central rib that joined the arms was designed to coincide with the bar's neutral plane, the mathematical plane inside the bar that didn't change length when the bar bent. The two marks near each end of the bar which defined the meter were ruled on this surface. Thus, to first order, the distance between the marks wouldn't change due to the slight sagging of the bar under its own weight between support points. One of the bars was selected as the International Meter. The United States received National Prototype Meters No. 27 and No. 21 in 1890. When the Mendenhall Order in 1893 declared the meter to be the fundamental length standard, No. 27 became the US primary national standard for all length measurements. It remained so until 1960.|$|R
