50|$|Many rotary unions {{incorporate}} multiple ports, some {{of which}} are designed to handle different types of material simultaneously. A rotary union with a straight port transfers the substance directly through the rotary union.

At the end of the cylinder is a threaded screw with seals that locks on to the output. The material being transferred flows into the cylinder and out of the input holes. In the case of a rotary union with multiple inputs, chambers separated by seals keep the materials from inadvertently mixing. This type of rotary union is often used in the manufacture of plastics and other petroleum products, for which multiple inputs may need to be streamlined, but kept separate.|$|E
