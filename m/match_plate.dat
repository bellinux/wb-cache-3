40|$|The {{development}} of a new microchannel plate photon-counting detector with an analog readout method based on a resistive anode is reported. This detector exhibits extremely high, stable electron gains of 10 to the 8 th. At this gain, the spatial resolution is no longer primarily limited by the noise of the resistive anode, so that digital methods of readout, such as discrete conductors, lose their advantage. These detectors can be readily scaled to 40 mm and 70 mm formats to <b>match</b> <b>plate</b> scales of 2 -m (and larger) telescopes. New, high speed digital electronics fully exploit the high spatial and time resolution made possible by gains of this level. Analysis of the theoretical performance of this detector shows that the major limitation to the spatial resolution is the proximity focus of the photocathode and the first microchannel plate. The detector has been mated to an echelle spectrograph developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{conversion}} casting makes manufacturing major components {{much more efficient}} with regards to time and cost. The conversion cast of the adapter hub used in the Victair Mistifier is a major component that requires 8 hours to machine. The existing hub starts from steel stock and then that block of steel is placed into a CNC machine and coded in to create the adapter hub. The manufacturing method changes to a casting for the adapter hub will create a replicated part that requires 1. 5 hours of post machining. The intricate design makes a conversion to casting more effective in reducing time and costs, because the cast part will be near-net shape. The original design was redesigned to be castable {{with the addition of}} casting components onto a pattern bed to create a <b>match</b> <b>plate.</b> In order to make this project economical and the final product as close to the net design of the adapter hub, shrinkage of the material was placed into consideration and casting formulas were used to create the smallest gating system as possible. Draft angles were added to all faces of the adapter hub design and filleted edges around the overall design were added for easy removal from the casting flask. This process reduces time and costs by $ 157 while also providing H. F. Hauff, manufacturer of the Victair Mistifier, the ability the mass produce a critical component of their most sold product. This in turn should lead to reduced costs for their customers...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a 50 Ω {{terminated}} or {{in other}} words transformerless bandpass matching network design methodology and an implementation example are presented. The real frequency techniques are powerful numerical methods to design wideband lossless two-port networks such as filters, matching networks and amplifiers. In these techniques, {{the value of the}} termination resistance of the designed network could not be yielded as 50 Ω by numerical package. Hence, a transformer is also required for 50 Ω termination which is not practical for high frequency applications. By employing the proposed procedure, it is guaranteed to obtain transformerless bandpass matching network. Also in this study a wideband suspended monopole antenna is examined. The proposed antenna consists of two major elements; Y-shaped impedance <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> and hemi-circular radiator. Moreover Y-shaped impedance <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> connected to a feeding probe excites the suspended hemi-circular radiator via air gap. Consequently, a transformerless bandpass matching network is designed to filter and expand the operational frequency bandwidth of the proposed antenna. It has been observed that ideal circuit and the layout of the matching network simulation have good agreement. Publisher's Versio...|$|R

Note, however, that a positive ID of the license plates in a hit and run accident will often be considered by insurance companies sufficient information to identify the negligent Hit and run driver.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{hydrodynamic}} characteristic size of polymer was proposed in this study, to characterize the size of aggregates of many polymer molecules in the polymer percolation process. The hydrodynamic characteristic sizes of polymers used in the target block S were examined by employing microporous membrane filtration method, and the factors were studied. Natural core flow experiments were conducted in order {{to set up the}} flow <b>matching</b> relationship <b>plate.</b> According to the flow <b>matching</b> <b>plate,</b> the relationship between the hydrodynamic characteristic size of polymer and pore throat radius obtained from core mercury injection data was found. And several suitable polymers for different reservoirs permeability were given. The experimental results of microporous membrane filtration indicated that the hydrodynamic characteristic size of polymer maintained a good nonlinear relationship with polymer viscosity; the value increased as the molecular weight and concentration of the polymer increased and increased as the salinity of dilution water decreased. Additionally, the hydrodynamic characteristic size decreased as the pressure increased, so the hydrodynamic characteristic size ought to be determined based on the pressure of the target block. In the core flow studies, good matching of polymer and formation was identified as polymer flow pressure gradient lower than the fracture pressure gradient of formation. In this case, good matching that was the pore throat radius should be larger than 10 times the hydrodynamic characteristic size of polymer in this study. Using relationship, more matching relationship between the hydrodynamic characteristic sizes of polymer solutions and the pore throat radius of target block was determined...|$|R

The system is based on video cameras placed at various intersections and software with image processing capabilities to <b>match</b> the <b>plate</b> numbers of vehicles as they cross equipped intersections. The data are collected in an urban area, and hence exhibit very high noise. The proposed approach emphasizes the need to properly identify outliers (for example, cars temporarily parked on an urban street). Similarly, Park et al.

30|$|Viable {{counts in}} faecal samples were {{mostly in the}} range of 108 cells per gram dry weight, with each faecal sample {{containing}} all targeted hydrolase producers although strictly anaerobic hydrolytically active bacteria were not quantified (Table  2). The counts for soil control samples were generally at least 1 – 2 logs lower than the counts in the corresponding faecal samples. In addition, clear differences in the proportions of specific hydrolase producers were evident (Fig.  2). Gong (2007) reported total and viable microscopic counts for cattle dung of about 1011  cfu/g (dry weight) and a <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> count for mesophilic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria of about 1010  cfu/g, with proteolytic bacteria present at about 108  cfu/g and both lipolytic, amylolytic and cellulolytic bacteria present at about 109  cfu/g. Viable plate counts established in this study for Nguni cow faeces were lower than those reported by Gong (2007), although similar relative proportions were observed for the hydrolase producers with the exception of cellulolytic microorganisms. The difference in viable counts per g of faeces might be due to the shorter incubation time for agar plates used and the typically poorer diet of the Nguni cow (Tada et al. 2013).|$|R
