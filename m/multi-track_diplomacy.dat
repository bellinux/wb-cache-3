[...] "High level" [...] (governmental and international) peacemaking, involving direct talks between the leaders of conflicting parties, is sometimes thus referred to as Track 1. Tracks 2 and 3 are said to involve dialogue at 'lower' levels—often unofficially between groups, parties, and stakeholders to a violent conflict—as well as efforts to avoid violence by addressing its causes and deleterious results. Peacemakers may be active in all three tracks, or in what is sometimes called <b>multi-track</b> <b>diplomacy.</b>|$|E

We discuss a range of conceptual issues relevant for negotiations over the management of Himalayan rivers. We introduce the concept of <b>multi-track</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> and apply it to the case of international river management, in the context of innovations incorporated in five international treaties signed in 1996 and 1997. We examine past problems with bilateralism in international river diplomacy, in particular as an obstacle to successful agreement and the potential of more multilateral approaches. We describe the wave of Himalayan water projects being designed and constructed {{at the beginning of the}} twenty-first century, based on earlier agreements as well as new initiatives. We note the subsequent implementation problems that have arisen, and the substantial issues that need to be addressed by an expanded group of countries depending on Himalayan rivers. Finally, we consider directions in which current innovations might be extended as bases of regional cooperation, using the <b>multi-track</b> <b>diplomacy</b> framework. We suggest that an independent regulatory agency could facilitate rational development, assist in the management of substantial uncertainties about future flows, and reduce the potential for conflict. We describe the possible structure and functioning of such a new institution...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{political}} conflict in Zimbabwe has {{attracted the attention}} of policymakers, academics and the media alike in the neighbouring countries of the region, across the African continent and internationally. While the story of an ageing African liberation hero turned dictator who, through autocratic rule, has governed his country and his people to the ground in order to maintain power is captivating, a key element of the fascination is the critical diplomatic role played by South Africa from 2000 onward. Foreign policy in post-apartheid South Africa on paper is driven by human rights and democracy, conflict prevention and conflict resolution through peaceful means, and the promotion of African interests in world affairs. However, after observing South Africa’s involvement in the Zimbabwe conflict between 2000 and 2009, South Africa’s foreign policy appears to be propelled more by African solidarity and sovereignty, anti-imperialism, and a softer interpretation of preventive diplomacy than its international counterparts. Thabo Mbeki’s preventive diplomacy toward Zimbabwe during his presidency was slow to produce results, lacked transparency and frustrated many, yet, when examined under a preventive diplomacy theoretical lens, Mbeki’s policy did eventually garner success through the signing of the Global Political Agreement (GPA) and the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe. This dissertation examines the role of preventive diplomacy in South Africa’s foreign policy toward Zimbabwe under Mbeki’s leadership and determines the point at which South Africa switched from an approach of preventive diplomacy to one of conflict resolution and conflict management. The concept of ‘preventive diplomacy’ is often focused on government-to-government relations or the high level diplomacy of intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations (UN). <b>Multi-track</b> <b>diplomacy</b> expands on this traditional interpretation and considers the preventive diplomacy contributions of a variety of non-state actors to the practice of conflict prevention. This dissertation uniquely moulds the preventive diplomacy theoretical framework of Michael Lund with Kumar Rupesinghe’s concept of <b>multi-track</b> <b>diplomacy</b> to form a more comprehensive illustration of the role of preventive diplomacy in the approach of multiple actors towards the Zimbabwe conflict. The more inclusive preventive diplomacy theoretical framework is then applied to the conflict in Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2009. Through the application of a preventive diplomacy framework which incorporates the concept of <b>multi-track</b> <b>diplomacy</b> it is then possible to observe the South African government’s preventive diplomacy approach toward Zimbabwe first between 2000 and 2007 and then as mandated by SADC between 2007 and 2009 and finally compare it with the diplomacy of multi-track actors such as the UN, Zimbabwe-based and South African-based civil society organizations, the Zimbabwean Diaspora, religious groups, and financial institutions. The examination of the larger role of preventive diplomacy in the Zimbabwe conflict situation leads to the understanding that each diplomatic effort is interlinked. Therefore the culminating event of the South African government’s preventive diplomacy approach in the Global Political Agreement could not have been achieved without the preventive diplomacy efforts of a multitude of actors who were also committed to preventing violence and finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Zimbabwe.

It is {{something}} that we all want, something we all speak about, and something we generally all consider to be a positive thing, but do we really understand what peace means and how it is achieved? In post conflict nations peace is the goal but you cannot have peace without meaningful political forgiveness. Political forgiveness plays a vital role in the building of peace in societies that have been decimated by violence, for without forgiveness the cycle of violence will only continue. We will be describing what is meant by political forgiveness, how it relates to individual and community forgiveness processes and how it applies to national healing peace processes such {{as in the case of}} Colombia and other societies that have been involved in long-running conflicts that have taken a significant toll on the country but also its population. Dr. Eileen Borris is the president of Forgiveness International, whose mission is to advance individual and societal transformation through the practice of forgiveness in order to create sustainable peace. A clinical and political psychologist with over 25 years of experience, Dr. Borris also served as director of training and program development for the Institute for <b>Multi-Track</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> (IMTD) and has extensive consulting experience, having worked in Indonesia for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and with trauma healing programs throughout Liberia through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
