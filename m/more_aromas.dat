40|$|Research {{conducted}} at Lincoln University, New Zealand, evaluated an alternative use for recycled glass in its crushed form as a mulch under grapevines. The trial comprised four treatments: clear glass, brown glass, mixed glass (which is primarily green and brown) and undisturbed soil as a control, with four replicates in a randomised block design. The vine material was twelve year-old Pinot noir 777 on 3309 rootstock. Radiation reflected {{back up into}} the fruiting zone was quantified using a Bentham spectroradiometer under clear and sunny field conditions. Reflection from the mulches was also measured under controlled conditions. The results showed that clear glass reflected the highest amount of radiation in all the spectral ranges evaluated. UV-B radiation reflected by clear glass was double that reflected by the control. UV-A reflected by clear glass was about seven times more {{than that of the}} undisturbed soil treatment. Readings for PAR were almost five times larger than the control and, for infra-red (IR), this difference was twice as much as for the control. PAR was also divided in different “colours”, with clear glass being the most reflective treatment in all PAR ranges. Similar data were obtained from the evaluation of the mulches under controlled conditions. However, the extra amounts of radiation reflected by the mulches did not have any effect on havest parameters: number of clusters, cluster weight, potential crop, ºBrix, pH or TA. Aromatic profiles of the juice obtained from the grapes of this trial were evaluated using GC-O analysis. The panellist identified seven aroma descriptors from the samples: cut grass, mushroom, fresh peas, violet, cooked potato, rose and blackberry. Despite <b>more</b> <b>aromas</b> being detected, these were the ones most frequently sniffed by the panellist. The descriptors corresponded only to an association between panellist’s perception and a known aroma. The use of reflective mulches showed an influence on the aromatic profile of the grape. Clear glass decreased the intensity of the cooked potato-like aroma. This treatment also enhanced the aromas described as roses and blackberry when sniffed by the panellist. GC-MS and a mix of standards were used to determine the compounds related to each of the aromas described by the panellist. Hexanal was reported as the compound related to the aroma described as cut grass, and 1 -hexanol was related to the aroma described as fresh peas. The rest of the descriptors were only tentatively identified. To do that, the retention time of each descriptor was compared with an alkane mix of standards and information registered in the literature. For mushroom aroma, 2 -octanone was described as the most possible compound related to this aroma in the samples analysed. The aroma described as violet was associated to four different compounds: (Z) -linalool oxide, (E) -linalool oxide, nerol oxide and linalool oxide. The cooked potato-like aroma was related to methional, which was described {{for the first time in}} this experiment on Pinot noir juice. Linalool was associated with the aroma described as rose by the panellist, and β-ionone was related with the blackberry-like aroma...|$|E

50|$|Scheurebe {{was created}} by German viticulturalist Dr. Georg Scheu (1879-1949) in 1916, {{when he was working}} as {{director}} of a grape-breeding institute in Alzey in Rheinhessen, by crossing Riesling with an unknown wild vine. According to the German grape-breeder Helmut Becker, Scheu's purpose was to create a superior version of Silvaner, with <b>more</b> <b>aroma</b> and greater resistance to frost damage and chlorosis. It was long assumed that Scheurebe was Silvaner x Riesling, but DNA analysis in the late 1990s ruled out Silvaner as a parent, while confirming Riesling as the father. It is known that Scheu was working on wild vines, so it is possible that a misidentification of the cross took place. According to official Austrian sources it is in fact a cross between Riesling and Bouquet Blanc (Bukettraube).|$|R

50|$|Jasmine tea {{is often}} {{consumed}} in China, {{where it is}} called jasmine-flower tea (茉莉花茶; pinyin: mò lì huā chá). Jasminum sambac flowers are also used to make jasmine tea, which often has a base of green tea or white tea, but sometimes an Oolong base is used. The flowers are put in machines that control temperature and humidity. It takes about four hours for the tea to absorb the fragrance and flavour of the jasmine blossoms. For the highest grades of jasmine tea, this process may be repeated up to seven times. As the tea absorbs moisture from the fresh Jasmine flowers, it must be refired to prevent spoilage. The used flowers may {{be removed from the}} final product, as the flowers contain no <b>more</b> <b>aroma.</b> Giant fans are used to blow away and remove the petals from the denser tea leaves.|$|R

40|$|The wild grape, Vitis vinifera L. subsp. sylvestris (Gmelin, Hegi) is {{spontaneous}} in Europe and it {{is considered}} the ancestor of cultivated varieties (Vitis vinifera L. subsp. sativa). We have identified around 150 wild vines identified in 10 different habitats in Tuscan Maremma, 72 of which were propagated by cuttings {{and placed in a}} collection applying a specific training system (Totem). Both SSR and SNPs analyses revealed that true sylvestris V. v. sylvestris are clearly distinct from V. v. sativa, and that some supposed sylvestris are feral sativa, while others accessions are possible natural sativa-sylvestris crosses. Even the analysis of flower and berry aroma clearly separated sylvestris from sativa genotypes. Sylvestris flowers produced much <b>more</b> <b>aroma</b> than sativa ones, with also a clear distinction of female and male of sylvestris, while the berry of sativa had a concentration of aroma higher than sylvestris grapes. Some differences have been observed also among the relative ratios within the single aroma compounds...|$|R

40|$|Processing of {{artificial}} fragrant rice {{in which one}} or <b>more</b> <b>aroma</b> compounds were introduced into raw milled rice were studied. The end product, which is potentially marketable, showed no visible difference in appearance from the untreated rice, and the cooked product showed perceivable aroma to the consumers. The aromatisation process used liquid carbon dioxide {{as a vehicle to}} deliver the aroma. Five aroma compounds of eugenol, iso-eugenol, methyl eugenol, cinnamyl alcohol, and cinnamaldehyde were used as model compounds. The results showed that liquid carbon dioxide at a pressure of 8 MPa and an equilibration time of 5 minutes were found to be the optimum conditions for imparting the aroma compounds into the rice. The retention of the model aroma compounds in rice were in the range of 33 % to 50 %. The aroma carrier was found to be able to carry the model compounds into the core of rice. This was significant, as it potentially provided a longer period for the aroma compounds to remain in the rice...|$|R

40|$|Common {{buckwheat}} (Fagopyrium esculentum Moench) {{was used}} to substitute 15 % of wheat flour to make husked and unhusked buckwheat breads. Volatile compounds and taste components in buckwheat breads were analyzed and compared with those in white bread. Both buckwheat breads contained more sugars and had higher sugar contents than white bread. Both buckwheat breads contained more total free amino acids (86. 36 - 87. 73 mg/g) than white bread (73. 90 mg/g). Contents of flavor 5 '-nucleotides were higher in both buckwheat breads. Both buckwheat breads had higher umami intensities than white bread. Three breads had different profiles of volatile compounds, and total volatile contents in buckwheat breads (3564. 36 - 4951. 39 mu g/g) were 2 - to 3 -folds higher than that in white bread (1, 706. 46 mu g/g). In addition, buckwheat breads possessed a <b>more</b> characteristic <b>aroma</b> than white bread. Overall, buckwheat could be incorporated into bread and provide buckwheat bread with more sugars, a stronger umami taste and a <b>more</b> characteristic <b>aroma.</b> PRACTICAL APPLICATION Common buckwheat (Fagopyrium esculentum Moench) is commonly used as an important functional food and most popularly is ground to make buckwheat noodles. Buckwheat {{can be added to}} food as a supplement to provide beneficial health effects and prevent oxidation of food during processing. Bread is consumed all over the world, and many food ingredients have been included in bread formulations to increase the diversity, nutritional value and product appeal of bread. In the present study, buckwheat {{was used to}} substitute 15 % of wheat flour to make buckwheat breads. Volatile compounds and taste components, including soluble sugars, free amino acids and 5 '-nucleotides, in buckwheat bread are valuable information for its practical application. The present work showed that buckwheat could be incorporated into bread and provides buckwheat bread with more sugars, a stronger umami taste and a <b>more</b> characteristic <b>aroma...</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{effectiveness}} of decanting is a topic of debate, with some wine experts such as oenologist Émile Peynaud claiming that the prolonged exposure to oxygen actually diffuses and dissipates <b>more</b> <b>aroma</b> compounds than it stimulates, {{in contrast to the}} effects of the smaller scale exposure and immediate release that swirling the wine in a drinker's glass has. [...] In addition {{it has been reported that}} the process of decanting over a period of a few hours does not have the effect of softening tannins. The softening of tannins occurs during the winemaking and oak aging when tannins go through a process of polymerization that can last days or weeks; decanting merely alters the perception of sulfites and other chemical compounds in the wine through oxidation, which can give some drinkers the sense of softer tannins in the wine. In line with the view that decanting can dissipate aromas, wine expert Kerin O'Keefe prefers to let the wine evolve slowly and naturally in the bottle, by uncorking it a few hours ahead, a practice suggested by wine producers such as Bartolo Mascarello and Franco Biondi Santi.|$|R

40|$|Drinking wine is a manifestly sensuous experience. Wine stimulates {{most of our}} senses; {{particularly}} smell (olfaction) and taste, and, to {{a lesser}} extent, sight and touch. These sensory inputs interact with the limbic system in our brain which is associated with emotions and memory. Agreeable smells can thus evoke feelings of enjoyment and nostalgia. But how are tastants and aromas detected? Over {{the past few years}} a great deal has been learnt about how small tastant and odorant molecules are detected by specific protein receptors located in our mouth and in nasal cavities, respectively. Indeed, we have a vast array of olfactory receptors encoded by a group of genes that represent {{a significant part of the}} human genome. Interestingly, many <b>more</b> <b>aroma</b> compounds can be detected and discriminated than can be accounted for by the number of olfactory receptors that are encoded by our genes. Such disparity implies a level of complexity in this system which is not yet fully understood. Sophistication in olfaction is something that winemakers (and drinkers!) have long appreciated, and now scientists are beginning to unravel some of the underlying mysteries. Discovering why some individuals are more receptive to different tastes and smells than others will help wine producers understand variation in consumer preferences between different parts of the world, and possibly capture new opportunities in a changing global marketplace. Given such prospects, this present review offers a timely summary of some key developments in our understanding of odorant and tastant detection. We also consider how genetic components in human olfaction might be utilised to develop a 'biosensor' for aroma detection and discrimination. 5 page(s...|$|R
