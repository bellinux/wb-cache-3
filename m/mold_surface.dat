25|$|Epoxy, metal-filled epoxy, and metal-coated epoxy is {{used for}} tooling that has an EOL {{in the tens of}} {{thousands}} of parts. It is typically used for molding flexible foam cushions and seating, integral skin and microcellular foam padding, and shallow-draft RIM bezels and fascia. The heat transfer characteristic of epoxy tooling is fair; the heat transfer characteristic of metal-filled and metal-coated epoxy is good. Copper tubing can be incorporated into the body of the tool, allowing hot water to circulate and heat the <b>mold</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, cores {{are usually}} supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means {{are required to}} support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied {{in the form of}} chaplets. These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the <b>mold</b> <b>surface</b> and the core. Since the chaplets become part of the casting, the chaplets must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects or create a weak spot in the casting. It is usually more critical to ensure the upper chaplets are stronger than the lower ones because the core will want to float up in the molten metal.|$|E

50|$|Molten {{steel is}} also less fluid than molten iron, {{making it more}} {{difficult}} to pour and fill intricate gaps in a mold cavity. Molten steel is also more likely to react with internal <b>mold</b> <b>surfaces,</b> making for more unpredictable results.|$|R
50|$|Mold Tapering: The twin-belt {{casting machine}} differs from other moving mold casting {{machines}} in that all four <b>mold</b> <b>surfaces</b> are independent. This allows the <b>mold</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{to be tapered}} to remain {{in contact with the}} cast product as it shrinks. The high velocity cooling water, which is continuously applied to the backside of the belt, impinges on the belt and creates a force on the belt.This force acts to press the belt against the surface of the strip or slab as it shrinks, keeping the belt in close contact with the cast product throughout the mold. Each side of the mold is formed by an endless chain of dam blocks,which are held against the cast strip by adjustable spring-loaded guides.|$|R

50|$|Advantages {{are high}} {{achievable}} temperatures, independent from the conductivity of the mold and independent {{from heat and}} pressure.

50|$|The mold {{must also}} have a well {{designed}} cooling system so that heat can be quickly extracted from the hot plastic part allowing fast cycle times. To achieve this, cooling channels need to be designed close to the <b>molding</b> <b>surface.</b> Cleaning the mould {{on a daily basis}} is also a critical requirement to maintain the part quality.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the plug}} has been formed, it is sprayed with a mold release agent. The release agent {{will allow the}} mold to be {{separated}} from the plug once it is finished. The mold release agent is a special wax, and/or PVA (Polyvinyl alcohol). Polyvinyl Alcohol, however, is said to have negative effects on the final <b>mold's</b> <b>surface</b> finish.|$|R
50|$|Materials may {{be loaded}} into the mold either {{in the form of}} pellets or sheet, or the mold may be loaded from a plasticating extruder.

50|$|Injection mold epoxy castingEpoxy Casting. Epoxy Casting {{is the use}} of {{a liquid}} epoxy that has been mixed with a metal alloy. Typically {{the most common form of}} epoxy based molds are {{combined}} with atomized aluminum. The atomized aluminum allows for the distribution of heat from the <b>mold</b> <b>surface</b> outward toward the edges. This preserves the surface quality of the mold for typically 50 - 100 cycles on a single epoxy mold.|$|E
5000|$|Release agents {{provide the}} {{critical}} barrier between a molding {{surface and the}} substrate, facilitating separation of the cured part from the mold. Without such a barrier in place the substrate would become fused to the <b>mold</b> <b>surface,</b> resulting in difficult clean-up and dramatic loss in production efficiency. Even when a release agent is used, factors such as irregular applications or improper release agent choice may have a dramatic effect on the quality and consistency of the finished product.|$|E

Since the method is non-abrasive, the cleanings will not damage <b>molding</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Ice blasting can be used on hot or cold molds, reducing the downtime in production facilities. Ice sublimates on impact, so entrapment of the blasting media is not a concern. Grit entrapment is the reason abrasive media such as sand cannot be used to clean online.|$|R
50|$|Types {{of samples}} include air, surface, bulk, and swab. Air {{is the most}} common form of {{sampling}} to assess mold levels. Indoor and outdoor air are sampled, and their mold-spore levels compared. Air sampling often identifies hidden <b>mold.</b> <b>Surface</b> sampling measures the number of mold spores deposited on indoor surfaces, collected on tape or in dust. Bulk removal of material from the contaminated area is used to identify and quantify the mold in the sample. With swab, a cotton swab is rubbed across the area being sampled, often a measured area, and subsequently sent to the mold testing laboratory. Final results indicate mold levels and species located in suspect area.|$|E

5000|$|Analysis {{showed that}} some massive {{concrete}} supports could burst and crumble under likely stresses. In particular the western supports were extensively modified. First, {{the location of}} existing reinforcing bar is determined using magnetic techniques. In areas between bars holes are drilled. Into these holes is inserted and glued an L-shaped bar that protrudes 15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches). This bar is retained in the hole with a high-strength epoxy adhesive. The entire surface of the structure is thus covered with closely spaced protrusions. A network of horizontal and vertical reinforcing bars is then attached to these protrusions. <b>Mold</b> <b>surface</b> plates are then positioned to retain high-strength concrete, which is then pumped into the void. After removal of the formwork the surface appears similar to the original concrete. This technique has been applied elsewhere throughout California to improve freeway overpass abutments and some overpass central supports that have unconventional shapes. (Other techniques such as jacket and grout are applied to simple vertical posts; see the seismic retrofit article.) ...|$|E
