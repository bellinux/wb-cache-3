Applying this method microstructures are generated by molding of a thermoplastic polymer (<b>mold</b> <b>material)</b> using a <b>molding</b> tool. In order to otain very good adhesion to the wafer and very little adhesion to the molding tool {{in the process of}} plastic molding a two-layer PMMA base <b>mold</b> <b>material</b> was developed.

40|$|Surface finish is {{the most}} desired {{characteristics}} to be on product surface. This is because surface finish is a predictor {{of the performance of}} a mechanical component, since irregularities in the surface may form nucleation sites for cracks or corrosion. In this study, the impact of <b>mold</b> <b>material</b> and coating on surface finish in sand casting was investigated. By using different kind of material to make the mold and evaluating whether coating give effect to product surface finish, the experiment had been done in 4 different tests by using sand casting process as a method to make the final product. In sand casting process, <b>mold</b> <b>material</b> and coating are two significant concerns, but they have different impact in surface finish. In producing part using sand casting, analyzing test is commonly made between these two features to get good quality surface finish. A result among these two different parameters concerns can be achieved by getting the experiment done which on the other hand, selection of better <b>mold</b> <b>material</b> and use of coating will further provide an improved solution. In this thesis, efforts towards determining good surface finish will be decide using different mold properties and coating. The quality of the surface roughness is determined by using visual and analysis. This Surface Roughness is obtained based on the analyzed using MAHR Perthometer s 2. In this present work, the main objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the effect of coating between two patterns and decide which one has a better surface finish and to compare <b>mold</b> <b>material</b> whether carbon dioxide, CO 2 molding or Greensand molding with and without coating and their effect in product surface finish.

BMG mold inserts were replicated from a fused silica master mold using precision glass molding techniques. The molded BMG inserts with optical features were used next as secondary molds to manufacture of polymer micro optics. High volume production methods, i. e., hot embossing and injection molding, are investigated. In order to evaluate the performance of BMG inserts, the geometry of the gratings on PMMA part were verified with fused silica master mold and BMG inserts using a non-contact profilometer. In addition, an instrument designed to measure surface scattering was used to measure the light distribution from the gratings. By using this process, high performance and BMG mold inserts for hot embossing and injection molding can be prepared cost-effectively for high volume production of plastic micro optical components...|$|R

Neutron radiography provided quantitative data for the local water concentrations within the <b>mold</b> <b>material</b> as a function of time and temperature.

Within four cycles of de- and rehydration, no significant differences in water kinematics were detected.

40|$|For {{characterization}} {{and assessment}} of service behavior of <b>mold</b> <b>materials</b> and <b>mold</b> coatings for glass forming opterations, like e. g. glass container manufacturing, a testing procedure and corresponding laboratory apparatus was developed. The testing procedure resembles industrial working conditions, the <b>mold</b> <b>material</b> specimens are subjected to cyclic loading by pressing small gobs (soda-lime glass) from a melting crucible under defined non-isothermal conditions. A function of pressing parameters, especially mold temperature, molding pressure and service time of the mold specimens, the sticking behavior, surface structure of the molded glass objects and corrosion and wear of the mold surfaces are analyzed. The sturdiness of sticking may be described by a Gaussian distribution, and is quantified by recording the time interval necessary for separating the glass blank from the mold surface using a special separation procedure. The duration of sticking increases steeply with mold temperature within a narrow temperature interval of 20 - 50 K. The sticking characteristics of each tested bulk material and coating can be described by two material specific values: the lower and the upper sticking temperatures. The lower sticking temperatures exhibit a linear dependence on the thermal diffusivity of the <b>mold</b> <b>materials,</b> whereas the upper sticking temperature additionally depends on chemical and structural properties of the mold surfaces. Corrosion and wear of the <b>mold</b> <b>materials</b> in contact with hot glass is enhanced in this testing procedure due to conducting those pressing experiments well above the lower sticking temperature, which yields significant differences in corrosion behaviour in short time laboratory experiments...|$|R
