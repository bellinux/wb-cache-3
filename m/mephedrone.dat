5|$|<b>Mephedrone</b> {{is often}} {{consumed}} with alcohol. A study in mice investigated the interrelation {{between these two}} substances, focusing on the psychostimulant and rewarding properties of <b>mephedrone.</b> It found that at low (non stimulant) doses alcohol significantly enhanced the psychostimulant effects of <b>mephedrone.</b> This effect was mediated {{by an increase in}} synaptic dopamine, as haloperidol, but not ketanserin, was able to block the potentiation by alcohol. Similarly, the rewarding properties of <b>mephedrone</b> were enhanced by a low non-rewarding dose of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken <b>mephedrone.</b> Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used <b>mephedrone,</b> 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of <b>mephedrone,</b> of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased <b>mephedrone</b> online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its stimulant effects, <b>mephedrone</b> produces side effects, of which teeth grinding is the most common. The metabolism of <b>mephedrone</b> has been studied in rats and humans and the metabolites can be detected in urine after usage.|$|E
5|$|The keto oxygen renders <b>mephedrone</b> more {{hydrophilic}} {{than the}} corresponding methylamphetamines, which {{may account for}} the higher doses required to achieve a similar effect, because <b>mephedrone</b> is less able to cross the blood–brain barrier.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mephedrone</b> {{has been}} implicated {{in the death of}} a 22-year-old male, who had also {{injected}} black tar heroin. <b>Mephedrone</b> was found in his blood at a concentration of 0.50mg/L and in his urine at a concentration of 198mg/L. The blood concentration of morphine, a metabolite of heroin, was 0.06mg/L. For comparison, the average blood morphine concentration resulting from deadly overdoses involving only heroin is around 0.34mg/L.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mephedrone</b> may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry {{to confirm}} {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalised patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma <b>mephedrone</b> concentrations {{are expected to be}} in a range of 50–100 μg/l in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/l in intoxicated patients and >500 μg/l in victims of acute overdosage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mephedrone</b> {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1929, {{but did not}} become widely known until it was rediscovered in 2003 at which point it was legal to produce and possess in many countries. By 2007, <b>mephedrone</b> {{was reported to be}} available for sale on the internet, by 2008 law enforcement agencies had become aware of the compound, and by 2010, it had been reported in most of Europe, becoming particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom. <b>Mephedrone</b> was first made illegal in Israel in 2008, followed by Sweden later that year. In 2010, it was made illegal in many European countries and in December 2010, the EU ruled it illegal. In Australia, New Zealand and the United States, it is considered an analog of other illegal drugs and can be controlled by laws similar to the US Federal Analog Act. In September 2011, the US temporarily classified <b>mephedrone</b> as a Schedule I drug, effective October 2011. This classification was made permanent in July 2012 {{with the passage of the}} Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act (SDAPA).|$|E
5|$|Several {{articles}} published {{near the end}} of 2011 examined the effects of <b>mephedrone,</b> compared to the similar drugs MDMA and amphetamine in the nucleus accumbens of rats, as well as examining the reinforcing potential of <b>mephedrone.</b> Dopamine and serotonin were collected using microdialysis, and increases in dopamine and serotonin were measured using HPLC. Reward and drug seeking are linked to increases in dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens, and drug half-life plays a role in drug seeking, as well. Based on histological examination, most of the author's probes were in the nucleus accumbens shell. <b>Mephedrone</b> administration caused about a 500% increase in dopamine, and about a 950% increase in serotonin. They reached their peak concentrations at 40 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, and returned to baseline by 120 minutes after injection. In comparison, MDMA caused a roughly 900% increase in serotonin at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in dopamine. Amphetamine administration resulted in about a 400% increase in dopamine, peaking at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in serotonin. Analysis of the ratio of the AUC for dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) indicated <b>mephedrone</b> was preferentially a serotonin releaser, with a ratio of 1.22:1 (serotonin vs. dopamine). Additionally, half-lives for the decrease in DA and 5-HT were calculated for each drug. <b>Mephedrone</b> had decay rates of 24.5 minutes and 25.5 minutes, respectively. MDMA had decay values of 302.5 minutes and 47.9 minutes, respectively, while amphetamine values were 51 minutes and 84.1 minutes, respectively. Taken together, these findings show <b>mephedrone</b> induces a massive increase in both DA and 5-HT, combined with rapid clearance. The rapid rise and subsequent fall of DA levels could explain some of the addictive properties <b>mephedrone</b> displays in some users.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} reports of users craving <b>mephedrone,</b> {{suggesting}} it may be addictive.|$|E
5|$|According to the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, after <b>mephedrone</b> {{was made}} illegal, a street {{trade in the}} drug emerged, with prices around double those prior to the ban, at £20–£25 per gram. In September 2010, Druglink {{reported}} the ban had had a mixed effect on <b>mephedrone</b> use, with it decreasing in some areas, remaining similar in others and becoming more prevalent in some areas. In an online survey of 150 users after the ban, 63% said they were continuing to use <b>mephedrone,</b> half of those used the same amount and half said they used less. Compared to previous surveys, more users purchased it from dealers, rather than the internet. The average price per gram was £16, compared to around £10 before the ban. The 2010 Mixmag survey of 2,500 nightclubbers found one quarter had used <b>mephedrone</b> in the previous month, the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, and it {{was more likely to}} be cut with other substances. Of those who had already used <b>mephedrone</b> prior to the ban, 75% had continued to use it after the ban. Of the various drugs used by the survey participants, users {{were more likely to have}} concerns about it. Interviews with users in Northern Ireland also found the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, to around £30 a gram. Rather than the price rising due to increased scarcity of the drug, it is thought to have risen for two other reasons. Firstly, dealers knew there was still demand for <b>mephedrone,</b> but were aware the supplies may be exhausted in the future. Secondly, the dealers perceived customers were likely to be willing to pay more for an illegal substance.|$|E
5|$|By December 2009 <b>mephedrone</b> was {{available}} {{on at least}} 31 websites based in the UK and by March 2010 {{there were at least}} 78 online shops, half of which sold amounts of less than 200grams and half that also sold bulk quantities. The price per gram varied from £9.50 to £14. Between July 2009 and February 2010, UK health professionals accessed the National Poisons Information Services (NPIS) entry on <b>mephedrone</b> 1664 times and made 157 telephone inquiries; the requests increased month on month over this period. In comparison, over a similar time period, the entries for cocaine and MDMA were accessed approximately 2400 times. After <b>mephedrone</b> was made illegal the number of inquiries to the NPIS fell substantially, to only 19 in June 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mephedrone</b> {{does not}} react with most reagent testing kits. The {{exception}} is the Liebermann reagent, which gives a bright yellow reaction.|$|E
5|$|One {{published}} {{study that}} analysed samples of <b>mephedrone</b> bought {{using the internet}} in the UK in 2010 found it was racemic (a mixture of both stereoisomers) and of high purity. An unpublished study of six samples also ordered off the internet in the UK in 2010 found they contained very few organic impurities. Four products sold in Irish head shops were tested in 2010 and were found to contain between 82% and 14% <b>mephedrone,</b> with some products containing benzocaine and caffeine.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used <b>mephedrone</b> {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for <b>mephedrone</b> usage.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, <b>mephedrone</b> {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of <b>mephedrone</b> to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, the International Narcotics Control Board {{published}} a report about designer drugs, noting <b>mephedrone</b> was by then being used recreationally in Europe, North America, Southeast Asia, New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mephedrone</b> is a monoamine {{releasing}} agent. It is a chiral {{compound and}} both of its enantiomers display similar potency as substrates at dopamine transporters. R-Mephedrone is much less potent than S-mephedrone as a substrate at serotonin transporters.|$|E
5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The {{first step in}} the synthesis would be to react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. This would produce (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be methylated to produce <b>mephedrone.</b>|$|E
5|$|In some countries, <b>mephedrone</b> is not {{specifically}} listed as illegal, but is controlled under legislation that makes compounds illegal {{if they are}} analogs of drugs already listed. In Australia during 2010, it was {{not specifically}} listed as prohibited, but the Australian Federal Police stated it is an analogue to methcathinone and therefore illegal. It is now listed as a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. In February 2010, 22 men were arrested in connection with importing <b>mephedrone.</b> By January 2011, every state in Australia, other than Victoria, had listed it as a controlled drug.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be {{produced}} by oxidising the ephedrine analogue 4-methylephedrine using potassium permanganate dissolved in sulfuric acid. Because 4-methylephedrine can be obtained in a specific enantiomeric form, <b>mephedrone</b> consisting of only one enantiomer can be produced. The danger associated with this method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mephedrone</b> {{is a white}} substance. It is sold most {{commonly}} as crystals or a powder, {{but also in the}} form of capsules or pills. It can have a distinctive odour, reported to range from a synthetic fishy smell to the smell of vanilla and bleach, stale urine, or electric circuit boards.|$|E
5|$|Neurotoxic {{effect of}} <b>mephedrone</b> on {{serotonin}} (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) systems remains controversial. Although some studies in animal models reported no damage to DA nerve endings in the striatum and no {{significant changes in}} brain monoamine levels, some others suggested a rapid reduction in 5-HT and DA transporter function. Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve endings at high ambient temperature. Oxidative stress cytotoxicity {{and an increase in}} frontal cortex lipid peroxidation were also reported.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the summer}} of 2009 and March 2010, the use of <b>mephedrone</b> grew rapidly in the UK, with it {{becoming}} readily available at music festivals, head shops and on the internet. A survey of Mixmag readers in 2009, found {{it was the fourth}} most popular street drug in the United Kingdom, behind cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy. The drug was used by a diverse range of social groups. Whilst the evidence was anecdotal, researchers, charity workers, teachers and users reported widespread and increasing use of the drug in 2009. The drug's rapid growth in popularity was believed to be related to both its availability and legality.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mephedrone</b> {{can come}} in the form of capsules, tablets or white powder that users may swallow, snort, inject, smoke or use rectally. When taken orally, users {{reported}} they could feel the effects within 15–45 minutes; when snorted, the effects were felt within minutes and peaked within half an hour. The effects last for between two and three hours when taken orally or nasally, but only half an hour if taken intravenously. It is sometimes sold mixed with methylone in a product called bubbles in the UK and also mixed with other cathinones, including ethcathinone, butylone, fluoromethcathinone and methedrone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mephedrone</b> can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacologically, {{bath salts}} usually contain a cathinone, {{typically}} methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), methylone or mephedrone; however, the chemical composition varies widely and products labeled {{with the same}} name may also contain derivatives of pyrovalerone or pipradrol. In Europe the main synthetic cathinone is <b>mephedrone,</b> whereas in the US MDPV is more common.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the BBC {{reported}} {{that use of}} MDMA had decreased in the UK in previous years. This {{may be due to}} increased seizures during use and decreased production of the precursor chemicals used to manufacture MDMA. Unwitting substitution with other drugs, such as <b>mephedrone</b> and methamphetamine, as well as legal alternatives to MDMA, such as BZP, MDPV, and methylone, are also thought to have contributed to its decrease in popularity.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction {{reported}} that there are 280 new legal drugs, known as legal highs, available in Europe. One of the best known, <b>mephedrone,</b> was banned in the United Kingdom in 2010. On November 24, 2010, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration announced it would use emergency powers to ban many synthetic cannabinoids within a month. An estimated 73 new psychoactive synthetic drugs appeared on the UK market in 2012. The response of the Home Office has been to create a temporary class drug order which bans the manufacture, import and supply but not the possession of named substances.|$|E
25|$|In {{part due}} to the global supply {{shortage}} of sassafras oil, substances that are sold as molly frequently contain no MDMA and instead contain methylone, ethylone, MDPV, <b>mephedrone,</b> or any other of the group of compounds commonly known as bath salts. Powdered MDMA ranges from pure MDMA to crushed tablets with 30–40% purity. MDMA tablets typically have low purity due to bulking agents that are added to dilute the drug and increase profits (e.g., lactose) and binding agents. Tablets sold as ecstasy sometimes contain 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), other amphetamine derivatives, caffeine, opiates, or painkillers. Some tablets contain little or no MDMA. The proportion of seized ecstasy tablets with MDMA-like impurities has varied annually and by country. The average content of MDMA in a preparation is 70 to 120mg with the purity having increased since the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, {{unconfirmed}} reports speculated {{about the}} role <b>mephedrone</b> has played {{in the deaths of}} several young people in the UK. By July 2010, <b>mephedrone</b> had been alleged to be involved in 52 fatalities in the UK, but detected in only 38 of these cases. Of the nine that coroners had finished investigating, two were caused directly by <b>mephedrone.</b> The first death reported to be caused by <b>mephedrone</b> use was that of 46-year-old, John Sterling Smith, who had underlying health problems and repeatedly injected the drug. A report in Forensic Science International in August 2010 stated <b>mephedrone</b> intoxication has been recorded as the cause of death in two cases in Scotland. Post mortem samples showed the concentration of <b>mephedrone</b> in their blood was 22mg/L in one case and 3.3mg/L in the other. The death of a teenager in the UK in November 2009 was widely reported as being caused by <b>mephedrone,</b> but a report by the coroner concluded she had died from natural causes. In March 2010, the deaths of two teenagers in Scunthorpe were widely reported by the media to be caused by <b>mephedrone.</b> Toxicology reports showed the teenagers had not taken any <b>mephedrone</b> and had {{died as a result of}} consuming alcohol and the heroin substitute methadone. According to Fiona Measham, a criminologist who is a member of the ACMD, the reporting of the unconfirmed deaths by newspapers followed [...] "the usual cycle of ‘exaggeration, distortion, inaccuracy and sensationalism'" [...] associated with the reporting of recreational drug use.|$|E
500|$|Doctors {{who treated}} a 15-year-old female {{suffering}} from <b>mephedrone</b> intoxication suggested in The Lancet that, like MDMA, <b>mephedrone</b> may promote serotonin-mediated release of antidiuretic hormone, resulting in hyponatraemia and an altered mental state. In another case, a 19-year-old male {{was admitted to}} hospital suffering from inflammation of the heart, 20 hours after taking one gram of <b>mephedrone.</b> The doctors treating the patient stated it was caused by either a direct toxic effect of <b>mephedrone</b> on the heart muscle, or by an immune response. One case of acquired methaemoglobinaemia, where a patient had [...] "bluish lips and fingers", has also been reported, after the user snorted one gram of <b>mephedrone.</b> The patient started to recover after arriving {{at the hospital and}} it was not necessary to administer any medication.|$|E
500|$|Professor Shiela Bird, a {{statistician}} at the Medical Research Council, {{suggested the}} ban of <b>mephedrone</b> {{may lead to}} more cocaine-related deaths. In {{the first six months}} of 2009, the number of cocaine-related deaths fell for the first time in four years, and fewer soldiers tested positive for cocaine in 2009 than in 2008. She suggested this may have been due to users switching to <b>mephedrone</b> from cocaine, but cautioned that before full figures are available for 2009 and 2010, it will be difficult to determine whether <b>mephedrone</b> saved lives, rather than cost them. Other supposedly legal drugs have filled the gap in the market since <b>mephedrone</b> was made illegal, including naphyrone (NRG-1) (since made illegal) and Ivory Wave, which has been found to contain MDPV, a compound made illegal at the same time as <b>mephedrone.</b> However, some products branded as Ivory Wave possibly do not contain MDPV. When tested, some products sold six weeks after <b>mephedrone</b> was banned, advertised as NRG-1, NRG-2 and MDAI, were found to be <b>mephedrone.</b> A Drugscope survey of drugs workers at the end of 2012 reported that <b>mephedrone</b> use was still widespread in the UK and that there increasing reports of problematic users. It was being taken as not only a [...] "poor man's cocaine" [...] but also amongst users of heroin and crack cocaine. Cases of intravenous use were also reported to be on the increase.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, as its use {{became more}} prevalent, many {{countries}} passed legislation prohibiting <b>mephedrone.</b> It became illegal in Croatia and Germany in January, followed by Romania and the Isle of Man in February. In March 2010, it {{was classified as}} an unregulated medicine in the Netherlands, making the sale and distribution of it illegal. The importation of <b>mephedrone</b> into the UK was banned on 29 March 2010. The next day, the ACMD in the UK published {{a report on the}} cathinones, including <b>mephedrone,</b> and recommended they be classified as Class B drugs. On 7 April 2010, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2010 was passed by parliament, making <b>mephedrone</b> and other substituted cathinones, Class B drugs from 16 April 2010. Prior to the ban taking effect, <b>mephedrone</b> was not covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. It was, though, an offence under the Medicines Act to sell it for human consumption, so it was often sold as [...] "plant food" [...] or [...] "bath salts", although it has no use as these products; this, too, was possibly illegal under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. In the US, similar descriptions have been used to describe <b>mephedrone,</b> as well as methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV). In May 2010, the Republic of Ireland made <b>mephedrone</b> illegal, followed by Belgium, Italy, Lithuania, France and Norway in June and Russia in July. In August 2010, Austria and Poland made it illegal and China announced it would be illegal as of 1 September 2010. <b>Mephedrone</b> had been reported to be used in Singapore in February 2010, but it was made illegal in November 2010. In December 2010, following the advice of the EMCDDA, <b>mephedrone</b> was made illegal throughout the EU, a move Switzerland also made shortly afterwards. Countries which have not already banned it, such as the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal, will need to change legislation to comply with the EU ruling. In Hungary, a government advisory body recommended <b>mephedrone</b> should be made illegal in August 2010, which was followed, making it illegal in January 2011; Spain followed in February 2011. Mexico, by decree, outlawed <b>mephedrone</b> as a substance [...] "with low or no therapeutical use which pose a serious threat to public health" [...] in 2014.|$|E
500|$|In Canada, <b>mephedrone</b> is not {{explicitly}} listed in any schedule of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, but [...] "amphetamines, their salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues" [...] {{are included in}} Section 19 of Schedule I of the act. Cathinone and methcathinone are listed in separate sections of Schedule III, while diethylpropion and pyrovalerone (also cathinones), are listed in separate sections of Schedule IV, each without language to capture analogues, isomers, etc. <b>Mephedrone</b> is considered a controlled substance by Health Canada. According to the Canadian Medical Association, <b>mephedrone</b> is grouped with other amphetamines as Schedule I controlled substances. There have been several media reports of the Canadian police seizing <b>mephedrone.</b> <b>Mephedrone</b> is also currently scheduled in the United States as of 2011. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) states, as an analogue of methcathinone, possession of <b>mephedrone</b> can be controlled by the Federal Analog Act, {{but according to the}} Los Angeles Times, this only applies if it is sold for human consumption. Several cities and states, such as New York state, have passed legislation to specifically list <b>mephedrone</b> as illegal, but in most areas it remained legal, so long as it is not sold for human consumption, so retailers described it as 'bath salts'. In September 2011, The DEA began using its emergency scheduling authority to temporarily control <b>mephedrone.</b> Except as authorised by law, this action made possessing and selling <b>mephedrone</b> or the products that contain it illegal in the US for at least one year while the DEA and the United States Department of Health and Human Services conduct further study. Control of these compounds became permanent on 9 July 2012, via passage of the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{one case}} of {{sympathomimetic}} toxicity {{was reported in}} the UK after a person took 0.2g of <b>mephedrone</b> orally, and after this did not achieve the desired effect, subcutaneously injected 3.8g mixed with water into his thighs. Shortly afterwards, the user [...] "developed palpitations, blurred tunnel vision, chest pressure and sweating". The patient was treated with 1mg of lorazepam and the sympathomimetic features decreased and the user was discharged within six hours of arrival. One case of serotonin syndrome has been reported, where the patient was already prescribed fluoxetine and olanzapine, and then took 40 tablets containing <b>mephedrone</b> in one night. He was treated with lorazepam and discharged 15 hours after admission. Both enantiomers of methcathinone, which differs only in the lack of the methyl group on the aryl ring when compared to <b>mephedrone,</b> {{have been shown to be}} toxic to rat dopamine neurons, and the S-enantiomer was also toxic against serotonin neurons. Simon Gibbons and Mire Zloh of the School of Pharmacy, University of London stated, based on the chemical similarities between methcathinone and <b>mephedrone,</b> [...] "it is highly likely that <b>mephedrone</b> will display neurotoxicity". However, Brunt and colleagues stated, [...] "extreme caution" [...] should be used when inferring the toxicity of <b>mephedrone</b> from methcathinone, noting some of the toxicity associated with methcathinone is due to manganese impurities related to its synthesis, rather than the compound itself. They concluded more experimental research is needed to investigate the toxicity of <b>mephedrone.</b>|$|E
500|$|A drug {{similar to}} <b>mephedrone,</b> {{containing}} cathinone, was sold legally in Israel from around 2004, {{under the name}} hagigat. When this was made illegal, the cathinone was modified and the new products were sold by the Israeli company, Neorganics. The products had names such as Neodoves pills, but the range was discontinued in January 2008 after the Israeli government made <b>mephedrone</b> illegal. The Psychonaut Research Project, an EU organisation that searches the internet for information regarding new drugs, first identified <b>mephedrone</b> in 2008. Their research suggested the drug first became available to purchase on the internet in 2007, when it was also discussed on internet forums. <b>Mephedrone</b> was first seized in France in May 2007, after police sent a tablet they assumed to be ecstasy to be analysed, with the discovery published in a paper titled [...] "Is 4-methylephedrone, an [...] "Ecstasy" [...] of the twenty-first century?" [...] <b>Mephedrone</b> was reported as having been sold as ecstasy in the Australian city of Cairns, along with ethylcathinone, in 2008. An annual survey of regular ecstasy users in Australia in 2010 found 21% of those surveyed had used <b>mephedrone,</b> with 17% having done so in the previous six months. The price they paid per gram varied from A$16 to $320.|$|E
