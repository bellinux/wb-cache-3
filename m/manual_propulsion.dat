25|$|Before engines became available, boats {{could be}} {{propelled}} manually {{or by the}} wind. Boats could be propelled by the wind by attaching sails to masts set upright in the boat. <b>Manual</b> <b>propulsion</b> {{could be done in}} shallow water by punting with a push pole, and in deeper water by paddling with a paddle or rowing with oars. The difference between paddling and rowing is that when rowing the oars have a mechanical connection with the boat, while when paddling the paddles are hand-held with no mechanical connection. Canoes were traditionally paddled, with the paddler facing the bow of the boat. Small boats that use oars are called rowboats, and the rower typically faces the stern.|$|E
50|$|A {{self-propelled}} manual wheelchair {{incorporates a}} frame, seat, {{one or two}} footplates (footrests) and four wheels: usually two caster wheels at the front and two large wheels at the back. There will generally also be a separate seat cushion. The larger rear wheels usually have push-rims of slightly smaller diameter projecting just beyond the tyre; these allow the user to manouevre the chair by pushing on them without requiring them to grasp the tyres. Manual wheelchairs generally have brakes that bear on the tyres of the rear wheels, however these are solely a parking brake and in-motion braking {{is provided by the}} user's palms bearing directly on the push-rims. As this causes friction and heat build-up, particularly on long downslopes, many wheelchair users will choose to wear padded wheelchair gloves. Manual wheelchairs often have two push handles at the upper rear of the frame to allow for <b>manual</b> <b>propulsion</b> by a second person, however many active wheelchair users will remove these to prevent unwanted pushing from people who believe they are being helpful.|$|E
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the design and {{configuration}} of manual wheelchairs have been indicated as factors that influence the biomechanics of the upper limbs during <b>manual</b> <b>propulsion.</b> From a kinematic point of view, the angles of the shoulder and elbow are particularly important, as they can reveal potentially harmful joint positions {{as well as providing}} information that can complement the analysis of the performance of the propulsion technique. This study investigated the influence of two different designs of manual wheelchairs (rigid frame and foldable frame) on the shoulder and elbow angles during <b>manual</b> <b>propulsion</b> in straightforward and turning trajectories. Eleven subjects without disabilities performed a propulsion protocol comprising a 15 -m straightforward sprint and a 2 -m radius turn in both clockwise and anticlockwise direction. During the propulsion tests, data of shoulder and elbow angles were collected using accelerometers. The results revealed that <b>manual</b> <b>propulsion</b> with a rigid frame wheelchair may provide more protection as it was related to lower maximum angles of shoulder extension and abduction and elbow flexion-extension range of motion in comparison with the foldable frame chair.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the frequency content of racing wheelchair propulsion motion data. The selection of the filter corner frequency in previous kinematic analyses of <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> was commonly based on gait literature. An estimate of the frequency separating the signal and the noise was determined to make recommendations for low-pass digital filters. The global (noncoordinate specific) cutoff frequency was 6 Hz. The directional cutoff frequencies were 5. 1, 3. 9, and 5. 6 Hz, in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior and medial-lateral directions, respectively. Recommendations for the corner frequencies of low-pass Butterworth digital filters based on the cutoff frequency are higher than the corner frequencies used in previous studies of <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> kinematic data.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{association}} between upper extremity (U/E) and trunk strength {{as well as}} seated postural stability with wheelchair propulsion performance has not been evaluated. Consequently, it remains unknown to what extent U/E and trunk strength and seated postural stability contribute to <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> performance. Gaining additional knowledge with regards to these modifiable contributors may provide guidance to rehabilitation professionals, particularly to physiotherapists, for selecting and prioritizing therapeutic interventions aiming to improve manual wheelchair performance, aside from those focusing on developing optimal propulsion techniquesObjectiveTo quantify the {{association between}} performance-based <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> tests (i. e., 20 -m propulsion test, slalom test, and 6 -min propulsion test), trunk and U/E strength as well as seated reaching capability to establish which trunk and U/E strength or seated reaching capability measures best predict performance on timed <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> tests completed at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation by individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI). MethodsFifteen individuals with a SCI performed the 20 -meter, slalom and 6 -minute wheelchair propulsion tests within 72 hours prior to discharge from comprehensive inpatient SCI rehabilitation. Trunk and U/E strength along with seated reaching capability with unilateral hand support were also measured. The relationships between the wheelchair propulsion tests and the other variables were assessed using bi-variate correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. ResultsThe 20 -meter propulsion-maximum velocity, slalom and 6 -minute propulsion tests were moderately or strongly correlated with anterior and lateral inclination trunk strength, seated anterior reaching distance {{and the majority of}} shoulder, elbow and handgrip strength measures. Shoulder adductor strength-weakest side explained 53 % of the variance on the 20 -meter propulsion test-maximum velocity. Shoulder adductor strength-strongest side and forward seated reaching distance explained 71 % of the variance on the slalom test. Handgrip strength explained 52 % of the variance on the 6 -minute propulsion test. ConclusionsU/E strength, especially of the shoulder adductors and handgrip, and forward seated reaching capability may be important determinants and predictors of performance during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> tests.

However, <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> can lead to upper-limb pain and can be very inefficient. This has led investigators to apply biomechanics {{to the study of}} wheelchair use. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the frequency content of the motion of both hands during two speeds of wheelchair propulsion, (2) to obtain the filter frequencies necessary to remove noise from wheelchair motion data, and (3) to provide signal-to-noise ratio data for wheelchair kinematics. The {{participants in this study were}} a random sample of manual wheelchair users with paraplegia caused by spinal cord injury. Subjects propelled their personal wheelchairs on a computer-controlled dynamometer at speeds of 0. 9 m/s and 1. 8 m/s. Motion data were collected at 60 Hz with the use of a commercial infrared marker-based system. The main outcome measures were arm motions and noise frequency spectra, filter cutoff frequencies, and signal-to-noise ratio. Our results indicate that there is no useful signal power above 6 Hz during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> at the speeds that we analyzed. In many cases, there was no useful signal power above 4 Hz. This would indicate that the frequency content of <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> is similar to that of human gait. The mean signal-to-noise ratio varied from a high of 91 dB to a low of 21. 8 dB. The signal-to-noise ratio was greatest in the x direction (along the line of progression) and lowest in the z direction (medial-lateral). <b>Manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> kinematic data should be low-pass filtered at approximately 6 Hz for speeds at or below 1. 8 m/s.

40|$|Study design: This is an {{experimental}} design. Objectives: This {{study examined the}} association between rates of energy expenditure (that is, oxygen consumption (VO 2)) and accelerometer counts (that is, vector magnitude (VM)) {{across a range of}} speeds during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> on a motor-driven treadmill. Such an association allows for the generation of cutoff points for quantifying the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion.</b> Setting: The study was conducted in the University Laboratory. Methods: Twenty-four manual wheelchair users completed a 6 -min period of seated rest and three 6 -min periods of <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> on a motor-driven wheelchair treadmill. The 6 -min periods of wheelchair propulsion corresponded with three treadmill speeds (1. 5, 3. 0 and 4. 5 mph) that elicited a range of physical activity intensities. Participants wore a portable metabolic unit and accelerometers on both wrists. Primary outcome measures included steady-state VO 2 and VM, and the strength of association between VO 2 and VM was based on the multiple correlation and squared multiple correlation coefficients from linear regression analyses. Results: Strong linear associations were established between VO 2 and VM for the left (R= 0. 93 ± 0. 44; R 2 = 0. 87 ± 0. 19), right (R= 0. 95 ± 0. 37; R 2 = 0. 90 ± 0. 14) and combined (R= 0. 94 ± 0. 38; R 2 = 0. 88 ± 0. 15) accelerometers. The linear relationship between VO 2 and VM for the left, right and combined wrists yielded cutoff points for MVPA of 3659 ± 1302, 3630 ± 1403 and 3644 ± 1339 counts min - 1, respectively.

40|$|Studies of <b>manual</b> {{wheelchair}} <b>propulsion</b> often assume {{bilateral symmetry}} to simplify data collection, processing and analysis. However, {{the validity of}} this assumption is unclear. Most investigations of wheelchair propulsion symmetry have been limited by a relatively small sample size and a focus on a single propulsion condition (e. g., level propulsion at self-selected speed). The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate bilateral symmetry during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> in a large group of subjects across different propulsion conditions. Three-dimensional kinematics and handrim kinetics along with spatiotemporal variables were collected and processed from 80 subjects with paraplegia while propelling their wheelchairs on a stationary ergometer during three different conditions: level propulsion at their self-selected speed (free), level propulsion at their fastest comfortable speed (fast), and propulsion on an 8 % grade at their level, self-selected speed (graded). All kinematic variables had significant side-to-side differences, primarily in the graded condition. Push angle was the only spatiotemporal variable with a significant side-to-side difference, and only during the graded condition. No kinetic variables had significant side-to-side differences. The magnitudes of the kinematic differences were low, with only one difference exceeding five degrees. With differences of such small magnitude, the bilateral symmetry assumption appears to be reasonable during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> in subjects without significant upper-extremity pain or impairment.

40|$|Background/Objective: As {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made in laboratory-based assessment of <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> biomechanics, the necessity to translate this knowledge into new clinical tools and treatment programs becomes imperative. The objective of this study was to describe the development of a <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> training program aimed to promote the development of an efficient propulsion technique among long-term manual wheelchair users. Methods: Motor learning theory principles were applied to the design of biomechanical feedback-based learning software, which allows for random discontinuous real-time visual presentation of key spatio-temporal and kinetic parameters. This software was used to train a long-term wheelchair user on a dynamometer during 3 low-intensity wheelchair propulsion training sessions over a 3 -week period. Biomechanical measures were recorded with a SmartWheel during over ground propulsion on a 50 -m level tile surface at baseline and 3 months after baseline. Results: Training software was refined and administered to a participant who was able to improve his propulsion technique by increasing contact angle while simultaneously reducing stroke cadence, mean resultant force, peak and mean moment out of plane, and peak rate of rise of force applied to the pushrim after training. Conclusions: The proposed propulsion training protocol may lead to favorable changes in <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> technique.

Design: Case series. Setting: Six research institutions that collect kinetic wheelchair propulsion data and contribute that data to an international data pool. Participants: Subjects {{with spinal cord injury}} (N= 128). Interventions: Subjects propelled a wheelchair from a stationary position to a self-selected velocity across a hard tile surface, a low pile carpet, and up an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant ramp. Unilateral kinetic data were obtained from subjects using a force and moment sensing pushrim. Main Outcome Measures: Differences in self-selected velocity, peak resultant force, push frequency, and stroke length across all surfaces, relationship between (1) weight-normalized peak resultant force and self-selected velocity and (2) push frequency and self-selected velocity. Results: Graphical references were generated for potential clinical use based on the relation between body weight-normalized peak resultant force, push frequency, and velocity. Self-selected velocity decreased (ramp carpet > tile), and push frequency and stroke length remained unchanged when compared across the different surfaces.

The purpose of this study was to determine if selected seat cushions and back supports minimize the transmission of vibrations during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion.</b> Ten unimpaired participants traversed an activities of daily living course using four seat cushions and four back supports. Vibrations were measured using triaxial accelerometers. The time domain and frequency domain transmissibility was used to determine if differences exist among seat cushions and back supports. Differences were found among the four seat cushions and four back supports. Seat cushion and back support manufacturers should concentrate on single-event shocks and repeated shocks, as opposed to oscillatory motions and self-generated vibrations, because the vibrations generated by these events tend to reside in the range of frequencies most sensitive to humans. Vibrations in this range of frequencies have the greatest effect on the transmission of whole-body vibration during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion.</b> Differences among the seat cushions and back supports appear to be due to the seat cushion/back support design and postural support.

To {{quantify}} {{the association between}} performance-based <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> tests (20 [*]m propulsion test, slalom test, and 6 min propulsion test), trunk and upper extremity (U/E) strength, and seated reaching capability and to establish which ones of these variables best predict performance at these tests. Methods. 15 individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) performed the three wheelchair propulsion tests prior to discharge from inpatient SCI rehabilitation. Trunk and U/E strength and seated reaching capability with unilateral hand support were also measured. Bivariate correlation and multiple linear regression analyses allowed determining the best determinants and predictors, respectively. Results.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} the direction of the <b>propulsion</b> force in <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> can be interpreted {{as a result of the}} balance between the mechanical task requirements and the driver's biomechanical possibilities. We quantify the balance at the joint level in the form of an effect-cost criterion, from which we predict the force direction that results in an optimal compromise. Kinematic and dynamic data were collected from nine habitual wheelchair users driving at four velocities (0. 83, 1. 11, 1. 39, 1. 67 m/s) and three external power levels (10, 20, 30 W). Experimental data and predictions are in good agreement in the middle and final part of the push; the effect-cost value in this region approximates the achievable maximum. Early in the push the effect-cost criterion predicts an upwards propulsion force whereas the experimental force is downwards, the difference probably being mainly attributable to the force generation dynamics of the muscles. As a result of the geometric features of large-rim manual wheelchairs, the mechanically required and biomechanically preferred force directions are not in accordance during a substantial part of the push, making even the best compromise a poor one.

40|$|Purpose: The Objective of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of rehabilitation on physical capacity, mechanical efficiency of <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion,</b> and performance of standardized activities of daily living (ADL). Methods: Nineteen recently injured subjects with spinal cord injuries were tested on a wheelchair ergometer (maximal isometric strength, sprint and maximal power output, and peak oxygen uptake) and during standardized ADL (physical strain and performance time) at the beginning (t 1) and at the end (t 2) of the active rehabilitation period. Results: Paired Student t-tests showed significant increases for maximal isometric strength (24 %, P < 0. 01), sprint power output (17 %, P < 0. 001) and maximal power output (38 %, P < 0. 001). Peak oxygen uptake showed no statistically significant improvement (11 %, P = 0. 06). Mechanical efficiency of submaximal wheelchair exercise was significantly higher at t 2 (9. 0 %) compared to t 1 (7. 9 %, P < 0. 01). No significant differences were found for physical strain during ADL, except for passing a door (P < 0. 05). Performance time showed a significant decrease for most tasks.

40|$|Background: Inverse dynamic {{methods have}} been widely used to {{estimate}} joint loads during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion.</b> However, the interpretation of 3 D net joint moments and powers is not always straightforward. It has been suggested to use joint coordinate systems (expression of joint moment on anatomical axes) and the 3 D angle between joint moment and angular velocity vectors (propulsion, resistance or stabilization joint configuration) for a better understanding of joint dynamics. Methods: Nine spinal cord injured subjects equipped with reflective markers propelled in a wheelchair with an instrumented wheel. Inverse dynamic results were interpreted using joint coordinate systems, 3 D joint power and the 3 D angle between the joint moment and joint angular velocity vectors at the three upper limb joints. The 3 D angle was used to determine if the joints were predominantly driven (angle close to 0 or 180 degrees) or stabilized (angle close to 90). Findings: The wrist and elbow joints are mainly in a stabilization configuration (angle close to 90) with a combination of extension and ulnar deviation moments and an adduction moment respectively. The shoulder is in a propulsion configuration, but close to stabilization (angle hardly below 60) with a combination of flexion and internal rotation moments. Interpretation: Stabilization configuration at the joints could partly explain the low mechanical efficiency of <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> and could give insight about injury risk at the wrist, elbow and shoulder joints...|$|R

Analysis of variance was used to compare peak and average pressures under static and dynamic conditions. SETTING: Human locomotion laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Ten subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI) and 10 individuals with no disabilities. INTERVENTIONS: <b>Manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> on a stationary wheelchair ergometer at the subject's maximum propulsion speed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seat interface pressure and the 3 -dimensional position of the pelvis were measured with a pressure mat and an optical motion analysis system. RESULTS: During wheelchair sprinting, the ischia were located at 19. 2 +/- 11. 7 mm behind the corresponding peak pressure locations. The anteroposterior rocking of the pelvis was 11. 2 degrees and 5. 2 degrees for the normal and SCI group, respectively. The average interface pressure over the ischial tuberosity area was lower under dynamic conditions. It was also observed in the SCI group that there was a concentration of high-pressure gradients around the peak pressure areas of the buttock during dynamic propulsion. CONCLUSION: Peak pressure locations did not concur exactly with the ischial tuberosities during propulsion. The movements of the ischial bone and the cyclic loading imposed on the tissue underneath the ischial tuberosities during dynamic conditions may have implications for the etiology of decubitus ulcers.

Primary variables that were compared between the 2 wheelchairs were participants' mean steady-state oxygen consumption, ventilation, heart rate, mean stroke frequency, and maximum upper-extremity joint ROM. When using the PAPAW, participants showed a significant (P <. 05) decrease in mean oxygen consumption and ventilation throughout all trials. Mean heart rate was significantly lower when using the PAPAW for the high resistance trial. Stroke frequency was significantly lower when using the PAPAW for the slight and moderate resistances. Overall joint ROM was significantly lower when using the PAPAW. For subjects with tetraplegia, PAPAWs reduce the energy demands, stroke frequency, and overall joint ROM when compared with traditional <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion.</b> © 2004 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Manual</b> {{wheelchair}} <b>propulsion</b> is a straining form of ambulation, {{both for}} the cardio-respiratory {{as well as the}} musculo-skeletal system. Wheelchair locomotion implies arm work in every other activity in daily life. Compared to leg work, wheelchair arm work is much less efficient and more straining, and subsequently leads to a lower work capacity 1, 2. Underlying pathology may further influence performance capacity, as is illustrated by Mukherjee et al 3 in the comparison of wheelchair dependent subjects with non-wheelchair users in this issue. In addition, hand rim wheelchair propulsion- {{the most common form of}} manual wheelchair ambulation in the western world- is overall a very inefficient mode of exercise due to the coupling/decoupling of the han...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare four cushions, a Jay Active (JA), and PinDot Comfort-Mate (PDCM), a Roho Low Profile (RLP), and a Varilite Solo (VS), based on their ability to {{minimize}} the vibrations transmitted from the wheelchair to the individual during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> (MWP). Accelerometers measured the vibrations at the wheelchair/cushion interface and at the individual’s head as the individual traversed an obstacle course. The VS performed the best, followed by the PDCM, the RLP and finally the JA, suggesting that a combination of foam and air minimizes the transmission of vibration. Cushions designed for static pressure relief may not perform well in other areas potentially related to secondary injuries such as vibration...|$|R

40|$|The {{high demand}} {{on the upper}} {{extremity}} during manual wheelchair use contributes to a high prevalence of shoulder pathology in people with spinal cord injury. The overall purpose of this thesis was to investigate shoulder muscle recruitment patterns and wheelchair kinetics in able-bodied participants over a range of daily activities and mobility tasks requiring <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion.</b> With a complete understanding of the muscle recruitment patterns, physiotherapists and wheelchair users can improve rehabilitation protocols and wheelchair propulsion performance to prevent shoulder pathology and maintain comfort during locomotion. Motor unit recruitment patterns were examined first during isometric and isotonic contractions to determine if spectral properties from EMG and MMG {{could be related to}} the different motor units in biceps brachii by using wavelet techniques coupled with principle component analysis. The results indicated that motor unit recruitment patterns can be indicated by the spectral properties of the EMG and MMG signals. EMG activity of 7 shoulder muscles was recorded with surface electrodes on 15 able-bodied participants over a range of <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> activities. Wavelet and principle component analysis was used to simultaneously decompose the signals into time and frequency domain. There are three main conclusions that can be drawn: 1) Uphill and faster speed (1. 6 m/s) propulsion required higher activity levels in the shoulder muscles and greater resultant joint force than did slow speed propulsion on the ergometer (0. 9 m/s), thus potentially resulting in shoulder pathology. 2) Prolonged wheelchair propulsion and greater muscle activity may result in fatigue and play a factor in the development of shoulder pain and pathology over time. 3) The instructed semicircular pattern has a positive effect on shoulder muscle recruitment patterns. Further investigations need to focus on a systematic integrated data collection and analysis of kinematic, kinetic, and electromyography (EMG) data from people with spinal cord injuries...|$|R
40|$|Wheelchair {{propulsion}} {{has been}} reported to be responsible for musculoskeletal pain in the upper extremities. Epidemiological studies have shown a high prevalence of shoulder complaints in paraplegic and quadriplegic spinal cord injured (SCI) people. It has been argued that the high incidence of shoulder complaints in SCI {{was the result of the}} weight&# 8208;bearing or propulsion function of the upper extremity in those subjects. This work aimed at proposing an alternative wheelchair propulsion technique based on the levers' system.

40|$|Abstract This {{technical}} note illustrates {{that some of}} the dif-ferences that have been reported regarding wheelchair propul-sion {{may be due to the}} methods used to calculate key variables. Wheelchair ambulation is a very important form of locomotion that lacks a standard pushrim force and moment analysis sys-tem. We have developed tools for analyzing upper limb biome-chanics during <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion.</b> Among the tools is a system that allows the direct measurement of global coor-dinate forces FX, F y, F, and corresponding moments. The ana-lytical techniques presented here allow calculation of radial (Fr) and tangential (Fr) forces, the determination of point of force application (PFA), and the moment applied by the hand (M h,). Our results show that the PFA can be calculated from kinetic data. Comparison of the PFA to the second metacarpopha-langeal (MP) joint, calculated from kinematic data and used i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Wheelchair {{locomotion}} is {{an important}} form of mobility for many individuals with spinal cord injury. How-ever, <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> can lead to upper-limb pain and can be very inefficient. This has led investigators to apply biomechanics {{to the study of}} wheelchair use. The objec-tives of this study were (1) to determine the frequency content of the motion of both hands during two speeds of wheelchair propulsion, (2) to obtain the filter frequencies necessary to remove noise from wheelchair motion data, and (3) to provide signal-to-noise ratio data for wheelchair kinematics. The par-ticipants in this study were a random sample of manual wheel-chair users with paraplegia caused by spinal cord injury. Subjects propelled their personal wheelchairs on a computer-controlled dynamometer at speeds of 0. 9 m/s and 1. 8 m/s. Motion data were collected at 60 Hz {{with the use of a}} commer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} validation of the OptiPush Biofeedback System, a commercially available, instrumented wheel system that records handrim biomechanics and provides stroke-by-stroke biofeedback and targeting for 11 propulsion variables. Testing of the system revealed accurate measurement of wheel angle (0. 02 % error), wheel speed (0. 06 % error), and handrim loads. The maximum errors in static force and torque measurements were 3. 80 % and 2. 05 %, respectively. Measured forces were also found to be highly linear (0. 985. 998). Dynamic measurements of planar forces (and) and axle torque also had low error (− 0. 96 N to 0. 83 N for force and 0. 10 [*]Nm to 0. 14 [*]Nm for torque) and were highly correlated (r >. 986) with expected force and torque values. Overall, the OptiPush Biofeedback System provides accurate measurement of wheel dynamics and handrim biomechanics and may be {{a useful tool for}} improving <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Several {{methods are}} {{available}} for computing {{the location of the}} point of force application (PFA) in <b>manual</b> wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> using kinetic data. We compared five different techniques for computing the PFA location in analysis of data from five wheelchair users propelling their own wheel-chairs using their normal propulsion style. The effects of the assumptions used in the calculations on the resulting location of the PFA, handrim force and moment components, and mechanical efficiency (e) were quantified. When kinetic data were used to locate the PFA, the most consistent and stable results were obtained using the assumptions that components of the handrim moment about the anteriorly directed and vertical-ly directed axes were negligible. Some assumptions led to unsolvable equations at points during the propulsion cycle, demonstrating that they were inappropriate. All PFA values cal-culated with kinetic data were unstable {{at the beginning and end}} of the propulsion phase. While differences exist due to individual technique, assuming handrim moment components about the anterior-posterior, vertical, and/or both axes resulted in the most representative results...|$|R
