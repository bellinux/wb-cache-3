25|$|LaHaye {{believed}} that the Illuminati is secretly engineering world affairs. In Rapture Under Attack he wrote:I <b>myself</b> <b>have</b> been a forty-five year student of the satanically-inspired, centuries-old conspiracy to use government, education, and media to destroy every vestige of Christianity within our society and establish a new world order. Having read at least fifty books on the Illuminati, I am convinced that it exists and can be blamed for many of man's inhumane actions against his fellow man {{during the past two}} hundred years.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} wonder {{in the region}} which is called Ercing. A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; {{and the name of}} the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it {{sometimes}} six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you will not find it to have the same length – and I <b>myself</b> <b>have</b> put this to the test.|$|E

500|$|For several judges, {{the use of}} Sheldon's {{statement}} in Parliament was a deciding factor. In the initial hearing, Lords Bridge, Browne-Wilkinson and Oliver were all in favour of dismissing Hart's case, later changing their mind with the new evidence available to them.

But subsequently, Cissé was linked with a return to the English Premier League with Blackburn Rovers, Wigan Athletic, Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth and Bolton Wanderers said to be interested. Manchester City had their approach for Cissé rejected by Marseille boss, who said, [...] "He is wanted, that is for sure, I <b>myself</b> <b>have</b> been approached by Manchester City (about Cissé) but I turned it down categorically". On 26 January 2008, Cissé scored a hat-trick in Marseille's 6–1 win against Caen.|$|E

Kirk, {{the former}} {{commanding}} officer of the USS Enterprise and an Admiral at Starfleet headquarters, who re-assumes command of the Enterprise, and with it, temporary demotion to his previous rank, captain. When asked during a March 1978 press conference {{about what it would}} be like to reprise the role, Shatner said, [...] "An actor brings to a role not only the concept of a character but his own basic personality, things that he is, and both Leonard Nimoy and <b>myself</b> <b>have</b> changed over the years, to a degree at any rate, and we will bring that degree of change inadvertently to the role we recreate." ...|$|E

The angsty stuff generally comes from him. The poppy, hard stuff comes from me." [...] Esch commented in 1994, [...] "Sascha and myself are different, of course. But that's why we can still make things happen. Our best and worst qualities are contrary. To put it simply, he's more organized and stable, I'm more complicated and abstract." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbette was {{championed by}} avant garde artist Jean Cocteau. Cocteau wrote in 1923 to Belgian friend and critic Paul Collaer: [...] "Next week in Brussels, you'll see a music-hall act called 'Barbette' {{that has been}} keeping me enthralled for a fortnight. The young American who does this wire and trapeze act is a great actor, an angel, and he has become the friend to all of us. Go and see him ... and tell {{everybody}} that he is no mere acrobat in women's clothes, nor just a graceful daredevil, {{but one of the}} most beautiful things in the theatre. Stravinsky, Auric, poets, painters, and I <b>myself</b> <b>have</b> seen no comparable display of artistry on the stage since Nijinsky." [...] To other friends he wrote [...] "Your great loss for 1923 was Barbette – a terrific act at the Casino de Paris...Ten unforgettable minutes. A theatrical masterpiece. An angel, a flower, a bird." ...|$|E
500|$|Through Bowie's {{connections}} {{because of}} his marriage and his fluency in Spanish, the predominantly Mexican population of San Antonio often furnished him with information about {{the movements of the}} Mexican army. After learning that Santa Anna had 4,500troops and was heading for the city, Bowie wrote several letters to the provisional government asking for help in defending the Alamo, especially [...] "men, money, rifles, and cannon powder". In another letter, to Governor Smith, he reiterated his view that [...] "the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Béxar {{out of the hands of}} the enemy. It serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march toward the Sabine." [...] The letter to Smith ended, [...] "Colonel Neill and <b>myself</b> <b>have</b> come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy." ...|$|E

500|$|Fewer than 100 Texian {{soldiers}} {{remained at}} the Alamo Mission in Béxar, {{under the command of}} Colonel James C. Neill. [...] Unable to spare the number of men necessary to mount a successful defense of the sprawling facility, in January Houston sent Bowie with 30 men to remove the artillery [...] and destroy the complex. In a letter to Governor Smith, Bowie argued that [...] "the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Béxar {{out of the hands of}} the enemy. It serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march towards the Sabine." [...] The letter to Smith ended, [...] "Colonel Neill and <b>myself</b> <b>have</b> come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy." [...] Few reinforcements were authorized; cavalry officer William B. Travis arrived in Béxar with 30men on February 3 and five days later, a small group of volunteers arrived, including the famous frontiersman Davy Crockett. On February 11, Neill left to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies. [...] In his absence, Travis and Bowie shared command.|$|E
500|$|Houston {{could not}} spare {{the number of}} men {{necessary}} to mount a successful defense. Instead, he sent Colonel James Bowie with 30 men to remove the artillery from the Alamo and destroy the complex. Bowie was unable to transport the artillery since the Alamo garrison lacked the necessary draft animals. Neill soon persuaded Bowie that the location held strategic importance. In a letter to Governor Henry Smith, Bowie argued that [...] "the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Béxar {{out of the hands of}} the enemy. It serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march towards the Sabine." [...] The letter to Smith ended, [...] "Colonel Neill and <b>myself</b> <b>have</b> come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy."

500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. I think a lot of people, including <b>myself,</b> <b>have</b> come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E

2500|$|After {{first meeting}} in 1975, Norris {{was in a}} {{long-term}} relationship with Israeli activist Ezra Nawi {{for a number of}} years until 1985.
