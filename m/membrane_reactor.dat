40|$|<b>Membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> are {{currently}} under extensive research and development. Hardly any concept, however, is realized yet in practice. Frequently, forgotten as <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> are electro-catalytic <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> where electrodes perform chemical conversations and membranes separate {{the locations of}} conversion. We review first a mature electromembrane technology: the chlor-alkali electrolysis. A second example is the polymer-electrolyte fuel cells (FC) as an emerging technology, which carries the potential to dramatically change society¿s energy infrastructure. Finally, we extensively describe a technology where the membrane itself is catalytically effective, splitting water into protons and hydroxyl ions: bipolar ion-exchange membrane technology...|$|R
40|$|<b>Membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> are {{a modern}} {{configuration}} which integrates reaction and separation units in one vessel {{and results in}} a tremendous degree of process intensification. Application of <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> for hydrogen production has been widely studied in literature because membranes with infinite permselectivity towards hydrogen are well known since two centuries. On the other hand, the request of ultra-pure hydrogen is constantly increasing mainly due to the advances in fuel cells. For this reason, different patents have also been awarded in this field. In this review, the main aspects related to the patents on hydrogen production through <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> have been reported, with {{particular attention to the}} future trend on the field...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{fields of}} application of biocatalytic <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> have widened considerably in recent years. Although biocatalytic <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors,</b> in general, {{are yet to}} achieve broad industrial application, in the not too far future {{they are expected to}} play a major role, not only for the production, transformation and valorization of raw materials but also for environmental remediations. This chapter comprehensively reviews the laboratory scale studies which demonstrate the potential of biocatalytic <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> in wastewater treatment applications. Studies reponed in the literature, however, serve as proof of concept only. Issues {{that need to be addressed}} in order to achieve scale-up of such systems have been discussed in this chapter...|$|R
50|$|A <b>membrane</b> <b>reactor</b> is a {{physical}} device that combines a chemical conversion process with a membrane separation process to add reactants or remove products of the reaction.|$|E
50|$|Making a gaseous {{product in}} a <b>membrane</b> <b>reactor</b> {{generally}} affects {{the way that}} pressure affects the extent of reaction at thermodynamic pseudo-equilibrium. In an ordinary flow reactor, {{the composition of the}} exhaust gas is determined by the composition of the feed gas and the extent of reaction. As a result, at pseudo-equilibrium, the extent of reaction is entirely determined by the feed composition and the exhaust equilibrium constant, the latter being determined by the temperature and pressure of the exhaust. In a <b>membrane</b> <b>reactor,</b> the partial pressure of the components at psueudo-equilibrium are not uniquely determined by the total pressure, exit temperature, and feed composition. There is also a significant (and beneficial) effect that derives from the controlled removal of a product or addition of reactant.|$|E

The project aim to create {{possibilities for the}} use of cheaper, less reactive, raw materials by using <b>membrane</b> <b>reactor</b> technology. CARENA brings together companies and institutes from 8 European countries. European chemical companies as Akzo Nobel and Arkema ensure a strong industrial leadership to the project.|$|E
40|$|<b>Membranes</b> and <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> {{for pure}} {{hydrogen}} production are widely investigated {{not only because}} of the important application areas of hydrogen, but especially because mechanically and chemically stable membranes with high perm-selectivity towards hydrogen are available and are continuously further improved in terms of stability and hydrogen flux. <b>Membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> are (multiphase) reactors integrating catalytic reactions (generally reforming and water gas shift reactions for hydrogen production) and separation through membranes in a single unit. This combination of process steps results in a high degree of process integration/intensification, with accompanying benefits in terms of increased process or energy efficiencies and reduced reactor or catalyst volume. The aim of this review is to highlight recent advances in hydrogen selective membranes (from palladium-based to silica and proton conductors) along with the advances for the different types of <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> available (from packed bed to fluidized bed, from micro-reactors to bio-membrane reactors). In addition, the application of <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> for hydrogen production from different feedstock is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of Co-Pt/gamma-Al 2 O 3 catalytic <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation has been explored. The results of hydrogenation in four <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> with different configurations {{indicate that the}} effect of the gas transport limitation {{is more important than the}} liquid diffusion limitation. The membrane with the catalytic layer situated on the gas side shows the highest activity due to the minimized gas transport limitation...|$|R
50|$|Porous glasses {{can be used}} as <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> as well, {{again because}} of their high mechanical, thermal and {{chemical}} stability. <b>Membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> can improve conversion of limited balance reactions, while one reaction product is removed by a selective membrane. For example, in the decomposition of hydrogen sulfide on a catalyst in a glass capillary, the conversion by reaction was higher with glass capillary than without.|$|R
5000|$|The other process {{features}} an integrated reaction chamber and separation membrane, a <b>membrane</b> <b>reactor.</b> In this, relatively new approach, the reaction chamber {{is made to}} contain high-temperature, hydrogen-permeable membranes that can be formed of refractory metals, palladium alloys, or a PdAg-coated ceramic. The hydrogen is thereby separated out of the reaction chamber as the reaction proceeds, This purifies the hydrogen and, as the reaction continues, increases both the reaction rate {{and the amount of}} hyrogen extracted.|$|E
5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{approach to}} solar thermal hydrogen production is proposed by H2 Power Systems. Material constraints {{due to the}} required high temperatures above 2200 °C are reduced by {{the design of a}} <b>membrane</b> <b>reactor</b> with simultaneous extraction of hydrogen and oxygen that exploits a defined thermal gradient and the fast diffusion of hydrogen. With concentrated sunlight as heat source and only water in the reaction chamber, the produced gases are very clean with the only possible contaminant being water. A [...] "Solar Water Cracker" [...] with a concentrator of about 100 m² can produce almost one kilogram of hydrogen per sunshine hour.|$|E
50|$|Ultra pure hydrogen, {{generated}} from these reactions, is extracted {{by use of}} thin dense metallic membranes that are 100% selective to hydrogen. The mechanism of the transport is the separation of hydrogen into protons and electrons at the surface and recombination on the filtrate or raffinate side. Other high temperature membranes are being considered for hydrogen generation where the purity requirements are not as great; for example for pollution mitigation for coal power generation. Hydrogen, produced from coal gas in the <b>membrane</b> <b>reactor</b> {{would be used for}} power generation, while the carbon dioxide would remain at high pressure for carbon capture and storage.|$|E

40|$|<b>Membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> are {{generally}} applied in high temperature reactions (> 400 °C). In {{the field of}} fine chemical synthesis, however, much milder conditions {{are generally}} applicable and polymeric membranes were applied without their damage. The successful use of <b>membranes</b> in <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> is primary the result of two developments concerning: (i) membrane materials and (ii) membrane structures. The selection of a suited material and preparation technique depends on the application the membrane {{is to be used}} in. In this chapter a review of up to date literature about polymers and configuration catalyst/ membranes used in some recent polymeric <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> is given.

50|$|The biofilm {{membrane}} filtration method {{is used to}} remove harmful chemical by-products, such as NH4+-N, total nitrogen, and dissolved organic matter, that could form from disinfection processes. Biofilm Pre-treatment is a necessary step for water treatment {{in many parts of}} world due to its low operation cost and effectiveness at pollutant removal. In this process microorganisms remove contaminants in raw and wastewater that are harmful to humans, but nutrients to them. Bio-diatomite dynamic <b>membrane</b> <b>reactor</b> filtration combines dynamic membrane technology for wastewater treatment, and microbial colonies that form diatomite particles to purify water. These methods are under development in China as part of addressing the country's pollution problems.|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{combined}} role of mass and heat dispersion {{effects on the}} performance of adiabatic large-scale <b>membrane</b> <b>reactor</b> modules is investigated.

40|$|The {{dehydrogenation}} of propane and isobutane was {{studied in}} hydrogen permselective packed bed <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors</b> and conventional packed bed reactors. Two {{different types of}} developmental membranes were investigated: sol-gel derived silica-based membranes and a pure palladium thin film supported by a porous ceramic substrate. The palladium membranes deactivated and eventually failed when exposed to both isobutane and propane dehydrogenation temperatures above 773 K. Moderate improvements in propylene and isobutylene yields were obtained with the silica-based <b>membrane</b> <b>reactors.</b> An isobutylene yield of 48 mole percent was obtained at a {{liquid hourly space velocity}} (LHSV) of 1. 8 and temperature of 798 K compared to a yield of 39 percent in a conventional reactor operated with the same flow rate.
