2500|$|According to the Heritage Foundation, a {{conservative}} American think tank, oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China's biggest supplier of oil. “China has extended three multibillion dollar {{lines of credit}} to the Angolan government; two loans of $2 billion from China Exim Bank, one in 2004, the second in 2007, {{as well as one}} loan in 2005 of $2.9 billion from China International Fund Ltd.” Growing oil revenues have also created opportunities for corruption: according to a recent Human Rights Watch report, 32billion US dollars disappeared from government accounts from 2007 to 2010. Furthermore, Sonangol, the state run oil company, has control of 51% of Cabinda’s oil. Due to this <b>market</b> <b>control</b> the company ends up determining the profit given to the government and the taxes paid. The council of foreign affairs states that the World Bank mentioned that Sonangol [...] " [...] is a taxpayer, it carries out quasi-fiscal activities, it invests public funds, and, as concessionaire, it is a sector regulator. This multifarious work programme creates conflicts of interest and characterises a complex relationship between Sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state." ...|$|E

40|$|The papers {{presented}} here {{were prepared for}} a Workshop on Price and <b>Marketing</b> <b>Controls</b> in Kenya, held at the Institute for Development Studies from 26 to 29 March 1979. The purpose of the workshop was to evaluate price and <b>marketing</b> <b>controls</b> in Kenya, and bring together parties influencing and/or affected by the price and <b>marketing</b> <b>control</b> policies. The {{first part of the}} workshop was devoted to a search for a theoretical framework for analysing price and <b>marketing</b> <b>controls,</b> including illegal activities which frustrate the objectives of those policies. A paper by the Central Bureau of Statistics outlines consumer price data collection in rural and urban areas and how price controls affect the accuracy of the cost of living indices. Position papers from the Trade Onion movement, the manufacturers' association, the Kenya Consumers' Organisation and the Chamber of Commerce show the conflict of interests and diversity of views on price and <b>marketing</b> <b>control</b> policy. Other papers cover domestic price effects of industrial protection, an evaluation of the role and performance of marketing boards, and price control on manufactures, milk, maize, meat, wages, and rents. The introduction to the workshop papers outlines the theme emerging from the papers and the policy implications, and draws heavily from the discussion in the workshop...|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{differences}} between three entry modes [...] sales subsidiaries, agents and distributors [...] along four dimensions [...] trust, commitment, <b>marketing</b> <b>control</b> and performance. It is posited that trust, commitment, <b>marketing</b> <b>control</b> and performance are highest in integrated modes (like sales subsidiaries) and lowest in distributor relationships, the agency solution being situated somewhere in between. These hypotheses are {{tested in a}} sample of 260 exporter intermediary relations of 120 Norwegian exporters. Concerning <b>marketing</b> <b>control</b> the hypotheses are confirmed. On the other hand [...] there is virtually no difference between agents and distributors on two other dimensions: trust and commitment. Here the dividing line goes between integrated and independent channels. Concerning financial performance, there is {{no significant difference between the}} three modes of entry. However, integrated modes of entry seem to meet exporter expectations better than independent solutions regarding the more general performance measure, 'goal achievement'.
