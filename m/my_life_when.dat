500|$|Kaif's {{career as}} a model led to {{anticipation}} surrounding her Bollywood debut. Boom (2003) had its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival, and was heavily promoted at the event. Boom was a commercial and critical failure. Kaif's enactment of a supermodel ensnared in the Mumbai underworld was poorly received, with Ziya U. Salam of The Hindu attributing the weak performances of the film's leading ladies to [...] "the vacuity of their expressions". Hindustan Times reported that after Booms release, Kaif was written off due to her poor Hindi and thick British accent. She later dismissed the film: [...] "I don't count Boom among important happenings in <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>When</b> I signed this film, I didn't know much about India and its film audience". Although Kaif was offered a number of modelling assignments, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her because of her poor command of Hindi. In one instance, Mahesh Bhatt replaced her with Tara Sharma in Saaya (2003) as he found her an [...] "inconsistent performer". Subsequently, Kaif began working on her diction through Hindi classes.|$|E

2500|$|However, Powell {{lost his}} seat in the {{election}} by 731 votes to the Social Democratic and Labour Party's Eddie McGrady, mainly because of demographic and boundary changes that resulted in there being many more Irish Nationalists in the constituency than before.

Both Ricky and Liam returned to the main serial as regular characters later that year, without Bianca. In an interview, Palmer discussed the spin-off and the reasons why {{she did not want}} to return to EastEnders: [...] "I have absolutely no desire to return to EastEnders. Not at all. In fact, I think that brief spin-off of a storyline for Ricky and Bianca was a double-edged sword. On one hand, I don't think we should ever have done it, it was a mistake on my behalf.
