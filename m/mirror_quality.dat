Together, FMX and AMX will cover a broad range of use cases from serial crystallography on micron sized crystals, to very large unit cell complexes, to rapid sample screening, e. g. for the always-hard-to-grow membrane proteins and for ligand binding studies. The LIX beamline will support a variety of X-ray scattering measurements for studies on proteins in solution, lipid membranes and biological tissues. We have performed Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW) [2] and Shadow[3] simulations to help select optimal methods to modify the size of the beam easily and smoothly at both FMX and AMX. The very low emittance of the NSLS-II storage ring and the resulting low divergence of the X-ray beam, as well as the long optical path lengths in the photon delivery systems lead to stringent requirements e. g. for vibrational stability and <b>mirror</b> <b>quality.</b> We discuss beamline design considerations addressing these challenges, such as combining mirror optics with compound refractive lenses (CRLs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe SpaceTube® {{is a new}} cost-optimized {{parabolic}} trough collector with an aperture width greater than 8 m. This paper summarizes the development and testing of first-round SpaceTube® SCE prototypes and their related componentry. These tests showed good agreement with the modeled performance, confirming the commercial potential of the design. The optical accuracy of the SpaceTube® is higher than previous designs, due to improvements in the <b>mirror</b> <b>quality</b> and frame stiffness. To {{take advantage of these}} improvements, the concentrator geometry was analytically optimized for maximum performance under two different heat transfer fluid scenarios; current (oil-based) fluid in the range of 400 ˚C and next-generation (molten salt or direct steam) at temperatures above 500 ˚C. This led to an increase in the nominal heat collection element (HCE) diameter. Compared to the benchmark EuroTrough II, the SpaceTube® uses a 65 % larger mirror module (SCE) and a more efficient frame structure, reducing the cost per unit aperture of the installed collector by approximately 40 % [1].

40|$|Spectrally {{engineered}} semiconductor Fabry-Perot laser resonators {{are designed}} to enhance the optical feedback for selected longitudinal modes, which thereby require less gain for lasing. This is achieved by introducing refractive index perturbations {{along the length of}} the resonator. However, the physical realization of these resonators is a challenge because of very narrow tolerances; in particular the need for precise positioning of the end facets of the resonator in relation to the perturbations, and the excess propagation loss associated with the perturbations, has been a major concern. We report on a method to achieve high-quality end facet mirrors enabling precise positioning relative to the perturbations, the latter which are realized as lateral corrugations of the waveguide. Measurements show that the <b>mirror</b> <b>quality</b> is comparable to that of cleaved mirrors and that the additional loss introduced by the perturbations adds < 10 cm- 1 to the overall propagation loss, provided that the perturbations are densely enough spaced along the resonator.

40|$|Photographs {{obtained}} {{during three}} flights of an 11 inch diameter normal incident soft X-ray (wavelength 63. 5 A) telescope are analyzed {{and the data}} are compared to the results expected from tests of the mirror surfaces. Multilayer coated X ray telescopes {{have the potential for}} 0. 01 arcsec resolution, and there is optimism that such high quality mirrors can be built. Some of the factors which enter into the performance actually achieved in practice are as follows: quality of the mirror substrate, quality of the multilayer coating, and number of photons collected. Measurements of multilayer mirrors show that the actual performance achieved in the solar X-ray images demonstrates a reduction in the scattering compared to that calculated from the topography of the top surface of the multilayer. In the brief duration of a rocket flight, the resolution is also limited by counting statistics from the number of photons collected. At X-ray Ultraviolet (XUV) wavelengths from 171 to 335 A the photon flux should be greater than 10 (exp 10) ph/sec, so that a resolution better than 0. 1 arcsec might be achieved, if <b>mirror</b> <b>quality</b> does not provide a limit first.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The primary {{advantage}} of a PV concentrator is that concentrating light allows {{a significant reduction in}} the area of solar cell coverage, the main cost driver in a flat plate system. PV systems, whether flat plate or concentrating, normally have groups of solar cells connected in series in order to increase voltage and limit current. However, low illumination on a single cell proportionally reduces its current, and hence affects the performance of all other cells in series. Ideally, a reflective PV concentrator system will have high concentration, a uniform flux distribution, and low cost. However, it is difficult to obtain these three conditions simultaneously, as cost tends to increase with better <b>mirror</b> <b>quality,</b> improved tracking accuracy, and the use of secondary flux modifiers. Linear concentrators have the {{advantage of}} simpler and cheaper tracking and support structures than dishes; however, achieving a consistent flux profile on every cell along the focal line is challenging. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present results of direct measurements of the flux profile along the length of a single axis tracking trough, and to develop simulation techniques that allow the reasons for peaks and troughs in the flux profile to be better understood...|$|E

In {{view of the}} more efficient epilayer area utilized, AlGaInP/mirror/barrier/Si LEDs with vertical electrodes are proposed in this work. A variety of barrier layers (Pt/Ti, TaN/Ta, and TiN/Ti) have been incorporated into the mirror structure. The <b>mirror</b> <b>quality</b> after bonding is a confirmed key issue in obtaining vertical MS-LEDs with high brightness. It is found that AuBe thickness has a large effect on the final MS-LED performance due to {{the difference in the}} interdiffusion of Be atoms in each mirror structure. The diffusion of excess Be atoms diffusing to the mirror side results in a rougher surface and inferior reflectivity. The luminance intensity of an AlGaInP LED chip (626 nm) with an optimum AuBe thickness can reach a maximum of similar to 165 mcd at 20 mA with a forward voltage of 2. 1 V. After encapsulation into lamps, the peak power efficiency can reach 21. 7 %, which corresponds to a 9 mW output at 20 mA.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 106 - 110) This thesis outlines {{noise and}} drift reduction and characterization in an optical Micro- Electro-Mechanical (MEMs) accelerometer that incorporates a micro-scale tunable Fabry-Perot cavity. With this method, {{the displacement of}} a proof mass is detected by {{the change in the}} transmission of the optical resonant cavity, which is detected by the light collected by an integrated photodiode. Optical transduction offers several potential advantages compared to typical acceleration sensing techniques. However, this technique comes with its own unique set of challenges. Accelerometer performance is dependent on numerous noise sources, including optical, mechanical, and electrical. A comprehensive system model of a Fabry-Perot based MEMs accelerometer is developed to quantify overall acceleration spectral noise density, as a function of anticipated and potential design parameter values. Modeling shows potential noise reduction to the 10 ng/???Hz range. Current optical accelerometer performance is compared to the model, and a number of methods of reducing noise and increasing overall performance are discussed. Examples include modulating and demodulating the optical source, source selection in terms of power, wavelength, divergence, and coherence length, modification of packaging and source spacing, <b>mirror</b> <b>quality,</b> and packaging pressure. Laser modulation is demonstrated to show over 3 times reduction in noise and bias instability, with potential for up to 100 times improvement.
