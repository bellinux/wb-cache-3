At this point of time, the government sold €0.75bn of bonds with a five-year maturity, {{to the tune of}} a 4.85% yield. A continued selling of bonds with a ten-year maturity, which would equal a regain of complete access to the private lending market (and mark the end of the era with need for bailout support), is expected to happen sometime in 2015. The Cypriot minister of finance recently confirmed, that the government plan to issue two new European <b>Medium</b> <b>Term</b> <b>Note</b> (EMTN) bonds in 2015, likely shortly ahead of the expiry of another €1.1bn bond on 1 July and a second expiry of a €0.9bn bond on 1 November.

5000|$|A {{structured}} {{investment vehicle}} (SIV) is a non-bank financial institution established to earn a credit spread between the longer-term assets held in its portfolio and the shorter-term liabilities it issues with high leverage. They are simple credit spread lenders, frequently [...] "lending" [...] by investing in securitizations, but also by investing in corporate bonds and funding by issuing commercial paper and <b>medium</b> <b>term</b> <b>notes,</b> which were usually rated AAA until {{the onset of the}} financial crisis. They did not expose themselves to either interest rate or currency risk and typically held asset to maturity. SIVs differ from asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in that they are permanently capitalized and have an active management team. They do not wind-down {{at the end of their}} financing term, but roll liabilities in the same way that traditional banks do.|$|R
50|$|A SIV may {{be thought}} of as a very simple virtual {{non-bank}} financial institution (i.e. it does not accept deposits). Instead of gathering deposits from the public, it borrows cash from the money market by selling short maturity (often less than a year) instruments called commercial paper (CP), <b>medium</b> <b>term</b> <b>notes</b> (MTNs) and public bonds to professional investors. SIVs had the highest ratings of AAA/Aaa, as a result of their very high quality portfolio requirements, almost zero exposure to interest rate and FX risk and large capital base (compared to traditional banks). This enabled them to borrow at interest rates close to the LIBOR, the rate at which banks lend to each other. The gathered funds are then used to purchase long term (longer than a year) bonds with credit ratings of between AAA and BBB. These assets earned higher interest rates, typically 0.25% to 0.50% higher than the cost of funding. The difference in interest rates represents the profit that the SIV pays to the capital note holders part of which return is shared with the investment manager.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, Brazil’s growth has {{significantly}} decelerated. Accompanying this slowdown, a change in com-mentary on Brazil’s economic future has emerged, and is reflected in a recent ratings downgrade of Brazilian sovereign paper and an overall much-bleaker growth outlook both for the near and <b>medium</b> <b>term.</b> This <b>note</b> examines three contrib-uting factors to this change in sentiment: macroeconomic management, the external environment, and microeconomic fundamentals. Among these, this note argues that the relative lack of progress on the microeconomic reform agenda has been far more detrimental to the growth outlook than either the credibility cost of recent macroeconomic management or the negative influence of a less supportive external environment. Against this backdrop, the recent ratings downgrade is not inherently negative: while Brazil {{is not about to}} slide down a slippery slope of macroeconomic mismanagement or on the verge of an externally powered economic meltdown, the downgrade can serve as a call to action for government to enact the necessary structural reforms to energize and sustain productivity growth. Slower Growth, Diminished Expectations Brazil’s postwar era was marked by a protracted boom period, followed by alternating episodes of macro instability and sta-bilization. Between 1947 and 1980, Brazil’s national income grew at 7. 5 percent per year, lifting the country into upper...|$|R
