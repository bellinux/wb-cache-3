However, the first International meeting in 1987 was the initial round of the Intercontinental F3000 Championship on 12 April. The race was run at 103.96mph, the winner being Maurício Gugelmin in a Ralt from Michel Trollé in a Lola and Roberto Moreno aboard another Ralt.|$|E

Heng hoped that the LGBT community would relate to the plays which included 'insider' jokes and references that could only be fully appreciated by the gay community, with scripts that were not dumbed down to accommodate a straight audience. Owing to its lesbian theme, the producers experienced great difficulty in securing a corporate sponsor.|$|E

25|$|Waugh {{began the}} Ashes series with centuries in the First Test at Brisbane (112) and the Third Test at Melbourne but was criticised for taking singles {{off the first}} ball of the over, and exposing the {{tail-end}} batsmen to the strike. Stuart MacGill and Glenn McGrath fell to Darren Gough after one such instance as Australia collapsed in the second innings whilst chasing a small target. This criticism could be considered <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> unfair, however, given his strong record overall of batting well with lower order batsman such as Merv Hughes, Jason Gillespie, Ian Healy, Shane Warne and even Glenn McGrath precisely by putting his faith in them. In the Fifth Test of the season, Waugh {{was involved in a}} century partnership with brother Mark for the second consecutive year. Again however, he fell within sight of triple figures for 96, while his brother reached his century. Australia won the Test and the series 3–1.|$|E

500|$|In the episode's {{original}} plot, Dupre was to {{have jumped}} into Mulder's body. There was, however, a belief {{at the time that}} neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena; Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such a way. With <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> reluctance, the producers agreed to make the change. As writer Howard Gordon later recalled, [...] "We'd wanted Mulder to experience the soul switch". Eventually, however, Fox's stance was changed; most notably, in the two-part sixth season episode, [...] "Dreamland", when Mulder's consciousness is exchanged with government agent Morris Fletcher. Gordon ultimately came to believe that the final decision was almost certainly for the best and saw the benefit of introducing Scully's former boyfriend as it provided a welcome opportunity to delve into her history.|$|E
500|$|In 1940, Barrymore {{appeared}} in The Great Profile, a spoof {{of his life}} in the months prior to My Dear Children. Barrymore played Evans Garrick, closely modeled on his own experience, and Mary Beth Hughes played his wife. The critics reacted harshly to the film, and to Barrymore's association with it. The New York Times wrote that [...] "As a play it is a feeble thing, hardly matching the spectacular public accounts of his amours... for all of Mr. Barrymore's shenanigans and devastating wit, The Great Profile is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pathetic. In the Winter of his Discontent Mr. Barrymore is selling his talent at cut-rate". In terms of his reputation, worse was to come in his final film, Playmates (1941), which [...] "amply illustrated the depths to which he had fallen; he played an alcoholic Shakespearean ham named John Barrymore".|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who want nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> peace and quiet; however, {{they have to deal}} with screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E

It {{is hard to}} see how any candid student can deny the greatness of this symphony." [...] However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express {{reservations}} about one or both symphonies. In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in The Gramophone, [...] "For some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bored by the rival work." [...] The critic John Warrack wrote, [...] "There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief", whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and angst and is marked instead by a [...] "benevolent tranquillity." ...|$|E

Krewen critiqued {{what he saw}} as the thesis to Rogan's book, commenting: [...] "Here is the premise of Van Morrison: No Surrender: Because the Belfast-born Morrison was raised in Ulster ... and subjected to violent religious prejudice, the musician embodies a symbolic metaphor of Northern Ireland's defiant nature. That's it." [...] Krewen noted that [...] "the book does capture Van the Man's evolution into an electrifying showman during his Monarchs and Them years." [...] The book also received a negative review from Martin Tierney in The Herald, who wrote: [...] "The title here is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> contrived as Rogan attempts to draw parallels with the sectarian troubles in Morrison's home turf and the maestro himself. It doesn't work, given that Morrison has never been political, thankfully sticking to music.

500|$|In 2002, Grint {{starred in}} his first non-Harry Potter film, Thunderpants, which {{revolves}} around Patrick (played by Bruce Cook) whose remarkable capacity for flatulence scores him {{a job as an}} astronaut. In this film, Grint portrayed the co-lead role of Alan, an [...] boy who is Patrick's only friend. It was generally ignored by critics and audiences alike. Most of the critics that did take notice of Thunderpants did not respond well to it, with one writing: [...] "This film should be shown in prisons so that inmates have a good reason to never return." [...] Another film he appeared in was Driving Lessons, a comedy-drama released in 2006, where he starred opposite Julie Walters. The film was met with a mixed reception by critics, but his portrayal of an oppressed teenaged boy was generally praised. [...] "Grint, on the other hand, is a revelation", who [...] "displays an innate naturalness mixed with personal charisma that turn a potentially pathetic Christian freak into a humorous, thoroughly likable – if <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> awkward – young man", wrote Alt Film Guides Andre Soares.|$|E
500|$|Davil Balls of Digital Spy {{described}} the music video as being [...] "cheeky, seductive and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit ridiculous" [...] {{and said that}} Spears [...] "delivers some killer dance routines". Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly compared the dance in the chair with the music video of [...] "Stronger" [...] and added that [...] "best of all, she actually looks animated in this video {{and appears to be}} having fun". James Montgomery of MTV said that after watching the video [...] "you are overcome with the sudden urge to go to the Big Apple Circus. Or pick up some Curious perfume. Or you know, possibly both". The music video won the category of Best Moves at the MTV Australia Awards 2009. It was also nominated for four VMAs at the 2009 awards in the categories of Best Art Direction, Best Choreography, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, but lost of all them. It was also nominated for Best Video in the MTV Europe Music Awards 2009, but lost to Beyoncé's [...] "Single Ladies".

He declared the scenes showing Madonna's then-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat, the singer's cleavage and booty slaps as highlights of the video. Stern concluded by saying that he [...] "thought this would be much worse because the concept is so flimsy, but I have to say: It's kind of a treat to see Madonna letting loose and having some fun." [...] Belinda White from The Daily Telegraph wrote that Madonna refused to act [...] "her age" [...] in the video but [...] "she has us <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> envious of all the fun she's having, not to mention how incredible she looks."

[...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote [...] "Like many S13 episodes, “Badge” feels <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> derivative," [...] describing the episode {{as a combination}} of the season 4 episode [...] "Mr. Plow" [...] and the season 5 episode [...] "Homer the Vigilante". He continued by writing [...] "That doesn’t mean the show lacks amusement, but it’s too rehashed to end the year with a real winner." [...] Nate Boss of Project-Blu described it as [...] "A random episode, without many laughs," [...] however, he added that it [...] "could have been worse."

Further in his review, Poniewozik said that he most enjoyed episodes in which Liz shows her [...] "evil side" [...] because the show [...] "does {{an excellent job of}} showing how much work it is for her to be assertive and slightly evil, how she's excited yet made nervous by the idea at the same time." [...] As with Poniewozik, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club complimented 30 Rock as they [...] "pulled it off with aplomb" [...] in regards to Liz's actions in this episode. He said that Liz and Drew [...] "are so damned delightful that it's hard not to root for them even if Liz's antics increasingly border on deranged and criminal." [...] Rabin said that the Rohypnol incident was funny [...] "but also sweet and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> romantic." [...] Sassone enjoyed Liz and Drew's scenes, writing that when Fey and Hamm work together they are quite good. Gold said that Liz's unsuccessful attempts of seduction were [...] "hilarious effects".

500|$|Skeptics such as James Randi {{suggest that}} his {{reputation}} as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as [...] "retroactive clairvoyance" [...] (postdiction). Thus, no Nostradamus quatrain is known to have been interpreted as predicting a specific event before it occurred, other than in vague, general terms that could equally apply to any number of other events. [...] This even applies to quatrains that contain specific dates, such as III.77, which predicts [...] "in 1727, in October, the king of Persia [...] captured by those of Egypt"—a prophecy that has, as ever, been interpreted retrospectively in the light of later events, in this case as though it presaged the known peace treaty between the Ottoman Empire and Persia of that year. Similarly, Nostradamus's notorious '1999' prophecy at X.72 (see Nostradamus in popular culture) describes no event that commentators have succeeded in identifying either before or since, other than by dint of twisting the words to fit whichever of the many contradictory happenings they are keen to claim as 'hits'. Moreover, no quatrain suggests, as is often claimed by books and films on the alleged Mayan Prophecy, that the world would end in December 2012. [...] In his preface to the Prophecies, Nostradamus himself stated that his prophecies extend 'from now to the year 3797'—an extraordinary date which, given that the preface was written in 1555, may have <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{to do with the fact}} that 2242 (3797−1555) had recently been proposed by his major astrological source Richard Roussat as a possible date for the end of the world.|$|E
