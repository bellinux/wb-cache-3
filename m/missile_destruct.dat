40|$|Pyrotechnics is a {{fascinating}} subject for research because it sooner or later requires the investigator to apply most of the analytical tools that are available. Of course, one shouldn't overlook the appeal to the boy's love of noise and excitement that is present in much of our experimental work, whether we admit it or not. In addition to providing us with challenging problems and exciting experiments, pyro, in many cases, has afforded the only practical way to achieve the result that is desired. A special expertise is needed for {{the solution of the}} problems associated with these practical applications and the expert pyrotechnist appears to have become one of the &quot;endangered species &quot; in recent years. I hope the thoughts which I have presented in this paper may help to avoid his extinction. If they have any claim to merit, it is due to {{the people who have been}} my colleagues during forty years in ordnance research, which has included terminal ballistic effects, phenomena due to the detonation of explosives, <b>missile</b> <b>destruct</b> systems and incendiary ammunition functioning. Much of my more recent experience has been with pyrotechnics,- to me...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} four innovative pedagogical exercises: (i) The expression for relation between cross sections {{in the laboratory}} and the centre of mass systems provided in text books assumes zero or low Q values which needs to be corrected for the most general case when Q value of the reaction is not negligible compared to the masses of interacting nuclei. The general expression derived here {{can be used for}} elastic and inelastic cases involving zero, low or even very high Q values. (ii) The equation of oscillatory motion of a massive surface put horizontally on two wheels rotating with equal and opposite angular velocities is established. The time period of oscillation is related to the coefficient of dynamic friction between the surface and the wheels which facilitates the measurement of the coefficient of dynamic friction. (iii) The equation of motion of a fixed torque mass shedding vehicle moving against friction and its velocity at any instant of time are derived. This example is equivalent to motion of a mass shedding rocket moving by applying fixed force against atmospheric friction. (iv) The equation of the path of a missile directed at every instant of time towards a rectilinearly moving target and time taken to hit the target are derived. It provides equation of path for asteroid and comet <b>destructing</b> <b>missiles</b> as conceptualized by NASA projects. Comment: 4 pages; [URL]...|$|R
