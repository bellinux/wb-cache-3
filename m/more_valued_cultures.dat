50|$|Julia Serano {{notes that}} {{masculine}} {{girls and women}} face much less social disapproval than feminine boys and men, which she attributes to sexism. Serano argues that women wanting to be like men {{is consistent with the}} idea that maleness is <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> in contemporary <b>culture</b> than femaleness, whereas men being willing to give up masculinity in favour of femininity directly threatens the notion of male superiority as well as the idea that men and women should be opposites. To support her thesis, Serano cites the far greater public scrutiny and disdain experienced by male-to-female cross-dressers compared with that faced by women who dress in masculine clothes, as well as research showing that parents are likelier to respond negatively to sons who like Barbie dolls and ballet or wear nail polish than they are to daughters exhibiting comparably masculine behaviours.|$|R

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on organizational culture {{focuses on the}} strategic fit between a firm's <b>culture</b> <b>values</b> and its technology and task environment. This study, however, emphasizes the diffusion perspective of organizational culture, that organizations often imitate cultures of successful firms to reduce uncertainty, resulting in a homogeneous set of organizational <b>culture</b> <b>values</b> that are considered universally beneficial to organizational functioning. <b>Culture</b> <b>values</b> falling into this category include modern values that emphasize innovation, risk-taking, and change, as opposed to <b>more</b> traditional <b>values</b> that focus on stability and consistency. Using 1958 employees from 50 firms in Taiwan and Mainland China, we developed an organizational culture measure consisting of both modern and traditional organizational <b>culture</b> <b>values.</b> We showed that modern organizational <b>culture</b> <b>values</b> were considered beneficial even by employees with traditional personal values. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This essay aims {{to examine}} the self-sustainability of the urban {{regeneration}} policy using culture as a main tool. The possibility is pointed out that using culture for the economic purpose would vitiate the <b>value</b> of <b>culture</b> itself or cause a local society unexpected side effects which would do harm to the sustainability of the policy in the longer term. This problem is broken down into 2 issues as follows : 1. how the policy should treat culture for urban regeneration; 2. how the meaning which the policy presents affects the local community. To examine the issues, the essay takes up the experiences of two cities in the UK., Glasgow and Newcastle / Gateshead. The essay concludes as follows. Firstly, it {{can be one of}} the sustainable way of culture-led urban regeneration policy to position as a primary objective not utilizing culture for the sake of economy, but enhancing the cultural value of local cultural capital, which leads to enhancing the economic value, thus stimulating economic activities. Secondly, it can be deduced that in unfolding cultural policy we should <b>value</b> <b>more</b> the <b>culture's</b> role of presenting new way of viewing or thinking which could breathe new life into an unlively local community, than reflecting many local people's voices in the culture. However, in that case the meaning of the culture to be presented by cultural policy should not be imposed on a local community but must be open to people's interpretation...|$|R
