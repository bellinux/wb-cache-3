40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the techniques of midwife by tracing the practicing midwives who have lived for Taisho, Showa, Heisei. The method of investigation is to have interview. The results are as follows. The techniques of midwife during the pregnancy, the intrapartum period, and the puerperal period are accepted absolutely today. The current of the criticism for controlled delivery at present hospital and the revolution for natural delivery supposes that delivery advances physically and naturally. We midwives should support natural delivery, establishment the feed on <b>mother</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> and childrearing and so on, to demonstrate the specialty of midwife. And in the end, we think ［Giving Birth and Being Born as a Human］ is guaranteed. 本論文の目的は、大正、昭和、平成と生きた開業助産婦の軌跡をたどることによって、助産技術を考察した。研究方法は、面接による聞き取り調査を行った。その結果、妊娠期、分娩期、産褥期における助産技術は、現代にもまったく通ずるものであった。現代の病院管理分娩への批判、自然分娩への回帰などは、分娩が生理的で自然に進むものであるという前提ありきの流れである。われわれ助産師は、正常で自然な分娩への援助、そして母乳栄養確立への援助、育児援助など、助産師の専門性を発揮するための援助を確実にしなければならない。そのことがひいては「人として産み、生まれること」の保障をもたらすことにつながると考える...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid 1900 s, {{there has}} been a {{dramatic}} {{increase in the number of}} osteoporotic-related fractures in the industrialised world. The reason for this is unknown, but there could be a link between the increased use and production of chemicals and effects on bone. Many chemicals possess endocrine-disrupting properties, affecting reproductive tissues and other endocrine-regulated tissues, such as bone tissue. In this thesis, studies have been performed on wild (alligator and herring gull) as well as experimental animals (goat and rat) with the aim to investigate potential bone effects of different persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as dicofol, DDT and its metabolites, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins. The methods used include peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), biomechanics (three-point bending test), mineralisation analysis (bone chemical composition), and measurements of the bone markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (bone formation) and carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) (bone resorption). The results in this thesis show that free-ranging female alligators residing in a pesticide-polluted lake (dicofol, DDT and its metabolites) in Florida, USA show increases in trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), total BMD and bone mineral content, compared to females from a control lake. The bone effects indicate exposure to an estrogenic environment, suggesting the mainly anti-androgenic p,p -DDE and/or the mainly estrogenic dicofol to elicit estrogenic actions on bone tissue homeostasis. Bone effects have been observed in free-ranging herring gulls residing in the Great Lakes, a lake system in North America polluted with POPs and metals and situated near many large cities and industries. Alterations include decreases in bone length, periosteal circumference, total cross-sectional area (CSA) and an increase in displacement at failure, compared to herring gulls from a freshwater reference site. The pQCT results indicate disrupted estrogen-signalling in bone tissue and in addition, the biomechanical results suggest disruption of the mineralisation process. This thesis also presents bone effects observed in experimental animals. Female goat offspring exposed to an environmentally relevant dose of the non dioxin-like putative estrogen PCB 153 in utero and through <b>mother</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> had bone changes indicating estrogenic bone effects, such as increased trabecular BMD in the metaphysis and decreases of the total CSA, moment of resistance and marrow cavity in the diaphysis. However, the dioxin-like anti-estrogenic PCB 126 did not produce any developmental effects on goat bone. Interestingly, male rats exposed to a single high dose (LD 50) of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCCD) for only five days (short-term exposure) showed anti-estrogenic bone effects, such as decreased trabecular area, an increase of CTX, a decrease of ALP, and an altered bone chemical composition, resembling more mature bones. In conclusion, bone tissue is a likely target for endocrine-disrupting chemicals, hence, bone effects were observed in a various number of species exposed to POPs. The observed effects suggest POPs to exert anti-estrogenic or estrogenic actions on bone composition, dimensions and strength, or to disrupt the mineralisation process. However, further studies are needed in order to elucidate by what mechanisms pesticides, PCBs and dioxins exert their potential effect on bone tissue...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{more people}} are {{drinking}} more milk and consuming more dairy products. Yet milk production is still too low in ACP countries, and hampered by cheap imports. It s a bucketful of paradoxes and problems, hopes and heartbreaks. Have you ever {{had the chance to}} lift a glass of really fresh milk to your lips, still warm and frothy, drawn straight from the udder of a cow, sheep, goat or camel? Did it bring back an old, deep, primitive feeling in you? Most of us were raised on our <b>mother</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> which makes milk our first food. The Malian author Amadou Hampaté Bâ sums it up: 'The baby at the mother s breast drinks more than milk, but mercy too, and love. ' Milk may have its mythical dimension, but it is nevertheless the traditional food for many herder communities in Africa and for village communities across the Pacific and the Caribbean. Not that it has ever really been plentiful there, due to such practices as letting the calf suckle before drawing any milk for the herder s family, and {{the fact that there is}} much less milk available during dry seasons. In herding families, only the children, pregnant women and the elderly drink it regularly. Other types of farmers can get milk only on rare occasions because it is difficult to transport; it will not keep for more than a few hours if it has not been processed. Milk has also become an icon of urban consumption, a symbol of modernity. Generations of urban consumers have acquired a taste for it through distribution schemes at schools and through advertisements praising its beneficial effects. You will find it in all shapes and sizes on market stalls and shop shelves: packs of UHT (ultra high temperature) treated milk, cans of evaporated or condensed sweetened milk, full, skimmed or formula baby powder, butter milk or yoghurt, cream, butter and ghee (clarified butter) not to mention all sorts of cheeses. Too costly to buy Everyone knows and covets these products, but only a minority of consumers can afford to buy them regularly. For most town dwellers, especially in West Africa, the only kind of milk they can buy for their families is the powdered variety, sold in small portions or reconstituted to liquid milk in small workshops. In general, milk consumption is very low in most ACP countries. In those countries where there is a tradition of milk consumption (such as eastern Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific), people consume an average of 50 litres a person each year. Across the whole of Africa, the annual average hovers around 20 litres. This is four times below the minimum consumption recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), and between 20 and 25 times less than the European average. The minimum level of consumption of milk and milk products in Africa is thus far from being met. The authors of an FAO book on the supply of milk and milk products in African cities noted, in 1995, that 'after all sorts of ethnical, religious or sociological considerations about the consumption of milk and milk products in Africa, one basic truth stands out above all others: the low purchasing power of consumers or, put differently, the excessive price of milk and milk products. ' Too cheap to sell Even with the growth of urban populations, demand for milk products has been met essentially with imported products: in the towns of West Africa, they often represent more than 90 % of the supply. This figure rarely drops below 75 % across the totality of ACP countries. This imported milk is subsidised in a number of ways. First, there is support given to farmers in countries where production costs are high, in particular in Europe (see the table of production costs in selected countries). Then there are the subsidies on the export of powdered milk itself. No wonder that these products are available at low prices on ACP markets. Local production is finding it hard to get off the ground. As well as competing with imports, producers face a whole set of barriers: low productivity, milking herds dispersed over large areas, the high costs of inputs (fodder, medicines) in intensified methods and the problems of organising collections. The resulting shortage of fresh milk pushes up the price. Faced with the competition of imported milk, local production cannot generate enough income with which to increase the supply on the market; this in turn feeds the growing trend of using milk from elsewhere. The bigger picture Macro-economic factors have played their role in recent years. The devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 doubled the cost of imported milk in West Africa overnight, without any lasting benefit for locally produced milk. The supply of local milk did not improve, and consumers soon became resigned to spending the same amount of money as they had previously for half the amount of powdered milk. Another, hopeful, element to take into account is the prospect of changes to the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. It is most unlikely that European tax payers will continue, indefinitely, to pay the farmers in the four or five major milk-producing countries to live off a permanent level of over-production. Then milk prices will tend to rise above their existing very low levels. Finally, the trend to liberalise markets is leading to lower customs tariffs. Local producers and processors now find themselves exposed to a mean white wave of imports, and have become unprotected and impoverished to varying degrees, even in such countries as Jamaica which has a long-established dairy sector (see box). A vicious circle Using imported milk has become a classical vicious circle, and getting out of it has become urgent. Truth be told, only a drastic increase in local production will provide a satisfactory supply of milk and milk products and help to generate more income for local farmers and thus trigger development in the sector. What form, though, should this model of development take? In those countries with a well-established dairy sector, the tradition has long been to operate with large-scale dairies based on a widespread network of cooperative members. They bring economies of scale and a strong capacity to invest, with all the fragile risks that these involve. That is the position, for example, of Rewa Co-Operative Dairy Company in Suva which has a quasi-monopoly of the Fiji market, of Dairy Corporation Ltd of Kampala which processes two-thirds of Uganda s milk and the Kenya Cooperative Creameries group which, not to put too fine a point on it, imploded in a maelstrom of bad management and corruption. To impose this model on countries without an established dairy sector would be bound to fail. Public development agencies and private investment bodies rarely show much interest in this option. More modest and pragmatic options stand a better chance; they include setting up a belt of dairy farms around towns and helping urban mini-dairies to better target their market. The local dairy chain has become the focus of several worthy experiments, such as those coordinated by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) (see Links) and the West African networks promoted by GRET, the French technology research group. Technology development can also boost new supply chains: the cooling system of lactoperoxydase (see Spore 80), for example, has opened up opportunities for distant producers to sell to urban markets. It will be a question of seizing every opportunity, however small. The stakes are high. As the English statesman Winston Churchill once growled 'there is no better investment for a country than to feed milk to its children. ' [captions to illustrations] Camel s milk in Mauritania; in-pouch pasteurisation in Guyana; publicity in Togo; a milk churn rides a bike to market in Kenya; and the centre-forward of the USA women s soccer team scores a point. A litre of fresh milk consists of 35 g fat, 35 g protein, 50 g carbohydrate (sugars), 10 g sodium and vitamins A, D, E, B 1, B 2 and C. For the vitamins to stay intact, they should be kept away from light, air and heat. Worldwide, {{more people are}} drinking more milk and consuming more dairy products.

40|$|Differences in {{clotting}} {{between human}} and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in the stomachs of infants are discussed. Gastric pH, after ingesting milk, {{of an infant}} up to 6 months of age stays at a pH range of 4 - 5, near the isoelectric point of casein, and never reaches the value of 2, which is found in adults. Pepsin C (or gastricsin) can hydrolyze proteins at this pH range. Gastric emptying time is shorter with human milk than with cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> {{which appears to be}} correlated to the smaller size of human milk clots. Elimination of a readily coagulable fraction of casein from cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> by restricted rennet action produced B-casein rich milk with similar coagulating properties to that of human milk. Although pepsin digestibility at pH 2 was greater for bovine whole casein than bovine B-casein-rich fraction or human casein, this difference was minimized or even reversed at pH 4. This was ascribred to the difference in clotting behavior of s 1 -casein and B-casein, namely a harder clot of the former. Therefore, the difference in clotting and proteolytic properties between human milk and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in an infant 2 ̆ 7 s stomach can be explained from the difference in chemical properties of their major caseins, i. e., B-caseins and s 1 -case-ins in human milk and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> respectively...|$|R

Objective: To determine the nutritional adequacy of two groups of 12 – 24 -month-old Irish children by type of milk consumption (consumers or non-consumers of GUM). Design: Using data from a cross-sectional study of Irish children, the National Pre-School Nutrition Survey (2010 – 2011), two groups of children were defined. The groups included children aged 12 – 24 months with an average daily total milk intake of at least 300 g and consuming GUM (≥ 100 g/day) together with cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> (n= 29) or cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> only (n= 56). Results: While average total daily energy intakes were similar in both consumers and non-consumers of GUM, intakes of protein, saturated fat, and vitamin B 12 were lower and intakes of carbohydrate, dietary fibre, iron, zinc, vitamins C and D were higher in consumers of GUM. These differences in nutrient intakes are largely attributable to the differences in composition between GUM and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk.</b> For both consumers and non-consumers of GUM, intakes of carbohydrate and fat were generally in line with recommendations while intakes of protein, dietary fibre and most micronutrients were adequate.

40|$|Background: Several {{different}} factors {{point to}} {{the significance of the}} role of non-genetic causes in the etiology of type 1 diabetes. Some studies have suggested a positive correlation between early exposure to cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in infancy and increased later risk of developing the disease, while other studies have not found such a correlation. The issue is still unresolved, and in this systematic review I will investigate the most relevant literature on the subject. Methods: I conducted a systematic literature search in Medline and Embase databases, using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies comparing infant cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure with type 1 diabetes risk were included in the review. A total of 19 studies were included, most of them being retrospective case-control designed studies. Results: The included studies were categorized in terms of whether they showed a positive, negative or no correlation between infant cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure and risk of type 1 diabetes, and with regard {{to the quality of the}} studies. Six of the studies results were considered to be positive and convincing for increased risk of type 1 diabetes with early infant exposure, four were positive and plausible or positive and lacking, and 12 showed no effect. Conclusions: Divergent results could be seen between the different studies included in this review with regards to whether early infant cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes or not. On the basis of the findings in this review, one can therefore not conclude with a positive, negative or a non-existing relationship between the respective exposure and the disease...|$|R

40|$|People talk {{of having}} an allergy to cow <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> but such allergies are in fact quite rare. People are {{normally}} referring to an intolerance of cow <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> through the body s reaction to lactose, the natural sugar of milk. It is a double sugar {{that has to be}} divided into two separate sugars for the body {{to be able to use}} them. This division usually takes place in the small intestine, mediated by an enzyme known as lactase. After birth and during infancy, most people produce enough lactase to digest the <b>milk</b> <b>s</b> lactose. It is at a later age that some adults do not secrete enough lactase, particularly when they have stopped drinking milk regularly. In such cases, the undigested lactose passes into the large intestine, where it is fermented by bacteria. This intolerance is quite frequent in adults in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America; it is rarer in Europe and North America. People suffering from this ailment can nonetheless consume milk in small amounts, as well as unlimited amounts of butter, cheese and yoghurt as these products contain very little lactose. An alternative to cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> is soya milk, which is also a complementary foodstuff.
