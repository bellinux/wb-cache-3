5|$|Jackson {{was born}} in Greenville, South Carolina, {{and raised in the}} Jackson Park Highlands District of the South Shore {{community}} area on the South Side of Chicago, one of five children of Jesse and Jacqueline (Brown) Jackson. He attended nursery school at the University of Chicago and attended John J. Pershing Elementary School. At age five, Jackson mimicked his father in a speech atop a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> at the Operation PUSH headquarters. His father sought media attention to shed light on important issues according to some accounts {{and as a result of}} his father's travels, his time with his father often occurred in the time between meetings.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} eight, Alex {{had begun}} playing both {{basketball}} and football. He would shoot hoops with a soccer ball and a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> nailed to a tree. The sport was becoming increasingly popular in Nigeria due {{to the success of}} National Basketball Association (NBA) center Hakeem Olajuwon and Owumi often followed the NBA. When he was 12, his family moved to England, where they lived for three years. They then settled in Boston after his father joined the Harvard School of Public Health. In sixth grade, he enrolled at the local Tobin K-8 School. He attended Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, Boston, where he played basketball and football. Owumi later estimated that he lost, at most, nine high school basketball games. At Burke in 2003, he won The Boston Globe Scholar Athlete Award, given to the top male and female student-athletes in Boston. Owumi was also a part of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball team, Boston Amateur Athletic Club.|$|E

5000|$|Tower of Strength - The Teams {{must use}} <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> {{to build a}} tower {{all the way to}} the golden skull at the top. If the tower falls apart, the team will have to start over again. The first team to grab the skull wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, single stacks of crates can only be built and one member must give the <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> to their partner.|$|R
50|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>crates</b> are square or {{rectangular}} interlocking {{boxes that}} are used to transport milk and other products from dairies to retail establishments.|$|R
50|$|The {{dimensions}} of the <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> may {{have been influenced by}} the {{dimensions of}} the Tea chest. For all practical purposes, both hold similar internal volumes, but tea chests are designed for shipping over the open ocean.|$|E
50|$|Step {{aerobics}} {{was developed}} by Gin Miller around 1989. After a knee injury, Gin consulted with an orthopedic doctor, who recommended she strengthen the muscles supporting the knee by stepping {{up and down on}} a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> and from this she developed the step regimen.|$|E
50|$|The bottle crate emerged {{after the}} tea chest was {{a de facto}} {{shipping}} method. The plastic <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> is claimed as an Australian invention, produced {{through a period of}} trial and error in design by the Dairy Farmers Cooperative Milk Company in the 1950s and 60s.|$|E
50|$|Square milk jugs are {{stackable}} and 9% {{more can}} be shipped in the same space. They also {{eliminate the need for}} <b>milk</b> <b>crates,</b> which are required for traditional bell-shaped jugs.|$|R
50|$|The {{processing}} plant {{is located in}} Downey with a cold storage facility in the neighboring city of South Gate. The dairy has hired six to 10 new employees annually from targeted Enterprise Zone employment areas within the local community, earning the business tax credits now worth approximately $100,000 a year.The company uses the Q5i Near Infrared In-Line Analyzer from Engineering Solutions Experts, Inc., improving quality control during the fluid milk standardization process. Rockview Farms uses HTST pasteurization to ensure maximum nutrition and taste.Rockview Farms processes about 800,000 to one million gallons of milk a week.Expenses facing the company include the theft of plastic <b>milk</b> <b>crates.</b> Rockview Farms wrote in support of California Assembly Bill 1583 saying that it purchases nearly 450,000 <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> annually {{at a cost of}} more than $1.7 million, yet police reports and investigations have found that <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> and plastic pallets are stolen and sold illegally to junk dealers/recyclers who then grind the plastic containers into chips to be resold for a lesser price.|$|R
50|$|Dairy mix is {{typically}} packaged in 2.5 gal bags, 1 gal jugs or half gallon cartons. Most dairies place these in <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> or boxes, {{depending on where}} or how they ship their product. These products are pasteurized under State and Federal guidelines.|$|R
50|$|Blondie {{develops}} {{a car to}} be used in the drag racing tournaments, and finds that Jake excels at driving it. One night, Blondie attempts to repossess a car owned by King, and King and one of his associates assault him. While on a pornographic film set during a suggestive photo shoot, Jake knocks out King and his partner, takes King's keys, and repossesses his car. Jake has dinner with Jenny, and tells her that he originally quit racing after his wife passed away from illness while he raced in and won a time trial for the Indianapolis 500. When Jenny leaves to get more beer, Jake finds her hanging by a noose over a <b>milk</b> <b>crate,</b> and King warns him that he and Jenny will face consequences if Jake loses the upcoming drag race. The <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> is kicked away, and Jake saves Jenny from hanging.|$|E
50|$|The {{lymphedema}} had {{a severe}} effect on Warren's {{personal life and}} health. He already weighed 300 lb {{before the onset of}} the condition and he suffered from high blood pressure and asthma. The swelling increased his weight to about 450 lb. Because his penis and testicles were enclosed by his gigantic scrotum, he was unable to urinate normally or to have sex. Simply keeping his scrotum under cover was a challenge in itself, which he eventually solved by wearing an upside-down full-size hooded sweatshirt over it with his legs in the sleeves. Traveling on buses required him to bring along a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> and a cushion on which to rest his scrotum during the journey. As travel was so difficult, he would spend {{most of his time in}} his apartment's living room watching television while propping his scrotum on top of the <b>milk</b> <b>crate.</b>|$|E
50|$|On July 5, 2006, workers began {{bulldozing}} {{the farm}} amidst protest {{and acts of}} civil disobedience. One protester chained himself to a bulldozer and another lay {{down in front of}} a bulldozer. Both were arrested. Two others were also arrested, one for throwing a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> at a police officer and the other for assaulting a bulldozer driver. Ten people were arrested in total.|$|E
50|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>crates</b> and bottle crates are {{a form of}} {{reusable}} packaging used to ship to retail stores and to return empty bottles to the bottler or packager. These are usually moulded plastic designs expected to make several round trip shipments. Wood structures are also used.|$|R

50|$|Stilts {{are often}} {{required}} to plaster most ceilings {{and it is}} typically harder to lay-on and work than walls. For short ceilings one can also work with <b>milk</b> <b>crates.</b> The difficulty of working upside down often results in plaster bombs splattering on the floors, walls and people below.|$|R
50|$|Plasterers will {{typically}} divide a room, (especially a {{large or}} high-ceilinged wall) into top and bottom. The one working on top will do from the ceiling's edge to about belly height and work off a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> for an 8 ft ceiling, or work off stilts for 12-foot-high rooms. For cathedral ceilings or very high walls, staging {{is set up}} and one works topside, the others further below.|$|E

He became an apprentice to the proprietor, at first standing on a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> to cut. He won a national barber competition, and in the late 1930s he emigrated to New York. He worked at various places before taking over the Broadway Barbershop.|$|E

50|$|The first {{broadcast}} was technically able within 48 {{hours from}} gaining tenancy access at the Moorabbin location. This required all preparatory {{work to be}} completed ahead of time, which was the case, and the studios just needed to function - thus were built using old desks, old wall dividers and office panels, <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> and borrowed equipment.|$|R
50|$|The Gyro UP was {{introduced}} in October 1985. It differs from the Gyro X by replacing {{the front and rear}} tie-down racks with a single heavy-duty baggage platform fixed directly to the rear engine pod, giving the appearance of a scooter pick-up truck. This platform has a rubber-mat loading area of 450 mm × 570mm that is rated for 30 kg. Honda claims it is sized for a 20 bottle beer crate, a container that is roughly similar to the plastic <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> common in other countries.|$|E
50|$|Commons {{spent his}} {{childhood}} in Toledo, Ohio near his grandparents, but he was mainly looked after by his mother Rena. His father worked at a charter bus company and was absent {{for most of the}} year. Chris attended the Union Grove Missionary Baptist Church three times each week with his extended family. Commons started playing basketball in fourth grade, and he supposedly tried to improve his shooting skills early on by nailing a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> to a tree in his yard. He also watched Chicago Bulls games on television in his bedroom.|$|E
50|$|In early 1995 ECT {{started its}} first green box {{recycling}} service, using a carton {{roughly the size}} of a <b>milk</b> <b>crate,</b> into which paper, glass, cans, foil, textiles, shoes, household batteries and engine oil can be placed, collected once a week by ECT. Materials are sorted into compartments on the recycling vehicle at the kerbside to avoid contamination and mix-up of items. This recycle from home service is now used by 860,000 people in sixteen local authority areas, across parts of London, Avon, Somerset, Warwickshire and the West Midlands.|$|E
50|$|An {{intruder}} {{entered the}} rural home of Herbert and Sonja Knippers {{in the early}} morning hours of July 8, 1984. He appeared to gain entry by stacking two <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> outside the Knippers' bathroom window and cutting the screen. After Sonja entered the bathroom some time later, the attacker tried to rape her and began stabbing her with a knife.|$|R
30|$|Field {{work was}} {{conducted}} across four farms {{located in the}} Atherton Tablelands region (17 ° 16 ′S, 145 ° 53 ′E) of North Queensland over 3  days. All four farms had different farming and feed management practices {{including the use of}} a variety of hides (e.g. old car tyres or <b>milk</b> <b>crates,</b> etc.), time and frequency of feeding, pond fertilisation methods, water source, and supplemental feed provided.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers {{claim that}} this {{rectangular}} design has cut water use by 67% to 70%, according to one dairy, {{since there are no}} crates to be cleaned; the absence of dirty crates also reduces the risk of jugs carrying contamination. There is also the reduced cost with no crates to be stolen: Pennsylvania dairies alone spent US$6 million replacing <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> in 2005, mostly from theft.|$|R

50|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was announced}} on 29 July 2014 {{as part of}} a $9 million package of public artworks for Sydney. Cloud Arch is designed by Junya Ishigami, and is expected to cost $3.5 million. Announced at the same time were Pavilion by Hany Armanious, a 13 m <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> to be placed in Belmore Park, and The Distance of Your Heart by Tracey Emin, to consist of 60 bronze bird sculptures perched on poles and above doorways in the northern end of the central business district. Development applications for the sculptures are expected to be lodged by the end of 2015. If approved, construction will begin on the Armanious and Emin sculptures in October 2016 and on Cloud Arch in 2017.|$|E
5000|$|Kerrie Roberts {{grew up as}} a {{daughter}} to a pastor and a church choir director. [...] It is because of this that Roberts {{spent a lot of}} time in the church during her childhood. Roberts began performing music at the age of 5, singing in her mom's church choir. [...] According to her YouTube autobiography, she was so small that she had to stand on a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> in order for the congregation to see her. [...] This experience eventually led to her playing piano and leading worship music in the church. [...] Roberts' music revolved solely around her parents' church until high school, at which point she began writing her own songs. [...] This writing continued while she attended college at the University of Miami; she graduated with a degree in studio music and jazz vocal.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947, Sidney Holes {{were selling}} 3-wheeled PCVs, {{fitted with a}} [...] motor and a 24-volt battery. The {{bodywork}} was fabricated from steel, and the vehicle could carry 24 <b>milk</b> <b>crates,</b> 16 {{in the body and}} 8 on the roof. Those in the body were mounted on runners, so that they could slide out to access the bottles. It had a range of 10 mi.|$|R
25|$|Geoducks spawn {{from spring}} to late {{summer in the}} wild, peaking in June and July. Because of this timing, {{an equal number of}} male and female clams are {{collected}} starting in the early fall when gametogenesis commences. The clams are placed in <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> and maintained in polyethylene fish totes supplied with flowing seawater (10-12nbsp&°C) for several weeks. Microalgae is added as feed and regular cleaning is carried out to remove biodeposits.|$|R
50|$|Tosh may perform {{original}} short sketches {{related to}} or parodying these videos. For example, he displayed {{a video of}} a man attempting to climb a precariously homemade staircase of <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> to reach a flagpole, resulting in a great fall with visibly broken bones. Tosh whimsically parodied the tragedy in a fully animated stylistic recreation of Nintendo's original Super Mario Bros. (1985) video game, starring himself as Mario within the game's madcap action of jumping over huge blocks and collecting treasure.|$|R
