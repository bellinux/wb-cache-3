5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had <b>mid-mounted</b> straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The <b>mid-mounted</b> wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a <b>mid-mounted</b> engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E

5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, <b>mid-mounted,</b> trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The 112 and 114 are {{conventional}} layout monoplanes {{with the}} main wing set low and a <b>mid-mounted</b> horizontal stabilizer. This places the stabilizer outside the prop wash, and results in heavier handling at lower speeds.|$|E
25|$|The wings were <b>mid-mounted</b> and {{strongly}} tapered with slightly swept leading edges and marked curvature on the trailing edges. They were fitted with tabbed ailerons and flaps. There were three crew, a bomb aimer/observer {{housed in a}} partially glazed nose, the pilot in a conventional cockpit which merged into a raised rear fuselage and, in the extreme tail just beyond the fins, a rear gunner in a turret. The NC.1070 had retractable tricycle gear, the nose leg slightly offset to port and each leg with a large single wheel.|$|E

Despite the small displacement it delivers 100 kilowatts (136 hp) with 250 N·m of torque at 1900 rpm. The engine is of the common rail type, which is more efficient and quieter than the conventional rotary pump injection systems. It {{is equipped with a}} particulate matter filter. The engine is linked to a Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) with 7 gears, and is a <b>mid-mount</b> in front of the rear axle ...|$|R
25|$|Gloster {{produced}} several design {{proposals in}} the hope of satisfying the requirement. P.228, drawn up in 1946, was essentially a two-seat Meteor with slightly swept wings. A similar design was also offered to the Royal Navy as the P.231. The later-issued P.234 and P.238 of early 1947 had adopted many of the features that would be distinctive of the Javelin, including the large delta wing and tailplane. The two differed primarily in role; P.234 was a single-seat day fighter with a V-tail, while P.238 was a two-seat night fighter with a <b>mid-mounted</b> delta tailplane.|$|E
25|$|It was an {{all-metal}} aircraft with a {{tricycle undercarriage}} and conventional low, straight wings with <b>mid-mounted</b> turbojet engines and a high-mounted tailplane {{clear of the}} jet exhaust. The Meteor F.1 exhibited some problematic flying characteristics typical of early jet aircraft; it suffered from stability problems at high transonic speeds, large trim changes, high stick forces and self-sustained yaw instability (snaking) caused by airflow separation over the thick tail surfaces. The longer fuselage of the Meteor T.7, a two-seater trainer, significantly reduced the aerodynamic instability that the early Meteors were known for.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the DH.100 used a single jet engine {{installed}} in an egg-shaped fuselage which was primarily composed of plywood for the forward section and aluminium throughout the aft section. It was furnished with conventional <b>mid-mounted</b> straight wings; air brakes were installed on the wings to slow the aircraft, better enabling it to manoeuvre into a firing position behind slower aircraft - a feature that had also been incorporated in the Meteor. Armament comprised four 20mm Hispano Mk V cannon located underneath the nose; from {{the onset of the}} design phase, even when the aircraft was officially intended to serve only as an experimental aircraft, the provision for the cannon armament had been included.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fire escape}} and ladder {{miniature}} {{used in the}} final chase sequence is {{on display at the}} Hollywood Museum in Hollywood. Also, the Santa Rosita Fire Department's ladder truck was a 1960s Seagrave Fire Apparatus open-cab <b>Mid-Mount</b> Aerial Ladder. Portions of the life-size building and fire escape were constructed on the Universal Studios back lot. In the original ending as conceived by Kramer, the heroes-turned-criminals in the prison hospital were visited by a non-sympathetic doctor (intended to be played by Groucho Marx), rather than Mrs. Marcus. His punchline would have been [...] "...don't believe what you see on TV because crime does not pay". That ending was dropped for the final one.|$|R
25|$|Ladder Companies are {{generally}} equipped with Seagrave aerials. Ladder length varies and often {{depends on the}} geographic area to which the unit is assigned. Those in the older sections of the city often use tiller trucks to allow for greater maneuverability. Before Seagrave was the predominant builder, Mack CF's built with Baker tower ladders were popular. Most FDNY aerials are built with 75’, 95' or 100' ladders. Tiller ladders, rear mount ladders and <b>mid-mount</b> tower ladders are the types of trucks used. In 2010, The FDNY chose Ferrara over Pierce, and E-One for a new contract that issued for 10–100' rear-mount ladder trucks, using a chassis and stainless steel cab custom-designed to FDNY specifications. Delivery {{of the first of}} these new trucks is anticipated in the 1st quarter of 2011.|$|R
50|$|Sutphen {{produces}} {{all types}} of fire related vehicles on their own chassis including the usual engines, ladders, and rescues but also provides bodies for commercial chassis applications. The company still produces <b>mid-mount</b> aerials as either a tower ladder platform (with a bucket/basket) or in a ladder tower form (no bucket) plus industrial application aerials today. On April 21, 2016 at FDIC International the company debuted its first ever rear-mount aerial with the Sutphen SLR 75. The following year Sutphen previewed a 108-foot model. Previously, Sutphen had produced tillers in the 1990s including a unique tiller-tower concept where the bucket of the tiller aerial also acted as the tillerman's cab. The concept {{never made it to}} production. All Sutphen aerials are made of Aluminum alloys and fastened with aircraft-type Huck Bolts. The hydraulics are custom designed and built by the company for their applications.|$|R
25|$|The M7A was an open-wheeled {{single-seater}} with a <b>mid-mounted</b> engine {{driving the}} rear wheels. The chassis was a bathtub-type (i.e. open-topped) monocoque made from 22-gauge aluminium alloy and 20-gauge magnesium alloy panels glued and riveted {{together and to}} three steel bulkheads. The monocoque terminated behind the driver's seat and the engine {{was used as a}} stressed part of the chassis, bolted directly to the rearmost bulkhead. The gearbox was then attached behind the engine, and the rear suspension – consisting of lateral top links, twin radius arms and reversed wishbones– attached to the gearbox and the rear bulkhead. The front suspension – upper and lower lateral links and radius arms – and the steering column were attached to the two bulkheads in front of the driver. Coilover springs and Koni dampers mounted outside of the body were employed front and rear.|$|E
25|$|The 703 was a wood framed {{aircraft}} {{covered with}} a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its cantilever <b>mid-mounted</b> wing had a single spar and an associated D-box, skinned in plywood, formed the leading edge. The wing was fabric covered behind the spar. The leading edge was straight from root to tip, with slight sweep-back. From root out almost to half-span the wing tapered in plan only gently but further out, where the trailing edge was entirely formed by the aileron the wing tapered more strongly to a rounded tip. The NACA-derived airfoil provided a high maximum lift coefficient and small pitching moments and the wing had washout to avoid tip stall. There were Schempp-Hirth style airbrakes mounted on the rear of the spar in the central section, extending above and below the wing. On the first two 703s the central sections were set with strong (6.5°) dihedral and the outer section with none, forming a gull wing. The third 703 had the same wing but with constant dihedral from root to tip.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Motor Racing Developments, {{the owners}} of the Brabham Formula One Team, were sold to Alfa Romeo. [...] Wishing to revive the Procar series, Brabham and Alfa Romeo {{developed}} a prototype racing car using a <b>mid-mounted</b> Formula One-based V10 engine, covered in a bodywork silhouette mimicking the Alfa Romeo 164. Alfa Romeo intended to use identical copies of the car for a resurrected Procar series, but the plans never came to fruition and only the prototype was built.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mid-mounted</b> {{wings are}} of cropped-delta configuration. Near the wing root are the LERX, which {{generate}} a vortex that provides extra lift to the wing at high angles of attack encountered during combat manoeuvres. A conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement is incorporated, with all-moving stabilators, single vertical stabiliser, rudder, and twin ventral fins. The {{flight control surfaces}} are operated by a computerised flight control system (FCS), which also adjusts the slats/flaps for improved manoeuvrability. Up to [...] of ordnance, equipment, and fuel can be mounted under the hardpoints, {{two of which are}} on the wing-tips, four are under the wings and one is under the fuselage.|$|E
500|$|The Il-30 was a {{follow-on}} to the Il-28, although design {{began on}} 21 June 1948, before the Il-28 had flown. It {{was designed to}} meet a requirement for a jet bomber that could carry [...] {{to a range of}} [...] with a maximum speed no less than [...] The design took that of the Il-28 as a starting point, but had thin, <b>mid-mounted</b> swept wings with a 35° sweep angle, chosen to allow the aircraft to reach its required speed. It was intended to be powered by two new Lyulka TR-3 axial-flow turbojet engines with 45.1kN (10,140lbf) thrust each in wing-mounted nacelles. Both the fuselage and the nacelles were area ruled.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the limited}} {{success of the}} 150, drastic changes were {{introduced}} to improve performance and ease of maintenance. The RD-10 engine, rated at [...] of thrust, {{was moved to the}} front of the nose and its cowling formed the bottom of the forward fuselage. This position minimized thrust losses due to the length of the intake duct and allowed the engine to be changed much more easily than its predecessor. The cockpit was widened and moved to a position over the mid-set wings, even with the engine's exhaust nozzle. The pilot's seat back was armored and he was protected by an armor plate to his front and a bulletproof windscreen. Three fuel tanks were positioned ahead of the cockpit and one behind it with a total capacity of [...] of fuel. The removable, <b>mid-mounted</b> wings used several different laminar flow airfoils over their span. Each wing had a single spar, slotted flaps and ailerons. The tricycle undercarriage retracted into the fuselage, which meant that the aircraft had a very narrow ground track. The aircraft was armed with three [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, two on the starboard side of the aircraft's nose and the other on the port side. Each gun had 50 rounds of ammunition.|$|E
500|$|The OKB chose a [...] "pod-and-boom" [...] layout {{for their}} new fighter, the I-300 (also called the izdeliye F (model or product F) by the OKB) because it offered the {{advantages}} of improved landing performance and better visibility from the cockpit when landing but it had some drawbacks, such as the unfamiliar tricycle arrangement of the landing gear, protecting the rear fuselage from the jet exhaust, and where to place the aircraft's armament. The all-metal aircraft had unswept, <b>mid-mounted</b> wings with two prominent air intakes in the nose. Its two-spar wings were fitted with slotted flaps and Frise ailerons. Its powerplant comprised two RD-20 turbojets, which were Soviet-manufactured versions of the BMW 003. The two engines were located behind the cockpit in the lower fuselage, with the exhaust exiting under the tail unit. A steel laminate heatshield was installed {{on the bottom of}} the rear fuselage to protect it from the exhaust gasses. There were four bag-type fuel tanks in the fuselage and three in each wing, providing a total internal fuel capacity of 1,625 liters (429 US gallons). The cockpit was not pressurized. The planned armament consisted of a 57mm NL-57 cannon mounted in the centerline engine intake bulkhead and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon mounted on the lower lip of the air intakes. The N-57 gun was provided with 28 rounds and the two NS-23 cannons had 80 rounds each.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1943 {{the company}} {{produced}} the OQ-7, essentially an OQ-3 with some cleanups {{and a new}} <b>mid-mounted,</b> slightly swept wing. This reached [...] but was not taken into production.|$|E
2500|$|The Hispano drove a two-blade {{propeller}} with a pointed spinner; it was cooled by a rectangular radiator {{on each side}} of the fuselage between the wings. [...] The fuselage was flat sided with rounded decking, tapering aft to the <b>mid-mounted</b> tailplane, where the vertical tail was broad and low. [...] The Š-14 landed on a fixed conventional tailskid undercarriage.|$|E
2500|$|With a short wheelbase, <b>mid-mounted</b> winch, {{and short}} overhang, the body {{could only be}} [...] feet long. Both sides had {{sideboards}} with fold down troop seats and bows for a tarpaulin. Two spare tires were mounted inside the body, one along each side. Early models had all steel bodies, in 1942 they were replaced by largely wood types to conserve steel. All Corbitts (3,077) were prime movers, White also built 3,547.|$|E
2500|$|Prime movers {{were used}} to tow field {{artillery}} pieces, they also transported gun crews, equipment, and ammunition. They had a pintle hitch at the rear for towing up to [...] Another pintle at the front {{could be used to}} emplace the piece. A <b>mid-mounted</b> [...] winch had a centered cable drum and a capstan on the right side. Pulleys and rollers routed the cable under the body and out the rear frame cross-member.|$|E
2500|$|The {{engine was}} front <b>mid-mounted</b> with a {{rear-mounted}} transaxle, giving a 49/51 front/rear weight distribution. Slotted Brembo brakes were also standard. The original V8 Vantage could accelerate to 60mph (97km/h) in 4.7 seconds topping out at [...] Vantages with the enhanced 400bhp {{version of the}} 4.3L V8 engine (included with the [...] "N400" [...] package or available individually as a Power Upgrade kit) as well as later models with the 4.7L V8 and 5.9 L V12.|$|E
2500|$|Nakajima's design {{featured}} a <b>mid-mounted</b> wing of small area and high aspect ratio, a {{tricycle landing gear}} and a large single-fin rudder. Power came from four 2,000hp Nakajima NK9K-L [...] "Homare" [...] 24 radial engines with Hitachi 92 turbosuperchargers and driving four-bladed propellers. The engines were cooled by counter-rotating fans positioned just inside the engine cowlings. Defensive armament included power-operated nose, dorsal, ventral and tail turrets along with two free-swiveling machine guns at the beam positions.|$|E
2500|$|At ILA 1984 in Hanover Wolf Hoffmann {{presented}} a mock-up {{for a new}} project based on the Hoffmann Dimona motor-glider, called Hoffmann Visonar, before being renamed. [...] The Observer's design aim was long endurance with minimal fuel burn, combined with extremely good vision from the cockpit. [...] To obtain this, the conventional tractor propeller is driven by a <b>mid-mounted</b> engine placed behind the two side-by-side seats. [...] This location for the power-plant was intended to leave the nose clear of obstruction. [...] Since the canopy glazing extends to the crew's feet, vision {{was expected to be}} far better than from a conventional aircraft, and not far from that from some helicopters.|$|E
2500|$|The Platypus has the {{extended}} plywood skinned ES-60 wing, {{built around a}} single spar. The leading edge is unswept but the straight trailing edges have forward sweep that increases on the outer, aileron-carrying, panels. [...] There are airbrakes mounted just aft of the spar on the inner panels. These wings were <b>mid-mounted</b> onto a new GRP fuselage. [...] This has a maximum width of 1.20m (3ft11in) to accommodate the side by side seating but narrowed in pod and boom style, particularly in plan, behind the wings. The cockpit has a two-piece fixed screen extending almost to the nose and is accessed via a rear hinged, bulged canopy. [...] The pod includes a fixed, faired, centre-line two wheel undercarriage, with a brake-equipped mainwheel under the wings and a smaller nosewheel.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{mechanically}} propelled two-wheel vehicle is believed {{by some to}} have been built by Kirkpatrick MacMillan, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839. A nephew later claimed that his uncle developed a rear-wheel drive design using <b>mid-mounted</b> treadles connected by rods to a rear crank, similar to the transmission of a steam locomotive. Proponents associate him with the first recorded instance of a bicycling traffic offence, when a Glasgow newspaper reported in 1842 an accident in which an anonymous [...] "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design" [...] knocked over a pedestrian in the Gorbals and was fined five British shillings. However, the evidence connecting this with MacMillan is weak, since {{it is unlikely that}} the artisan MacMillan would have been termed a gentleman, nor is the report clear on how many wheels the vehicle had. [...] The evidence is unclear, and may have been faked by his son.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>mid-mounted</b> 5.4L Modular V8 {{engine is}} all-aluminum with a Lysholm twin screw-type supercharger. It {{features}} a forged rotating assembly housed in an aluminum block {{designed specifically for}} the GT program. A dry sump oiling system is employed, allowing the engine to sit low in the car's frame. The DOHC 4-valve heads are a revision of the 2000 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra R cylinder heads (with slightly increased wall casting thickness in the exhaust port). The camshafts have unique specifications, with more lift and duration than {{those found in the}} Shelby GT500. Power output is [...] at 6500 rpm and generates [...] of torque at 3750 rpm. [...] A Ricardo six-speed manual transmission is fitted featuring a helical limited-slip differential. Car and Driver tested the GT in January 2004 and recorded a 0-60 time of 3.3 seconds, with a 5-60 time of 3.7 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The 997 GT2 has a twin {{turbocharged}} 3.6 litre 6-cylinder engine {{based on}} 997 Turbo, but the 997 GT2 uses a {{rear wheel drive}} layout for reduced weight, and boasts a power increase from a newly designed expansion intake manifold, and shorter turbo intake manifolds. Further, a full titanium silencer was fitted to the 997 GT2. Despite the power hike, Porsche claims fuel consumption at full throttle is improved by 15 percent compared with the 997 Turbo.
