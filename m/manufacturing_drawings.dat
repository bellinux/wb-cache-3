40|$|Abstract – Engineering {{design is}} an {{essential}} part of the engineering curriculum, and it is important to select projects with appropriate scope and challenge to develop the desired skills subject to constraints on time, student ability and available resources. This paper considers two types of projects typically encountered in capstone design: detailed design projects, and conceptual design projects. Detailed design projects usually have a goal of constructing and testing a physical prototype, and the main focus is on CAD modeling, detailed analysis, engineering <b>drawings,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> processes, prototype fabrication, and testing. Conceptual design projects focus on the conceptual design stages, and typically do not result in a prototype. These projects are more open-ended, and focus on problem definition, background research, order-of-magnitude analysis, numerical simulation, technical and economic feasibility, and consideration of nontechnical aspects including impact on society and the environment. This paper compares and contrasts the two types of projects in terms of their characteristics, and evaluates them based on the CEAB Graduate Attributes. Both types of projects provide valuable and complementary design experience, and each type emphasizes different attributes...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the world}} of {{computer}} graphics, images are often treated as “stand alone ” entities that are used for dedicated purposes.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was the {{fabrication}} of ossicular replacement prostheses (ORPs) from decellularized banked cortical bone via computer numerically controlled (CNC) ultraprecision micromilling, in order to obtain preformed clinical-grade tissue products, reproducing shape, size, and details perfectly comparable to those of synthetic devices. Methods: Banked femoral compact bone was used to fabricate partial and total ORPs via CNC micromilling according to Good <b>Manufacturing</b> Practices procedures. <b>Drawings</b> of ORPs with different shapes and sizes were uploaded to the computer interface, and different surface-finish parameters were tested. The obtained products underwent dimensional, weight, and surface characterizations. A histologic analysis was pursued to compare the bone matrix compactness of the produced ORPs to that of the ear ossicles. Results: Banked-bone ORPs were produced with high dimensional accuracy. Partial ORP weights averaged (±SD) 31. 2 ± 0. 6 mg, and total ORP weights averaged 69. 3 ± 0. 7 mg. The best-finish mode allowed microscale or nanoscale roughness free from machinery textures to be obtained. Finally, the histologic analysis confirmed that the extracellular matrix compactness of the produced ORPs was suitable for ossicular chain replacement. Conclusions: This study assesses the fabrication feasibility of novel banked-bone ORPs of extremely high dimensional accuracy. Such devices are aimed at combining the most favorable aspects of both synthetic (reproducibility, convenience, and biosafety) and biological replacements (total biocompatibility) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the best {{practices of the}} Vehicle Design Team for VIPA. The functions of the VIPA Vehicle Design (VVD) discipline team are to maintain the controlled reference geometry and provide linked, simplified geometry {{for each of the}} other discipline analyses. The core of the VVD work, and the approach for VVD s first task of controlling the reference geometry, involves systems engineering, top-down, layout-based CAD modeling within a Product Data Manager (PDM) development environment. The top- down approach allows for simple control of very large, integrated assemblies and greatly enhances the ability to generate trade configurations and reuse data. The second VVD task, model simplification for analysis, is handled within the managed environment through application of the master model concept. In this approach, there is a single controlling, or master, product definition dataset. Connected to this master model are reference datasets with live geometric and expression links. The referenced models can be for <b>drawings,</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> visualization, embedded analysis, or analysis simplification. A discussion of web based interaction, including visualization, between the design and other disciplines is included. Demonstrated examples are cited, including the Space Launch Initiative development cycle, the Saturn V systems integration and verification cycle, an Orbital Space Plane study, and NASA Exploration Office studies of Shuttle derived and clean sheet launch vehicles. The VIPA Team has brought an immense amount of detailed data to bear on program issues.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based upon the work done at Westinghouse {{electric}} company (WEC) in Västerås during the spring semester of 2015 and describes the development of a quick coupler with associated blade changing tool. These are meant to be used together with a sawing tool that the company uses for the dismantling of nuclear reactors, which is performed under water. The aim of the thesis was to develop a complete <b>manufacturing</b> documentation with <b>drawings</b> and related CAD models which Westinghouse later can use to manufacture the tool and the quick coupler. It was also included in the assignment to, if necessary, modify parts of the saw tool to adapt these to the intended blade changing tool. A number of visits to the company's workshop was made during the time to study the saw that the thesis {{is based upon}}. The purpose of these visits was to get a better idea of the dimensions, construction and the field of use of the saw. On three of those occasions various engineers and consultants accompanied us to discuss possible problems with different ideas. This was interspersed with information in the form of literature studies on quick couplers to create a clearer picture {{of the nature of the}} task. When enough information had been gathered a functional analysis was made to divide the main problem into sub this phase the idea and concept generating process took place. The methods used for this was mainly brain writing and brainstorming. When enough ideas and concepts had been generated the most promising ideas was selected by using an evaluation matrix, in which the various suggestions were weighted against the parameters that our supervisor thought mattered the most. The next step was to create a computer model of the best concept and finding suitable components in worm gear, electric motor, planetary gears, screws, etc. During the modeling phase further developed of the concept was made until the tool and quick coupler received its final shape whereupon the manufacturing documentation was created...|$|R
40|$|NEXUS, the NASA Engineering Extendible Unified Software system, is a {{research}} set of computer programs designed to support the full sequence of activities encountered in NASA engineering projects. This sequence spans preliminary design, design analysis, detailed design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing. NEXUS primarily addresses the process of prototype engineering, the task of getting a single or small number of copies of a product to work. Prototype engineering is a critical element of large scale industrial production. The time and cost needed to introduce a new product are heavily dependent on two factors: 1) how efficiently required product prototypes can be developed, and 2) how efficiently required production facilities, also a prototype engineering development, can be completed. NEXUS extendibility and unification are achieved by organizing the system as an arbitrarily large set of computer programs accessed in a common manner through a standard user interface. The NEXUS interface is a multipurpose interactive graphics interface called NASCAD (NASA Computer Aided Design). NASCAD {{can be used to}} build and display two and three-dimensional geometries, to annotate models with dimension lines, text strings, etc., and to store and retrieve design related information such as names, masses, and power requirements of components used in the design. From the user's standpoint, NASCAD allows the construction, viewing, modification, and other processing of data structures that represent the design. Four basic types of data structures are supported by NASCAD: 1) three-dimensional geometric models of the object being designed, 2) alphanumeric arrays to hold data ranging from numeric scalars to multidimensional arrays of numbers or characters, 3) tabular data sets that provide a relational data base capability, and 4) procedure definitions to combine groups of system commands or other user procedures to create more powerful functions. NASCAD has extensive abilities to handle IGES format data, including proposed solid geometry formats. This facilitates interfacing with other CAD systems. NEXUS/NASCAD supports the activities encountered in various engineering projects as follows: 1) Preliminary Design - Geometric models can be built from points, lines, arcs, splines, polygons, drive surfaces, ruled surfaces, and bicubic spline surfaces. Geometric models can be displayed in any view (including hidden line and hidden surface removal) to check design features, 2) Design Analysis - Geometric models and related data structures can be used to build a NASTRAN data deck. Calculated stress data can be added to model data structures and displayed as color variations on the geometric model, 3) Detailed Design - This phase consists of dimensioning and annotating the geometric model and generating <b>manufacturing</b> and assembly <b>drawings,</b> 4) <b>Manufacturing</b> - NASCAD developed geometric model and related data structures can be used to build input for the APT program which generates a cutter location (CL) file describing required tool motions, 5) Assembly - Generation of a robot plan for putting together or taking apart (repair) of a mechanical assembly based on an IGES solid geometry description, and 6) Testing - Correlation of test data can be made with predictions made during the design analysis phase. NEXUS/NASCAD is available by license for a period of ten (10) years to approved licensees. The licensed program product includes the source, executable code, command streams, and one set of documentation. Additional documentation may be purchased separately at any time. The NASTRAN and APT programs are distributed separately from the NEXUS/NASCAD system (contact COSMIC for details). The NEXUS/NASCAD system is written in FORTRAN 77 and PROLOG, with command streams in DEC Control Language (DCL), for interactive execution under VMS on a DEC VAX series computer. All of the PROLOG code deals with the robot strategy planner feature. A minimum recommended configuration is a DEC VAX with 1 megabyte of real memory, 100 megabytes of disk storage, and a floating point accelerator. For interactive graphics, NEXUS/NASCAD currently supports Tektronix 4114, 4016, 4115, & 4095 terminal, Lexidata Solidview terminals, and Ramtek 9400 terminals. Most features are supported on the VT 125, and the non-graphics features are available from any text terminal. The NEXUS/NASCAD system was first released in 1984 and was last updated in 1986...|$|R
