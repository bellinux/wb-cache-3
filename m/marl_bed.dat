The occurrence of very finegrained black sediments together with pyrite and a fine undisturbed lamination point to an euxinic depositional environment in the lower parts of the small fish clay basins. The material of the fish clay seems to be of mainly terrigenous origin, containing quartz and feldspar, while mixed-layer clay minerals are probably of diagenetic origin.

Using literature, {{identification of the}} first representatives of I. albeari appeared to be very confusing. In this study descriptions of I. albeari are compared and a consistent definition is proposed. Igorinid specimens with an incipient keel {{are considered to be}} I. albeari. Flattening of the last chambers and the fusion of muricae on the peripheral margin may indicate such a slight keel. This keel enables an unambiguous distinction between I. pusilla and the first form of I. albeari and is in keeping with the original descriptions without introducing an intermediate species. In the southern Tethys, the lowest occurrence of I. albeari occurs just prior to the pinkish-brown <b>marl</b> <b>bed</b> in Egypt and immediately overlies the glauconitic bed in Tunisia. Furthermore, the NTp 7 A/NTp 7 B subzonal boundary, delineated by the lowest occurrence of Chiasmolithus edentulous, is in close correlation with these marker beds. In Egypt C. edentulous appears 1 m below the entry of I. albeari, whereas in Tunisia they coappear. This implies significant erosion at the glauconitic bed in the studied parts of the Tunisian Trough and a more complete succession at the dark-brown <b>marl</b> <b>bed</b> in the Nile Valley. These marker beds can also be correlated to a level of minor lithologic change in {{the upper part of the}} Danian Limestone Formation in the Zumaia section through the lowest occurrence of Chiasmolithus edentulous. The distinct lithologic change in Zumaia, from the Danian Limestone to the Itzurun Formation, however, appears to be ~ 600 kyr younger than what we now call upper Danian event beds, in Tunisia and Egypt...|$|E

Nickel boride {{was used as a}} desulphurizing agent to recover sulphur-bound lipids from the polar and asphaltene fractions. Carbon isotopic compositions (delta vs PDB) of free hydrocarbons and of S-bound hydrocarbons were also measured. Relationships between these carbon skeletons, precursor biolipids, and the organisms producing them could then be examined. Concentrations of S-bound lipids and free hydrocarbons and their delta values were plotted vs depth in the <b>marl</b> <b>bed</b> and the profiles were interpreted in terms of variations in source organisms, 13 C contents of the carbon source, and environmentally induced changes in isotopic fractionation. The overall range of delta values measured was 24. 7 %, from - 11. 6 % for a component derived from green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) to - 36. 3 % for a lipid derived from purple sulphur bacteria (Chromatiaceae). Deconvolution of mixtures of components deriving from multiple sources (green and purple sulphur bacteria, coccolithophorids, microalgae and higher plants) was sometimes possible because both quantitative and isotopic data were available and because either the free or S-bound pool sometimes appeared to contain material from a single source. Several free n-alkanes and S-bound lipids appeared to be specific products of upper-water-column primary producers (i. e. algae and cyanobacteria). Others derived from anaerobic photoautotrophs and from heterotrophic protozoa (ciliates), which apparently fed partly on Chlorobiaceae. Four groups of n-alkanes produced by algae or cyanobacteria were also recognized based on systematic variations of abundance and isotopic composition with depth. For hydrocarbons probably derived from microalgae, isotopic variations are well correlated with those of total organic carbon. A resistant aliphatic biomacromolecule produced by microalgae is, therefore, probably {{an important component of the}} kerogen. These variations reflect changes in the depositional environment and early diagenetic transformations. Changes in the concentrations of S-bound lipids induced by variations in conditions favourable for sulphurization were discriminated from those related to variations in primary producer assemblages. The water column of the lagoonal basin was stratified and photic zone anoxia occurred during the early and middle stages of marl deposition. During the last stage of the marl deposition the stratification collapsed due to a significant shallowing of the water column. Contributions from anaerobic photoautotrophs were apparently associated with variations in depth of the chemocline...|$|E
40|$|Kerogens {{isolated}} from nine samples {{from a single}} <b>marl</b> <b>bed</b> of the Gessoso-solfifera formation in the Vena del Gesso basin (Upper Miocene, Italy) were treated with CrCl 2 and Li/EtNH 2 to remove inorganic and organic sulphur, respectively. The untreated and 'desulphurized' (CrCl 2 and Li/EtNH 2) kerogens were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Typically, significant variations in the relative contributions and abundances of n-alk- 1 -enes/n-alkanes, alkylated pyrroles, thiophenes and supposedly S-bound moieties released as phytenes and sterenes were observed. The first series of products (n-hydrocarbons) contributed relatively more to the pyrolyzates of the desulphurized kerogens, suggesting an enrichment of microalgal-derived aliphatic macromolecules. These marine micro-organisms are thought to belong {{in part to the}} class of Eustigmatophyceae. Alkylated pyrroles were barely detectable in the untreated kerogen pyrolyzates, whereas they contributed significantly to those from the treated kerogens. Similar treatment of a porphyrin, octaethylporphyrin, revealed that alkyl porphyrins are thermally too stable to be cleaved upon pyrolysis. However, Li/EtNH 2 treatment reduced the porphyrin standard, such that it could generate mainly monopyrroles upon pyrolysis. It is concluded that Li/EtNH 2 treatment reduced tetrapyrrole moieties bound to the desulphurized kerogen network...|$|E

Relationships between {{the nature of the}} pyrolysis products and the source organisms were determined. The high abundance of (i) algal-derived components (n-alkanes and n-alk- 1 -enes) and (ii) sulphur-containing and sulphur-bound products signifying a high degree of early diagenetic sulphurization were observed. Presence of photic zone anoxia during the deposition of these sediments was discussed via the presence of 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetramethylbenzene in the pyrolysates. Unusual distributions were found for three series of pyrolysis products (i. e. C 13 and C 14 n-alkylated thiophenes and thiolanes and C 12 and C 13 n- 1, 3 -alkadienes were by far the major products of these series) in the pyrolysates of two samples corresponding {{to the middle of the}} cycle (samples 3 and 5) which also have the highest 13 CTOC values and the highest pyrolysis yields. Therefore, the contribution of organisms biosynthesizing resistant algal biopolymer was considered as much more important during the deposition of the sediments associated with samples 3 and 5.

40|$|A global faunal crisis {{close to}} the Eifelian-Givetian stage {{boundary}} in the mid-Devonian has been purported {{to be related to}} the impact of one or two major extraterrestrial bodies. This was based on unusual mineralogical and chemical features within a distinct composite <b>marl</b> <b>bed,</b> at a level c. 40 cm below the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Eifelian-Givetian boundary at Jebel Mech Irdane in Morocco. The impact relation has been challenged based partly on the absence of platinum group element data. We present here detailed Ir, Os, Pd and Pt as well as Os isotopic data across the bed at Mech Irdane and from a correlated 10 cm bed at a nearby site, Rich Haroun. Iridium concentrations of 0. 13 - 0. 28 ng/g in the beds represent a small enrichment compared to average shale, but Ir/Al ratios are only a factor 1. 5 - 2 higher than background at respective site. Such small enrichments can readily be explained by terrestrial diagenetic processes, and do not require the presence of an extraterrestrial component. On an Al-normalized basis Pd and Pt show weak enrichments, typically a factor 2 - 4 higher than background. High Os- 187 /(OS) -O- 188 ratios, 1. 1 - 3. 8, reflect ingrowth of radiogenic Os from Re, which is also evident from Os concentrations of up to 3 ng/g. The platinum group inter-element ratios are clearly non-chondritic. The overall platinum group and trace element (e. g. Co, Ni, As, V) patterns indicate that diagenetic processes at redox fronts have played a crucial role in shaping most element enrichments. If an excess siderophile-rich extraterrestrial component exists in these beds it represents less than 0. 2 %. by weight. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|The Tanjero {{formation}} {{has been}} studied from a sequential stratigraphic point of view by Minas (1997) who includes the lower and middle parts as (TST) and (HST), respectively. In this work, we recognize that the Tanjero formation consists of a shelf-margin system tract (SMST, TST and HST) and extends from the Late Early Maastrichtian to the Early Late Maastrichtian, in both zones (IZ) and (HFTZ), while, remarkably, it disappears in the LFTZ and towards the Kurdistan platform. The shelf-margin system tract {{is characterized by a}} low-stand wedge and land-stand fans that are rich in pebbly sandstone conglomerates and breciated or slumped rudist fragments (especially in the IZ sections, Fig.  4, 4 – 8) with a Ta–Tb-dominated coarse Baume sequence that alternates with deep marine planktonic-rich marl facies. The retrogradational stacking pattern shows a progressive increase in deep facies which overlies shallow facies, and this points to rapid transgressions and progressive increase in marl facies with a fine sandstone bed that indicates distal facies. The maximum flooding surface, MFS 180, {{at the top of the}} transgressive system tract (TST) is represented by 20 – 50 -m-thick marl and shale beds that are very rich in planktonic foraminifera of the Gansserina gansseri zone and associated with a condensed section that is rich in deep planktonic foraminifera (Fig.  4, 9 – 11). The highstand aggradational stacking pattern is characterized by a thick <b>marl</b> <b>bed</b> and very thin bioturbated sandstone that is characterized by Bouma horizons of Td and Te. The late HST shows a shallowing upwards overall parasequence, hence a progressional stacked parasequence associated with increasing proximal turbidites. A pebbly sandstone bed about 2 – 5  m thick, with a ball and pillow sedimentary structure, alternates with sandy to a sea level fall during the Late Maastrichtian. That is also manifested by the SBT 2 at the boundary between the Tanjero and Aqra formations (Fig.  5, 2 – 5). This boundary combined by the disappearance of the planktonic foraminifera (outer-shelf depth more than 150  m) and appearance of large foraminifera, with predominance of Hippurites, indicates variation in water depth from tens to only few metres.|$|E

In order to refute it, it is necessary to propose an alternative mechanism for generating these cyclic bands, or for erosion to have coincidentally removed {{just the right amount of}} sediment everywhere before the gypsum was deposited. The proponents claim that the gypsum was deposited directly above the correlated marl layers, and slumped into them, giving the appearance of an unconformable contact. However, their opponents seize upon this apparent inconformity, and claim that the Sorbas basin was exposed—therefore eroding—while the Mediterranean sea was depositing evaporites.

This report deals primarily with the distribution and chemical composition of these carbonate deposits and the uses for which they are suited.

They are quarried in large quantities in the southeastern part of the state, where the lower Ordovician rocks are predominantly dolomitic limestones. Limestones high in calcium are far less abundant, being confined to several strata that are more limited in their distribution. Locally they have been quarried for their high lime content.

Successful exploration and development of the Eagle Ford Shale Play requires reservoir characterization, recognition of fluid regions, and the application of optimal operational practices in all regions. Using stratigraphic and petrophysical analyses, we evaluated key parameters, of reservoir depth and thickness, fluid composition, reservoir pressure, total organic carbon (TOC), and number of limestone and organic-rich marl interbeds of the Lower Eagle Ford Shale. Spatial statistics were used to identify key reservoir parameters affecting Eagle Ford production. We built reservoir models of various fluid regions and history matched production data. Well deliverability was modeled to optimize oil production rate by designing appropriate operational parameters. From NW to SE, Eagle Ford fluids evolve from oil, to gas condensate and, finally, to dry gas, reflecting greater depth and thermal maturity. From outcrop, the Eagle Ford Shale dips southeastward; depth exceeds 13, 000 ft at the Sligo Shelf Margin. We divided Eagle Ford Shale into three layers. The Lower Eagle Ford is present throughout the study area; it is more than 275 ft thick in the Maverick Basin depocenter and thins to less than 50 ft on the northeast. In the Lower Eagle Ford Shale, a strike-elongate trend of high TOC, high average gamma ray values, and low bulk density extends from Maverick Co. northeastward through Guadalupe Co. Both limestone and organic-rich <b>marl</b> <b>beds</b> increase in number from fewer than 2 near outcrop to more than 20 at the shelf margins. Average thicknesses of Lower Eagle Ford limestone and organic-rich <b>marl</b> <b>beds</b> are low (< 5 ft.) in the La Salle ? DeWitt trend, coincident with the most productive gas and oil wells. Eagle Ford Shale was divided into 5 production regions in South Texas that coincide with the regional, strike-elongate trends of geologic parameters, which suggests that these parameters significantly impact Eagle Ford Shale production. Eagle Ford Shale production (barrels of oil equivalent, BOE) increases consistently with depth, increases with Lower Eagle Ford thickness (up to 180 -ft thickness), and increases with TOC (up to 7 %). P values analyses suggest high certainty {{of the relationship between the}} production and five reservoir parameters tested in regression models. Multiple good history matches of a gas condensate well suggest significant uncertainties in reservoir parameters. Oil production rate is not sensitive to oil relative permeability for the gas condensate well model. We were unable to match the production history for the volatile oil wells, possibly because gas of lift.

40|$|The {{nature of}} rhythmic carbonate-rich {{successions}} such as limestone^marl alternations has been, and still is, subject to controversy. The {{possibility of an}} entirely diagenetic origin for the rhythmic calcareous alternations is discarded by most authors. One problem with an entirely diagenetic, self-organized development of limestone^marl alternations {{is the fact that}} limestone and <b>marl</b> <b>beds</b> in many examples are laterally continuous over hundreds of meters or even kilometers. In an entirely self-organized system, lateral coupling would be very limited; thus one would expect that, rather than laterally continuous beds, randomly distributed elongate nodules would form. We address the origin of limestone^marl alternations using a computer model that simulates differential diagenesis of rhythmic calcareous successions. The setup uses a cellular automaton model to test whether laterally extensive, rhythmic calcareous alternations could develop from homogeneous sediments in a process of self-organization. Our model is a strong simplification of early diagenesis in fine-grained, partly calcareous sediments. It includes the relevant key mechanisms to the question whether an external trigger is required in order to obtain laterally extensive limestone^ marl alternations. Our model shows that diagenetic self-organization alone is not sufficient to produce laterally extensive, correlatable beds. Although an external control on bedding formation could be considered to have solved the problem as commonly assumed, we here suggest an interesting third possibility: the rhythmic alternations wer...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} area, Upper Miocene-Lower Pliocene aged Ulumuhsine {{formation}}, {{was formed in}} a shallow, open lake and river environment. The lithologies of this formation are thin-medium bedded, laminated and fossil rich limestone, thin-thick bedded mudstone, thin-thick <b>bedded</b> <b>marl,</b> thin-thick <b>bedded</b> dolomite with stromatolite interbedded limestone, tuffite, chert bands and coal-rich levels. In addition, it includes conglomerates and sandstones of underwater distrubution channels in lacustrine, and channel and bar sediments in stream environments. Red, gray, rarely green colored sandstones are thin-thick bedded, and in some levels well sorting, in some levels proorly sorting. They present sedimentary structures, as graded, herringbone cross-bedding, symmetric ripple-marks, and laminate. Sandstones are named lithic arenite and lithic graywacke and litharenite, feldspathic litharenite and sublithic arenite. These sandstones are rich rock fragments and quartzs, in addition they contain plagioclase, biotite, muskovite, opaque mineral and epidote. Binding materials of sandstones are mainly calcite cements and clay matrix, and iron oxide cement in little amount. From the mineralogical and textural point of view. As a tectonic environment, {{the main source of}} sandstones are recycled orogen (thrust, collision and land uplift) and recyded lithic fragments...|$|R

40|$|Global {{temperatures}} rose 6 °C {{from the}} late Paleocene ca. 58 Ma to the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) ca. 52 – 50 Ma. Superimposed, were certainly two geologically brief (< 200 kyr) intervals of extreme warming, the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) and Eocene thermal maximum 2 (ETM- 2 or H- 1); at least four more events, H- 2, I- 1, I- 2 and K/X, probably occurred. Both the longterm rise and short-term “hyperthermals” {{have been linked to}} massive injections of 13 C-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system and greater continental weathering. However, relationships remain uncertain, principally because detailed and coupled proxy records do not extend across the entire interval of interest. Mead Stream, New Zealand, exposes a 650 m-thick sequence of limestone originally deposited on an upper continental slope {{from the late}} Cretaceous to the middle Eocene. Previous work has provided accurate ages for this expanded section, and has shown that the PETM, ETM- 2, H- 2, I- 1 and I- 2 hyperthermals are marked by pronounced negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) and clay-rich horizons (marls), the latter caused by excess terrigenous dilution. 283 new samples were collected, mostly above the I- 2 event; these were analyzed for carbonate content, lithology, and bulk carbonate carbon isotopes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Near {{the town}} of Zumaya in {{northern}} Spain, upper Maastrichtian strata consist of limestone/marl rhythms with thin, interbedded sandstones. The marls and limestones are primarily pelagic and hemipelagic deposits, while the sandstones {{are the product of}} turbidity currents. Stratigraphic variations m the volume of marl and limestone form three hierarchical or composite cycles. The first-order cycles consist of 20 - 30 -m alternations between stratal sequences consisting of interbedded limestone and marl, and sequences composed almost exclusively of marl. Within the interbedded limestone/marl sequences, econd-order cycles occur that consist of 5 - 10 -m alternations between limestone or marl domination. The third-order cycles consist of the bed-by-bed alternation of limestone and marl. These three composite cycles are the product of shifts in the clay-carbonate ratio on various rock- and time-stratigraphic scales. In order to determine if the cyelicity was the result of changes in the supply of siliciclastic material or carbonate material, detailed stratigraphic measurements were made of volume percent, average bed thickness, and stratigraphic frequency for each lithoiogy. Product-moment coefficients indicate that a negative correlation exists between percentage marl and sandstone frequency and a positive correlation exists between limestone percent and sandstone frequency. Assuming that turbidite deposition is not genetically related to limestone or marl deposition, the correlation coefficients suggest that there were increased sedimentation rates during marl accumulation. Correlation coefficients also showed that increases in amount of marl in a section occur through bed thickening rather than the increased number of <b>marl</b> <b>beds.</b> In contrast, limestone-dominated intervals are achieved by reduction of marl-be...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} Silurian carbonates from Gotland (Sweden) {{have led to}} a model for the {{development}} of limestone–marl alternations. This model postulates that early diagenesis of precursor sediments without strong primary differences can result in a differentiation by selective dissolution of aragonite in <b>marl</b> <b>beds</b> and reprecipitation of calcite cement in limestone beds. This model is described as a set of mathematical equations that quantify the diagenetic processes (aragonite dissolution and calcite reprecipitation) that occur during the formation of limestone–marl interbeds from a hypothetical homogeneous precursor sediment. The calculations demonstrate that resulting hypothetical limestone–marl alternations show characteristic mathematical relationships between the ratios of the bed thicknesses of limestones and marls on one side, and the carbonate contents, on the other. By reversing this model, the original mineralogical composition of the precursor sediment of real-world rhythmic successions can be determined. In this study, alternations from the Silurian of Gotland, the Cambrian, Devonian, and Mississippian of North America, the Jurassic of France and Germany, and the Cretaceous of France are shown to exhibit mathematical relationships similar to those calculated for hypothetical precursor sediments without primary differences. Therefore, the mineralogical composition of their precursor sediments can be estimated. In contrast, the clear mismatch shown by the Lower Jurassic Belemnite Marls from Dorset indicates that these rhythms did not suffer an early diagenetic overprint. Our model helps to differentiate between rhythmites with strong depositional variations and those without; however, it cannot indicate whether a given alternation is the product of rhythmic diagenesis of a homogeneous precursor sediment or the result of diagenetic enhancement of subtle underlying sedimentary rhythms. For horizontally correlated patterns, such as laterally extensive beds and layers of nodules, an a priori unknown external signal has to be assumed...|$|R
40|$|According {{to their}} microstratigraphical {{composition}} the laminated sediments of Baldeggersee are true varves. Two varve time-series from freeze cores {{taken in the}} deepest part (66 m) of Baldeggersee have been analysed for annual and seasonal layers. The varve time-series covers the period of 1885 to 1993. The two freeze-cores from Baldeggersee can be accurately correlated by means of distinct layers (e. g. marker varves, turbidites), lithological units, and varve measurements. The Baldeggersee varve chronology has been checked by independent high-resolution 137 Cs dating. Mobility of cesium has not been detected in Baldeggersee. A highly positive correlation between phosphorus concentration in the lake water and median grain size of calcite crystals has been observed and allows, together {{with the results of}} geochemical analyses, to hindcast the trophic state in Baldeggersee for periods where no limnological data are available. The main features of the Baldeggersee varve time-series can be summarized as follows: before 1885 there are packets of 5 – 10 varves interrupted by massive, homogeneous <b>marl</b> <b>beds,</b> indicating oscillating hypolimnetic oxygen levels until the lake ultimately became anoxic in 1885. Between 1885 and 1905 varves are thin, with a high carbonate content. Between 1905 and 1910 the thickness of varves increased steadily, and an increase in calcite grain size suggests a major step in eutrophication. Median grain size values increase again {{at the end of the}} 1940 s, whereas the thickness of the seasonal layers decreased between the early 1940 s and the early 1960 s. At the onset of the 1960 s, during the time of highest epilimnetic phosphorus concentrations in Baldeggersee, the total phosphorus concentrations in the sediments as well as the varve thickness and the total accumulation rates all increased. At the beginning of the 1980 s the median grain size decreased substantially as a result of lower phosphorus concentrations in Baldeggersee...|$|R
40|$|The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) {{initiated}} a global biotic event with major evolutionary impacts. Since {{a series of}} minor d 13 C and d 18 O excursions, indicative of hyperthermals, now appears to characterize early Eocene climate, {{it remains to be}} investigated how the biosphere responded to these warming events. We studied the Esna Formation at Dababiya (Nile Basin, Egypt), in order to identify Eocene thermal maximum 2 (ETM- 2) and to evaluate the foraminiferal and ostracode patterns. The studies interval generally consists of gray-brown marls and shales and is interrupted by a sequence of deviating lithologies, representing an early Eocene Egyptian environmental perturbation that can be linked to ETM- 2. The ETM- 2 interval consists of brownish shales (<b>bed</b> 1) to <b>marls</b> (<b>bed</b> 2) at the base that grade into a foraminifera-rich chalky limestone (bed 3) at the top. This conspicuous white limestone bed forms the base of the Abu Had Member. A distinct negative d 13 C excursion of approximately 1. 6 ‰ is recorded encompassing this interval and a second negative d 13 C shift of 1 ‰ occurs 5 m higher. These two isotope events are situated respectively in the basal and lower part of the calcareous nannoplankton zone NP 11 and appear to correlate with the H 1 and H 2 (?) excursions observed in the deep-sea records. The lower d 13 C excursion is associated with benthic foraminiferal and ostracode changes and settlement of impoverished anomalous foraminiferal (planktic and benthic) assemblages, indicating a transient environmental anomaly, disrupting the entire marine ecosystem during ETM- 2. Our observations indicate some similarities between the sedimentary and biotic expressions of ETM- 2 and the PETM at Dababiya, pointing to similar processes operating in the Egyptian Basin during these global warming events...|$|R
