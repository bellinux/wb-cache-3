5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E

40|$|<b>Machines</b> <b>and</b> {{technologies}} {{are the key}} for the paradigm shift in achieving sustainable agriculture development. The ergonomics design of the <b>machines</b> <b>and</b> technologies {{is very important to}} resolve WMSD problems faced by workers. The study aims to investigate on the pain problems experienced by palm oil workers on their body parts, due to the impact of the usage of <b>machines</b> <b>and</b> technologies as they perform their daily tasks in the palm oil plantation. A survey was conducted using Modified Nordic Questionnaire to investigate and analyse musculoskeletal symptoms among palm oil plantation workers. There were 12 palm oil plantation workers who participated in the survey. The survey results show that all workers who used <b>machines</b> <b>and</b> technologies while working have been experiencing body parts pain disorders, especially at the neck. Body parts pain experienced by these workers has led to an increasing number of palm oil plantation workers who are resisting from using <b>machines</b> <b>and</b> technologies. Practitioner Summary: <b>Machines</b> <b>and</b> technologies would be very helpful tools, if the designers have considered various ergonomic factors at the design stage. This is important because a good and realistic relationship needs to be established between human user <b>and</b> <b>machine.</b> Human workers shall then be able to accept and continue to use the <b>machines</b> <b>and</b> technologies, if it is comfortable and safe to use...|$|R
