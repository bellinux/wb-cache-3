2500|$|The {{rotating}} armature {{consists of}} one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated, magnetically [...] "soft" [...] ferromagnetic core.

The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the <b>motor</b> <b>frame.</b> The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.|$|E

40|$|The {{absence of}} muscular proprioception, whether at a {{segmental}} or at a central level, impairs performance in several ways. The contribution of proprioception to movement control and learning {{is not easily}} dissociated from that of other sources of sensory information (e. g., vision). Therefore, the rare clinical cases of extensive neuropathy, depriving the brain massively and permanently of its presumed main sources of dynamogenic information from skin and muscles, are of very special interest. Two such patients and controls were tested in experiments investigating (i) force production, (ii) amplitude coding, (iii) spatial reference frames in pointing, and (iv) prismatic adaptation.

40|$|Abstract — Single-phase and {{three-phase}} induction motors, {{small and}} large, {{are commonly used}} in industrial applications. The present paper presents the work done in the design, construction, and testing of a high accuracy system for the measurement of fractional horsepower (FHP) induction motor losses and efficiency. The calorimeter designed and built is capable of measuring heat losses of up to 1 kW with an overall accuracy better than 3 %. During all tests, ambient temperature, humidity, motor speed and <b>motor</b> <b>frame</b> temperature were recorded using precise digital instruments. The inlet, outlet temperatures and resulting losses were recorded automatically using a high accuracy 12 -bit data acquisition system. The preliminary results obtained demonstrate the suitability of the designed calorimeter for the accurate measurement of losses small induction motors.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{rotating}} electrical machines, the vibro-acoustic behaviour becomes an important criterion. In an electrical machine, electromagnetically induced forces may cause vibrations of for instance, the stator. These vibrations may radiate annoying acoustic energy, especially at resonances of the stator assembly. This paper describes some techniques to analyse the vibro-acoustic behaviour of a (brushless DC-) motor. However; the technique is quite general and cart be used {{for all types of}} electrical machines. The "inverse-frequency-response-function" technique (IFRF) allows the identification of the actual vibration behaviour of the <b>motor</b> <b>frame</b> from the measurement of the acoustic field around the motor. Experimental modal analysis yields the resonant behaviour of the motor: A combination of both techniques indicates the critical resonances, causing the undesired acoustic emissions. This may lead to an improved, quieter design of the electrical motor. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{two-phase}} doubly salient {{permanent magnet}} machine (FMDSPM) with new winding configuration is proposed in this paper. This machine {{is identical to}} the existing doubly salient permanent magnet machine (DSPM) with respect to the mechanical structure, whereas the winding configuration is totally different from that in the latter. The structure and operation principle of FMDSPM is analyzed, and power and sizing equations are derived analytically, which provides the designer with initial calculation to determine the <b>motor</b> <b>frame.</b> Allowing for the new winding configuration utilized, the magnetic features of FMDSPM are investigated by using the FEA. The results show that this new machine is suitable to the application of DC square wave, and the output torque produced is smoother due to no cumbersomely commutating torque ripples compared with the existing DSPM. Further, the prototype is fabricated to validate the above analysis.   Keywords :</p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the endwinding cooling {{problems}} of totally enclosed fan-cooled (TEFC) induction motors. In order to obtain information about the phenomena involved in the motor end space, three "ad hoc" prototypes have been built.

The measurement results have shown that all the motor-part overtemperatures (winding, endwindings, stator lamination, and external <b>motor</b> <b>frame)</b> decreasing, with the inner air speed increasing. The measured motor overtemperatures and losses allow the thermal-resistance identification of a simplified thermal model suitable to describe the thermal behaviors of the prototypes. By the endwinding-to-motor frame thermal resistance, the related heat-exchange coefficients have been evaluated {{as a function of}} the rotor speed. The proposed procedure allows separating the forced-convection contribution by the other thermal-exchange phenomena that occur in the end-space regions. The obtained heat-transfer coefficients are in agreement with the results reported in the past literatur...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in sensorimotor control concerns {{the transformation of}} spatial signals from the retina into eye and headmotor commands required for accurate gaze shifts. Here, we investigated these transformations by identifying the spatial codes embedded in visually evoked and movement-related responses in the frontal eye fields (FEFs) during head-unrestrained gaze shifts. Monkeysmadedelayed gaze shifts to the remembered location of briefly presented visual stimuli,with delay serving to dissociate visual and movement responses. A statistical analysis of nonparametric model fits to response field data from 57 neurons (38 with visual and 49 with movement activities) eliminated most effector-specific, head-fixed, and space-fixed models, but confirmed the dominance of eye-centered codes observed in head-restrained studies. More importantly, the visual response encoded target location, whereas the movement response mainly encoded the final position of the imminent gaze shift (including gaze errors). This spatiotemporal distinction between target and gaze coding was present {{not only at the}} population level, but even at the single-cell level. We propose that an imperfect visual–motor transformation occurs during the briefmemory interval betweenperceptionandaction, and further transformations from the FEF’s eye-centered gazemotor code to effector-specific codes in <b>motor</b> <b>frames</b> occur downstream in the subcortical areas.
