5|$|In 2006, {{readers of}} Doctor Who Magazine voted Eccleston's Doctor {{the third most}} popular Doctor. Both <b>mainstream</b> <b>press</b> and science fiction reviewers {{generally}} credit Eccleston and his incarnation of the character as helping to re-establish the show following its hiatus between 1996 and 2005. The character's interactions with his archenemies, the Daleks, were particularly praised. Eccleston won several awards for his single series including the 2005 National Television Award for best actor.|$|E
5|$|In many countries, being {{identified}} {{in such a}} sauna was still viewed by the press as scandalous. In Ireland in November 1994, the Incognito sauna made <b>mainstream</b> <b>press</b> as the gay sauna where a priest {{had died of a}} heart attack and two other priests were on hand to help out. Scott Capurro is known for his deliberately provocative comedy material and often refers to gay sexual culture including gay bathhouses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mainstream</b> <b>press</b> {{reviews in}} the US were mixed and were largely {{negative}} in the UK, although a review in Asia was more positive. In a speech before the UN General Assembly in September 2006, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez openly praised the work. Sales {{of the book}} surged after the recommendation, its rank on Amazon.com rising to #1 in paperback and #6 in hardcover {{in only a few}} days.|$|E

5|$|The Man-Eating Myth {{was widely}} {{reviewed}} in academic journals and also attracted attention from <b>mainstream</b> <b>press.</b> Views were mixed, with most reviewers highlighting the intentionally provocative {{nature of the}} work. Critics charged Arens with constructing straw man arguments and for exaggerating the methodological problems within anthropology. Although influential, in ensuing decades, increasing archaeological study of cannibalism led many to dismiss Arens' hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{match between}} Taylor and Bigelow brought the WWF <b>mainstream</b> <b>press</b> coverage. The {{reactions}} to the match were mixed; some people thought that Taylor performed surprisingly well for a non-wrestler. Others thought that the WWF pushing a football player to defeat a wrestler made professional wrestling look bad. Reviews of the event as a whole have also been mixed, and the event has been called both the worst WrestleMania of all time and the event that saved the WWF.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} 2008 and 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Kilroy was {{involved}} in close elections for Ohio's 15th congressional district. She lost in 2006 after an election that required the counting of absentee ballots and election recounts. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot voting results. The 2010 election race was widely followed in the <b>mainstream</b> <b>press</b> as a race that the Republicans were targeting.|$|E
50|$|The press {{began with}} a mission to discover, publish, and promote works of {{literary}} excellence that have been overlooked by <b>mainstream</b> <b>presses,</b> and to build audiences for literature by fostering the literacy of youth and by bringing distinguished and emerging writers to the public stage. In 2011, the mission evolved into the commitment to publish work of literary excellence, support diversity, and promote literacy and a community of readers and writers who are actively engaged in the essential human practice known as literature.|$|R
5|$|I think I can't {{be happy}} if I'm the only one that's getting {{published}} by Random House when I know there are such magnificent writers – both Latinos and Latinas, both Chicanos and Chicanas – in the U.S. whose books are not published by <b>mainstream</b> <b>presses</b> or whom the mainstream isn't even aware of. And, you know, if my success means that other presses will {{take a second look}} at these writers... and publish them in larger numbers, then our ship will come in.|$|R
40|$|A {{few years}} ago I {{received}} an interesting reader's report on a grant application. It was far from flattering - nothing unusual in that; negative reader's reports {{are part of the}} territory if you apply for grants. What made me laugh out loud was a single comment which went something like this: "Professor Lumby publishes with <b>mainstream</b> <b>presses</b> such as Pan Macmillan and is frequently paraded in the media as an expert. She's really more of a journalist than a scholar. " 3 page(s...|$|R
5|$|First {{emerging}} in New York City in 2011, the Occupy movement was an international protest movement against {{social and economic}} inequality, its primary goal being to make the economic structure and power relations in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, but among the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control {{the world in a}} way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen as a reaction to the 2008–2012 global recession, an economic crisis that had led to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world. Chomsky became a supporter for the Occupy movement, joining protesters at some of their camps and advocating their cause in the <b>mainstream</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he {{was held}} in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, his long time {{secretary}} Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the <b>mainstream</b> <b>press,</b> that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1890s, Morris was {{increasingly}} ill and living largely as an invalid; {{aside from his}} gout, he also exhibited signs of epilepsy. In August 1891, he took his daughter Jenny {{on a tour of}} Northern France to visit the Medieval churches and cathedrals. Back in England, he spent an increasing amount of time at Kelmscott Manor. Seeking treatment from the prominent doctor William Broadbent, he was prescribed a holiday in the coastal town of Folkestone. In December 1894 he was devastated upon learning of his mother's death; she had been 90 years old. In July 1896, he went on a cruise to Norway with construction engineer John Carruthers, during which he visited Vadsö and Trondheim; during the trip his physical condition deteriorated and he began experiencing hallucinations. Returning to Kelmscott House, he became a complete invalid, being visited by friends and family, before dying of tuberculosis on the morning of 4 October 1896. Obituaries appearing throughout the national press reflected that at the time, Morris was widely recognised primarily as a poet. <b>Mainstream</b> <b>press</b> obituaries trivialised or dismissed his involvement in socialism, although the socialist press focused largely on this aspect of his career. His funeral was held on 6 October, during which his corpse was carried from Hammersmith to Paddington rail station, where it was transported to Oxford, and from there to Kelmscott, where it was buried in the churchyard of St. George's Church.|$|E

During this period, Street Editions published such poets as John James, Sarah Kirsch, Tom Raworth, John Wilkinson, Stephen Rodefer and Rod Mengham, and was at its peak regarded as a leading outlet for experimental literature that could not be published by <b>mainstream</b> <b>presses.</b> Mulford left the company in 1998, but her 2009 poetry collection The Land Between was published by the company.|$|R
