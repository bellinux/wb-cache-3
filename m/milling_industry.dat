5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position in the flour <b>milling</b> <b>industry,</b> after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. The wheat fields of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E

500|$|Saint Anthony Falls, {{the only}} {{waterfall}} of its height on the Mississippi, {{played an important}} part in the development of Minneapolis. [...] The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills. [...] In 1870, {{only a small number of}} flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain. [...] Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the <b>milling</b> <b>industry.</b> [...] Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling. [...] To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology. [...] They invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process. [...] They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones. [...] A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch. [...] These improvements led to the production of [...] "patent" [...] flour, which commanded almost double the price of [...] "bakers" [...] or [...] "clear" [...] flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis <b>milling</b> <b>industry.</b> [...] This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region.|$|E

500|$|Undoubtedly, Evans' {{contributions}} to milling were profound {{and the most}} rapidly adopted. Within his lifetime American milling had undergone a revolution, and his designs allowed mills to be built on industrial-scales with far greater efficiency. Now a more profitable enterprise, the number of mills increased dramatically across the United States. The price of flour fell significantly, availability increased, and the automated drying and bolting processes increased the quality and fineness of flour. In turn this led to major shift in bread making—cheaper and better quality flour lowered the cost of bread production and within a generation the majority of bread consumption shifted from the home-made to store-bought. The revolution was even more far-reaching in Europe where the so-called [...] "American System" [...] was quickly adopted by the <b>milling</b> <b>industry</b> and triggered major increases in food production—sorely needed {{in a period of}} almost continual warfare {{at the turn of the}} 18th century.|$|E
500|$|Constructing the {{machinery}} {{to realize this}} vision was complicated. Evans struggled to find {{the money to pay}} the highly skilled carpenters needed to construct his complex machines. The nearby flour <b>milling</b> <b>industry</b> on the Brandywine River was large, but dominated by the Quaker millers of Wilmington who saw little potential in Evans's designs. James Latimer, a Newport flour merchant upon hearing Evans's ideas exclaimed [...] "Ah! Oliver, you cannot make water run uphill, you cannot make wooden millers!" [...] Latimer's son, George, however once more saw the promise in Evans's ideas and helped him to secure patent protection over the inventions throughout 1787 and 1788. By this time Evans converted his brothers' mill at Red Clay Creek into a fully automated prototype based on his perfected designs, and the Evans brothers sent handbills and diagrams to the major milling centers of the United States offering free licensing of the designs for the first miller in each county who would commission Evans to refit their mills. Yet this campaign was to prove a major disappointment, and little commercial interest materialized.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in the 1890s, {{farmers in}} Wisconsin shifted from wheat to dairy {{production}} {{in order to}} make more sustainable and profitable use of their land. Many immigrants carried cheese-making traditions that, combined with the state's suitable geography and dairy research led by Stephen Babcock at the University of Wisconsin, helped the state build a reputation as [...] "America's Dairyland." [...] Meanwhile, conservationists including Aldo Leopold helped reestablish the state's forests during the early 20th century, paving the way for a more renewable lumber and paper <b>milling</b> <b>industry</b> as well as promoting recreational tourism in the northern woodlands. Manufacturing also boomed in Wisconsin during the early 20th century, driven by an immense immigrant workforce arriving from Europe. Industries in cities like Milwaukee ranged from brewing and food processing to heavy machine production and toolmaking, leading Wisconsin to rank 8th among U.S. states in total product value by 1910.|$|E
