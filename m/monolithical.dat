A separate party ideology was not well developed at the time of independence, except insofar as it focused on the liberation of Algeria. Its nationalist outlook was also closely interwoven with anti-Colonialism and anti-imperialism, something which would remain a lasting characteristic of Algerian foreign policy; but also with pan-Arab solidarity. This latter aspect led to the denial of or refusal to deal with the separate Berber identity held by Berber-speaking Algerians who made up about 50% of Algeria, something which caused fierce opposition and led to the splintering of the movement immediately after independence, as Hocine Aït Ahmed set up the Berberist and pro-democracy Socialist Forces Front (FFS).|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, data {{structure}} analysis was mainly done {{at a high}} level of abstraction in the computer science community. For instance, choosing a linked list as a data structure as opposed to an array for a specific situation, was mainly motivated from a performance point of view under the implicit assumption that the computer platform (that had to run the software) consisted out of one <b>monolithical,</b> physical memory. In the context of mobile, embedded devices, energy consumption is as important as performance. In addition to this, the assumption of one <b>monolithical</b> memory is outdated for many (if not all) current-day platforms! Clearly, {{there is a need to}} improve the choices that are made during data structure analysis given specific knowledge of the memory hierarchy of the platform under investigation. We show how memory related energy consumption can heavily be reduced by taking into account the access behaviour of the application on the one hand and the available on-chip and off-chip memory space on the other hand. We do this by exploiting the sparseness that is present in one steady state of the data structure under investigation. Analytical results show that energy reductions of a factor of 8. 7 are feasible in comparison to common data structure implementations. We trade these gains off with on-chip memory space consumption of a custom memory architecture...|$|E

In this thesis InP-based heterostructures for integrating high frequency photodetectors and transistors for applications in data communication systems have been investigated. Rf-optimized pseudomorphic HEMTs have been produced on an InAlAs/InGaAs layer system and characterized. The addition of an InGaAs absorption layer to the HEMT layer system allows the production of transistors and photodetectors in parallel. The influence of the additional layer {{on the performance of}} the photodetectors and the transistors was investigated and the properties of the layer system has been optimized so that both devices still show a good high frequency performance. To demonstrate the capability for a <b>monolithical</b> integration a photoreceiver, consisting of an MSM-photodiode and a traveling wave amplifier with two HEMTS has been produced. The optoelectrical circuit reached a bandwidth of 13. 5 GHz and a response of 0. 7 A/W.
