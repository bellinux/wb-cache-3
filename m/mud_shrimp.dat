5|$|Both Neotrypaea californiensis and the <b>mud</b> <b>shrimp</b> Upogebia pugettensis live in mudflats {{and sandy}} {{substrates}} in the intertidal zone of estuaries in western North America. N.californiensis is found from Mutiny Bay, Alaska to Punta Abreojos, Mulegé, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Its habitat {{is also used}} for the aquaculture of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Since the bioturbation carried out by N.californiensis and U. pugettensis reduces the productivity of the oyster beds, they are considered pests. Their effects may, however, have knock-on effects across the entire ecosystem, and may buffer it from the hazards of nutrient enrichment and increase primary and secondary productivity by {{increasing the amount of}} dissolved inorganic nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Various {{insects and}} arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the stonefly, the mayfly, the caddisfly, the simulium, the {{subfamily}} of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked tussock moth, and the mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the <b>mud</b> <b>shrimp</b> at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>shrimps</b> (formerly Thalassinidea) {{are common}} burrow {{dwelling}} decapod crustaceans in the littoral {{zone of the}} Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. Their burrow morphology was investigated using foam casting methods. The present study shows that the burrow morphology in Upogebia carinicauda is not consistent and the recorded variations are based on habitat type and some physical characteristics of sediments. Adult burrow morphology in sandy-muddy substrate with shells, and boulder field habitats were Y-shaped and complex burrows of horizontal channels with turning chambers and vertical connections to internal passages or crevices of boulders, respectively. In burrows of U. carinicauda, some narrow passages, connected to {{the upper part of}} adult burrows in sandy-muddy habitats, belong to juveniles. Another species, Neocallichirus jousseaumei was found under boulders in sandy-muddy habitats of the Gulf of Oman and Qeshm Island, Persian Gulf. Since this type of habitat is special in some features, no conspicuous ex-current openings (usually obvious as conical mounds of extruded sediment) have been observed on the sediment surface; as these were hidden among the boulders surrounded by mixed sand and shells.

40|$|Decapod {{crustaceans}} {{from the}} Ottnangian (middle Burdigalian, Lower Miocene) of the Western and Central Paratethys remain poorly known. In this study, we review and re-describe <b>mud</b> <b>shrimps</b> (Jaxea kuemeli), ghost shrimps (Gourretia sp., Calliax michelottii) and brachyuran crabs {{of the families}} Leucosiidae, Polybiidae and Portunidae. A dorsal carapace of the genus Calliax is reported {{for the first time}} in the fossil record. Re-examination of the type material of Randallia strouhali (Leucosiidae) and Geryon ottnangensis (Geryonidae) resulted in a transfer of these species into Palaeomyra (Leucosiidae) and Liocarcinus (Polybiidae), respectively. Achelous vindobonensis, originally described as a chela of a portunid crab, probably belongs to a member of Polybiidae and is provisionally treated as Liocarcinus sp. Only two species, J. kuemeli and C. michelottii, are also known from the Karpatian, the succeeding Paratethyan stage. In most cases, the decapod assemblages of the Ottnangian consist of rather shallow-water taxa whereas the assemblages of the Karpatian consist of deep-water taxa from the middle and outer shelf. The Central Paratethyan assemblages show similarities in genus composition to the Proto-Mediterranean and recent Indo-Pacific regions. Gourretia sp. represents the earliest occurrence of the respective genus in the fossil record. The Oligocene–Early Miocene appearance of Palaeomyra and Liocarcinus in the circum-Mediterranean implies that sources of present-day diversity hotspots in the Indo-Pacific trace to the Western Tethys (as for other decapod genera), although coeval decapod assemblages in the Indo-Pacific remain poorly known...|$|R

40|$|Predation can {{significantly}} affect prey populations and communities, but predator {{effects can be}} attenuated when abiotic conditions interfere with foraging activities. In estuarine communities, turbidity can affect species richness and abundance and is changing in many areas because of coastal development. Many fish species are less efficient foragers in turbid waters, and previous research revealed that in elevated turbidity, fish are less abundant whereas crabs and shrimp are more abundant. We hypothesized that turbidity altered predatory interactions in estuaries by interfering with visually-foraging predators and prey but not with organisms relying on chemoreception. We measured the effects of turbidity on the predation rates of two model predators: a visual predator (pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides) and a chemosensory predator (blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus) in clear and turbid water (0 and ∼ 100 nephelometric turbidity units). Feeding assays were conducted with two prey items, mud crabs (Panopeus spp.) that rely heavily on chemoreception to detect predators, and brown shrimp (Farfantepenaus aztecus) that use both chemical and visual cues for predator detection. Because turbidity reduced pinfish foraging on both <b>mud</b> crabs and <b>shrimp,</b> the changes in predation rates are likely driven by turbidity attenuating fish foraging ability and not by affecting prey vulnerability to fish consumers. Blue crab foraging was unaffected by turbidity, and blue crabs were able to successfully consume nearly all <b>mud</b> crab and <b>shrimp</b> prey. Turbidity can influence predator–prey interactions by reducing the feeding efficiency of visual predators, providing a competitive advantage to chemosensory predators, and altering top-down control in food webs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bandon Bay (Surat Thani Province) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} coastal areas in southern Thailand. The Tapi River and 18 channels are the main sources of freshwater, nutrients, organic matter and sediment to the bay and the loading of freshwater and nutrients provide essential support for the production of phytoplankton in the estuarine ecosystem. Bandon Bay is important as natural spawning, nursery and feeding grounds for shellfish such as oysters, blood cockles, green mussels, short-necked clams, <b>mud</b> crabs and <b>shrimps,</b> and the estuary also serves as an excellent area for mariculturing of shellfish. In fact, oysters and blood cockles cultured in Bandon Bay are now being exported worldwide. However, Bandon Bay is also a textbook example of overexploitation of coastal resources in the tropics including all the derived changes in the estuarial ecosystem with severe socio-economic consequences...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the occurrence, resistant efficiency of bacteria collected from four shrimp farming zones, Vunh Tau (VT), Nha Trang (NT), Da Nang (DN) and Hue (HU) of Viet Nam against five commonly applied antibiotics [sulphamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP), norfloxacin (NFC), amoxillin (AXC) and streptomycin (SMC) ] and bacterial degradation of antibiotic. Mud samples were employed to examine the resistant population and antibiotic resistant assay of bacteria using spread plate technique and disc diffusion method, respectively. Significantly high resistant bacterial populations were found in SMX (76 – 296 X 103 cfu/g), TMP (39 – 309 X 103 cfu/g), AXC (135 – 154 X 103 cfu/g) and SMC (93 – 239 X 103 cfu/g), whereas NFC showed a lowest count (0 – 17 X 103 cfu/g) in all sampling stations. Antibiotic resistant of bacteria was also strong as no clear zones were found in SMX and TMP up to 6 μg/ml and in AXC upto 4 μg/ml concentrations among five antibiotics. Bacterial degradation of the antibiotic (TMP, 0. 098 μg/ml/day) clearly pronounced that rate of antibiotic degradation governed by the bacterial resistant ability against the antibiotic. It may also be indicated that unutilized excessive antibiotic residues in <b>mud</b> of <b>shrimp</b> ponds lead to immeasurable loss in the microbial profile by acquiring high degree of resistant efficiency against SMX, TMP and AXC antibiotics in aquaculture environment.
