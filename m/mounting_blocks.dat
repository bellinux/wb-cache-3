5|$|A brick privy with a {{gabled roof}} clad in {{corrugated}} asbestos sheeting is located {{to the north}} of the cottage building. It was probably constructed circa 1930. Further north is the workshop building, which also housed the electricity generators at one point, dating from the 1950s. It features a flat and skillion roof, and concrete <b>mounting</b> <b>blocks.</b> Its most recent use was as a fishermen's cabin.|$|E
25|$|Situated on {{the high}} ridge above the gun emplacements, the battery {{observation}} post is a two-level structure built of off-form concrete, to house the range finder and the command post. External timber stairs survive, and rooftop fittings that formerly carried a camouflage netted structure. The upper level contains original timber joinery to observation slit and doorway and four intact concrete <b>mounting</b> <b>blocks,</b> possibly for a vertical rangefinder. The lower level comprises one large room with steel-reinforced concrete support beam and pillar beneath the <b>mounting</b> <b>blocks</b> in the upper level. Both levels contain evidence of a later interior fitout as residential accommodation.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} plan for Pohick Church was {{drawn up by}} James Wren, and was identical to that used for both The Falls Church and Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia; however, {{at some point during}} the construction process the footprint of the church was altered to that seen today. Some sources have claimed that George Washington himself drew up the design for the building, and at least one hints that George Mason, too, might have provided input; however, records show that in March 1769 the vestry paid James Wren and William West for the church plans. Construction was initially overseen by the planter Daniel French of Rose Hill, a member of the congregation. He died before completion of the building works, and oversight passed to William Buckland, who was also involved in the building of Gunston Hall nearby, and who may have participated in the decoration of the church interior as well; it is possible that Buckland took over the work at the instigation of his employer, George Mason, who had assumed many of French's debts and obligations at the latter's death. Much of the original woodwork in the building was executed by master carver William Bernard Sears, a longtime associate of Buckland's who was also attached to Gunston Hall, likely in indenture to Mason, and is known to have worked at Mount Vernon as well. The account presented by him for his services survives, and indicates that he was paid £58:19:0 for his craft. Plans for the church complex also called for the installation of <b>mounting</b> <b>blocks</b> and six benches in the churchyard, so that people could sit under the trees, and for the area to be cleared of all rubbish and litter. Washington's records indicate that he took an interest in furnishing the new church; besides paying William Copan for carving ciphers on both his pew and that of his neighbor Fairfax, he fitted his own pew with drawers, and also paid for a latch and a door for the church building.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Sikes {{says that}} it is a Hallow-Een custom in some parts of Wales to listen at the church door in the dark to hear shouted by a ghostly voice in the edifice the names of those who are shortly to be buried in the {{adjoining}} churchyard. In other parts, he says, 'the window serves the same purpose,' and, he adds, 'there are said to be still extant outside some village churches steps which were constructed in order to enable the superstitious peasantry to climb to the window to listen.' These steps in several places {{seemed to me to be}} merely old <b>mounting</b> <b>blocks,</b> but they may have been made use of for the less practical purpose in question.|$|E

5000|$|The Shepherdstown Historic District {{comprises}} the historic core of Shepherdstown, West Virginia. The town {{is the oldest}} in West Virginia, founded in 1762 as Mecklenburg. No structures are known to exist from the time before the town became known as Shepherdstown. The historic district is concentrated along German Street, the main street, with 386 contributing resources and 69 non-contributing elements. The chief representative period is the late 18th century, with many Federal style brick houses.

50|$|<b>Mounting</b> <b>blocks</b> {{were usually}} made from stone or wood and {{prior to the}} era of the motor car they were very common. Some have three or more steps leading up to a {{platform}} which gave extra height and therefore easier access to the saddle and less chance of falling when dismounting. A few had a wall or some other support {{to one side of the}} steps, as at Saint Boswells. Some were built as memorials and bear inscriptions. They were built with bricks, ashlar and even occasionally from a single stone block, whilst an example at Shewalton Mill in North Ayrshire is a glacial erratic boulder located in the mill yard.|$|E
50|$|The Mill Site is {{represented}} by the remains of boilers and other machinery, concrete <b>mounting</b> <b>blocks,</b> belt wheels and stacks of corrugated iron sheeting. There are traces of rail embedded in the grass. A feature of the sawmill site that can be seen for some distance away is a metal chimney belonging to the boiler and machinery that once ran the sawmill. For safety reasons, steel cables currently brace this chimney. Industrial equipment immediately adjacent to the chimney consists of the main boiler, secondary boiler, steam engine and a steam generator interconnected by a series of cast iron pipes. Concrete pads represent the previous location of other industrial equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first meeting}} {{house on the}} site was built from logs in 1705-1708 by English Quakers, some of the {{earliest}} settlers in the area.

Remnants of some of these buildings, especially stone <b>mounting</b> <b>blocks</b> used to help mount horses, are scattered around the property. A stone schoolhouse was built to the east of the meetinghouse in 1798, and forms the nucleus of the current Buckingham Friends School.
