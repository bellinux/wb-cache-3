He {{may want to}} replace one of the PCs and attempt to turn the character into a vampire and take on that character's form. He may desire the love of Ireena, whose appearance matches that of his lost love, Tatyana. Using mind control, Strahd will try to force a PC to attack Ireena and gain her love by [...] "saving" [...] her from the situation he created. Strahd <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> create an evil magic item, or destroy the Sunsword.

50|$|When Jay {{left the}} {{presidency}} {{to serve as}} minister to Spain, Samuel Huntington of Connecticut was elected on September 28, 1779. Huntington had health problems, including contracting smallpox in 1780, and so he asked to be replaced in July 1781. By this time, the Articles of Confederation had been ratified. On July 9, 1781, Samuel Johnston became {{the first man to}} be elected as president of Congress after the ratification of the Articles. He declined the office, however, citing pressing family matters.

[...] Although estrogen/testosterone production may be restored after treatment for hyperprolactinemia, {{even a year}} or two without estrogen/testosterone can compromise bone strength, and patients should protect themselves from osteoporosis by increasing exercise and calcium intake through diet or supplementation, and by avoiding smoking.

[...] Several nature trails allow access as well as providing gateway access to neighboring state and federal park lands, and the Mt. Tamalpais Watershed wildland on the broad eastern face of Mt. Tamalpais that overlooks Mill Valley. [...] These are undeveloped natural areas and contain many species of wild animals, including some large predators like the coyote, the bobcat, and the cougar. [...] As in all wildland areas, observe daytime access hours, keep dogs on leashes, and keep younger children from wandering about unattended.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Kérékou's move to Marxism-Leninism was motivated mainly by pragmatic considerations, and that Kérékou himself was not actually a leftist radical; the new ideology offered a means of legitimization, a way of distinguishing the new regime from those that had preceded it, and was based on broader unifying principles than the politics of ethnicity. Kérékou's regime initially included officers from both the north and south of the country, but as the years passed the northerners (like Kérékou himself) became clearly dominant, undermining the idea that the regime was not based in ethnicity. By officially adopting Marxism-Leninism, Kérékou <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> win the support of the country's leftists.|$|R

Writer Jerome Winer suggests that Gauguin may have felt guilty over his treatment of Van Gogh to identify with Prado. According to Bradley Collins, [...] "There is no question that Gauguin would have strongly associated Vincent with the execution". [...] Collins continues, [...] "If Gauguin had been terrified by the sight of the near-dead Vincent curled up in his bloody sheets, he may have had the counterphobic desire to reassure himself of his courage by taking an unflinching look at Prado's execution. He <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> glory in his own innocence and another's guilt." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Description Logic (DL) {{knowledge}} bases (KBs) {{allow to}} express knowledge about concepts and individuals {{in a formal}} way. This knowledge is typically crisp, i. e., an individual either is an in-stance of a given concept or it is not. However, in practice this is often too restrictive: when querying for instances, one <b>may</b> often <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> find suitable alternatives, i. e., individuals that are not instances of query concept, but could still be considered ‘good enough’. Relaxed instance queries have been introduced to gradually relax this infer-ence in a controlled way via the use of concept similarity measures (CSMs). So far, those algorithms only work for the DL EL, which has limited expressive power. In this paper, we introduce a suitable CSM for EL++-concepts. EL++ adds nominals, role inclusion axioms, and concrete domains to EL. We extend the algorithm to compute relaxed instance queries w. r. t. this new CSM, and thus to work for general EL++ KBs. ...|$|R

Barrow was unable to provide the Board of the Admiralty with a persuasive argument to support these appointments, so after some prevarication Sir John Franklin and Francis Crozier were appointed instead.

5000|$|Tensions mounted {{again after}} 1805, erupting into the War of 1812, when the Americans {{declared}} war on Britain. The Americans were angered by British harassment of U.S. ships {{on the high seas}} and seizure ("Impressment") of 6,000 sailors from American ships, severe restrictions against neutral American trade with France, and British support for hostile Indian tribes in Ohio and territories the U.S. had gained in 1783. American [...] "honor" [...] was an implicit issue. The Americans were outgunned by more than 10 to 1 by the Royal Navy, but could call on an army much larger than the British garrison in Canada, and so a land invasion of Canada was proposed as the only feasible, and most advantegous means of attacking the British Empire. Americans on the western frontier also hoped an invasion would bring an end to British support of Native American resistance to the westward expansion of the United States, typified by Tecumseh's coalition of tribes. Americans <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> annex Canada.|$|R
40|$|Let A be an {{unbounded}} operator on a Banach space X. It {{is sometimes}} useful {{to improve the}} operator A by extending it to an operator B on a larger Banach space Y with smaller spectrum. It would be preferable {{to do this with}} some estimates for the resolvent of B, and also to extend bounded operators related to A, for example a semigroup generated by A. When X is a Hilbert space, one <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> Y <b>to</b> be Hilbert space. Results of this type for bounded operators have been given by Arens, Read, Muller and Badea, and we give some extensions of their results to unbounded operators and we raise some open questions. A related problem is to improve properties of a C 0 -semigroup satisfying lower bounds by extending it to a C 0 -group on a larger space or by finding left-inverses. Results of this type for Hilbert spaces have been obtained by Louis and Wexler, and by Zwart, and we give some additional results...|$|R

Victims who were raped after willingly consuming alcohol or drugs are particularly reluctant because they may be charged for having used a substance illegally.

50|$|But, Philip claimed full {{rights over}} {{the lands of}} the house of St Gilles; some historians believe his {{dispatch}} of de Montfort and other northern barons to be, at the very least, an exploratory campaign to reassert the rights of the French Crown in Le Midi. Philip <b>may</b> well <b>also</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> appease the papacy after the long dispute over his marriage, which had led to excommunication. He also sought to counter any adventure by King John of England, who had marriage and fealty ties also with the Toulouse comtal house.

However, he moved {{later that year}} to Hastings on grounds of health, though he <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> escape Oxford's febrile religious controversies. For many years he was physician to the St. Leonards and East Sussex Infirmary. His investigations of mortality rates in Hastings showed the insanitary conditions of artisan housing, despite the town's new popularity as a health resort. In 1857 he founded the Hastings Cottage Improvement Society, and was its secretary from 1857 to 1891: this company bought up and improved insanitary accommodation, as well as building new housing of a better standard. The venture's success prompted Greenhill to promote the idea at the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, and establish a similar organisation in London, the London Labourers' Dwellings Society, {{of which he was}} secretary from 1862 to 1876. On Gladstone's recommendation, Greenhill was granted a civil list pension of £60 in 1881. At {{the time of his death}} at The Croft, Hastings, aged 81, Greenhill had outlived his wife and his eldest daughter and son, who had each died young; one son and one daughter survived him.|$|R
