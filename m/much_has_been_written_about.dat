When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp {{to keep it from}} floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E

25|$|Information {{about the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of synephrine used as a single drug may be deduced from the foregoing {{review of the literature}} in this Article. This information is, by and large, not contended. However, there exists considerable controversy {{about the safety}} and/or efficacy of synephrine-containing preparations, which are often confused with synephrine alone, sometimes with m-synephrine, and <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> such preparations in the medical literature and on the Internet. Since this body of literature deals with mixtures containing synephrine as only one of several biologically-active components, even, in some cases, without explicit confirmation of the presence of synephrine, further discussion is outside the scope of this article.|$|E

Koropeckyi notes that, apart from some specialist literature, only five book-length biographies of Mickiewicz have been published in English. He also writes that, though many of Mickiewicz's works have been reprinted numerous times, no language has a [...] "definitive critical edition of his works." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyond friendship, Leonardo {{kept his}} private life secret. His {{sexuality}} {{has been the subject}} of satire, analysis, and speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by Sigmund Freud. Leonardo's most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Salai and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his death, described Leonardo's feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with sodomy in an incident involving a well-known male prostitute. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was related to Lorenzo de' Medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal. Since that date <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in John the Baptist and Bacchus and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> {{scene as}} a {{cultural}} document of an important period when many immigrants were coming to America. In fact, the picture was taken on a cruise to Europe from America, {{and for that reason}} some critics have interpreted it as recording people who were turned away by U.S. Immigration officials and were forced to go back home. Although some of the passengers might have been turned back because of failure to meet financial or health requirements for entrance, {{it is more likely that}} most of them were various artisans who worked in the booming construction trade of the time. Workers who were highly skilled in crafts such as cabinet-making, woodworking and marble laying were granted two-year temporary visas to complete their jobs and then returned to their homelands when the work was complete.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding Wagner himself, {{it often}} seems ironic to some {{that many of}} the most {{influential}} and popular interpreters of his work have been Jewish conductors such as the aforementioned Mahler and Bernstein, as well as Daniel Barenboim, Arthur Fiedler, Asher Fisch, Otto Klemperer, Erich Leinsdorf, James Levine, Hermann Levi (who was chosen by Wagner to conduct the premiere of Parsifal Lorin Maazel, Eugene Ormandy, Fritz Reiner, Sir George Solti, George Szell and Bruno Walter. It has been noted that there is a [...] "love of contemporary Jewish conductors for Wagner". While <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> Wagner's anti-Semitism in his writings and music, and the Nazi appropriation of his music, research in recent years has analyzed the possibility that Wagner was himself of Jewish ancestry, and explored Wagner's interaction with and attitude towards the Jews through a multi-sided perspective.|$|E
2500|$|Though <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> the MacCrimmon pipers to the MacLeods of Dunvegan, {{there is}} little {{reliable}} information on them. The genealogy of the [...] "hereditary pipers" [...] has also {{been the subject of}} debate and speculation. The MacCrimmon of whom there is the most reliable information is Red Donald (Dòmhnull Ruadh) [...] (d July 31, 1825). Red Donald held tacks at Borreraig and Shader, and at Trien in Waternish, and also a farm at Glenelg. Red Donald's older brother was Black John (Iain Dubh) (d 1822), who also held the Boreraig tack. Interestingly the MacCrimmon brothers had their most formative years during the Disarming Act. Today it is accepted that these MacCrimmon brothers were sons of Malcolm (Calum), son of Pàdraig Òg, who were both pipers to the chiefs of MacLeod and who also held land from them. Red Donald and Black John's father and paternal uncle (Donald Ban) both piped for the Government forces in the 1745–46 Jacobite Rising.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> the {{unpleasant}} side of Hooke's personality, starting with comments {{by his first}} biographer, Richard Waller, that Hooke was [...] "in person, but despicable" [...] and [...] "melancholy, mistrustful, and jealous." [...] Waller's comments influenced other writers for well over two centuries, so that a picture of Hooke as a disgruntled, selfish, anti-social curmudgeon dominates many older books and articles. [...] For example, Arthur Berry said that Hooke [...] "claimed credit {{for most of the}} scientific discoveries of the time." [...] Sullivan wrote that Hooke was [...] "positively unscrupulous" [...] and possessing an [...] "uneasy apprehensive vanity" [...] in dealings with Newton. Manuel used the phrase [...] "cantankerous, envious, vengeful" [...] in his description. More described Hooke having both a [...] "cynical temperament" [...] and a [...] "caustic tongue." [...] Andrade was more sympathetic, but still used the adjectives [...] "difficult", [...] "suspicious", and [...] "irritable" [...] in describing Hooke.|$|E
