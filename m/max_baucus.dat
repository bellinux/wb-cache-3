By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives. On the Senate side, from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill. This group—in particular, Democrats <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus,</b> Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate healthcare reform bill.|$|E
25|$|Supplementing the {{reporting}} regimes {{already in place}} was stated by Senator <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus</b> (D-MT) to be a means of acquiring more financial data and raising government revenue. After committee deliberation, Sen. <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus</b> and Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) introduced the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2009 to Congress on October 27, 2009.

5000|$|In 2009, he {{was asked}} to film a {{documentary}} investigating and exposing political corruption in Montana. The result was the controversial Beneath the Beauty (2010), which documented political concerns from questionable real estate development deals, to alleged police brutality cases and Senator <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus's</b> apparent collusion with pharmaceutical corporations in drafting the [...] "Obamacare" [...] health care bill.|$|R

25|$|Senator <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus</b> is {{a popular}} Democrat in Montana, {{representing}} {{a state that has}} long been fairly Republican but also is receptive to Democrats in state and local elections. President Bush won Montana by more than 20 points in both 2000 and 2004, but Montana also has a popular Democratic governor, Brian Schweitzer, and a newly elected Democratic junior senator, Jon Tester. Baucus was not expected to face a significant challenge from the 85-year-old Republican nominee, Bob Kelleher, who surprised observers by winning the June 3 Republican primary despite supporting a number of positions that put him to the political left of Baucus, such as nationalization of the American oil and gas industry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Max</b> Sieben <b>Baucus</b> (born Enke, December 11, 1941) is an American {{diplomat who}} was a United States Senator from Montana from 1978 to 2014.

500|$|Their public debut was in Bozeman, Montana in 1971 as {{the opening}} act for Rare Earth. [...] Their band logo was {{designed}} by Missoula artist Monte Dolack. The band was influenced by folk and traditional country music traditions as well as contemporary bands of the time such as Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. Band members also credit the influence of Jonathan Edwards. A 1974 fundraiser performance helped propel a then-young politician, <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus,</b> to victory in his first race for the United States House of Representatives. [...] Baucus later returned the favor when as a U.S. Senator, he introduced the band (sitting in the balcony) {{from the floor of}} the Senate chambers as [...] "Montana's Favorite Sons".|$|E
500|$|The {{schedule}} fluctuated {{over the}} next three years, with the train operating daily between Chicago and Seattle in the summers and reverting to tri-weekly west of Minneapolis the rest of the year. Amtrak would also run a daily service during the holiday season (as in 1975, when the train operated daily December 12 [...] January 12), but the train never operated a daily schedule for a full calendar year. In early 1976 the North Coast Hiawatha was threatened with discontinuance, along with the Pacific International and the three daily Portland, OregonSeattle trains, after the Ford Administration proposed budget cuts. Several members of Congress protested the proposed cuts, including Representative <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus</b> (D-Montana), and Senators Warren Magnuson (D-Washington) and Bob Packwood (R-Oregon). In the end Congress approved a budget for Amtrak $62 million above the administration's request, saving all three services.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1988, United States Senator <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus,</b> {{along with}} two other Senators, wrote to DuPont {{reminding}} the company of its pledge.

[...] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal [...] "unwarranted and counterproductive".|$|E
2500|$|On February 26, 2009, Byrd {{was one of}} two Democrats to {{vote against}} the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009, which if it had become law would have added a voting seat in the United States House of Representatives for the District of Columbia and add a seat for Utah, {{explaining}} that he supported the intent of the legislation, but regarded it as an attempt to solve with legislation an issue which required resolution with a Constitutional amendment. [...] (Democrat <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus</b> of Montana also cast a [...] "nay" [...] vote.) ...|$|E
2500|$|A 2016 {{study found}} that Hannity {{promoted}} a number of falsehoods about the Affordable Care Act. For instance, Hannity falsely alleged several times that Democratic Senate Finance Committee Chairman <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus</b> had said Social Security could be “insolvent in two years” due to the Affordable Care Act. According to the study, Hannity, unlike other Fox News hosts such as Bill O'Reilly and Greta Van Susteren, [...] "took a more direct approach, aggressively supporting Republicans and conservatives and attacking Democrats and liberals, endorsing the more spurious claims long after they were proven incorrect, and putting advocacy above accurate reporting, to further the network’s themes opposing reform." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{project has}} been {{primarily}} funded through Qualified Forestry Conservation Bonds – a public financing mechanism created in the 2008 Farm Bill {{under the leadership of}} Montana Senator <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus.</b> The program enabled The Nature Conservancy and The Trust for Public Land to purchase forest lands either through the issuance of tax credit bonds or through direct federal grants. [...] The bond program, however, contained such stringent project requirements that it was in fact only available to the Montana Legacy Project lands; the projects had to involve at least [...] of land that partially bordered National Park land and that was subject to a native fish habitat conservation plan.|$|E
2500|$|George McGovern {{wrote that}} {{significant}} campaign funds {{were given to}} the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over health care legislation: [...] "Chairman <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus</b> of Montana, a Democrat, and his political action committee have received nearly $4 million from the health-care lobby since 2003. The ranking Republican, Charles Grassley of Iowa, has received more than $2 million. It's a mistake for one politician to judge the personal motives of another. But Sens. Baucus and Grassley are firm opponents of the single-payer system, as are other highly placed members of Congress who have been generously rewarded by the insurance lobby." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matt Taibbi {{wrote in}} Rolling Stone that President Obama and key {{senators}} who have advocated single-payer {{systems in the}} past are unwilling to face the insurance companies and their powerful lobbying efforts. Key politicians on the Senate Finance Committee involved in crafting legislation have received over $2 million in campaign contributions from the healthcare industry. Several of the firms invited to testify at the hearings sent lobbyists that had formerly worked for Senator <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus,</b> {{the chair of the}} committee. Mr. Baucus stated in February 2009 that: [...] "There may come a time when we can push for single-payer. At this time, it's not going to get to first base in Congress." ...|$|E
2500|$|Montana's Senate {{district}} {{is the fourth}} largest by size, behind Alaska, Texas, and California. The most notorious of Montana's early Senators was William A. Clark, a [...] "Copper King" [...] {{and one of the}} 50 richest Americans ever. He is well known for having bribed his way into the U.S. Senate.

Wheeler (serving from 1923 to 1947), an oft-mentioned presidential candidate and strong supporter of isolationism; Mike Mansfield, the longest-serving Senate Majority Leader in U.S. history; <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus</b> (served 1978 to 2014), longest-serving U.S. Senator in Montana history, and the senator who shepherded the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through the Senate in 2010; and Lee Metcalf (served 1961 to 1978), a pioneer of the environmental movement.|$|E
2500|$|Nelson {{was one of}} {{only two}} Democratic {{senators}} to vote against the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. He voted with Republicans on matters of bankruptcy reform, environmental protection, lawsuit reform, and trade. In 2004 he {{was one of only}} three Democratic senators to vote to invoke cloture on the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment; in 2006 he was one of only two Democratic Senators to vote that way. He was the only Democratic senator to vote against a 2006 bill that would have extended federal funding for Stem Cell Research. He has, however, voted consistently against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He has also opposed President Bush's plan to send an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq. Early in Bush's first term he voted with the majority of his party against scrapping President Bill Clinton's expansive new rules on ergonomics regulation for workers; many of his fellow conservative Democrats like John Breaux, <b>Max</b> <b>Baucus,</b> Blanche Lincoln, and Zell Miller voted with Republicans on the issue. [...] On April 26, 2010, Nelson was one of two Democratic senators in attendance to vote against the motion to move a financial regulations bill forward, siding with Senate Republicans.
