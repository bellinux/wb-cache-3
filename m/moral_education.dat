(This said, Hartup of Contemporary Psychology said Summerhill was closer to Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality than to Émile and criticized Neill's psychoanalytic overemphases.) The psychoanalyst Benjamin Wolstein put Neill's work alongside that of John Dewey, and Sir Herbert Read likened Neill to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Henry Caldwell Cook. David Carr characterized the book as centered on <b>moral</b> <b>education,</b> despite Neill's recurrent insistence on the danger of moral teachings.

40|$|<b>Moral</b> value <b>education</b> is both {{a demand}} and a need for human beings {{as a manifestation of}} {{togetherness}} in terms of nations and countries with a variety of problems. There are a lot of problems, such as global terrorism and multidimensional crises, which one country cannot solve on its own because to do so it needs other countries’ supports. <b>Moral</b> value <b>education</b> is an alternative problem solution which is local, regional, national, and international in nature. It has become a global issue in several countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and China) and it has some differences and similarities. The differences result from the countries’ different ideologies. However, such countries emphasize <b>moral</b> value <b>education</b> on <b>moral</b> ethic values, especially on values related to human rights that are universal and global in nature.

40|$|The idea of <b>moral</b> values <b>education</b> as {{a formal}} {{subject in the}} {{curriculum}} has waxed and waned; however, considering the rapid rate in which societies are evolving, {{it is clear that}} <b>moral</b> values <b>education</b> is as important as ever. In order to insure that children and young adults are prepared to become active and educated participants and decision-makers in modern society, they must be guided responsibly by moral and democratic principles. This thesis is a comparative perspective of <b>moral</b> values <b>education</b> in the primary school curriculum of Japan and Norway, which considers both of these nation’s unique historical and cultural foundations, as well as the evolution of the philosophy of education in each society. The aim of the paper is to characterize <b>moral</b> values <b>education</b> in Japan and Norway and to determine what is distinctly Japanese and Norwegian in terms of <b>moral</b> values <b>education</b> in the primary school curriculum. The study is situated within the interpretivist paradigm and is mainly qualitative in nature. I have chosen a multi-method approach which includes reviews of historical events connected to the foundation of <b>moral</b> values <b>education,</b> and a comparative and evaluative design of the current national core curriculum as it outlines the goals of contemporary <b>moral</b> values <b>education.</b> As a starting point, my inquiry examines the historical development of the national education system and the philosophy of education in both Japan and Norway. Specific attention is paid to the conception and understanding of moral values and the element of democratic education in terms of the curricular rhetoric. John Dewey’s conception of democratic education and sociological concepts from cross-cultural studies are the guiding principles used in analyzing the findings. The conclusion of this thesis is that despite contrasting educational foundations, a unique philosophy of education inspired by different cultural traditions has evolved in both Japan and Norway. From the early foundations of the educational system through today, this philosophy of education has enabled a distinctive approach to {{the development and implementation of}} ideas surrounding <b>moral</b> values <b>education.</b> Key Words: <b>Moral</b> Values <b>Education,</b> Primary School Curriculum, Japan, Norway, Democratic Educatio...|$|R
