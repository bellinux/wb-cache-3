5|$|Both {{ancient and}} modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae {{as an example of}} the power of a {{patriotic}} army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used {{as an example of the}} advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force <b>multipliers</b> and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, {{although}} {{the battle was}} actually not decisive {{in the context of}} the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting. The performance of the defenders is used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force <b>multipliers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Halo 3s {{story or}} {{campaign}} mode {{can be played}} through alone or cooperatively with up to three other players via Xbox Live or System Link. Instead of having each player be an identical character as in previous Halo games, the first player plays as Master Chief, and the second player plays as the Arbiter. The other two players control two Covenant Elites, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, each with their own backstories. No matter which character is played, each player has identical abilities, though their starting weapons vary. Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled, such as giving the enemies extra health, changing in-game dialogue, or modifying AI behavior. These skulls, {{as well as the}} difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed, provide <b>multipliers</b> to the total score. Players are awarded gamerscore points for unlocking Achievements by reaching a certain score in each level.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its {{corresponding}} extra, such as invincibility or stud <b>multipliers,</b> becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten {{pieces of a}} Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting {{a certain number of}} gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing in}} GHTV, the player is scored to track their performance, and their scores are {{compared}} to other players - both those playing {{at the same time}} as well as asynchronous scores from other players. To help boost their score, players can accumulate Hero Power in the same fashion as in the GH Live mode. Prior to a song, the player can choose to use Coins, the in-game currency, to purchase one of several Hero Powers which they can deploy during the song, improving their score and performance. Hero Powers include temporary boosts in scoring <b>multipliers,</b> ability to clear all notes for a short distance on the track, or to increase or decrease the density of notes. When a song is complete, the player is ranked based on their performance with the other tracked players, and awarded experience points, Coins, and other bonuses. Experience points are used to raise the player's rank in the GHTV metagame, allowing them to unlock player card skins and other features of GHTV, including Play tokens. Alternatively, players can use the paid, microtransaction currency Hero Cash to purchase access to content. In an update in December 2015, players on GHTV have an opportunity to be randomly pitted in a head-to-head challenge against another player of similar skill level, about twice every half-hour. Winning this head-to-head challenge can give the player an experience point boost.|$|E

25|$|Hardware {{types that}} use powers-of-1024 <b>multipliers,</b> such as memory, {{continue}} to be marketed with customary binary prefixes.|$|E
25|$|The {{multiplication}} {{will consist}} of two parts. The first part {{will consist of}} several multiplications involving one-digit <b>multipliers.</b> The operation of each one of such multiplications was already described in the previous multiplication algorithm, so this algorithm will not describe each one individually, but will only describe how the several multiplications with one-digit <b>multipliers</b> shall be coordinated. The second part will add up all the subproducts of the first part, and the resulting sum will be the product.|$|E
25|$|Constrained {{problems}} {{can often be}} transformed into unconstrained problems {{with the help of}} Lagrange <b>multipliers.</b> Lagrangian relaxation can also provide approximate solutions to difficult constrained problems.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} optimization, {{the method}} of Lagrange <b>multipliers</b> (named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange) is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints.|$|E
25|$|Key {{mechanical}} components might include rotating shafts for carrying data within the computer, miter gear differentials, disc/ball/roller integrators, cams (2-D and 3-D), mechanical resolvers and <b>multipliers,</b> and torque servos.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{the problem}} is to {{minimize}} the objective function subject to the m constraints. It is solved {{by the use of}} Lagrange <b>multipliers.</b> After some algebraic manipulations, the result is obtained.|$|E
25|$|The {{formulation}} of Lagrange's equations for this system yields six equations {{in the four}} Cartesian coordinates xi, yi i=1, 2 and the two Lagrange <b>multipliers</b> λi, i=1, 2 that arise from the two constraint equations.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that while}} A6 and A7 have an {{exceptional}} Schur multiplier (a triple cover) {{and that these}} extend to triple covers of S6 and S7, these do not correspond to exceptional Schur <b>multipliers</b> of the symmetric group.|$|E
25|$|Lagrange {{was one of}} {{the creators}} of the {{calculus}} of variations, deriving the Euler–Lagrange equations for extrema of functionals. He also extended the method to take into account possible constraints, arriving at the method of Lagrange <b>multipliers.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Michael Shuman {{proposed}} Local ownership import substituting (LOIS), as {{an alternative}} to neoliberalism. It rejects the idelogy of there is no alternative. Shuman claims LOIS businesses are long term wealth generators, are less likely to exit destructively and have higher economic <b>multipliers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Note that if Schneider or Schwarz are {{declared}} but not made, {{then the}} contract is not met and declarer loses the amount {{that he or she}} would have won if successful. The above <b>multipliers</b> do not figure into games played null or ramsch.|$|E
25|$|The {{metric system}} has names to cover {{different}} ranges {{of the same}} measure. Instead of using names based on {{the context of the}} measure, the metric system mainly uses names made by adding prefixes, such as kilo- or milli-, as decimal <b>multipliers</b> to the base unit names. Thus, one kilogram is 1000grams and one kilometre is 1000metres.|$|E
25|$|Rectifiers are {{constructed}} from diodes, {{where they are}} used to convert alternating current (AC) electricity into direct current (DC). Automotive alternators are a common example, where the diode, which rectifies the AC into DC, provides better performance than the commutator or earlier, dynamo. Similarly, diodes are also used in Cockcroft–Walton voltage <b>multipliers</b> to convert AC into higher DC voltages.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) technology, Yannis Tsividis' group at Columbia University has been revisiting analog/hybrid computers design in standard CMOS process. Two VLSI chips have been developed, an 80th-order analog computer (250nm) by Glenn Cowan in 2005 and an 4th-order hybrid computer (65nm) developed by Ning Guo in 2015, both targeting at energy-efficient ODE/PDE applications. Glenn's chip contains 16 macros, {{in which there are}} 25 analog computing blocks, namely integrators, <b>multipliers,</b> fanouts, few nonlinear blocks. Ning's chip contains one macro block, in which there are 26 computing blocks including integrators, <b>multipliers,</b> fanouts, ADCs, SRAMs and DACs. Arbitrary nonlinear function generation is made possible by the ADC+SRAM+DAC chain, where the SRAM block stores the nonlinear function data. The experiments from the related publications revealed that VLSI analog/hybrid computers demonstrated about 1–2 orders magnitude of advantage in both solution time and energy while achieving accuracy within 5%, which points to the promise of using analog/hybrid computing techniques in the area of energy-efficient approximate computing.|$|E
25|$|Another {{treatise}} {{on the same}} lines was his Leçons sur le calcul des fonctions, issued in 1804, with the second edition in 1806. It is in this book that Lagrange formulated his celebrated method of Lagrange <b>multipliers,</b> {{in the context of}} problems of variational calculus with integral constraints. These works devoted to differential calculus and calculus of variations may be considered as the starting point for the researches of Cauchy, Jacobi, and Weierstrass.|$|E
25|$|A {{solution}} to this problem was explored in the form of efficient frequency <b>multipliers,</b> optical devices that combine several photons into one of higher energy, and thus frequency. These devices were quickly introduced and tested experimentally on the OMEGA laser and others, proving effective. Although the process is only about 50% efficient, and half the original laser power is lost, the resulting ultraviolet light couples much more efficiently to the target plasma and is much more effective in collapsing the target to high density.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{moving coil}} meter is {{suitable}} only for direct current measurements, {{usually in the}} range of 10 microamperes to 100mA. It is easily adapted to read heavier currents by using shunts (resistances in parallel with the basic movement) or to read voltage using series resistances known as <b>multipliers.</b> To read alternating currents or voltages, a rectifier is needed. One of the earliest suitable rectifiers was the copper oxide rectifier developed and manufactured by Union Switch & Signal Company, Swissvale, Pennsylvania, later part of Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company, from 1927.|$|E
25|$|The PMO of Narendra Modi {{overhauled}} the MEA {{in order}} to transform Indian diplomacy from a reactive bureaucracy to a proactive & entrepreneurial mind-set along the models of JETRO (Japan), KOTRA (South Korea) and TAITRA (Taiwan). Officers posted to Indian Missions overseas were ordered to act as force <b>multipliers</b> for the Indian economy by focusing on issues like identifying of market opportunities, foreign trade promotion & facilitation for Indian companies, overseas acquisition of energy supplies, securing raw-materials for domestic manufacturing industries and safeguarding multi-modal air-sea-land trading routes. In June 2015, the government announced that it intends to build capacity at the MEA through recruitment from academic circles and the private sector.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{leverage}} is {{also reflected in}} the pricing of options written on leveraged ETFs. In particular, the terminal payoff of a leveraged ETF European/American put or call depends on the realized variance (hence the path) of the underlying index. The impact of leverage ratio can also be observed from the implied volatility surfaces of leveraged ETF options. For instance, the implied volatility curves of inverse leveraged ETFs (with negative <b>multipliers</b> such as -1, -2, or -3) are commonly observed to be increasing in strike, which is characteristically different from the implied volatility smiles or skews seen for index options or non-leveraged ETF options.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} {{was published in}} the Journal of the Royal United Services Institute and {{a couple of years later}} a shorter article suggested that if the Soviets themselves had used SMAs in swarms in Afghanistan their COIN operations against the Mujaheddin would have been far more successful. Contemporary Western armies in Afghanistan can readily accept that swarming at the tactical and operational levels is appropriate, but the physical structure of the country rules out the currently available fighting vehicles. However, networked and swarming SMAs, again 5,000 in number, all armed with laser designators for the second echelon of conventional ground attack aircraft, would constitute force <b>multipliers</b> with a substantial impact.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{computers}} use {{a variety}} of techniques. One common method, especially on higher-end processors with floating point units, is to combine a polynomial or rational approximation (such as Chebyshev approximation, best uniform approximation, and Padé approximation, and typically for higher or variable precisions, Taylor and Laurent series) with range reduction and a table lookup—they first look up the closest angle in a small table, and then use the polynomial to compute the correction. Devices that lack hardware <b>multipliers</b> often use an algorithm called CORDIC (as well as related techniques), which uses only addition, subtraction, bitshift, and table lookup. These methods are commonly implemented in hardware floating-point units for performance reasons.|$|E
25|$|This energy {{function}} only introduces probability biases {{for a spin}} having a value and {{for a pair of}} spins having the same value. Higher order correlations are unconstrained by the <b>multipliers.</b> An activity pattern sampled from this distribution requires the largest number of bits to store in a computer, in the most efficient coding scheme imaginable, as compared with any other distribution with the same average activity and pairwise correlations. This means that Ising models are relevant to any system which is described by bits which are as random as possible, with constraints on the pairwise correlations and the average number of 1s, which frequently occurs in both the physical and social sciences.|$|E
25|$|Another {{polynomial}} viewpoint is {{exploited by}} the Winograd FFT algorithm, which factorizes z'N−1 into cyclotomic polynomials—these often have coefficients of 1,0,or−1, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd {{can be used}} to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors. Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(N) irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern processors with hardware <b>multipliers.</b> In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of prime sizes.|$|E
25|$|Cascaded diode and {{capacitor}} stages can {{be added}} to make a voltage multiplier (Cockroft-Walton circuit). These circuits are capable of producing a DC output voltage potential up to about ten times the peak AC input voltage, in practice limited by current capacity and voltage regulation issues. Diode voltage <b>multipliers,</b> frequently used as a trailing boost stage or primary high voltage (HV) source, are used in HV laser power supplies, powering devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) (like those used in CRT based television, radar and sonar displays), photon amplifying devices found in image intensifying and photo multiplier tubes (PMT), and magnetron based radio frequency (RF) devices used in radar transmitters and microwave ovens. Before the introduction of semiconductor electronics, transformerless vacuum tube receivers powered directly from AC power sometimes used voltage doublers to generate roughly 300VDC from a 100–120V power line.|$|E
