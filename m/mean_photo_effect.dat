40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} an alternative 3 T 3 mouse fibroblast {{neutral red uptake}} assay and investigate the feasibility of utilizing an alternative in vitro method to replace the animal testing, in particular, in phototoxicity assessment of cosmetics. Method: Fifteen phototoxic and nine non-phototoxic chemicals were tested and 20 functional cosmetic products were assessed. The <b>mean</b> <b>photo</b> <b>effect</b> (MPE) and the photo-irritation factor (PIF) of Balb/c 3 T 3 cells were analyzed after exposure to specific chemicals and ultraviolet radiation, and then compared {{with the results of}} whole-animal phototoxicity testing. Result: A negative result was obtained with all the non-phototoxic chemicals in the in vitro test, while fourteen out of the fifteen phototoxic chemicals gave a positive result. The Pearson's chi-square test indicated no statistically significant difference from the historic phototoxicity data. For the assessed 20 cosmetic products, a high correlation was found between in vitro and in vivo data. Conclusion: The alternative 3 T 3 NRU phototoxicity assay was established successfully as a substitute for the guinea pig-based photoxicity test in assessing the phototoxic effects of cosmetics...|$|E

The endpoint used to assess toxicity was a tetrazolium-based assay whereas, the phototoxic potential of acylglutamate surfactants was predicted using two models namely, the Photo-Irritation Factor and <b>Mean</b> <b>Photo</b> <b>Effect.</b> The results of this study showed that the fatty acid chain length of acylglutamate greatly influences toxic effects on human keratinocyte cells. In addition, all the acylglutamate surfactants tested on human keratinocyte cells demonstrated significantly less cytotoxicity (when irradiated and non-irradiated with ultraviolet B light; p < 0. 05) and no phototoxic potential was observed in any of the acylglutamate surfactants, when compared with the positive control chlorpromazine.

40|$|Bee venom (BV) from {{honey bee}} (Apis mellifera L.) {{has been used}} in oriental {{medicine}} and cosmetic ingredients because of its diverse pharmacological activities. In many studies, among BV components, phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) is known as a major player in BV-induced allergic reaction. Therefore, we removed PLA 2 from BV using ultrafiltration and then investigated in vitro phototoxicity and in vivo skin sensitization of PLA 2 -free BV (PBV) in comparison with regular BV. The 3 T 3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay can be appropriated to identify the phototoxic effect of a test substance upon the exposure of ultraviolet A. Chlorpromazine, a positive control, showed high levels of photoirritation factor and <b>mean</b> <b>photo</b> <b>effect</b> values, while BV and PBV had less of these values. Local lymph node assay is an alternative method to evaluate skin sensitization potential of chemicals. BALB/c mice were treated with p-phenylenediamine (PPD, positive control), BV, or PBV. In all of PPD concentrations, stimulation indexes (SI) as sensitizing potential of chemicals were ≥ 1. 6, determined to be sensitizer, while SI levels of BV and PBV were below 1. 6. Thus, based on these findings, we propose that both BV and PBV are nonphototoxic compounds and nonsensitizers...|$|E

Since all the UV filter chemicals on the positive list of EU Directive 76 / 768 /EEC have been shown not to be phototoxic in vivo in humans under use con-ditions, only negative effects would be expected in the 3 T 3 NRU PT test. To balance the number {{of positive and negative}} chemicals, ten phototoxic and ten non-phototoxic chemicals were tested under blind conditions in four laboratories. Moreover, to assess the optimum concentration range for testing, information was provided on appropriate solvents and on the solubility of the coded chemicals. In this study, the phototoxic potential of test chemicals was evaluated in a prediction model in which either the Photoirritation Factor (PIF) or the <b>Mean</b> <b>Photo</b> <b>Effect</b> (MPE) were determined. The results obtained with both PIF and MPE were highly reproducible in the four laboratories, and the correlation between in vitro and in vivo data was almost perfect. All the pho-totoxic test chemicals provided a positive result at concentrations of 1 µg/ml, while nine of the ten non-phototoxic chemicals gave clear negative results, even at the highest test concentrations.

30|$|However, the {{practical}} {{application of this}} technology has been somewhat limited due to the high recombination of photogenerated e−-h+ pairs. Meantime, the pure TiO 2 coating cannot provide photogenerated cathodic protection in dark condition. To solve the above-mentioned problems, {{there have been a}} number of studies related to doped TiO 2 with materials such as WO 3 [9 – 12], SnO 2 [13 – 15], MoO 3 [16], phosphotungstic acid [17], and Ni(OH) 2 [18]. The semiconductor with a different energy level from TiO 2 can store excess electrons during irradiation. Subsequently, the stored electrons can be released in the dark, thus maintaining a more negative potential and offering a cathodic protection. However, this protection system cannot work well during a long-time dark condition. Thus, the investigation of the TiO 2 coating as protective materials for steels without the <b>photo</b> <b>effect</b> is of considerable practical interest. Up to now, there are few reports on the corrosion behavior of the modified nano-TiO 2 coatings without <b>photo</b> <b>effect.</b> In 2007, Yun et al. have revealed that N-doped TiO 2 coatings show a remarkable improvement in corrosion protection without the <b>photo</b> <b>effect</b> due to their compact structure and hydrophobic property [19].|$|R

The absorptive part has the three well-known contributions to the cross section σ_abs: the <b>photo</b> <b>effect,</b> the Compton effect and the pair creation, {{but there is also}} the inelastic Delbrück scattering. Second-order elastic scattering cross sections σ_sca with Rayleigh scattering (virtual <b>photo</b> <b>effect),</b> virtual Compton effect and Delbrück scattering (virtual pair creation) can be calculated by integrals of the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations from the cross section σ_abs.

30|$|In {{order to}} combine the photogenerated {{cathodic}} protection performance and the self-protection of TiO 2 coating without the <b>photo</b> <b>effect,</b> it is highly required {{to find a new}} approach to improve the TiO 2 coating as an excellent protective coating for metals. Herein a sol–gel method is used to modify nano-TiO 2 coating with cerium ion by adding the concentrated solution of cerium nitrate. The cerium ion-doped TiO 2 coating is taken into consideration for two reasons; on one hand, the Ce-doped TiO 2 has widely been used as a photocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 in the visible region [20 – 22] because it yields a large red shift compared to pure TiO 2 and suppresses electron–hole recombination with electron trapping at Ce 4 +. We make use of this advantage in the field of photocatalysis to verify its improvement in the photogenerated cathodic protection for metals. On the other hand, cerium nitrate is known as a corrosion inhibitor in an aqueous aggressive medium. The corrosion inhibition properties of cerium nitrate have been widely discussed in literatures [23 – 25]. It is generally accepted that cerium ions lead to the precipitation of cerium oxides or hydroxides that suppress the corrosion reactions in the defects. Moreover, the incorporation of corrosion inhibitors into the sol–gel films can improve the protective ability of the coatings [26, 27]. We expect that the cerium ions doped in the TiO 2 coating can also enhance the self-protection property of the coating based on its self-healing <b>effect</b> without <b>photo</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|R
