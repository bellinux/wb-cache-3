The <b>media</b> <b>size</b> for these devices was quoted at 156 MB, rather than 185 MB. It is possible that these devices used a packet writing format which took away some available disk space for use by formatting information.

5000|$|There is {{a variety}} of filter media that can be {{employed}} in depth filter processes the most common being sand. Choice of filter media has effects on filter rate, turbidity and filter surface area. Clean bed head loss (pressure drop) is sensitive to media diameter where increasing media diameter results in a longer time to design head loss. Increasing the media diameter and filter rate however results in degradation of effluent turbidity. To compensate, media depth can be increased to reduce the effects on effluent turbidity. The max value of media depth used in designs so far for high rate filtration is 100 in, whilst the maximum <b>media</b> <b>size</b> used in pilots is 2mm in diameter.

5000|$|Consumers {{initially}} {{were also}} slow to adopt Blu-ray {{due to the}} cost. By 2009, 85% of stores were selling Blu-ray Discs. A high-definition television and appropriate connection cables are also required {{to take advantage of}} Blu-ray disc. Some analysts suggest that the biggest obstacle to replacing DVD is due to its installed base; a large majority of consumers are satisfied with DVDs. The DVD succeeded because it offered a compelling alternative to VHS. In addition, the uniform <b>media</b> <b>size</b> let manufacturers make Blu-ray players and now defunct format HD DVD players backward-compatible, so they can play older DVDs.

40|$|The {{use of a}} spherical buoyant {{media in}} {{filtration}} has many potential advantages. The media stratify during backwashing such that the largest spheres {{are at the top}} of the bed and the smallest are at the bottom. During upflow filtration solids may be removed by both straining on the underside of the filter and by depth filtration. The accumulated solids may be readiiy dislodged by a brief downflow backwash and gravity assists i n this cleaning process. Basic studies on the removal of coagulated clay suspensions indicated that the clay was removed throughout the depth (D. 3 m) of the filter for <b>media</b> <b>sizes</b> between 0. 6 and 1. 0 mm. Straining was not observed to be significant but it would become more important for smaller <b>media</b> <b>sizes</b> or more flocculant solids. Headloss development was monitored and followed the expected behavior for depth filtration. Low headlosses could be maintained by using shallow bed of media and backwashing frequently. These preliminary studies indicate that if the buoyant media are to be used in an effective low energy filter, the system design wi 11 be very important. A straining mechanism may be preferred since the solids are retained on the underside of the filter and gravity wi 1 'l assist in cleaning the bed during backwash. However, to avoid rapid headloss development depth filtration must be used also.

30|$|Numerous {{complementary}} research {{works have}} been performed to clearly understand the effects of media material on removal of SS by depth filtration (Sun et al. 2015). Still in recent years, depth filtration models cannot completely account for the fundamental insights concurring with a large variety of solid loading rate for wastewater filtration (Ding et al. 2015). It {{is well known that}} tiny particles separation is a very complex process and influenced by several factors such as wastewater characteristics, types of SS, and the operation mode of filtration (Bedrikovetsky et al. 2011). When filtration proceeds over time without back-washing, effluent quality may be improved but clogging of filter bed will result in an increase in head loss and a decrease in filtration flux (Loderer et al. 2012). Clogging and head loss are influenced by various factors such as particle size distribution, particle concentration, particle surface chemistry, filter <b>media</b> <b>size,</b> and media type (Coustumer et al. 2012). Filter media with an uneven <b>media</b> <b>size</b> distribution normally have a greater chance of clogging than uniform filter media. The formation of clogging depends on the size distribution of SS, fine bedload, and channel sediments. Large fine particles diameter more than 30  µm are subjected to mechanical filtration rather than surface phenomena such as the van deer Waals force. Medium-sized particles between 3 and 30  µm are retained by both filtration mechanisms. Adhesion of colloidal particles and bacteria is exclusively due to physiochemical process (Wang et al. 2012).|$|E

Findings reveal the fact that high hardening effect was obtained in water-quenched samples by the virtue of the martensitic structure and lower hardened depth achieved in the air-quenched samples. Significant improvement achieved by increasing the velocity of air when quenched by compressed air. It was also concluded that the hardness of the quenched samples at certain depths can be estimated on the basis of heat transfer equations...|$|E
