5|$|Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant {{leaves and}} spend {{practically}} {{all of their}} time searching for and eating food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are <b>myrmecophilous,</b> eating ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most <b>myrmecophilous</b> Lycaenidae, {{deciduous}} waxy scales provide some protection from predators as they {{emerge from the}} nest. In {{the case of the}} moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make {{their way out of the}} nest after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from some}} papers {{published}} discussing <b>myrmecophilous</b> beetles and insect pests in forests, Clark predominately researched and published {{articles about the}} taxonomy of Australian ants. All of his articles and monographs were published in Australia. Throughout his career, Clark described around 200 different species of ants, but half of these may be synonyms. He worked and researched {{with all of the}} main groups of Australian ants, but his research and revisionary efforts were extensive with members of the former subfamily Cerapachyinae (now Dorylinae), especially those of Phyracaces, the Myrmeciinae, Rhytidoponera and members of the tribe Dolichoderini.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ants are prey for {{a number}} of predators, {{including}} assassin bugs and the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), in the faeces of which have been found worker ants. Birds also eat these ants, including the Australian white ibis (Threskiornis moluccus), black kite (Milvus migrans), masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) and the Australian owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles cristatus). Workers and larvae can be infected by parasites; examined workers were seen with late-stage pupae of an unidentified parasite in their thoraces. In some nests of the green-head ant, some <b>myrmecophilous</b> insects such as the beetle Chlamydopsis longipes are sometimes seen living inside colonies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Myrmecophilous</b> (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|Some species use {{vibrations}} {{for communicating}} within {{members of the}} same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug Nezara viridula. Vibrations {{can also be used to}} communicate between entirely different species; lycaenid (gossamer-winged butterfly) caterpillars, which are <b>myrmecophilous</b> (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way. The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression; the death's-head hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|Flies are {{eaten by}} other animals at {{all stages of}} their development. The eggs and larvae are {{parasitised}} by other insects and are eaten by many creatures, some of which specialise in feeding on flies but most of which consume {{them as part of}} a mixed diet. Birds, bats, frogs, lizards, dragonflies and spiders are among the predators of flies. Many flies have evolved mimetic resemblances that aid their protection. Batesian mimicry is widespread with many hoverflies resembling bees and wasps, ants and some species of tephritid fruit fly resembling spiders. Some species of hoverfly are <b>myrmecophilous,</b> their young live and grow within the nests of ants. They are protected from the ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members. Bombyliid bee flies such as Bombylius major are short-bodied, round, furry, and distinctly bee-like as they visit flowers for nectar, and are likely also Batesian mimics of bees.|$|E
25|$|The larvae have tentacular organs as seen on <b>myrmecophilous</b> lycaenids, {{but they}} have not been {{observed}} to be tended by ants.|$|E
25|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{immature}} stages of ant nest beetles. Most appear to live in ant nests in their early stages of life. Although many are facultative or obligate myrmecophiles, most do not appear like ants (i.e. myrmecomorphic) and unlike in the case of <b>myrmecophilous</b> larval Lycaenidae, there appears to be no benefit gained by the ants in this association. Many species follow the trails of worker ants of specific species. Glandular secretions on their antennae and body allow them to interact with ant workers. It is believed that the beetles use an acoustic mechanism to successfully imitate the sounds of an ant queen thus permitting them access to the nest without alarming the ants.|$|E
500|$|Essentially all beetles lay eggs, {{though some}} <b>myrmecophilous</b> Aleocharinae and some Chrysomelinae which live in {{mountains}} or the subarctic are ovoviviparous, laying eggs which hatch almost immediately. Beetle eggs generally have smooth surfaces and are soft, though the Cupedidae have hard eggs. Eggs vary widely between species: the eggs {{tend to be}} small in species with many instars (larval stages), and in those that lay large numbers of eggs.|$|E
500|$|Australian {{entomologist}} Leslie John William Newman of the Western Australian Department of Agriculture noticed Clark's {{enthusiasm for}} natural history, and on probation, took Clark {{in as the}} assistant to the entomologist in 1919. In 1920, Clark's position in the Department of Agriculture was confirmed; due to this, Clark and {{his family moved to}} Perth. He began publishing his first papers discussing the history of entomology in Western Australia in 1921, and also basic articles about ants, insect pests in Australian forests and <b>myrmecophilous</b> beetles. Three years after his articles were first published, Clark was promoted to assistant-entomologist. Scientists attending the 1926 Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science suggested that Clark should apply for a position as [...] "entomologist" [...] at the National Museum of Victoria, in which he was appointed in late 1926 and began working there in 1927. After working for the museum, he found museum work [...] "not to his liking" [...] and tried to apply for the post of [...] "economic entomologist" [...] in New Guinea, which at the time was an Australian administered-territory. However, this was unsuccessful for Clark, who would remain at the National Museum of Victoria for nearly 20 years. In 1933, Clark sold 8,000 ant specimens he collected to the museum for about £200.|$|E

50|$|There are <b>myrmecophilous</b> beetles in the {{families}} Coccinellidae (e.g. the ladybird Thalassa saginata), Aphodiidae, Scarabaeidae, Lucanidae, Cholevidae, Pselaphidae, Staphylinidae, Histeridae and Ptiliidae (some treated here as subfamilies). In ant-beetle associations, the <b>myrmecophilous</b> Staphylinids {{are the most}} diverse of the beetle families. <b>Myrmecophilous</b> associations are also seen in various other insects such as aphids and treehoppers, {{as well as the}} hoverfly genus Microdon and several other groups of flies.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to their}} large number and diversity, <b>myrmecophilous</b> Rove Beetles occupy {{an array of}} behaviors. <b>Myrmecophilous</b> {{interactions}} can be generalized into categories, in three of which Staphylinids can be found. The synecthrans, or “persecuted guests,” the synoeketes, or “tolerated guests,” and the symphiles, or “true guests.” ...|$|E
50|$|Questions {{of how and}} why species coevolve are {{of great}} {{interest}} and significance. In many <b>myrmecophilous</b> organisms it is clear that ant associations have been influential in the ecological success, diversity, and persistence of species. Analyses of phylogenetic information for <b>myrmecophilous</b> organisms as well as ant lineages have demonstrated that myrmecophily has arisen independently in most groups multiple times. Because there have been multiple gains (and perhaps losses) of <b>myrmecophilous</b> adaptations, the evolutionary sequence of events in most lineages is unknown. Exactly how these associations evolve also remains unclear.|$|E
50|$|Staphylinidae is {{currently}} {{considered to be}} the largest family of beetles, with over 58,000 species described. As such, many <b>myrmecophilous</b> species are unknown. The majority of studied <b>myrmecophilous</b> Rove Beetles belong to the subfamily Aleocharinae, including the commonly studied genera Pella, Dinarda, Tetradonia, Ecitomorpha, Ecitophya, Atemeles, and Limechusa, and to the subfamily Pselaphinae, which includes Claviger and Adranes. There are also representatives of Scydmaenidae, which includes 117 <b>myrmecophilous</b> species in 20 genera The Aleocharinae possess defensive glands on their abdomens, which are used in <b>myrmecophilous</b> species to prevent attacks by their host ant and in more extreme cases to integrate completely into the colony. Many Pselephinae species have trichomes, tufts of hairs which hold placating pheromones. Pselephines have evolved trichomes independently at least four times, most notably in all members of Clavigerini, but also in Attapsenius and Songius genera.|$|E

50|$|<b>Myrmecophilous</b> {{interactions}} {{provide an}} important model system for exploring ecological and evolutionary questions regarding coevolution, plant defense theory, food web structure, species coexistence, and evolutionarily stable strategies. Because many <b>myrmecophilous</b> relationships are easily manipulable and tractable, they allow for testing and experimentation {{that may not}} be possible in other interactions. Therefore, they provide ideal model systems in which to explore the magnitude, dynamics, and frequency of mutualism in nature.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} feed {{on common}} gromwell (Lithospermum officinale) and Pulmonaria officinalis. They {{have also been}} recorded to be <b>myrmecophilous.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{caterpillars}} of this butterfly, {{like other}} members of the subfamily Miletinae, are entomophagous and are predators of scale insects. The species unlike many other lycaenid butterflies is not <b>myrmecophilous.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Gerald W. Krantz and Norman I. Platnick re-examined the {{original}} specimen, {{and found it}} {{not to be a}} spider at all, but an extraordinary male mite that very much resembles a spider. He placed it under the existing <b>myrmecophilous</b> genus Sphaeroseius.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myrmecophilous</b> {{associations}} are best known in butterflies {{of the family}} Lycaenidae. Many lycaenid caterpillars produce nectar by specialized organs and communicate with the ants through sound and vibrations. The association with ants is believed to reduce the parasitisation of the butterfly caterpillars.|$|E
50|$|Young {{adults of}} <b>myrmecophilous</b> Lepidoptera escape from ant's nests {{by virtue of}} the {{deciduous}} waxy scales with which they are covered when born. These scales rub off and stick on the ants as they make {{their way out of the}} nest after hatching.|$|E
5000|$|The {{caterpillars}} feed in April and May {{mainly on}} the rootstock of sow thistles (Sonchus species) and common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), but also on various other plants (Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Artemisia vulgaris, Plantago, Achillea, etc.).

50|$|Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant {{leaves and}} spend {{practically}} {{all of their}} time searching for and eating food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are <b>myrmecophilous,</b> eating ant larvae.|$|E
50|$|This genus is {{remarkable}} for the caterpillars, {{which in some}} species are able to feed {{on a wide range}} of materials that are not usually eaten by Lepidoptera larvae, such as dead insects, manure and straw. The caterpillars of other Aglossa (e.g. A. signicostalis) are <b>myrmecophilous.</b>|$|E

50|$|The term myrmecophile is used {{mainly for}} animals that {{associate}} with ants. There {{are an estimated}} 10,000 species of ants (Formicidae), with a higher diversity in the tropics. In most terrestrial ecosystems ants are ecologically and numerically dominant, being the main invertebrate predators. As a result, ants {{play a key role}} in controlling arthropod richness, abundance, and community structure. There is evidence that the evolution of <b>myrmecophilous</b> interactions has contributed to the abundance and ecological success of ants, by ensuring a dependable and energy-rich food supply and thus providing a competitive advantage for ants over other invertebrate predators. Most <b>myrmecophilous</b> associations are opportunistic, unspecialized, and facultative (meaning both species are capable of surviving without the interaction), though obligate mutualisms (those in which one or both species are dependent on the interaction for survival) have also been observed for many species.|$|E
50|$|Duroia hirsuta is a myrmecophyte {{tree species}} from the Amazon Forest. It {{is one of}} some 37 species of Duroia which are shrubs or canopy trees in the family Rubiaceae, favouring ants (<b>myrmecophilous),</b> and {{occurring}} in Central America {{as far north as}} Mexico, the Amazon Basin, the Guiana Shield, the Brazilian Atlantic coast and planalto.|$|E
50|$|In biology xenophily includes, for example, the {{acceptance}} by an insect of an introduced foreign plant {{closely related to}} the normal host. Xenophily is distinguished from xenophagy (or allotrophy), and is less common than xenophoby. Early 20th century entomologists incorrectly concluded that the evolution of the glandular terminal disk was a function of xenophily, following its discovery in <b>myrmecophilous</b> larvae.|$|E
5000|$|Chrysauginae (including Bradypodicolinae, Semniidae) [...] - [...] about 400 species {{occurring}} predominantly in the Neotropical region. Larvae typically feed on plants, {{but some}} have more unusual feeding habits. The latter include for example some <b>myrmecophilous</b> species, {{as well as}} a number of sloth moths which are dependent on sloths for their entire life cycle. Most Chrysauginae larvae have a sclerotised ring around seta SD1 of the metathorax.|$|E

50|$|The eggs vary {{in shape}} but often appear round and flattened, some have {{the shape of}} a dome or turban. They are similar to the eggs of Lycaenidae. The {{caterpillars}} are usually hairy, plump, and are the common overwintering stage. The caterpillars are usually longer than those of the Lycaenidae except in the <b>myrmecophilous</b> species.Pupae are hairy and attached with silk to either the host plant or to ground debris or leaf litter. There is no cocoon.|$|E
50|$|Another notable {{species is}} milfoil (Achillea tenuifolia) which usually grows up to 80 cm. This species {{is very common}} for {{xerophyte}} associations of the Ararat plain, particularly in sandy semi-desert. Native communities collect milfoil and use it for preparation of food. Milfoil is usually surrounded by numerous ant hills. Ants are vitally tied to this {{as well as other}} sand species. Links between ants and <b>myrmecophilous</b> species (Euphorbia marschalliana, Oligochaeta divaricata, Ziziphora tenuior, Z. persica, etc.) are not yet fully understood.|$|E
