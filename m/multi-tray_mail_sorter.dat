By increasing the number of tasks an individual performs, job enlargement increases the job scope, or job diversity. Instead of only sorting the incoming mail by department, for instance, a <b>mail</b> <b>sorter's</b> job could be enlarged to include physically delivering the mail to the various departments or running outgoing letters through the postage meter.|$|R

After he was discharged, he eventually returned to cricket, and continued to play for his state, Victoria, and club, South Melbourne, into his forties. After his retirement, Trott served as a selector for Victoria for a number of years. Outside of cricket, he worked as a postman and <b>mail</b> <b>sorter.</b> He died of cancer in 1917, aged 51.|$|R
50|$|Generally {{assumed to}} be dead {{in the time of}} most of the books, Johnson is never seen, but was {{certainly}} alive {{around the time of the}} main events of Night Watch: Lord Snapcase took up the Patricianship in the course of the events chronicled at that time, and he could only have commissioned the Ornamental Cruet Set from Johnson after becoming Patrician. This is also approximately when Johnson must have created the ill-fated <b>mail</b> <b>sorter,</b> as dates in Going Postal suggest that this occurred 30 years before the events chronicled there. Given the nature of the sorter, though, timing may not be a problem.|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an Automated <b>Mail</b> <b>Sorter</b> (AMS) {{system that}} scans a mail and interprets {{one of the}} {{imperative}} fields of the destination address, the pin code to sort the mails. The scanned document was segmented into different fields to extract the pin code. A general classifier for the recognition of pin-code digits written in English was then employed. The recognition system consists of a feature extractor and a classification network. The feature extracted was Hu moments and the classification network was the support vector machine using a polynomial kernel of order 2. Other classification networks such as the multi feature recognizer and decomposing network were also used, but SVM gave the maximum accuracy...|$|R
5000|$|Mara then {{demands that}} Fred prove that Kris is [...] "the one and only" [...] Santa Claus {{on the basis}} of some {{competent}} authority. While Fred searches frantically, Susan writes Kris a letter to cheer him up, which Doris also signs. When a <b>mail</b> <b>sorter</b> (Jack Albertson) sees Susan's letter, he suggests they deliver the many letters to Santa taking up space in the dead letter office too. Fred presents Judge Harper with three of them, addressed simply to [...] "Santa Claus" [...] and delivered to Kris, asserting the Post Office has thus acknowledged that he is the Santa Claus. After mailmen dump another 21 full mailbags before him, Harper dismisses the case.|$|R
5000|$|At the time, a <b>mail</b> <b>sorter</b> {{could be}} {{expected}} to sort mail into one of about two dozen [...] "pigeon holes", small bins that collected all of the mail being delivered to a particular <b>mail</b> route. The <b>sorter</b> had to memorize addresses and the routes that served them, reading the address off a letter and placing it into the correct pigeon hole. In a small town each pigeon hole could represent the mail carried by a single deliveryman, and each sorter could remember the streets and sort mail for any of these routes. But for mail that was being delivered across larger areas, the sorting had to be broken into a hierarchy. A receiving station in Alberta routing a letter to Ontario would sort it into the Ontario stack. The mail would then be received in Ontario and sorted at a distribution center to stacks for city or towns. If the city was large enough, it might have to be sorted several more times before it reached an individual carrier.|$|R
