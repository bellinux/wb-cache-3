5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not ready to <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him {{into his office and}} berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware {{that he was going to}} lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|The aim of {{the game}} remains the same from its predecessor: {{complete}} increasingly difficult challenges to <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> race. The difficulty level is changed by increasing the top speed of the craft, through four different classes (Vector, Venom, Rapier and Phantom). The number of laps needed to complete a race also increased with each new class. Victory in the challenge modes is the game's ultimate accomplishment. These modes are similar to a championship where players have to race every track to become champion; however, rather than tallying up points, Challenge mode takes a very single player-centric approach by only allowing progress to the next track by coming in first on the current track. Players can lose the mode by losing all three lives, which are lost by finishing a race in worse than third position. By winning all the races, the player is crowned champion and given access to faster modes, new tracks and ultimately the Piranha craft.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Panic on Funkotron is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} up to two players play as ToeJam and Earl as they travel across Funkotron to capture antagonistic Earthlings that had stowed away. Players accomplish this by using a radar to locate an Earthling's proximity (some Earthlings may be hidden in the environment) and attack them with jars in order to trap and collect them. Once all Earthlings have been found, the player can <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> level. Players can collect presents containing various bonuses, such as super jars, radar scans, and teleporting moves. Coins {{can be used with}} parking meters to trigger events in the environment or participate in minigames such as Jam Outs and Fungus Olympics. Players can also enter gateways leading to the Hyper Funk Zone, where the player must avoid obstacles in order to earn more presents. Hidden throughout the game are ten objects belonging to Lamont the Funkapotamus; collecting all of which will earn the player the best ending upon completion.|$|E

50|$|During {{the regular}} season, each team plays the other nine teams twice, one {{at home and}} one away (10 teams, 18 games, 18 rounds). After this, the top six teams <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second stage, where they play a further 10 games against each other. The top four teams at the {{conclusion}} of <b>the</b> second stage <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> playoffs. In the semi-finals, the No. 1 seed plays the No. 4 seed, and the No. 2 seed plays the No. 3 seed. The winner of each best-of-three semi-final <b>moves</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Finals series <b>to</b> decide <b>the</b> title (also best-of-three).|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{this stage}} {{includes}} various calisthenics, and walking.

25|$|Foster {{has kept}} a {{relatively}} low profile since the group split. He leads a successful soul group and {{has appeared in the}} Channel 4 show The Games in 2005, replacing actor Jonathon Morris, and Channel Five's Trust Me – I'm A Beauty Therapist in October 2006. He has been a reserve on Dancing on Ice for 2009 and 2010. In May 2013, Danny auditioned for the BBC talent show 'The Voice' where he failed to <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> round, but received positive comments regarding his performance.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the talent}} of singing has become competitive. Currently, {{there are several}} {{television}} shows that showcase these talents. American Idol {{was one of the}} prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, {{it was one of the}} first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was Sa Re Ga Ma Pa launched by Zee TV in the 1995..At the American Idol Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. The Voice is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to American Idol, the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include The X Factor, America's Got Talent, Rising Star and The Sing-Off.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} TAKS test, {{the commissioner of}} education announced on April 24, 2012 that the new performance standards students that take end of course exams must meet are Advanced Academic Performance (Highly prepared, like the TAKS test's commended level), Satisfactory Academic Performance (Sufficiently prepared but not the best, like the TAKS test's passing level), and Unsatisfactory Academic Performance (Insufficiently prepared for the next grade and does not <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> grade). However, Scott announced that the scoring system has been suspended for the 2011-2012 school year. There have been no announcements of grades 3-8 grading yet.|$|E
25|$|In Move Mode, {{the player}} may advance or {{backtrack}} (limited) to previous screens. In {{a similar fashion}} to Look Mode, triggers {{will appear on the}} screen and a corresponding directional button must be pressed to move to them, adding a turn to the count. Unlike Look Mode, however, triggers in Move Mode do not require Trigger Points, so one may move as much as one likes, assuming there is no turn limit. Once the player has exited the final screen of a stage, the player will be prompted to save and then <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> stage.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the team}} medals are determined, horses and riders compete for {{individual}} medals. The team competition {{serves as the}} first individual qualifier, in that the top 25 horse/rider combinations from the Grand Prix test <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> round. The second individual qualifier is the Grand Prix Special test, which consists of Grand Prix movements arranged in a different pattern. For those 25 riders, the scores from the Grand Prix and the Grand Prix Special are then combined and the resulting top 15 horse/rider combinations {{move on to the}} individual medal competition—the crowd-pleasing Grand Prix Freestyle to Music (Kür).|$|E

25|$|Part of his {{testimony}} concerned Muhammad's complete multiphase plan. His plan {{consisted of three}} phases in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas. Phase One consisted of meticulously planning, mapping, and practicing their locations around the DC area. This way after each shooting {{they would be able}} to quickly leave the area on a predetermined path, and <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> location. Muhammad's goal in Phase One was to kill 6 white people a day for 30 days (180 per month). Malvo described how Phase One did not go as planned due to heavy traffic and the lack of a clear shot and/or getaway routes at different locations.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} points awarded on each hole is {{determined}} based on comparison {{of the number of}} strokes taken to a fixed score, usually par. This fixed score is then adjusted in relation to the player's handicap. Once players have taken two strokes more than the adjusted fixed score, they may abandon the hole and <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next,</b> as it is then not possible to score any points on that hole. Because of this, it is still possible to be competitive even allowing for a few bad holes. At the end of the round, the {{number of points}} scored on each hole is totaled to give a final score. The winner of a Stableford competition is the player with the highest point total. Final scores may be modified for all players using the Competition Stableford Adjustment system.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{strategy}} of the British during the war was to inhibit the finances of the Qing Empire, with {{the ultimate goal of}} acquiring a colonial possession on the Chinese coast. This was accomplished through the capture of Chinese cities and by blockading major river systems. Once a fort or city had been captured, the British would destroy the local arsenal and disable all of the captured guns. They would then <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> target, leaving a small garrison behind. This strategy was planned and implemented by Major General Gough, who was able to operate with minimal input from the British government after Superintendent Elliot was recalled in 1841. The large number of private British merchants and East India Company ships deployed in Singapore and the India colonies ensured that the British forces in China were adequately supplied.|$|E

30|$|Next, an {{unassigned}} {{customer is}} randomly chosen and is added on the vehicle’s route. If the customer–vehicle pairing {{does not meet}} the problem constraints, <b>the</b> program <b>moves</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next possible pairing. Otherwise, the function removes the customer from the pool of unassigned customers and adds it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vehicle route, updates the vehicle capacity, and <b>moves</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the unassigned customers and vehicles.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that {{this is perhaps the}} most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending on the number of riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want in the pack and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out until you have the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. This is a great event because it really measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider must be more than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good drafting skills, the ability to find good positioning, the intuition to know when {{to get out of the}} pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to be able to do this all day.|$|E

500|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} minigames accessed through an in-game GPS system called Mappie, which is rendered {{as a point}} and click map. In most cases, the player can choose to automatically skip accessing Mappie, but sometimes the player is required to play through the minigame to <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> event. When accessing Mappie, the player meets various people who become Kotarou's friends, and certain people and items encountered will lead the player to do a quest. The names of the friends and the completed quests are recorded in the Memory function, which serves as an encyclopedia of events. If the player completes all 31 quests, a bonus scenario called [...] is made available.

500|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, the tour {{began to be}} re-examined by critics, and {{the tone of the}} {{coverage}} began to change. In 2009, an article in the BBC News singled out the Glass Spider Tour's innovative set and marriage of music and theatre as an inspiration to later acts, including Britney Spears, Madonna, U2 and others. Stage designer Willie Williams said the Glass Spider Tour was a template for those acts: [...] "There will be one set of costumes and they will do a few songs, then there will be another big scene change and <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> thing. Bowie crossing rock 'n' roll with Broadway [...] was where that began." [...] In 2010, the Glass Spider Tour won an award for being one of the best concert designs of all time (alongside other such notable tours as U2's 360° Tour [...] and Pink Floyd's Division Bell Tour [...] ).|$|E
500|$|On January 6, 2006, just a {{few days}} after the Gator Bowl, Virginia Tech {{officials}} dismissed Vick from the Virginia Tech football team, citing a December 17 traffic stop in which Vick was cited for speeding and driving with a revoked or suspended license. Vick hid the information from the team and the infraction was not discovered until January. The traffic stop, an earlier suspension from the team, and his unsportsmanlike conduct during the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were used as grounds for his dismissal. In response to being dismissed from the team, Vick was quoted as saying, [...] "It's not a big deal. I'll just <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> level, baby". Vick appeared in one regular-season NFL game for the Miami Dolphins in 2006. The Dolphins did not renew his contract, and he has been out of football ever since.|$|E
