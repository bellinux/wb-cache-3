5|$|By 1771, {{there were}} 32 {{companies}} of the Royal Artillery in four battalions, {{as well as}} two Invalid Companies comprising older and unfit men employed in garrison duties. In January 1793, two troops of Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) were raised to provide fire support for the cavalry, joined by two more in November 1793. All RHA personnel were <b>mounted.</b> <b>The</b> Royal Irish Artillery was absorbed in 1801.|$|E

5|$|Forward riding, {{also called}} Straight riding or the Remontenschule - This {{is the name}} given to the skills taught {{in the first year}} of training, where a young horse learns to be saddled and bridled, learns basic {{commands}} on a longe line, and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach correct responses to the rider's legs and hands while <b>mounted.</b> <b>The</b> main goal during this time is to develop free forward movement in as natural a position as possible.|$|E

At one point, the Marquess <b>mounted</b> <b>the</b> diamond in the handle of his dress sword. In 1886, the diamond was valued at between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds (today between £ and £), {{due in part to}} its vast gain in brilliancy from the re-cut by Rundell and Bridge.|$|E

Matthias was surrendered to the Hungarian delegates in Strážnice on 9 February. With Poděbrady's mediation, he was reconciled with John Jiskra of Brandýs, the commander of the Czech mercenaries who dominated most of Upper Hungary.|$|E

Rosenbach in 1923, and passed into the collection of Arthur A. Houghton.

5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they <b>mounted</b> <b>the</b> counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but <b>mounted</b> <b>the</b> gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E

However, instead of praises, he received reproaches for his action. His elephant was followed by two other elephants; the first one contained the dead body of Ali Tabar, the other one carried the dead princes' women, who were assured protection by Bahadur Shah.|$|E

The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to suffer from labor pains. So it becomes Cu Chulainn's job to stop Medb's army from advancing further. He does this by invoking the right of single combat at fords. He defeats champion after champion in a stand-off that lasts for months.|$|E
5|$|At the {{procession}} to George's lying in state in Westminster Hall {{part of the}} Imperial State Crown fell from {{on top of the}} coffin and landed in the gutter as the cortège turned into New Palace Yard. The new king, Edward VIII, saw it fall and wondered whether it was a bad omen for his new reign. As a mark of respect to their father, George's four surviving sons, Edward, Albert, Henry, and George, <b>mounted</b> <b>the</b> guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes, at the catafalque on the night before the funeral. The vigil was not repeated until the death of George's daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. George V was interred at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 28 January 1936. Edward abdicated before the year was out, leaving his brother Albert, Duke of York, to ascend the throne (taking the regnal name George VI).|$|E

5|$|By 04:30 on 14July, the 1st Parachute Battalion was {{in control}} of Primosole Bridge, but the Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion were well dug in to the south. Beyond them, 140 men of the 2nd Parachute Battalion had {{occupied}} the three small hills, and taken 500Italian prisoners. In numbers, both battalions had little more than company strength. The 3rd Parachute Battalion had suffered {{the worst in the}} scattered parachute drop, and only a few of their men had arrived at the bridge. With no command structure, they were attached to the 1st Parachute Battalion to help defend the bridge. To the north, the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the 10th Arditi Regiment had been informed of the parachute landings. Many of the 372nd Battalion had disappeared, while the Arditi <b>mounted</b> <b>the</b> first of a number of attacks on the British positions. Without the support of any heavy weapons, they were easily fought off.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias {{in every}} one of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley <b>mounted</b> <b>the</b> guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Godwin {{remarried}} {{and his new}} wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, brought {{two children}} of her own into the marriage, most significantly—from Fanny Imlay and Mary Godwin's perspective—Claire Clairmont.

The Godwin household became an increasingly uncomfortable place to live as tensions rose and debts <b>mounted.</b> <b>The</b> teenage Mary and Claire escaped by running off to the Continent with Shelley in 1814. Fanny, left behind, bore the brunt of her stepfather's anger. She became increasingly isolated from her family and committed suicide in 1816.|$|E
