5|$|About 27hours before landfall, Mexican {{officials}} {{issued a}} hurricane watch from Mazatlán to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, with {{a tropical storm}} watch issued further south to Manzanillo. Six hours later when its track became <b>more</b> <b>apparent,</b> the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Mazatlán to La Fortuna, with a tropical storm warning southward to Manzanillo.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fields}} of ecology and {{environmental}} studies develop, exotic species attract more attention and their effects become <b>more</b> <b>apparent.</b> Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E

25|$|Burns had a {{significant}} influence on Alexander McLachlan and some influence on Robert Service. While {{this may not be}} so obvious in Service's English verse, which is Kiplingesque, it is <b>more</b> readily <b>apparent</b> in his Scots verse.|$|R
50|$|The {{pattern is}} <b>more</b> readily <b>apparent</b> at the {{departmental}} level {{than at the}} regional level. It {{is part of a}} broader pattern of low population density which extends into Spain and Portugal, and which is known as the continental diagonal.|$|R
5|$|During the 1970s, UK and France were {{developing}} a new aircraft which could fill the RAF tactical strike and reconnaissance missions: the SEPECAT Jaguar was introduced into service in 1974, {{and led to a}} re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, the limitations of the Lightning as an interceptor were becoming <b>more</b> <b>apparent.</b> The conversion of the RAF's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar, combined with its use of the Blackburn Buccaneer, meant {{that it was possible to}} begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{also gave}} credit to Elizabeth Sanders, Phipps' granddaughter and {{literary}} executor, for her skillful {{handling of the}} last two volumes. The purpose of the work becomes even <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> and direct under her management and editing of the material. The role of the future marshals becomes more clear in the campaigns of 1797, and especially in the Italian campaign; her handling of the material kept it fully focused on the future marshals Massena, Augereau, Berthier, and Brune.|$|E
5|$|Thompson's {{screenplay}} {{exaggerated the}} Dashwood family's wealth {{to make their}} later scenes of poverty <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> to modern audiences. It also altered the traits of the male leads {{to make them more}} appealing to contemporary viewers. Elinor and Marianne's different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. Ang Lee was selected as director, both due to his work in the 1993 film The Wedding Banquet and because Doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Lee was given a budget of $16 million.|$|E

Taking a user perspective, the effect of a change in minimum wage will be <b>more</b> readily <b>apparent</b> within managerial accounting systems than financial accounting systems under current standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board...|$|R
50|$|The Storm {{had lost}} twice to the Dragons already in 1999 {{and by the}} time Melbourne was behind by 0-14 at half time, it was <b>more</b> than <b>apparent</b> that St. George - Illawarra were going to take the premiership in their first ever season. There was nothing in the Storm's {{performance}} to indicate that a comeback was possible.|$|R
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of +0.08, Capella is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest star {{visible to the naked eye}} from the latitude 40° N. It appears to be a rich yellowish-white color, although the yellow color is <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone advisory was issued on Tropical Storm Dorothy, a hurricane watch and storm warning were issued for the Leeward Islands from Dominica northward. As its westward track became <b>more</b> <b>apparent,</b> the watches and warnings were extended southward to include Martinique and Saint Lucia. On Martinique, authorities {{released a statement}} that warned the public for the potential for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough waves. Also on the island, officials converted schools and government buildings into shelters for people in low-lying areas. As {{a result of the}} storm, the Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport in Le Lamentin was closed.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being the}} capital city, Kota Kinabalu {{is also the}} main {{industrial}} and commercial centre for Sabah. The economy {{is dominated by the}} primary sector of industry. Historically, the secondary sector dominated the economy, but due to rapid urbanisation and economic development, this sector of the economy is slowly diminishing. More recently, a move towards a more tertiary-based industry has become <b>more</b> <b>apparent,</b> especially with regards to the boom in the tourism industry. Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies have their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role involved 'coolie' (slavery work) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.|$|E

40|$|Gender {{differences}} {{in health and}} nutrition have long been a subject of study in the intrahousehold allocation literature. Unlike consumption expenditures or farm production, measurements of health and nutritional outcomes are always at the individual level, and thus factors that underlie systematic {{differences in}} outcomes—such as age, gender, and position within the household—are <b>more</b> readily <b>apparent.</b> Book chapterPRIFPRI 1; GenderFCN...|$|R
5|$|Daydream is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, released on October 3, 1995, by Columbia Records. The follow-up to her internationally successful album Music Box (1993) and holiday album Merry Christmas (1994), Daydream differed from the two by leaning increasingly towards hip hop and urban music. Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote and produced most of her two previous albums. With Daydream, Carey took {{more control over the}} musical direction as well as the album's composition. Carey said she considered Daydream the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation, a change that became <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> in her sixth album Butterfly (1997). During the album's production, Carey endured many creative differences with her label and husband Tommy Mottola.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{duration}} of the cyclone, the National Hurricane Center recommended for interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico to monitor the progress of the storm. Upon regaining tropical storm status on June 1, the governments of Guatemala and Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Sipacate, Guatemala to Barra de Tonala, Mexico. Later, as the track became <b>more</b> <b>apparent,</b> the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning, and a tropical storm watch was extended westward to Salina Cruz, Mexico. Officials in Mexico allocated emergency funds for southern regions of Chiapas and Oaxaca in preparation for a potential flooding disaster. At least 1,400people were evacuated in Chiapas to emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's chorea, is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become <b>more</b> <b>apparent.</b> Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.|$|E
5000|$|The blues scholar Paul Oliver {{noted that}} the [...] "raspy, buzzing sound" [...] {{of some of the}} jug band {{instruments}} was close to the musical aesthetic of Africa and that the jug and kazoo represented the voices of animals or ancestral spirits. However, many of the Memphis Jug Band's influences are <b>more</b> readily <b>apparent</b> in popular musical styles of their time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reversed}} vocal {{technique of}} backmasking {{is used in}} several places on the album; some segments are <b>more</b> audibly <b>apparent</b> than others. In particular, backmasking during the intro section of [...] "Creepy Green Light", which was originally titled [...] "Spooky Green Light", refers to a third-person [...] "spell" [...] of a friend's intention {{to be reunited with}} a dead spouse.|$|R
50|$|It {{was then}} {{decided that the}} entire fleet should be coppered, due to the {{difficulties}} in maintaining a mixed fleet of coppered and non-coppered ships. By 1781, 82 ships of the line had been coppered, along with fourteen 50-gun ships, 115 frigates, and 182 unrated vessels. By the time the war ended in 1783, problems with the hull bolts were once <b>more</b> becoming <b>apparent.</b>|$|R
5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players. FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar {{but he said the}} lag was not enough to hinder his enjoyment of the multiplayer action.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the danger}} from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada {{as part of a}} {{government}} evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over ₤1 million and strain Britain's resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At {{the same time that the}} British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became <b>more</b> <b>apparent,</b> experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{series is}} not told in a linear fashion. Instead, several storylines {{progress}} simultaneously, {{with the individual}} novels moving backwards and forwards between them. As the series progresses, links between these storylines become <b>more</b> readily <b>apparent.</b> During a book signing in November 2005, Steven Erikson confirmed that the Malazan saga consists of three major story arcs, equating them to the points of a triangle.|$|R
25|$|Treating {{the story}} of Dong Hai Chuan and Guo Yunshen as allegory, however, reveals a common {{training}} protocol among Xing Yi Quan and Bagua Zhang practitioners. Often, because Bagua Zhang requires significantly more time for a practitioner's skill to mature, it is acceptable to learn Xing Yi Quan first or simultaneously. Such a practitioner develops a tactical vocabulary that is <b>more</b> readily <b>apparent</b> than the core Bagua Zhang movements.|$|R

As Culver (2010) explains: [...] "The bohemian sexual and marital <b>mores</b> already <b>apparent</b> in Hollywood intersected with the resort atmosphere of Palm Springs, and this new, more open sexuality would gradually appear elsewhere in national tourist culture." [...] During this period, the city government, stimulated by {{real estate developers}} systematically removed and excluded poor people and Indians.|$|R
5|$|The skull {{has a long}} rostrum (front part), broad interorbital region (between the eyes), and low braincase. It {{differs from}} that of T.bolivaris in various proportions, which are <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> in adults than in juveniles. The skull of H.megacephalus is {{distinctly}} larger. The zygomatic plate is broad and includes a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) is heavy. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend about as far backward. The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak beading at its margins; T.bolivaris is similar, but has stronger beading and H.megacephalus entirely lacks the beading. The parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to its side, as it does in most T.bolivaris. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is large.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{lost the}} 1976 Republican nomination, Ronald Reagan ran again for the {{presidency}} in 1980, and succeeded in winning the nomination and election. During this second campaign, Nancy played a very prominent role, and her management of staff became <b>more</b> <b>apparent.</b> She arranged a meeting among feuding campaign managers John Sears and Michael Deaver, and her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and Sears being given full control. After the Reagan camp lost the Iowa Caucus and fell behind in New Hampshire polls, Nancy organized a second meeting and {{decided it was time}} to fire Sears and his associates; she gave Sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal. Her influence on her husband became particularly notable; her presence at rallies, luncheons, and receptions increased his confidence.|$|E
5|$|Argus had her genesis in the Admiralty's desire {{during the}} First World War for an {{aircraft}} carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but {{had no way to}} recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder William Beardmore had proposed to the Admiralty {{an aircraft carrier}} design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became <b>more</b> <b>apparent,</b> this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian ocean liners Conte Rosso and Giulio Cesare had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. Conte Rosso was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of Giulio Cesare, and the company began work on converting the ship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{domain name}} record for [...]so was {{initially}} created on 28 August 1997, {{at or near}} the peak of the ml.org service's popularity. At the time, the potential benefits seemed <b>more</b> than <b>apparent.</b> By taking responsibility for a country code domain, Monolith could have become able to issue *.so domains at second-level for little or no cost, providing a viable alternative to the higher Network Solutions pricing of that era.|$|R
