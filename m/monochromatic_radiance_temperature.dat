This method is achieved by a simultaneous measurement, in the near infrared spectral band, of the <b>radiance</b> <b>temperature</b> fields and of the emissivity fields measured indirectly by reflectometry. The theoretical framework of the method is introduced and {{the principle of the}} measurements at two wavelengths is detailed. The crucial features of the indirect measurement of emissivity are the measurement of bidirectional reflectivities in a single direction and the introduction of an unknown variable, called the ``diffusion factor. '' <b>Radiance</b> <b>temperature</b> and bidirectional reflectivities are then merged into a bichromatic system based on Kirchhoff's laws. The assumption of the system, based on the invariance of the diffusion factor for two near wavelengths, and the value of the chosen wavelengths, are then discussed in relation to a database of several material properties. A thermoreflectometer prototype was developed, dimensioned, and evaluated. Experiments were carried out to outline its trueness in challenging cases.

40|$|Abstract. Free {{solidification}} of a pool {{of molten}} alumina formed by local heating of solid alumina by concentrated CO 2 laser radiation was investigated. During free rapid cooling from 2700 ^ 2900 K in ambient air {{and in the course}} of solidification a high-speed pyrometer measured the thermograms of two <b>radiance</b> <b>temperatures</b> at the wavelengths of 0. 55 mm and 0. 72 mm. A high-speed scanning spectrometer measured the intensity of emitted radiation in the wave-length range from 0. 5 to 1. 3 mm. An infrared spectrometer measured the intensity of radiation of one discrete wavelength, which could be chosen in the range from 2 to 12 mm. In addition, the pool surface images during solidification were recorded with a CCD camera. Owing to semi-transparency of the melt, its emitted radiation depends in the general case on temperature distribution and the optical properties of the emitting surface layer. During solidification the spectral emissivity el in the whole of the scanned spectral region is high and lies in the range from 0. 8 to 1. A horizontal plateau of el and, accordingly, the <b>radiance</b> <b>temperature</b> is observed only in the infrared range of high absorption from 6 to 10 mm.

One challenge in this research is that the one-dimensional (1 D) radiative models widely used in both remote sensing and dynamical simulations become less accurate near cloud edges: The large horizontal gradients in particle concentrations imply that accurate radiative calculations need to consider multi-dimensional radiative interactions among areas that have widely different optical properties. This study examines the way {{the importance}} of multidimensional shortwave radiative interactions changes as we approach cloud edges.
