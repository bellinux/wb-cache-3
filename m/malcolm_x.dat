5|$|The {{originally}} scheduled {{start date}} was mid-August 1995, but filming was delayed until February 26, 1996. Director Tim Burton hired Peter Suschitzky as the cinematographer, {{because he was}} a fan of his work in David Cronenberg's films. Production designer Thomas Wynn (A Beautiful Mind, <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X)</b> intended to have the war room pay tribute to Dr. Strangelove (1964). During production, Burton insisted that the art direction, cinematography and costume design of Mars Attacks! incorporate the look of the 1960s trading cards.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his {{participation}} {{in the civil rights}} movement, King was criticized by many groups. This included opposition by more militant blacks such as Nation of Islam member <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X.</b> Stokely Carmichael was a separatist and disagreed with King's plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture. Omali Yeshitela urged Africans to remember the history of violent European colonization and how power was not secured by Europeans through integration, but by violence and force.|$|E
5|$|When African {{slaves were}} freed in America, they {{struggled}} {{to reach the}} social status of whites. Many former slaves tried to conform their hairstyles {{as part of this}} struggle. Women, especially, felt pressure to make their hair straight, rather than keeping the tightly coiled style they had known. However, during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, African-Americans such as <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X</b> advocated hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks, in order to embrace their race, and to return to West African roots.|$|E

This interchange with Cedar and Larch streets is also a connection to Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96) and Pennsylvania Avenue. St. Joseph Street ends after the connection to Pennsylvania Avenue.

5|$|Denzel Washington is an American {{actor who}} made his feature film debut in Carbon Copy (1981). In 1982, Washington made his first {{appearance}} in the medical drama St. Elsewhere as Dr. Philip Chandler. The role {{proved to be the}} breakthrough in his career. He starred as Private First Class Melvin Peterson in the drama A Soldier's Story (1984). The film was an adaptation of the Off-Broadway play A Soldier's Play (1981–1983) in which Washington had earlier portrayed the same character. In 1987, he played Steve Biko, an anti-apartheid activist in the Richard Attenborough-directed drama Cry Freedom, for which he received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

5|$|I-496 {{starts at}} an {{interchange}} with I-96/I-69 at that freeway's exit95 in Delta Township in Eaton County. The freeway runs eastward through suburban {{areas of the}} township adjacent to some residential subdivisions. Continuing eastward, there is an interchange for Creyts Road before I-496 angles to the northeast. At the interchange with Waverly Road, I-496 crosses into Ingham County.

Near a partial interchange with Lansing Road (old US27), the freeway gains a pair of service drives: St. Joseph Street runs one-way westbound on the north side, and <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X</b> Street runs eastbound to the south. The next interchange is for the connection to the Capitol Loop and M-99, both of which run along Martin Luther King Boulevard. The Capitol Loop, also internally numbered Connector 496, is a signed connector that provides access to various state government buildings like the Michigan State Capitol. South of this interchange, M-99 connects to the Lansing Car Assembly plant, a former facility for Oldsmobile.|$|E
5|$|The {{initial address}} {{received}} a mixed reception within the Congo. In some quarters {{it was widely}} supported. However, some believed that it merely highlighted the fact that Lumumba was inexperienced (and overly provocative) in comparison with Kasa-Vubu's measured and diplomatic approach. Members of Lumumba's own party, including Kanza, praised the speech itself but believed that the venue in which it had been delivered was inappropriate. Lumumba's address was also notably acclaimed by figures within the international Pan-African and Black Power movements including <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X.</b> The speech may have further heightened racial violence between white settlers and native Congolese which were already distrustful. As {{a result of the}} threat to its expatriates, Belgium deployed troops to the country and, amid mounting violence, several regions of the Congo, notably Katanga, seceded and declared their own independence, starting five-years of violence and political unrest known as the Congo Crisis.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Ballot or the Bullet" [...] served several {{purposes}} at {{a critical}} point in <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X's</b> life: {{it was part of}} his effort to distance himself from the Nation of Islam, and it was intended to reach out to moderate civil rights leaders. At the same time, the speech indicated that Malcolm still supported Black nationalism and self-defense and thus had not made a complete break with his past. [...] "The Ballot or the Bullet" [...] also marked a notable shift in <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X's</b> rhetoric, as he presented previously undiscussed ways of looking at the relationship between blacks and whites.|$|R

In March 1964, <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X</b> left the Nation due to disagreements with Elijah Muhammad; among other things, <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X</b> cited his interest in working with other civil rights leaders, saying that Muhammad had prevented him from doing so in the past. Later, <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X</b> also said Muhammad had engaged in extramarital affairs with young Nation secretariesa serious violation of Nation teachings. On February 21, 1965, <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X</b> {{was shot and killed}} while giving a speech at the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights, New York.

25|$|However, {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s, some black American leaders, notably <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X,</b> {{objected to the}} word Negro because they {{associated}} it with {{the long history of}} slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second class citizens, or worse. <b>Malcolm</b> <b>X</b> preferred Black to Negro, but also started using the term Afro-American after leaving the Nation of Islam.|$|E
