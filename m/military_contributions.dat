5|$|The {{stunning}} {{victory at}} the Battle of Rossbach marked {{a turning point in}} alliances of the Seven Years' War. Britain increased its financial support for Frederick. French interest in the so-called Prussian war declined sharply after the Rossbach debacle and, with the signing of the Third Treaty of Versailles in March 1759, France reduced its financial and <b>military</b> <b>contributions</b> to the Coalition, leaving Austria on its own to deal with Prussia in Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|While the {{tensions}} between NATO members from the build-up to the invasion of Iraq had dissipated, the NATO summit, and the months preceding the summit, were marked by divisions between the United States and the United Kingdom {{on the one side}} and France, Germany, Italy and Spain on the other. Two rifts existed, one about the <b>military</b> <b>contributions</b> to the war in Afghanistan, and the other concerning whether or not NATO should assume a more global role.|$|E

25|$|The {{activities}} of Augustus II {{were aimed at}} strengthening his royal power in the Commonwealth. Nobility's opposition to the stationing of Saxon troops in Poland, its cost and internally threatening role, led to military resistance, first attempted in 1714 {{and then in a}} more definitive way pursued in 1715, when the action unified the pro-Swedish and pro-Russian camps and Peter I's support was secured. In the fall the Crown army became organized in an anti-Saxon capacity and fighting commenced, with large scale participation not only of szlachta, but also of the oppressed by <b>military</b> <b>contributions</b> peasants. In November, the Tarnogród Confederation, with Stanisław Ledóchowski as its marshal was formed, having the goal of removing the Saxons from the Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|The fiscal {{difficulties}} affected {{also the}} Commonwealth diplomacy and foreign policy. John III kept resident diplomats in several major capitals, but the Sejm imposed limits {{on what they}} could undertake. The Sejm also banned long-term resident foreign representations in Warsaw, a prohibition ignored by the papacy and numerous governments. The Sejm itself had rather frequently sent its own missions abroad. The magnates, including top state officials, especially the hetmans, conducted their own foreign activities and at times served foreign powers for their private gain. When French dominated European diplomacy, in Poland the official language was still Latin. The 1684 treaty of Holy League, which ignored the recent Polish <b>military</b> <b>contributions</b> and Polish interests alike, was {{just one example of}} the Commonwealth's diplomacy lack of effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|After {{this series}} of {{imperial}} advances, on 5 November a Prussian corps under Frederick engaged Soubise's much larger force {{near the village of}} Rossbach in Saxony. The ensuing Battle of Rossbach ended in a stunning Prussian victory, in which Frederick lost fewer than 1,000 men, while the Franco-German force under Soubise lost around 10,000. This victory secured Prussia's control of Saxony for the time, and its effect on the morale of both sides was dramatic. After the embarrassing defeat at Rossbach, French interest in the Silesian War declined sharply; with the signing of Third Treaty of Versailles in March 1758, France greatly reduced its financial and <b>military</b> <b>contributions</b> to the Austrian coalition, leaving Rossbach as the only battle between the French and Prussians during the entire war.|$|E

500|$|Smith, Southern Rhodesia's first {{native-born}} head of government, {{was strongly}} influenced as premier by his wartime experiences. Southern Rhodesia's <b>military</b> <b>contributions</b> {{during the two}} World Wars, the Malayan Emergency and other conflicts, combined with memories of his own travails for Britain with the Royal Air Force—"undoubtedly the central experience of his life", RW Johnson wrote—caused Smith to feel profoundly betrayed when the British government proved one of his main adversaries as Prime Minister. The UK government's objection to continued white minority rule, based on moral and geopolitical factors, clashed with Smith's refusal to establish a timetable for the progressive introduction of majority rule in Southern Rhodesia. After talks repeatedly broke down, Smith's government unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965. In 1970, following {{the results of a}} referendum, he declared Rhodesia a republic. He argued that Britain was to blame for all of this—"Rhodesia did not want to seize independence from Britain. It was forced upon us," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to Ticonderoga, Arnold began to exert more {{authority over the}} place as Allen's men drifted away. [...] However, a Connecticut force of 1,000 men under Colonel Benjamin Hinman arrived in June with orders placing him in command with Arnold as his subordinate. This act angered Arnold, who felt his {{efforts on behalf of}} the revolution were not being recognized; he resigned his commission and headed for his home in Connecticut. [...] Arnold's angry response to the loss of command led some members of Congress to dislike him in spite of his <b>military</b> <b>contributions.</b> [...] Congressional opinion of Arnold was also negatively affected by reports circulated by two men that Arnold came to consider enemies. [...] John Brown and James Easton were two of Allen's lieutenants who had traveled to Massachusetts and Philadelphia to report on the action. [...] While their characterizations of Arnold's behavior were accurate, he apparently came to believe that they had probably slandered him, and later interactions with both men were marked by conflict. [...] In an encounter between Arnold and Easton in June, Easton slighted Arnold's authority, to which Arnold responded by challenging the other man to a duel. [...] Easton demurred, and Arnold, in his account of the affair, [...] "took the Liberty of Breaking his head". [...] After Arnold resigned his Massachusetts commission, the state's Committee of Safety appointed Easton to take over the Massachusetts troops at Ticonderoga.|$|E

These often took on mythical proportions and have become favorite activities for Israelis.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the lack of}} an {{effective}} royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the Guerras Irmandiñas ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), when leagues of peasants and burghers, with the support of a number of knights, noblemen, and under legal protection offered by the remote king, toppled many of the castles of the Kingdom and briefly drove the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as [...] "doma del Reino de Galicia": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities of the Kingdom, to ask for monetary and <b>military</b> <b>contributions.</b> This assembly soon developed into the voice and legal representation of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will and laws.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{investigating}} how metaphors {{are used in}} political speeches to achieve persuasion. By analyzing three speeches dealing with the Iraqi war 2003 and delivered by Bush, Blair and Howard, I {{try to find out}} the similarities and differences in how metaphors are constructed, how they are used as a persuasive technique, and lastly if the different <b>military</b> <b>contribution</b> of the three countries affected how metaphors are constructed. The main theory used in this study is Critical Metaphor Analysis suggested by Charteris-Black (2011). The analysis suggests that the speeches contain different kinds of metaphors like personification, the POLITICS IS BUSINESS metaphor and JOURNEY metaphors. Metaphors are generally found to be used in a similar way in order to show that the politicians are ‘right’. Still, there are some differences that could be attributed to the different <b>military</b> <b>contribution</b> of the countries and their different role in the war. ...|$|R
