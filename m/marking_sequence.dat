This method {{may be used}} in macromastias when the technique chosen implies a postoperative scar with the shape of an inverted T. The <b>marking</b> <b>sequence</b> follows standard steps, but the drawing is always different because it is a consequence of the shape of the breast. This marking method reduces the chance of making mistakes due to excessive personal evaluations or to the use of standard drawing patterns that may be not suitable for all breast shapes...|$|E

As discussed in Algorithm 2, BID dispatches the requests {{from the earliest}} marked staging queue and follows the <b>marking</b> <b>sequence.</b> The size of dispatch queue depends on the device driver specification and all the I/O requests from staging queue may not get dispatched at once. BID ensures that a staging queue is fully flushed before considering the next marked staging queue. This prevents multiplexing of I/O requests, thereby involves less movement of the disk arm to disjoint locations in the physical media.|$|E
40|$|By using {{improved}} transformation {{methods for}} Wangiella dermatitidis, and a cloned fragment of its chitin synthase 4 structural gene (WdCHS 4) as a <b>marking</b> <b>sequence,</b> the full-length gene was {{rescued from the}} genome of this human pathogenic fungus. The encoded chitin synthase product (WdChs 4 p) showed high homology with Chs 3 p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other class IV chitin synthases, and Northern blotting showed that WdCHS 4 was expressed at constitutive levels under all conditions tested. Reduced chitin content, abnormal yeast clumpiness and budding kinetics, and increased melanin secretion resulted from the disruption of WdCHS 4 suggesting that WdChs 4 p influences cell wall structure, cellular reproduction, and melanin deposition, respectively. However, no significant loss of virulence was detected when the wdchs 4 Δ strain was tested in an acute mouse model. Using a wdchs 1 Δ wdchs 2 Δ wdchs 3 Δ triple mutant of W. dermatitidis, which grew poorly but adequately at 25 °C, we assayed WdChs 4 p activity {{in the absence of}} activities contributed by its three other WdChs proteins. Maximal activity required trypsin activation, suggesting a zymogenic nature. The activity also had a pH optimum of 7. 5, was most stimulated by Mg 2 +, and was more inhibited by polyoxin D than by nikkomycin Z. Although the WdChs 4 p activity had a broad temperature optimum between 30 to 45 °C in vitro, this activity alone did not support the growth of the wdchs 1 Δ wdchs 2 Δ wdchs 3 Δ triple mutant at 37 °C, a temperature commensurate with infection...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} to investigate discourse markers from a functional and attitudinal perspective. Based on the pedagogical sub-corpus from CANCODE and the audio-recordings of class discussion of 49 secondary pupils in Hong Kong, Part I explores the roles discourse markers play in spoken discourse on a contextual basis and compares the different use of discourse markers by British and Hong Kong speakers of English using {{quantitative and qualitative}} methods. Discourse markers are found to serve as useful contextual coordinates to structure and organise speech on interpersonal (marking shared knowledge, attitudes and responses), referential (indicating textual relationships such as cause, contrast, coordination, digression, consequence, etc.), structural (summarising opinions, <b>marking</b> <b>sequence,</b> opening and closing of topics, transition and continuation of topics) and cognitive (denoting hesitation and thinking process, marking reformulation, self- correction or elaboration, and assessing the listener's knowledge about the utterances) realms, bearing a probabilistic relationship with the various role(s) on a multifunctional dimension in pedagogic discourse. Functionally, non-native speakers are found to display a highly restricted use of discourse markers, especially those interactive ones (e. g. initial and, yeah, you know,), whereas native speakers tend to use discourse markers more {{for a variety of}} pragmatic functions. Part II contains a questionnaire survey (N= 132) and an interview study (N= 3) of Hong Kong teachers. Reliability test and factor analysis were conducted In the quantitative part. The results indicate a very positive perception of the pragmatic and pedagogic value of discourse markers by the teachers where students at intermediate-advanced level are challenged to acquire them for both receptive and productive purposes. The findings also reveal teachers' preference to conform to an exonormative speaking model and their less favourable attitude towards the Hong Kong variety. They are not certain regarding the representation of discourse markers in the existing teaching materials and their actual teaching. The study has implications for second language teaching in five areas: (1) introducing discourse markers as a communication strategy; (2) developing learners' linguistic awareness of discourse markers as an instructional strategy; (3) utilising corpus-based research for materials development; (4) equipping teachers with a World English perspective; and (5) creating space for the development of Hong Kong English to prepare learners to communicate in a dynamic linguistic world.

We investigate two processes for constructing non-negative topological orderings of weighted directed acyclic graphs.

40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} a simple method to <b>mark</b> specific <b>sequences</b> in double-stranded DNA molecules. For the marking, we used two specifically designed oligonucleotides, {{one of which}} is complementary to the <b>sequence</b> to be <b>marked</b> and the other, serving as a splint, to make the marking stable and detectable by subsequent various analytical means. In the presence of the two deoxyoligonucleotides, whereas RecA protein-mediated reaction converts the <b>sequence</b> to be <b>marked</b> to a regional triple-stranded structure with the complementary (probing) oligonucleotide, DNA ligase transforms it to a stable multi- (possibly quintuple) stranded structure with the splint oligonucleotide. The whole marking process is simple and completed in a single reaction mixture. Because RecA protein makes the marking to proceed with high fidelity, we were able to mark (detect) SNPs in complex genomes like human's. Furthermore, the structure of the <b>marked</b> <b>sequence</b> is stable and quite distinct enough to be readily detectable by biochemical means or direct observation by scanning probe microscopy...|$|R

In some unpublished work, DeConcini and Procesi derived a recurrence for the Sn-character of the cohomology of X([Sigma]), and Stanley later used this to translate the problem of combinatorially describing the isotypic Eulerian numbers into the language of symmetric functions.

We identify a weakness of LSTM networks processing continual input streams without explicitly <b>marked</b> <b>sequence</b> ends.

Recent identification of Mu-like prophages within bacterial genomes offers new material for evolutionary and comparative functional studies. One such prophage, Hin–Mu of Haemophilus influenzae Rd, was studied for its transpositional properties. The components of its transposition core machinery, the encoded transposase (MuAHin) and the transposase binding sites, were evaluated for functional properties by sequence comparisons and DNase I footprinting. Transpositional activity of Hin–Mu was examined by in vitro assays directly assessing the assembly and catalytic function of the transposition core machinery. The Hin–Mu components readily assembled catalytically competent protein–DNA complexes, transpososomes. Thus, Hin–Mu encodes a functional transposase and contains critical transposase binding sites. Despite <b>marked</b> <b>sequence</b> differences, components of the Hin–Mu and Mu transposition core machineries are partially interchangeable, reflecting both conservation and flexibility in the functionally important regions within the transpososome structure...|$|R

Upon activation of these receptors, Fas/APO- 1 binds a protein called MORT 1 (or FADD) and p 55 -R binds a protein called TRADD. MORT 1 and TRADD can also bind to each other.

This protein exists in multiple isoforms, some of which contain a region that has proteolytic activity and shows <b>marked</b> <b>sequence</b> homology to proteases of the ICE/CED- 3 family.
