40|$|Parks and {{protected}} areas are long-regarded as effective measures for conservation of biodiversity. More recently, {{they are also}} recognized {{as a means to}} provide social and economic benefits and indefinite ecological and environmental services, particularly to local communities. Historically, parks {{and protected}} areas have been managed through an exclusive model, whereby local communities are regarded as a threat to biodiversity preservation. More recently, this model is being replaced by an inclusive model which regards local communities as important stakeholders and partners in sustainable resource management. Like other developing countries of the world, Pakistan is switching to the inclusive model, mostly under the influence and pressure of the world community and external donors. 	This thesis focuses on the Ayubia National Park (ANP) in Pakistan. This park is managed by the provincial government of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province through the Wildlife Department. At the same time, the park falls within the jurisdiction of the Forest Department by virtue of its being located within reserve forest. Until 1996, the traditional exclusive conservation model was predominant. Under the influence of the European Union (EU) and IUCN – The World Conservation Union – the inclusive approach has been tested in the park since 1996. Accordingly, the first park management plan was prepared with the active collaboration of all local communities, the WWF-Pakistan, and the Forest and Wildlife Departments. The planning document was designed to promote co-management and incorporate the viewpoints of all the local communities in park management. Following termination of EU funding, the plan was implemented, but without active involvement of the local communities. Evidence presented in this thesis shows that, due to strict management in line with the traditional exclusive conservation model, park resources have improved to a certain extent. However, failure in implementing the <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>planning</b> document has resulted in local communities developing serious mistrust against the Wildlife Department. This thesis suggests that short-term improvements in park resources mask the persistent problems of poor governance in the study area. The thesis shows that marked differences between the Forest and Wildlife Departments, and between local communities and the concerned government agencies provide a poor foundation for long-term sustainable resource management. Thus ineffective governance {{lies at the heart of}} resource management problems within the park. The thesis recommends that in order to effectively address the current park-people conflicts a state-centric co-management model should be pursued. Such a hybrid model will have the strengths of both the exclusive and inclusive models. The thesis further presents a framework focusing on effective environmental governance, effective management and effective planning. Importantly, the thesis argues that for effective environmental governance to be realized, the management approach must be place-based and site-specific. Thus, the thesis recommends both micro and macro level environmental governance measures. Such measures can be undertaken through proper institutional reforms that are undertaken at three distinct levels: legislative reforms, educational reforms and organizational reforms...|$|E

In June 1947, the nationalist leaders, including Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad on behalf of the Congress, Jinnah representing the Muslim League, B. R. Ambedkar representing the Untouchable community, and Master Tara Singh representing the Sikhs, agreed to a partition of the country along religious lines. The predominantly Hindu and Sikh areas were assigned to the new India and predominantly Muslim areas to the new nation of Pakistan; the plan included a partition of the Muslim-majority provinces of Punjab and Bengal.|$|R

25|$|Late in 1946, the Labour {{government}} in Britain, its exchequer {{exhausted by the}} recently concluded World War II, decided to end British rule of India, and in early 1947 Britain announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948. However, with the British army unprepared for the potential for increased violence, the new viceroy, Louis Mountbatten, advanced the date for the transfer of power, allowing {{less than six months}} for a <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>plan</b> for independence.

50|$|In 1946-48, Abdullah {{actually}} supported partition {{in order}} that the Arab allocated areas of the British Mandate for Palestine could be annexed into Transjordan. Abdullah {{went so far as}} to have secret meetings with the Jewish Agency (future Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir was among the delegates to these meetings) that came to a <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> upon partition <b>plan</b> independently of the United Nations in November 1947. On 17 November 1947, in a secret meeting with Meir, Abdullah stated that he wished to annex all of the Arab parts as a minimum, and would prefer to annex all of Palestine. This partition plan was supported by British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin who preferred to see Abdullah's territory increased at the expense of the Palestinians rather than risk the creation of a Palestinian state headed by the Mufti of Jerusalem Mohammad Amin al-Husayni.|$|R
40|$|Ms A, a 74 -year-old lady, {{suffered}} non-small cell {{lung cancer}} with brain secondaries. On examination, Ms A was unconscious but arousable. Neurological examination revealed bilateral sixth cranial nerve palsy and {{absence of the}} gag reflex. Ms A’s husband died 20 years ago. She had a son who lived in Australia, and a daughter, Ms B, who was a clinical psychologist. Ms A had assigned her son as proxy to make decisions regarding her medical care, witnessed by a solicitor. The staff considered Ms B’s manner rude, and her demands often ‘unreasonable’. These included frequent telephone calls to the ward or the doctors to ask for details about the patient’s condition, and insisting on immediate action for non-urgent matters. She also demanded oral feeding of her mother despite absence of the gag reflex. She made frequent complaints about the ward staff. The team decided that the goals of management were to negotiate a <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> care <b>plan</b> and provide quality care to the patient, and if possible, to the family members as well. Another goal was to minimize the negative staff emotions in looking after this patient. The strategies used to achieve these goals included enhanced staff support and teamwork. Staff members were encouraged to ventilate their emotions with colleagues. The senior staff had to take u...|$|R
40|$|EU Enlargement is a {{consequence}} of the success story of the creation of the European Communities, as many applicant countries were attracted to the new legal order based on the rule of law, rather than to an order or disorder based on the rule of politics. As from May 1 st 2004, the EU enlargement, unprecedented in its size, marks a historic milestone for the European Union and its Member States, and also for the whole continent. Given this new context, the EU has to find and define new cooperation partnerships with its neighbours. A major partner, not to be neglected in this new policy is by all means Russia. The first Summit between the enlarged EU and Russia held in Moscow on 21 May 2004 was the first high-level meeting of the 25 EU and Russia following the successful conclusion of negotiations between the European Commission and Russia on the extension of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) to the ten new EU Member States. The Summit calls for the reinforcement of EU-Russia relations via the creation of Four Common Spaces: a common economic space (with specific reference to environment and energy); a common space of Freedom, Security and Justice; a field of external security; as well as a space of research and education including culture. The next step will be to define shared priorities and concrete measures for each of the Four Common Spaces in a <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> Action <b>Plan...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Health {{and social}} care {{services}} are under strain providing {{care in the}} community particularly at hospital discharge. Patient and carer experiences can inform and shape services. Objective: To develop service user-led recommendations enabling smooth transition for people living with memory loss from acute hospital to community. Design: Lead and co-researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 pairs of carers and patients with memory loss at discharge, 6 and 12 weeks post-discharge and one semi-structured interview with health and social care professionals and Admiral Nurses. Framework analysis was guided by co-researchers. Two focus groups of study participants, facilitated by co-researchers, met to shape and finalize recommendations. Setting and participants: Recruitment took place in acute hospitals in two National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England. Patients were aged 65 and over, with memory loss, an in-patient for at least 1 week returning to the community, who had a carer consenting to be in the study. Results: Poor delivery of services caused considerable stress to some study families living with memory loss. Three key recommendations included a need for a written, <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> discharge <b>plan,</b> a named coordinator of services, and improved domiciliary care services. Discussion and conclusions: Vulnerable patients with memory loss find coming out of hospital after an extended period a stressful experience. The SHARED study contributes to understanding the hospital discharge process {{through the eyes of the}} patient and carer living with memory loss and has the potential to contribute to more efficient use of resources and to improving health outcomes in communities...|$|R
