500|$|Don't take it {{personally}} was chosen as a [...] "freeware game pick" [...] by IndieGames's Michael Rose, who {{said that it was}} worth playing through multiple times in order to see the different paths the story takes depending on the player's choices. The Daily Telegraph gave the visual novel the award for [...] "Best Script" [...] in its video game awards of 2011, stating that [...] "Love's layered narrative of a high school teacher embroiled in his student's worries goes places most mainstream video games wouldn't dare." [...] Pete Davidson of GamePro noted the game {{as an example of the}} [...] "creativity" [...] missing in many large-budget titles, and praised the story, calling Love [...] "a writer first and a game developer second." [...] Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as [...] "a game about love, sex and the internet" [...] that was [...] "capable of being profoundly moving" [...] and was about [...] "what it is to feel like someone's kicked <b>me</b> <b>straight</b> in the heart". He praised Love's ability to use dialogue to effect an emotional response, though he noted that the game seemed to lose some of its impact in the final chapters and felt that the use of the [...] "12chan" [...] threads as a Greek chorus was [...] "perhaps a meta-layer too far".|$|E
2500|$|Yang Fu, {{one of the}} {{officials}} who opposed Ma Chao in Liang Province, once visited his colleague and relative Jiang Xu and Jiang Xu's mother. He lamented about Ma Chao's murder of Wei Kang and forceful occupation of Liang Province: [...] " [...] Ma Chao betrayed his father, rebelled against the Emperor, and massacred the officers in our province. [...] Ma Chao is strong but iniquitous. He is morally weak and susceptible to temptation and trickery." [...] Yang Fu, Jiang Xu and several others later plotted against Ma Chao and drove him out of Liang Province. Ma Chao fought his way into Licheng (歷城) and captured Jiang Xu's mother. She scolded him, [...] "You're an unfilial son who betrays his own father and a treacherous villain who murders his superior. Heaven and Earth will not forgive you. You should die immediately. How dare you look at <b>me</b> <b>straight</b> in the eye!" [...] Ma Chao was furious and he killed her.|$|E
2500|$|Staind's vocalist Aaron Lewis {{rejected}} the nu metal label, saying, [...] "if we get called a 'nu metal' band one more time, I don't {{even know what}} I'm going to do!" [...] Chino Moreno, vocalist of Deftones, {{rejected the}} nu metal label saying [...] "We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't {{going to be with}} them". As Deftones abandoned the nu metal sound of their early work, Moreno tried to distance himself from nu metal bands and began to criticize the bands and their albums, including Korn's 2002 album Untouchables; he said, [...] "As Korn go on, it's the same things—bad childhoods and mean moms. It gets too old after a while. How old is Jonathan ? Thirty? How long has it been since he lived with his parents?" [...] Davis responded saying, [...] "Obviously, Chino hasn't listened to the words on the rest of my albums because they're nothing about my parents or my childhood." [...] Moreno also said, [...] "A big problem for me was opening for Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, two bands that wouldn't exist if it weren't for <b>me,</b> <b>straight</b> up!". Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park spoke about the nu metal label in an interview with NME, saying [...] "We never held the flag for nu-metal—it was associated with frat rock. Arrogant, misogynistic, and full of testosterone; we were reacting against that." [...] Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit said that he [...] "never liked or condoned" [...] the term [...] "nu metal" [...] in any way, and said he does not understand [...] "how so many bands that sound nothing alike can be put into" [...] the nu metal genre. Mike Wengren of Disturbed said that he doesn't think Disturbed [...] "were ever a nu-metal band to begin with".|$|E
