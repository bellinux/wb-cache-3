50|$|It's {{important}} {{for parents to}} regulate their child's behavior and environment {{in order to prevent}} any future affective disorders. Medication is often prescribed to these children however, it will not teach a child to create more valuable relationships at home or in the community, other forms of intervention should be applied. The increase of psychiatric medication of children may be a result of the noticeable declining support for caregiving, leading to psychopathology in which drugs are the first go to method. Families do not have the time or knowledge regarding other <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> such as child therapy and effective parenting strategies to meet their child's specific needs.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} the present study was to explore methods of {{effective}} treatment interventions for victims of Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking (DMST) from the viewpoint of practitioners. Although risk factors are present the secretive nature of the DMST population make victims difficult to identify. The sensitivity of the trauma victims experience also make it difficult to determine effective interventions to utilize for treatment of this population. This study seeks to gain the perspectives of practitioners who work with the DMST population in order to overcome these barriers. This study utilizes a qualitative design in which 10 practitioners were interviewed to determine effective <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention.</b> In doing so risk factors for identification, psychological impact of victimization and various interventions were highlighted to determine the most frequently used and most effective <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention.</b> Findings of the study indicate sexual abuse, homelessness, vulnerability, physical abuse and neglect as risk factors directly related to victimization. Findings of the study also indicate CBT, trauma focused and interpersonal psychotherapy as effective <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention.</b> The implementation of training programs specifically tailored to the DMST population is a necessary solution to bring awareness to DMST, assist in the identification of risk factors to prevent victimization and identify effective interventions for victims...|$|E

This concept was opposed to Raymond Boudon's failed attempt to establish a strict rational choice approach in French sociology.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> for {{domestic}} minor sex trafficking (DMST). Due to the secretive nature of the DMST industry, victims are not only difficult to identify, but are also difficult to gain access to in order to provide effective intervention. This study seeks to overcome these barriers by gaining the perspectives of DMST survivors. This study has a qualitative design, in which 8 survivors of DMST, who are now adults, were interviewed to determine appropriate <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> for child welfare social workers. In doing so, intervention was broken down into three categories; prevention, intervention, and recovery. The findings of this study indicated the need for an interagency approach to victim identification. Furthermore, the findings of this study highlighted the need for services that incorporated spirituality and a network of support; such as mentorship, life coaching, and support groups...|$|E

40|$|Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) {{has been}} the general term used within {{occupational}} therapy to define motor coordination difficulties in children since 1994. The presentation of the disorder seems complex as co-morbid conditions such as praxis may also be present which as added to the confusion. It has therefore been difficult for occupational therapists to identify a holistic and effective <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> for children suffering from DCD. The author of this paper conducted a literature review to explore the complexities of DCD in-depth. It is evident that confusion surrounding the disorder still exists and the identification of children with motor coordination difficulties suffers as a result. Within paediatric occupational therapy, it was highlighted that top-down approaches are increasingly being considered thus {{a review of the}} literature surrounding such an approach called the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) was conducted. The limited literature showed that this is potentially an effective <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> for children with DCD however, it is unknown if it is used often within occupational therapy practice as bottom-up approaches seemed to be used more traditionally. Therefore, the proposed research aims to uncover occupational therapists’ perceptions of the CO-OP approach by advertising the study on the College of Occupational Therapists website to recruit 10 participants. Telephone interviews will be conducted and audiotaped and the data will be transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis and the N-VIVO coding software in order to generate valid results...|$|R
