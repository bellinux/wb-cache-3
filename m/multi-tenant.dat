25|$|The GAO {{report also}} {{identified}} major security risks to FBI {{personnel in the}} D.C. metropolitan area because of the Hoover building's limitations. The Hoover building is surrounded on all sides by busy city streets which {{are just a few}} feet from the structure. Additionally, because the Hoover Building is too small to accommodate the FBI's post-9/11 activities, the agency has leased space in 21 locations throughout the metro area, nine of which are in <b>multi-tenant</b> buildings. The FBI admitted its internal security forces are not stationed at these leased spaces, but merely patrol them periodically.|$|E
25|$|Agere built a $165 million World Headquarters {{building}} in Hanover Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. This building {{was started in}} 2001 and completed in 2003. It brought together research and development facilities from Breinigsville and Muhlenberg Township. It absorbed about 2,000 workers from these two facilities. Agere Systems tried unsuccessfully to sell its Union Boulevard plant in Allentown, where the first commercial production line for transistors {{was set up in}} 1951. Agere Systems demolished the manufacturing part of the Union Boulevard facility. The company continues to use the offices and wet labs in the remaining part of the building. Its headquarters building is nearby in Hanover Township, Pennsylvania. In 2003, Agere Systems sold the chip plant and research center in Breinigsville to TriQuint Semiconductor, which also bought the company's fiber-optic components division. The facility, now under different ownership, is a <b>multi-tenant</b> technology park.|$|E

40|$|As a key service {{model in}} cloud computing, SaaS {{applications}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular. Multi-tenancy is a key characteristics of SaaS applications. Business processes {{play a key role}} in SaaS applications because of the composability and reusability of software services. This paper focuses on <b>multi-tenants</b> instance-intensive workflows system, in which workflows have a large number of instances belonging to multiple tenants in a SaaS environment, and further proposes a scheduling algorithm for <b>multi-tenants</b> workflow instances. This algorithm improves the quality of service (QoS) for tenants and saves the execution cost of workflows. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm guarantees the workflow execution conforming to the deadline set by tenants, and reduces the mean execution time for tenants in high priority whilst saves the execution cost for service providers...|$|R

40|$|The methodologies {{to develop}} <b>multi-tenanted</b> {{architectures}} {{have been investigated}} in the recent literature due to the popularity of cloud computing. A number of challenges need to be overcome if multitenanted architectures are to be effective and efficient. Among the challenges is the management of performance properties while effectively sharing the limited resources between the tenants. This work presents an approach to design such a management system for a <b>multi-tenanted</b> business process server. This approach not only enables performance to be maintained at different levels for different tenants depending on their priorities, but also autonomously detects the overloads of aggressive tenants and dynamically changes the control objectives to safeguard the business operations of other tenants. The novelty of the proposed approach {{is the use of}} the nonlinear feedback control. The experiment results indicate that the proposed nonlinear control approach achieves the objectives much better compared to the existing fixed and linear control techniques...|$|R

50|$|Hypervisors provide secure {{isolation}} between tenants {{but there}} {{can still be}} a 'noisy neighbour effect'. If a physical server is <b>multi-tenanted,</b> peaks of load from one tenant may consume enough machine resources to temporarily affect other tenants. As the tenants are otherwise isolated, it is also hard to manage or load balance this. Bare-metal servers, and single tenancy, can avoid this. As, once again, server costs are dropping {{as a proportion of}} total cost of ownership against their administration overhead, the classic solution of 'throwing hardware at the problem' becomes viable again.|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{airborne}} sound transmission in a <b>multi-tenanted</b> building has shown that elements of the building which are nominally identical {{do not have the}} same acoustic performance. It was seen that some of this variation in performance could be attributed to visually-observable differences in the constructions. Some of the variation could not be explained however, and it was concluded that this variation was due to workmanship. The level of this variation was seen to be approximately 1 dB for a light steel framed construction. This variation is considerably less than that measured previously for a monolithic construction...|$|R
