5|$|Extensive sociological, sexological {{and medical}} debate {{have focused on}} the clitoris, {{primarily}} concerning anatomical accuracy, orgasmic factors and their physiological explanation for the G-spot, and whether the clitoris is vestigial, an adaptation, or serves a reproductive function. Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding genital modification such as clitoris enlargement, clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy. Genital modification <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> aesthetic, medical or cultural reasons.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|UB-43 sank no ships {{over the}} next eight weeks. Author Paul Halpern reports that the {{majority}} of the German U-boats in the Mediterranean fleet were undergoing repairs and refits at Pola and Cattaro during January. Although no specific mention is made of repairs done on UB-43, the U-boat's inactivity in this period <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> that reason.|$|E
60|$|Answ. Fear, as I have showed you, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> taken several ways. 1. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> taken <b>for</b> {{the fear}} of devils. 2. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> taken <b>for</b> {{the fear of}} reprobates. 3. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> taken <b>for</b> the fear that is wrought in the godly by the Spirit as a spirit of bondage; or, 4. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> taken <b>for</b> the fear that I have been but now discoursing of.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{research}} suggests that the perception of pitch depends on both the places and patterns of neuron firings. Place theory <b>may</b> <b>be</b> dominant <b>for</b> higher frequencies. However, it is also suggested that place theory <b>may</b> <b>be</b> dominant <b>for</b> low, resolved frequency harmonics,and that temporal theory <b>may</b> <b>be</b> dominant <b>for</b> high, unresolved frequency harmonics.|$|R

5|$|I {{leave it}} with this House with every confidence. I am equal to either fortune. I can see past the {{decision}} of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, {{and it is no}} vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will admit that I am no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> <b>for</b> the good of this Dominion of Canada.|$|E

50|$|Notations and {{conventions}} for the velocity addition vary from author to author. Different symbols <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>for</b> the operation, {{or for the}} velocities involved, and the operands <b>may</b> <b>be</b> switched <b>for</b> the same expression, or the symbols <b>may</b> <b>be</b> switched <b>for</b> the same velocity. A completely separate symbol <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> used <b>for</b> the transformed velocity, rather than the prime used here. Since the velocity addition is non-commutative, one cannot switch the operands or symbols without changing the result.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of tools {{available}} for multiple sequence alignment. All of which possess their own strengths and weaknesses and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> specialized <b>for</b> distinct sequence types (DNA, RNA or protein). As such, a splice-aware aligner <b>may</b> <b>be</b> ideal <b>for</b> aligning RNA sequences, whereas an aligner that considers protein structure or residue substitution rates <b>may</b> <b>be</b> preferable <b>for</b> translated RNA sequence data.|$|R

One form of increasing the permeability of the barrier comprises forming micropores which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>for</b> administration of active agents across the barrier, or <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>for</b> sampling or collecting fluids, or <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>for</b> detecting, measuring or determining analytes, or <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>for</b> monitoring of physiological or other conditions.

25|$|The {{menopause}} transition typically begins between 40 and 50 {{years of}} age (average 47.5). The duration of perimenopause <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> up to eight years.

Nanocellulose has been reported to improve the mechanical properties of, for example, thermosetting resins, starch-based matrixes, soy protein, rubber latex, poly(lactide). The composite applications <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> use as coatings and films, paints, foams, packaging.|$|E

25|$|An {{object is}} an entity that is {{represented}} by information in a database. User queries are matched against the database information. Depending on the application the data objects <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> <b>for</b> example, text documents, images, audio, mind maps or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.|$|E

25|$|Inpatient drug detox and/or {{rehabilitation}} facilities <b>may</b> <b>be</b> inappropriate <b>for</b> {{those who}} have become tolerant or dependent while taking the drug as prescribed, as opposed to recreational use. Such inpatient referrals <b>may</b> <b>be</b> traumatic <b>for</b> non-abusers.|$|R
50|$|Probability {{measures}} {{are also used}} in mathematical biology. For instance, in comparative sequence analysis a probability measure <b>may</b> <b>be</b> defined <b>for</b> {{the likelihood that a}} variant <b>may</b> <b>be</b> permissible <b>for</b> an amino acid in a sequence.|$|R
25|$|Evidence-based {{practice}} is {{an approach that}} tries to specify {{the way in which}} professionals or other decision-makers should make decisions by identifying such evidence that there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> a practice and rating it according to how scientifically sound it may be. Its goal is to eliminate unsound or excessively risky practices in favor of those that have better outcomes.|$|E

While the reference price <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> West Texas Intermediate delivered at Cushing, the actual oil being traded may be a discounted Canadian heavy oil—Western Canadian Select— delivered at Hardisty, Alberta, and for a Brent Blend delivered at Shetland, {{it may be a}} discounted Russian Export Blend delivered at the port of Primorsk.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{reserves}} {{denote the}} amount of crude oil that can be technically recovered at a cost that is financially feasible at the present price of oil. Hence reserves will change with the price, unlike oil resources, which include all oil that can be technically recovered at any price. Reserves <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> a well, for a reservoir, for a field, for a nation, or for the world. Different classifications of reserves are related to their degree of certainty.|$|E

Hanuabada village {{is located on the}} outer suburbs of Port Moresby, here cricket is played everyday from small children to their national stars, every afternoon the streets are flooded with boys playing cricket, this was also where the Liklik Kricket Competition was started in PNG. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> these reasons {{more than half of the}} PNG national cricket team is from Hanuabada village.|$|E
25|$|One to one {{threading}} {{allows you}} to upload both a sequence you wish modelled AND the template on which to model it. Users sometimes have a protein sequence that they wish to model on a specific template of their choice. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> example a newly solved structure {{that is not in}} the Phyre2 database or because of some additional biological information that indicates the chosen template would produce a more accurate model than the one(s) automatically chosen by Phyre2.|$|E
25|$|It must {{be remembered}} that the DTM is only a model and cannot {{necessarily}} predict the future. It does however give an indication of what the future birth and death rates <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> an underdeveloped country, together with the total population size. Most particularly, of course, the DTM makes no comment on change in population due to migration. It is not applicable for high levels of development, {{as it has been}} shown that after a HDI of 0.9 the fertility increases again.|$|E
