5000|$|Malathion is of low toxicity; however, {{absorption}} or ingestion {{into the}} human body readily results in its metabolism to <b>malaoxon,</b> which is substantially more toxic. [...] In studies {{of the effects of}} long-term exposure to oral ingestion of <b>malaoxon</b> in rats, <b>malaoxon</b> {{has been shown to be}} 61 times more toxic than malathion. [...] It is cleared from the body quickly, in three to five days. [...] According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency there is currently no reliable information on adverse health effects of chronic exposure to malathion. Acute exposure to extremely high levels of malathion will cause body-wide symptoms whose intensity will be dependent on the severity of exposure. Symptoms include skin and eye irritation, cramps, nausea, diarrhea, excessive sweating, seizures and even death. Most symptoms tend to resolve within several weeks. Malathion present in untreated water is converted to <b>malaoxon</b> during the chlorination phase of water treatment, so malathion should not be used in waters that may be used as a source for drinking water, or any upstream waters.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bruchid beetles, Callosobruchus species, {{are serious}} pests of {{economically}} important grain legumes; their activity in stores is often controlled {{by use of}} synthetic insecticides. Esterases {{are known to be}} involved in insecticide resistance in insects. However, there is dearth of information on esterase activity in the genus Callosobruchus. In this study we investigated the effect of species, geographical strain and food type on the variation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and its inhibition by <b>malaoxon</b> (malathion metabolite) using an in vitro spectrophotometric method. RESULT: AChE activity varied significantly among species and strains and also among legume type used for rearing them. Generally irrespective of species, strain or food type, the higher the AChE activity of a population, the higher its inhibition by <b>malaoxon.</b> C. chinensis had the highest AChE activity of the species studied and in the presence of <b>malaoxon</b> it had the lowest remaining AChE activity, while C. rhodesianus retained the highest activity. CONCLUSION: A firsthand knowledge of AChE activity in regional Callosobruchus in line with the prevailing food types should be of utmost importance to grain legume breeders, researchers on plant materials for bruchid control and pesticide manufacturer/applicators for a robust integrated management of these bruchids. ...|$|E
40|$|SH-SY 5 Y {{neuroblastoma}} {{cells have}} been widely used in neuroscience research to model neurotoxic processes. It is unclear how well, in their undifferentiated, immortalised state, the cells model the original tissue type. SH-SY 5 Y cells can be differentiated, with compounds such as retinoic acid (RA), to become more ‘tissue-like’, and potentially better reflect the biochemistry of a mature neuronal cell. Studies that have investigated the RA-induced differentiation process have focused on upstream changes associated with a small number of genes or proteins. This study proposed to use a novel approach in untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomic analysis to investigate the downstream biochemical changes in the metabolome, which are closer to the phenotype associated with an RA-differentiated cell. Metabolomics was utilised to profile a wide range of biochemical changes in SH-SY 5 Y cells exposed to RA and how these processes were affected by exposure to <b>malaoxon,</b> a toxic metabolite of the pesticide malathion, to assess whether differentiated cells are more appropriate in future toxicology research. Cultured human SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells were exposed to 10 μM RA for 120 hours and 1 μM <b>malaoxon</b> for 24 hours. The samples were quenched, harvested, extracted and derivatised before metabolomic analysis was carried out using untargeted GC-MS. The metabolites that contributed most to the variance were identified using principal component analysis. This indicated that RA-differentiated cells, and undifferentiated and differentiated cells exposed to <b>malaoxon,</b> were grouped in relation to metabolite profile. The important metabolites were subsequently analysed to determine changes due to RA and <b>malaoxon</b> exposure, with the aim to produce a profile of RA-differentiation cells and of the differential toxicity between undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Changes were profiled in a range of metabolites including amino acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids and unknowns, indicating that exposure to RA caused a biochemical response in relation to neurite outgrowth, survival and apoptosis, decreased energy demand for cell proliferation and increased synthesis and activation of proteins involved in cell signalling. Data suggest that exposure to <b>malaoxon</b> induced a glutamate-mediated excitotoxic response causing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, energy depletion and damage to the cell membrane. In the differentiated state, induction of survival and apoptotic responses may have facilitated a neuroprotective response that decreased the toxic effects of <b>malaoxon.</b> This preliminary study has demonstrated that GC-MS-based metabolomic analysis can be used to detect changes in metabolite profile after RA and <b>malaoxon</b> exposure, illustrating the efficacy of this technique. The data indicates that there were a range of biochemical changes associated with an RA differentiated phenotype and that using such cells to study the effects of neurotoxins should be done with caution due to the potential neuroprotective response. The outcomes of this study have implications for research using RA-differentiated SH-SY 5 Y cells, with the decision to use differentiated cells resting on the particular neurotoxic model being investigated...|$|E

40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} ozonation of suspended malathion and chlorpyrifos {{particles are}} studied in real-time with a vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS). The pesticide particles with {{the diameter of}} hundreds of nanometers are generated by the homogeneous nucleation method using azelaic acid as nucleus. The reactions are carried out in an aerosol reaction chamber under ambient pressure (1 atm) and room temperature (298 K), respectively. The time-of-flight mass spectra of the solid-state ozonation products of malathion and chlorpyrifos are obtained. The assignments of the mass spectra reveal that the major ozonation products of malathion particles are s-(1, 2 -diethoxycarbonynl) ethyl-O,O-dimethylphosphorothioate (<b>malaoxon),</b> 2 -mercapto-succinic acid diethylester, 1, 2 -dicarbethoxyethyl-dimethoxyphosphinyldisulfide and bis(1, 2 -bis-ethoxycarbonylethyl) disulfide. The experimental results reveal that water vapor can enhance the formation of <b>malaoxon,</b> 2 -mercapto-succinic acid diethylester and bis(1, 2 -bis-ethoxycarbonyl-ethyl) disulfide. In the case of chlorpyrifos, the sole ozonation product observed is 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridyl-diethylphosphate (chlorpyrifos oxon). The pathways of heterogeneous ozonation of malathion and chlorpyrifos particles are proposed. The atmospheric lifetimes of malathion and chlorpyrifos particles towards ozone reaction are estimated based on the time-dependent mass spectrometric signals obtained. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Malathion was extensively activated by oxidative desulfuration to <b>malaoxon,</b> and hydrolyzed to various water soluble metabolic products. Hydrolysis appeared to be promoted by two distinct enzyme types: carboxylesterases and phosphbtriesterases. An {{attempt was made to}} study the oxidative desulfuration of malathion in vitro using preparations from crab hepatopancreas and, as a reference, rat liver. Appreciable malathion desulfurase activity was detected in the rat, but no conversion of malathion to <b>malaoxon</b> was observed in crab hepatopancreas. The condition and content of cytochrome P 450, a primary component in the desulfurase system, was examined by difference spectrometry. Substantial P 450 was detected in crab hepatopancreas, 0. 272 nM/mg microsomal protein. Anomalies in the absorption spectrum, however, indicated that the cytochrome may have partially existed as a nonfunctional derivative, cytochrome P 420. It was suggested that contamination of microsomes during preparation by bile salts naturally occurring in hepatopancreas may have been responsible for denaturation of the oxidative enzymes in vitro.

In contrast, resistance among Culex spp. has resulted from large-scale use of the organophosphorus insecticide group as larvicides for filariasis control and on rice paddy, where C. tritaeniorhynchus predominantly breeds, for agricultural purposes...|$|E
40|$|Organophosphorus {{pesticides}} (OPPs) emit {{into the}} atmosphere in both gas and particulate phases via spray drift from treatments and post-application emission, but most of their degradations in the atmosphere are not well known. In this study, the heterogeneous reactions of nitrate (NO 3) radicals with three typical OPPs (parathion, malathion, and fenthion) absorbed on azelaic acid particles are investigated using an online vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS). The reaction products observed with the VUV-ATOFMS are identified {{on the basis of}} GC/MS analysis of the products in the reaction between NO 3 radicals and the coating of the pesticide. Paraoxon is identified as the only product of parathion; <b>malaoxon</b> and bis(1, 2 -bis-ethoxycarbonylethyl) disulfide as the products of malathion; fenoxon, fenoxon sulfoxide, fenthion sulfoxide, fenoxon sulfone, and fenthion sulfone as the products of fenthion. The degradation rates of parathion, malathion, and fenthion under the experimental conditions are 5. 5 x 10 (- 3), 5. 6 x 10 (- 2), and 3. 3 x 10 (- 2) s(- 1), respectively. The pathways of the heterogeneous reactions between the three OPPs and NO 3 radicals are proposed. The experimental results reveal the possible transformations of these OPPs through the oxidation of NO 3 radicals in the atmosphere. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} effect of some water pollutant; malathion as an {{insecticide}} on histological and histochemical study in ophicoephalus punctatus. The exposure of fish to the examined pollutants induced a disappearance of some fractions and consequently changes of relative mobility and area that indicate damage. Ophicoephalus punctatus was exposed for 7 days to Malathion at a concentration of 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 µ 1 / 1 and 100 ppm under laboratory conditions. The fish showed severe histological changes in brain, liver, ovary and tissues. The degenerative changes included hypertrophy of cells and their nuclei, liver on the whole showed distance appearance. Pycnosis, Vaculation, Necrosis, fragmentation of ova were recorded in an increasing order towards the higher tested doses.

Degradation of a pesticide, malathion, in soil by Ba-cillus sp has been reported during current study. A simple and highly sensitive reverse phase HPLC-UV (High pressure liquid chromatography-Ultraviolet) method was used for determination of malathion de-gradation in soil. The bioremediation of was perform-ed in malathion contaminated sterile and nonsterile soil and {{it was found that}} 84. 81 % and 74. 11 % of mal-aoxon, respectively, from malathion concentration of 1. 5 % kg− 1 soil was degraded by strain PU after 7 days. Similarly, 63. 31 % and 57. 14 % of <b>malaoxon</b> in sterile and nonsterile soil respectively, from malathion concen-tration of 1. 5 % kg− 1 soil was degraded by strain KB 2 after 7 days. Bioremediation of malathion in soil using strain KB 1 have already discussed in the previous study (Singh et al., 2012). Regardless of soil sterilization, incorporation of bacterial strain in malathion con-taining soil resulted in higher level of degradation of malathion.

40|$|In October 1994, the California Department of Food and Agriculture began {{a series}} of aerial {{applications}} to eradicate an infestation of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) in Ventura County. Treatment consisted of 14 applications of a malathion-bait mixture applied over a 41 square kilometer (km 2) area encompassing the eastern part of Camarillo and the town of Somis. Applications were made at night, at 14 -to- 21 -day intervals from October 12, 1994, to May 23, 1995. The Environmental Hazards Assessment Program of the California Department of Pesticide Regulation monitored applications throughout the treatment program to measure the amount of malathion and <b>malaoxon</b> (a breakdown product of malathion) reaching the ground, and the concentration of these chemicals in air, surface water, and rain runoff. In addition, this information was compared with data from previous similar applications. Mass deposition of malathion averaged 8. 21 milligrams per square meter (mg/m ’) for the first two sprays, which is 80 % of the theoretical deposition rate of 10. 19 mg/m”. During the third spray, average mass deposition was 3. 23, which is 30 % of the theoretical rate.

40|$|Abstract: Photodegradation of coumaphos and azinphos–methyl in the air, in oxygen, and in {{nitrogen}} atmosphere (quartz reactor {{equipped with}} six 18 -W lamps with the maximum emis-sion intensity at 310 nm) was studied. The fastest reaction occurred with coumaphos in ni-trogen atmosphere (complete decomposition in 10 min), where {{the formation of}} a new com-pound was also detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the case of azinphos–methyl, no additional signals in HPLC chromatogram were observed. The re-arrangement mechanism, involving a triplet-state activation complex and {{the formation of a}}n acetylcholinesterase (AChE) -inhibiting oxo analog of coumaphos was verified and con-firmed by laser flash photolysis. The suitability of bioanalytical flow-injection analysis (FIA) systems, based on AChE inhibition and spectrophotometric or thermal lens spectrometric detection for rapid and sen-sitive screening in food quality control was demonstrated. Owing to the high sensitivity of thermal lens spectrometry (TLS), several steps in sample preparation can be avoided (pre-concentration, purification, isolation) and incubation times reduced. High sample through-puts (10 h– 1) are, however, also achievable for medium toxic oxo organophosphorus (OP) pesticides using spectrophotometric detection providing limits of detection (LODs) at the level of 10 ppb <b>malaoxon</b> equivalents, which is still about 50 times below maximal residue levels. Testing of the method for practical application on a set of 60 samples gave no false negative results and a level of 1. 7 % false positives...|$|E
40|$|Malathion {{is one of}} the organophosphorus {{insecticides}} least {{toxic to}} mammals. The toxicity of this compound in chick embryos is known; however, its teratogenic nature has not been recorded. Concentrations from 1. 17 to 116. 6 milligrams per egg were injected into the yolk sacs of 1 to 12 day incubated chicken eggs, and various types of abnormalities were produced. Injections of 3. 99 and 6. 42 milligrams malathion into the yolk sacs of 4 and 5 day incubated eggs produced deformed chicks with a combination of sparse plumage, micromelia, overall growth retardation and beak defects. All known breakdown and related products of malathion were investigated as to their teratogenicity; however, only the parent compound and <b>malaoxon</b> were capable of producing the aforementioned terata. Malathion causes a reduction in growth to, embryos from eggs injected on days 4 and 5 of incubation. Various metabolites were injected along with malathion into fertile eggs in an attempt to determine the possible effect of the latter compound on metabolism. Of the compounds injected, tryptophan prevented both the malformations and the growth retardation while nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and quinolinic acid prevented the malformations only. A tryptophan assay revealed a reduction of total tryptophan content in malathion treated embryos indicating a reduction in uptake of this amino acid from the yolk. Other compounds related to tryptophan by electronic reactivity enhanced the effect of malathion. Several NAB or NADp linked dehydrogenasas were investigated by histochemical and biochemical methods on both malathion treated and untreated embryos. A cholinesterase assay on embryo homogenates revealed no apparent relationship between cholinesterase levels and teratisms...|$|E
40|$|Bruchid beetles are {{economically}} important pests {{of grain}} legumes. Their medium to high level infestation is being controlled with insecticide. This {{study investigated the}} effects of environmental factors such as temperature, toxicant concentration, food and bruchid geographical strain on malathion tolerance in Callosobruchus species (c. maculatus, C. chinensis and C. rhodesianus). There were variations in insecticide tolerance among the species and C. maculatus {{which is the most}} widely spread and known showed the highest tolerance. Geographical origin had a pronounced impact on the response of C. maculatus to malathion. There was a positive relationship between temperature effect and bruchid susceptibility to malathion as often observed with organophosphate. The impact of food on insecticide tolerance in Callosobruchus was quite unpredictable. Overall, the interactive effects of all the factors are very complex. An alteration of anyone factor could either enhance or reduce tolerance. This could be driven by bruchid ancestry or fitness cost. Biochemical pathway study with <b>malaoxon</b> (malathion metabolite) ruled out acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as primarily responsible for malathion tolerance in bruchids; though it could be an additional factor to other tolerance mechanisms. However, there was variation in AChE activity among the species and strains with influence from the rearing food. Preliminary screening of the bruchids for the endosymbiont Wolbachia, prior to studies on its effect on insecticide tolerance was undertaken. The study revealed a high probable presence of this organism in C. maculatus and C. rhodesianus, which were previously thought to be non-host species. The implication of these findings in order to optimize bruchid management especially with insecticides to avoid/combat the development of insecticide resistance is discussed. This includes the impacts on legume breeding, production, transportation and storage. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Italy (evaluating Member State (EMS)), received an application {{from the company}} Cheminova to modify the existing MRLs for malathion in citrus and pome fruits, plum, strawberry and lettuce. In order to accommodate intended Southern European Union uses on lettuce, strawberries and citrus fruits and the authorized use on apples, pears and plums in the third countries, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for malathion in all crops under consideration, including other salad plants. According to EFSA, the submitted residue data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for citrus fruit, strawberries, apples, plums and lettuce. Residue data were not sufficient to derive a MRL proposal for pears. An extrapolation of residue data from lettuce to the whole group of salad plants is not supported by residue data. EFSA notes that for the MRL proposals on apples, plums, strawberries and lettuce additional data gaps were identified during the assessment. Based on the combined risk assessment, which was performed for malathion and its metabolites with similar toxicity (DMM desmethyl-malathion, MMCA malathion monocarboxylic acid and MDCA malathion dicarboxylic acid) and separately for <b>malaoxon</b> and {{taking into account the}} currently available information for the crops under consideration, the existing MRLs and the lack of detailed information on the actual approved uses of malathion, a potential long-term consumer health risk cannot be excluded. Setting a MRL on provisional basis might be acceptable by risk managers for citrus fruits, strawberries and lettuce, taking into account the low contribution of these crops to the overall long-term exposure and high level of uncertainties of the risk assessment which were compensated by using conservative assumptions leading to an overestimation of the calculated dietary exposure...|$|E
