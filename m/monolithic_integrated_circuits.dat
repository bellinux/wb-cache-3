25|$|On December 1, 1957, Jean Hoerni first {{proposed}} a planar technology of bipolar transistors. In this process, all the p-n junctions {{were covered by}} a protective layer, which should significantly improve reliability. However, in 1957, this proposal was considered technically impossible. The formation of the emitter of an n-p-n transistor required diffusion of phosphorus, {{and the work of}} Frosch suggested that SiO2 does not block such diffusion. In March 1959, Chi-Tang Sah, a former colleague of Hoerni, pointed Hoerni and Noyce to an error in the conclusions of Frosch. Frosch used too thin oxide layers, whereas the experiments of 1957–1958 showed that a thick layer of oxide can stop the phosphorus diffusion. Armed with this knowledge, by March 12, 1959 Hoerni made the first prototype of a planar transistor, and on May 1, 1959 filed a patent application for the invention of the planar process. In April 1960, Fairchild launched the planar transistor 2N1613, and by October 1960 completely abandoned the mesa transistor technology. By the mid-1960s, the planar process has become the main technology of producing transistors and <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTWe have {{explored}} the fabrication of an InP/InGaAs single {{heterojunction bipolar transistor}} (HBT) and a wave guide p-i-n photodiode (PD) on two kinds of double stacked layers {{for the implementation of}} an optoelectronic millimeter-wave <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (OEMMIC). We applied a photosensitive polyimide for passivation and integration to overcome the large difference between the HBT and PD layers of around 3 µm. Our experiment showed that the RF characteristics of the HBT were dependent on the location of the PD layer, while the dc performances of the HBTs and PDs were independent of the type of stacked layer used. The Ft and Fmax of the HBTs on the HBT/PD stacked layer were 10 % lower than those of the HBTs on the PD/HBT stacked layer.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{describe}} the design, simulation, and on-wafer measurements of Submillimeter-wave <b>Monolithic</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Circuit</b> (S-MMIC) amplifiers having gain in the 400 - 500 GHz range. A single-stage amplifier and two three-stage amplifiers with similar topology are presented, and have been fabricated in Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NGC) 35 -nm InP high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) process. The circuits were fabricated using different indium channel compositions on different wafers, and comparison of the results based on the indium content will be presented. We have performed on-wafer S-parameter calibration and measurements using newly developed WR 2. 2 waveguide wafer probes from 325 - 508 GHz. We measured approximately 5 dB of gain for the single stage amplifier at 437 GHz, and approximately 10 dB of gain at 474 GHz for a three-stage amplifier, with over 9 dB of gain at 490 GHz.
