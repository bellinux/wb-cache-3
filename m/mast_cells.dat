5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from <b>mast</b> <b>cells.</b> When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress {{the activity of the}} histamine.|$|E
5|$|Hypersensitivity is {{an immune}} {{response}} that damages the body's own tissues. They {{are divided into}} four classes (Type I– IV) based on the mechanisms involved and {{the time course of}} the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of <b>mast</b> <b>cells</b> and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.|$|E
5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), innate lymphoid cells, <b>mast</b> <b>cells,</b> eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
50|$|Tryptase is {{also known}} by <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> tryptase, <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> {{protease}} II, skin tryptase, lung tryptase, pituitary tryptase, <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> neutral proteinase, <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> serine proteinase II, <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> proteinase II, <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> serine proteinase tryptase, rat <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> protease II, and tryptase M.|$|R

50|$|<b>Mast</b> <b>cell</b> {{stabilizers}} are drugs {{which prevent}} <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> degranulation.|$|R
5|$|<b>Mast</b> <b>cells</b> {{reside in}} {{connective}} tissues and mucous membranes, and regulate the inflammatory response. They {{are most often}} associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators {{that are involved in}} defending against parasites and play a role in allergic reactions, such as asthma. Natural killer (NK cells) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells, or cells that have been infected by viruses.|$|E
5|$|The {{base of the}} Y {{plays a role in}} {{modulating}} immune cell activity. This {{region is}} called the Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region, and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody. Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of Fc receptors, and other immune molecules, such as complement proteins. By doing this, it mediates different physiological effects including recognition of opsonized particles (binding to FcγR), lysis of cells (binding to complement), and degranulation of <b>mast</b> <b>cells,</b> basophils, and eosinophils (binding to FcεR).|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known what}} {{specific}} agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated autologous serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When {{people who did not}} have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of <b>mast</b> <b>cells.</b> The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mast</b> <b>cell</b> {{activation}} syndrome (MCAS) is an idiopathic immune {{disorder that}} involves recurrent and excessive <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> degranulation and which produces symptoms {{that are similar}} to other <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> activation disorders. [...] The syndrome is diagnosed based upon four sets of criteria involving treatment response, symptoms, a differential diagnosis, and biomarkers of <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> degranulation.|$|R
50|$|Cytochemical {{properties}} of the leukemic cells must be typical of <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> derivation (presence of metachromatic granules staining with alpha-naphthyl chloroacetate esterase, but not with peroxidase). <b>Mast</b> <b>cell</b> tryptase is an enzyme contained in <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> granules. <b>Mast</b> <b>cell</b> numbers are best estimated by tryptase immunostaining because very poorly granulated cells may stain very weakly if at all for alpha-naphthol chloroacetate esterase.|$|R

The literature of small intestinal <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> disease is reviewed and the relationship to coeliac disease is discussed...|$|R
5|$|The {{cause is}} not entirely clear, but {{is thought to be}} multifactorial. It has even been {{suggested}} that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes. Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism, but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and not sexually transmissible. The mucosal destruction is thought {{to be the result of}} a T cell (T lymphocyte) mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). <b>Mast</b> <b>cells</b> and macrophages are also involved, secreting TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied, the histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate, 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of heat shock protein 65–60, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.|$|E
5|$|Those {{cells that}} {{recognize}} coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, {{as the name}} suggests, interact with the Fc region of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will phagocytose, <b>mast</b> <b>cells</b> and neutrophils will degranulate, natural killer cells will release cytokines and cytotoxic molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies initiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) – this process may explain the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies used in biological therapies against cancer. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mast</b> <b>cells</b> are {{a type of}} innate immune {{cell that}} reside in {{connective}} tissue and in the mucous membranes. They are intimately associated with wound healing and defense against pathogens, but are also often associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. When activated, <b>mast</b> <b>cells</b> rapidly release characteristic granules, rich in histamine and heparin, along with various hormonal mediators and chemokines, or chemotactic cytokines into the environment. Histamine dilates blood vessels, causing the characteristic signs of inflammation, and recruits neutrophils and macrophages.|$|E
30|$|According {{to these}} results, sesame oil {{decreased}} the MSU crystal-induced activation of nuclear NF-κB in <b>mast</b> <b>cell,</b> and <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> stabilizer ketotifen blockaded inflammatory cells infiltration in MSU crystal-treated rats. We suggest that inhibiting <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> degranulation accounts for sesame oil’s anti-inflammatory effect in MSU crystal-induced gouty inflammation. Further, {{in the present}} study, sesame oil inhibited IL- 4 release, <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> degranulation and accumulation in inflammatory site. Therefore, we suggest that inhibiting IL- 4 production in <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> is involved in sesame oil-associated anti-inflammatory effect against MSU crystal challenge.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> stabilizing potential of the ethanolic extract of Tephrosia purpurea (Linn.) {{in the management of}} asthma using experimental animal models. Ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Tephrosia purpurea (L.) (EETP) was prepared and <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> stabilizing potential evaluated against compound 48 / 80 and clonidine induced <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> degranulation in adult wistar albino rats. The result of present study revealed that, compound 48 / 80 and clonidine treatment produced 75. 83 % and 73. 67 % of <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> degranulation respectively. EETP at a concentration of 250, 500, and 750 μg/ml showed dose-dependent significant reduction in <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> degranulation (P < 0. 01) as compared to the compound 48 / 80 and clonidine-treated animals. However, its effect was less than the dexamethasone and disodium cromoglycate, potent <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> stabilizers. To conclude, the EETP possesses good <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> stabilizing properties and therefore can be a candidate for the antiasthmatic treatment. Future research should focus on the molecular mechanism of responsible constituent for <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> stabilizing potential...|$|R

25|$|In {{anaphylactic shock}} low blood {{pressure}} is related to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) triggered primarily by a massive release of histamine by <b>mast</b> <b>cells</b> activated by antigen-bound immunoglobulin E and also by increased production and release of prostaglandins.|$|E
25|$|Morphine induced {{pruritus}} syndrome {{may also}} be caused by release of histamine from <b>mast</b> <b>cells</b> in the skin (Gunion et al. (2004). Paus et al. (2006) report that opioid μ-receptors and opioid κ-receptors are located in skin nerves and keratinocytes.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Most {{patients}} with asthma and many {{patients with}} COPD show bronchial hyperresponsiveness to adenosine (BHRAMP). BHRAMP {{may be caused}} by release of <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> histamine, which induces smooth muscle contraction. Aim of the study: To evaluate whether <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> numbers in airway smooth muscle are increased in patients with asthma and COPD compared to their age-matched controls, and whether <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> numbers are correlated with BHRAMP. Patients: Twenty-two non-smoking subjects with asthma (age 31 yr, FEV 1 : 89 % pred, PC(20) AMP: 2. 7 mg/ml), 18 ex-smoking subjects with COPD (age 62 yr, FEV 1 : 58 % pred, PC(20) AMP: 52. 4 mg/ml). Methods: Snap-frozen bronchial biopsies were immunostained with anti-mast cell tryptase and anti-desmin antibodies. <b>Mast</b> <b>cell</b> number was expressed as the number of tryptase positive cells per area of smooth muscle. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> number between patients with asthma, COPD, and their respective age-matched healthy controls. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> number and FEV, or PC 20 AMP in any of the groups. Surprisingly, the <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> number was negatively correlated with reversibility to salbutamol in COPD patients (rho - 0. 47, P < 0. 05). Conclusion: <b>Mast</b> <b>cell</b> numbers in central airway smooth muscle apparently do not contribute importantly to bronchial hyperresponsiveness to adenosine. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|<b>Mast</b> <b>cell</b> {{tumors are}} one of the most common {{occurring}} cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors in the canine. Their appearance is extremely variable making fine needle aspiration imperative for pre-surgical diagnosis. Diff-Quick staining is usually sufficient to expose the cytoplasmic granules, however, occasionally Giemsa or Wrights stain is needed. The most widely accepted method of treatment is surgical excision with three centimeter lateral margins and one fascial plane deep. This may or may not be followed up by radiation depending on the grade and margin detemination (clean or dirty). <b>Mast</b> <b>cell</b> tumors are broken down into a histologic grade ranging from one to three. Most canine <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> tumors are histologically characterized as a grade II (40 %). The behavior of a grade II <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> tumor can range from benign (grade I) to highly metastatic (grade III). Due to the extreme inconsistency in biologic behavior of grade II <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> tumors it is imperative that a more superior prognostic indicator be found. According to one study, the c-kit receptor protein expression on the <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> is a useful method for fine tuning the prognosis of grade II <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. The case study of a ten year old female spayed golden retriever will illustrate one process of diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of grade II <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> tumors in a canine...|$|R
2500|$|Two {{types of}} <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> tumors have been {{identified}} in cats, a <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> type similar to dogs and a histiocytic type that appears as subcutaneous nodules and may resolve spontaneously.

25|$|If later {{exposure}} to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held {{on the surface of}} the <b>mast</b> <b>cells</b> or basophils. Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule, and activates the sensitized cell. Activated <b>mast</b> <b>cells</b> and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth muscle contraction. This results in rhinorrhea, itchiness, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, allergen, and mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems; asthma is localized to the respiratory system and eczema is localized to the dermis.|$|E
25|$|Only biopsy of {{suspicious}} lesions in {{the brain}} or elsewhere is considered useful for a definitive diagnosis of neurosarcoid.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We have {{previously}} shown that incubation of human endothelial <b>cells</b> with <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> granules results in potentiation of lipopolysaccharide-induced production of interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 8. AIMS: The {{objective of the}} present study was to identify candidate molecules and signal transduction pathways involved in the synergy between <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> granules and lipopolysaccharide on endothelial cell activation. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated with rat <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> granules in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide, and IL- 6 production was quantified. The status of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 activation, nuclear factor-kappaB translocation and intracellular calcium levels were determined to identify the mechanism of synergy between <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> granules and lipopolysaccaride. RESULTS: <b>Mast</b> <b>cell</b> granules induced low levels of interleukin- 6 production by endothelial cells, and this effect was markedly enhanced by lipopolysaccharide. The results revealed that both serine proteases and histamine present in <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> granules were involved in this activation process. <b>Mast</b> <b>cell</b> granules increased intracellular calcium, and activated c-Jun amino-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2. The combination of lipopolysaccharide and <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> granules prolonged c-Jun amino-terminal kinase activity beyond the duration of induction by either stimulant alone and was entirely due to active proteases. However, both proteases and histamine contributed to calcium mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 activation. The nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB proteins was of greater magnitude in endothelial cells treated with the combination of <b>mast</b> <b>cell</b> granules and lipopolysaccharide. CONCLUSIONS:Mast cell granule serine proteases and histamine can amplify lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial cell activation, which involves calcium mobilization, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and nuclear factor-kappaB translocation...|$|R
