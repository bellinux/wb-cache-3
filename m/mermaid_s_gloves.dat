40|$|An {{analysis}} of the pitcher 2 ̆ 7 s intent in baseball should ideally depend upon information given by the catcher before the pitch is thrown. Expert judgment has already identified {{the importance of this}} factor (e. g. the pitcher is 2 ̆ 2 missing his spots 2 ̆ 2 when unsuccessful in hitting the target). We describe the underpinnings of a automated video analysis system that uses semi-supervised learning methods to identify the catcher position - specifically, the catcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>glove</b> position. The analysis begins with video of a single pitch, supervised by a human controller; this information is then incorporated into one of a selection of learning algorithms and applied to subsequent pitches with minimal involvement from the controller. This is designed to be the first step in creating a public database of pitch intent, to be coupled with existing sources of pitch physics, so that analysts may better evaluate pitcher performance...|$|R

(It is said [...] that Lamba was asked to wear a helmet, but {{he thought it was}} {{unnecessary}} as only three balls of the over were remaining when he was asked to move to that position. He was known [...] not to use a helmet while fielding close in.) Lamba was playing for Dhaka's leading club, Abahani Krira Chakra, in the final of the Premier Division cricket match versus Mohammedan Sporting Club at the Dhaka Bangabandhu Stadium on 20 February 1998. The shot was so ferocious that the ball deflected from his head and flew into wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud' <b>s</b> <b>gloves.</b> He was not wearing a helmet. Mohammad Aminul Islam, the former Bangladesh captain, recalled [...] "I was the new man in and asked Raman if he was okay.

40|$|Possessing dexterity and sensory perceptions, {{the human}} hand is a {{versatile}} tool that can grasp, hold, and manipulate objects using various postures and forces {{interacting with the}} environment. Many industrial tasks are replacing human hands with anthropomorphic robotic hands. In skillful tasks such as micro surgical operations, a master-slave interface system of robotic hands is required to emulate a human hand 2 ̆ 7 s dexterity by using glove controllers with force sensors for telemanipulation. Although these interface techniques are widely applied for large scale robots, little has been accomplished for micro-scale robots due to the constraints and complexity imposed by miniaturization. To provide sensible haptic control and feedback from robots at the micro-level, this work investigates the intricacies {{associated with the use}} of micro-scale robotic actuators with the intention of using them with haptic feedback systems. This work also develops a system model to test the ability of computing elements that emulate a microrobotic hand 2 ̆ 7 s tactile perception of stiffness. An interface glove was used to collect control data from the user, which was used alongside a Matlab model to simulate the operation and control of two different microhand designs. In order to control the microhand device accurately, feedback from simulated sensors was used to affect the airflow of the pneumatic system driving the displacement of the microhand. Four major components were developed for the overall system. The glove interface gives the operator a method to interact with the system. The microhand modeling took place in two components. The first component was the model of the microhand itself. The other component needed was a pneumatic subsystem to drive the microhand operation. The final major component developed was a graphical user interface to give the operator feedback as to what is happening in the target environment. The integration of all of these components allows for experimentation of the intricacies of operating with these microhand devices. The investigation of this micro-haptic system shows that some parameters make the system perform faster and more accurately than others. Metrics such as percent error and settling time of the displacement of one micro-finger are shown to measure success of each method. Future improvements for this system could include the integration of pneumatically controlled balloon micro-actuators with the operator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>glove</b> interface or implementing more accurate contact mechanics into the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to give some {{attention}} to the characteristics and performative styles of Australian colonial puppetry during the first fifty years of European settlement. Both formal and informal modes of puppetry will be examined - from self-assembled 'toy theatres' in around the 1830 s, to grand exhibitions of mechanical automata in the 1840 <b>s,</b> and roadside <b>glove</b> puppet shows and marionette theatre beginning in the 1850 s. In particular, the examination argues that it is possible to track key developments in nineteenth-century colonial puppetry to twin factors: shifts in attitudes to entertainment motivated by mechanisation and commercialisation; and the rising popularity of ventriloquism, magicians and minstrel shows in the early Victorian era...|$|R

40|$|In their {{constructions of}} gender, both Mary Cholmondeley and Jerome K. Jerome locate {{women at the}} heart of the city, and both use the emblem of {{feminine}} hands to explore their presence there as culturally threatening. In ‘Geoffrey’s Wife’ (1885) Cholmondeley uses this image repeatedly, as the delicate hands of the bride Eva on her husband’s arm are replaced by the hands of a surging crowd during their honeymoon in Paris. In the disturbing ending to the story, Geoffrey learns that the hands around his neck belong to an ageing prostitute he has rescued in place of his wife, and he is left with nothing but a small tan glove for consolation. Jerome’s ‘The Fawn Gloves’ (first known publication 1916) references his own experience of the city in the 1880 <b>s.</b> The <b>gloved</b> hands of an unnamed woman in a park are used to invoke images of Eden, as the impoverished male figure casts her in the role of muse and idyllic lover. When he learns that the woman’s hands have suffered damage from a chemical reaction, he abandons her, only to learn too late that the condition is easily remediable. The woman has by this time stopped visiting the park, and having been reluctant to learn her address or the nature of her work, the man has no other means of tracing her. In Cholmondeley’s account the male figure is unable to protect his wife from the reverse image of the prostitute, while Jerome is exercised by what he sees as the anomaly of female employment. In his account the female muse is expelled from her rightful position by the dictates of ‘unnatural’ work. In each story the fetishist depiction of hands reveals the instability of sexual ideals: a husband misidentifies a prostitute’s hands as those of his wife, while the display of a virginal woman’s imperfect hands signifies her social failure. While traditional ideals of the feminine are initially upheld through recognisable types of the pure woman, these figures are not adapted to survive the hostile setting in which they are placed. This dilemma is carefully explored through the exploitation, and ultimately the consumption, of women’s bodies in the anonymous crowd of the city...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Current space suits {{have limited}} {{movement}} due to gas pressurization during {{exposure to the}} vacuum of space. Alternatively, if pressure is applied by an elastic garment vs. pneumatic garment to produce mechanical counter pressure (MCP), several advantages are possible. In this study, we investigate local microcirculatory and other effects produced with and without a prototype MCP glove and sleeve during exposure to varying levels of vacuum. METHODS: The entire arms of eight male volunteers were studied at normal ambient pressure and during 5 min exposures to - 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg with and without the MCP glove and sleeve. Pressure distribution, skin microvascular flow, and temperature were measured. RESULTS: The MCP glove and sleeve generated over 200 mm Hg on the middle finger, dorsum of the hand, and the wrist. However, pressure was significantly lower on the forearm and the upper arm. Without the glove and sleeve, only two of eight subjects tolerated - 100 mm Hg. Also, no subject tolerated - 150 mm Hg. However, subjects tolerated all vacuum pressures wearing the glove and sleeve. Skin microvascular flow and temperature remained within control values with the glove and sleeve at a chamber pressure of - 150 mm Hg. DISCUSSION: The MCP glove and sleeve counteracts adverse effects of vacuum exposures due to lower pressure differentials. Pressure levels over the hand and wrist {{are similar to those}} of the current U. <b>S.</b> space suit <b>glove</b> and sleeve, but additional development is required to increase MCP over the forearm and upper arm...|$|R
40|$|The {{gloved hand}} {{is one of}} an {{astronaut}} s primary means of interacting with the environment, and any restrictions imposed by the glove can strongly affect performance during extravehicular activity (EVA). Glove restrictions {{have been the subject}} of study for decades, yet previous studies have generally been unsuccessful in quantifying glove mobility and tactility. Past studies have tended to focus on the dexterity, strength, and functional performance of the gloved hand; this provides only a circumspect analysis of the impact of each type of restriction on the <b>glove</b> <b>s</b> overall capability. The aim of this study was to develop novel capabilities to provide metrics for mobility and tactility that can be used to assess the performance of a glove in a way that could enable designers and engineers to improve their current designs. A series of evaluations were performed to compare unpressurized and pressurized (4. 3 psi) gloved conditions with the ungloved condition. A second series of evaluations were performed with the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (TMG) removed. This series of tests provided interesting insight into how much of an effect the TMG has on gloved mobility - in some cases, the presence of the TMG restricted glove mobility as much as pressurization did. Previous hypotheses had assumed that the TMG would have a much lower impact on mobility, but these results suggest that an improvement in the design of the TMG could have a significant impact on glove performance. Tactility testing illustrated the effect of glove pressurization, provided insight into the design of hardware that interfaces with the glove, and highlighted areas of concern. The metrics developed in this study served to benchmark the Phase VI EVA glove and to develop requirements for the next-generation glove for the Constellation program...|$|R
40|$|The {{gloved hand}} is an {{astronaut}} s {{primary means of}} interacting with the environment, so performance on an EVA is strongly impacted by any restrictions imposed by the glove. As a result, these restrictions {{have been the subject}} of study for decades. However, previous studies have generally been unsuccessful in quantifying glove mobility and tactility. Instead, studies have tended to focus on the dexterity, strength and functional performance of the gloved hand. Therefore, it has been difficult to judge the impact of each type of restriction on the <b>glove</b> <b>s</b> overall capability. The lack of basic information on glove mobility in particular, is related to the difficulty in instrumenting a gloved hand to allow an accurate evaluation. However, the current study aims at developing novel technological capabilities to provide metrics for mobility and tactility that can be used to assess the performance of a glove in a way that could enable designers and engineers to improve upon their current designs. A series of evaluations were performed in ungloved, unpressurized and pressurized (4. 3 psi) conditions, to allow a comparison across pressures and to the baseline barehanded condition. In addition, a subset of the testing was also performed with the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (TMG) removed. This test case in particular provided some interesting insight into how much of an impact the TMG has on gloved mobility [...] in some cases, as much as pressurization of the glove. Previous rule-of-thumb estimates had assumed that the TMG would have a much lower impact on mobility, while these results suggest that an improvement in the TMG could actually have a significant impact on glove performance.

40|$|In some fictional, historical, and autobiographical {{accounts}} {{of the lives of}} married women on the prairies of North America during the brief period between initial exploration and permanent settlement, there appears a rather widespread and complicated motif. In it the woman lives on an empty prairie, usually far from the edge of town; physically isolated with her husband, she is psychologically alone, too, and friendless, especially in terms of female companionship. Often her family is far away; always her husband is insensitive and unsympathetic, and, in general terms, unworthy of her devotion. Sometimes even before she is able to voice or demonstrate her needs for friends, family, love, and beauty, the woman must pass a cruel love-test; she has to silence all that she has learned about the failure of her life, love, and lover on the prairie. Elizabeth Mitchell, a journalist interested in contemporary reforms, emigration, and the Garden Cities movement, describes the period in question as 2 ̆ 2 the time of hard fighting and unceasing struggle, 2 ̆ 2 when one could see 2 ̆ 2 settlers come in, but settlers go out again, sick of the country. 2 ̆ 2 She records this experience in her book In Western Canada before the War, which also contains proud and sympathetic {{accounts of}} successful marriages on the prairie, similar to those in the work of Willa Cather, Nellie McClung, and others. Mitchell 2 ̆ 7 s account of unhappy marriages {{on both sides of the}} international border closely resembles fictional accounts in Wolf Willow by Wallace Stegner, 2 ̆ 2 The Painted Door, 2 ̆ 2 by Sinclair Ross, and 2 ̆ 2 Snow, 2 ̆ 2 by the German-born, naturalistic writer, Frederick Philip Grove. In his autobiography, A Son of the Middle Border, Hamlin Garland presents at least two generations of women caught in the same type of unsatisfying marriage. Not every woman on the prairies during this period fits the motif. But the theme of the unappreciated, devoted, and silenced prairie wife exists in Canadian and American fiction and nonfiction, created by writers of both sexes. By coincidence or intention, this motif follows the most popular of the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen, 2 ̆ 2 The Little Mermaid. 2 ̆ 2 ANTECEDENTS OF ANDERSEN 2 ̆ 7 <b>S</b> <b>MERMAID</b> 2 ̆ 2 The Little Mermaid 2 ̆ 2 (first published in Danish in 1835) was well known in Europe and America in the second half of the nineteenth century. It was available in translations, authorized and not, the latter much to Andersen 2 ̆ 7 s chagrin. Andersen, who wrote several fanciful autobiographical stories, including one called 2 ̆ 2 the fairy tale of my life, 2 ̆ 2 maintained that the mermaid story was his creation. Nevertheless, he admitted to knowing the popular Danish song 2 ̆ 2 Agnete and The Mermen, 2 ̆ 2 and Andersen 2 ̆ 7 s other tales demonstrate that he knew European folk literature and mythology, where ancestors of the little mermaid can readily be identified. Examples of female water-deities in Mediterranean, North European, and English mythology and literature include sirens, naiads, Rhinemaidens, Lorelei, and the Arthurian 2 ̆ 2 Lady of the Lake. 2 ̆ 2 Hesiod records Aphrodite of the Waves, born from the blood-flecked seafoam following the castration by Cronus of the elemental god Uranus; this motif informs Botticelli 2 ̆ 7 s painting of a Christianized Venus rising from rose-decked waves. The goddess of birth and love bestows magical gifts of secret knowledge, wealth, or power. Other water-deities, such as the sirens in The Odyssey, offer seduction, confusion, enslavement, or death instead. Andersen adopts the bloody feet and the seafoam of Aphrodite and the singing of the sirens for his tale. His mermaid is silenced, as were the sirens when Odysseus closed the ears of his men to them, and this recalls another source, the myth of the rape of Philomela...|$|R
