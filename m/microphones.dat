5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, <b>microphones</b> are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two <b>microphones</b> placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E

The initial plan was to use the stand-held <b>microphones</b> used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held <b>microphones,</b> which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the eveningone for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.|$|E

25|$|Many {{hearing aids}} now have both an {{omnidirectional}} and a directional <b>microphone</b> mode. This {{is because the}} wearer may not need or desire the noise-reducing properties of the directional <b>microphone</b> in a given situation. Typically, the omnidirectional <b>microphone</b> mode is used in quiet listening situations (e.g. living room) whereas the directional <b>microphone</b> is used in noisy listening situations (e.g. restaurant). The <b>microphone</b> mode is typically selected manually by the wearer. Some hearing aids automatically switch the <b>microphone</b> mode.|$|R

He then employed Pro Tools for mixing and other production tasks.|$|E

5000|$|Phantom {{power can}} be {{supplied}} to a condenser <b>microphone</b> using center tap transformers.

5000|$|In {{a signal}} flow {{beginning}} with an acoustic sound source (such as {{a musical instrument}} or singer), the <b>Microphone</b> preamplifier is typically the first electronically adjustable gain stage, where the signal is amplified {{by as much as}} 95 dB in exceptional cases [...] Before reaching the <b>microphone,</b> the sound source is subject to the Inverse-square law, which states that sound intensity diminishes as distance between the sound source and the <b>microphone</b> increases. This means that (1) moving the <b>microphone</b> closer to the sound source increases the signal level produced by the <b>microphone,</b> and (2) moving the <b>microphone</b> farther away from undesirable noise sources will diminish the amount of noise in the <b>microphone</b> signal. <b>Microphone</b> placement is therefore an important aspect of gain staging [...]|$|R

40|$|Application of <b>microphone</b> arrays and {{beamforming}} {{techniques for}} speech information collection has significant advantages compared to systems operating {{with a single}} <b>microphone.</b> This paper presents {{a brief overview of}} <b>microphone</b> array systems for collecting distant speech information. The paper is based on an analysis of publications on the use of <b>microphone</b> arrays for speech information collection tasks, {{as well as on the}} author’s experience in the development and practical application of planar <b>microphone</b> arrays. The paper describes the main stages of the development of systems for remote capture of audio information. It provides a review of the main applications of <b>microphone</b> arrays, the basic types of <b>microphone</b> arrays and their features. The bulk of the paper deals with planar <b>microphone</b> arrays. We analyze the work of <b>microphone</b> arrays in different acoustic environments. The paper contains the basic equations for calculating the parameters of equidistant planar <b>microphone</b> arrays. Some methods of designing non-equidistant arrays are also mentioned (a list of references is included). We also provide a list of basic digital signal processing algorithms for planar <b>microphone</b> arrays, as well as a list of references on processing algorithms in the frequency domain. The paper includes a list of foreign companies offering systems based on <b>microphone</b> arrays for a wide range of tasks associated with the processing of speech and audio signals. We describe some state-of-the-art speech information collection systems based on <b>microphone</b> arrays. Some promising directions for the development of speech information collection systems using <b>microphone</b> arrays are described in conclusion. The material of the review is usable in designing of <b>microphone</b> arrays for specific practical applications...|$|R
5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two <b>microphones</b> to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone jack {{was moved to the}} bottom of the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Filming for Live Free or Die Hard {{started in}} {{downtown}} Baltimore, Maryland on September 23, 2006.

When recording the sound for the semi trailer used {{in one of the}} film's final scenes, 18 <b>microphones</b> were used to record the engine, tires, and damage to the vehicle. Post-production for the film only took 16 weeks, when it was more common for similar films to use 26 weeks.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} thesis {{deals with}} a tube <b>microphone</b> using a condenser <b>microphone</b> capsule for sound capturing. Moreover, two essential aspects of a tube <b>microphone</b> – {{the basis of its}} operation and its design – are also discussed in this thesis.

This paper also includes the choice of the most suitable <b>microphone</b> circuit, its modification and the design of a voltage source used for feeding and heating the vacuum tube. Some appropriate simulations were applied to find out the functionality of all designed parts of the <b>microphone</b> system. Following step was the practical realization of all <b>microphone</b> parts as well as the activation and the complete parameters and characteristics measurements of realized <b>microphone</b> system. After the provided measurements, the <b>microphone</b> was compared to equivalent commercial products. Evidently, the realized <b>microphone</b> is qualitatively similar to other commercial products.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Dugan {{developed}} a gain limiting improvement to the automixing algorithm. The Dugan Gain Limiting System was patented in September 1989 and {{presented to the}} 87th AES convention in October. Dugan described for the AES his prototype of an automixer to be inserted into selected microphone channels of a mixing console, operated by a person, to help in mixing multiple live <b>microphones</b> to have less reverberation and noise, more focus on the desired sound, eliminating the mixing engineer's problem of too-slow human reaction time. The gain limiting system provided smooth, continuous control over the equivalent number of open <b>microphones</b> (NOM) that the automixer would send at its outputs. The NOM could be set anywhere between 1 and 10, with higher settings sounding more natural for a recording in a studio, and lower settings offering greater control of acoustic feedback {{in the presence of}} sound reinforcement loudspeakers. An embodiment of Dugan's three patents was produced as the Model D Automatic Mixing Controller, a 3U rack unit handling 8 channels which could be linked with up to 11 other Model Ds to automatically mix as many as 96 channels simultaneously.|$|E
