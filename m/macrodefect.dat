40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The present study deals with the physical characterization of <b>macrodefect</b> free cements produced by ICI. These materials are made through a specialized mixing technique which incorporates an organic polymer into the cement/water system. The high mechanical strength and low porosity of this class of hardened cement paste had been well documented, however, a detailed characterization of the physical nature of the microstructure had not previously been attempted. Two classes of <b>macrodefect</b> free material were studied, based on Ordinary Portland cement and High Alumina cement, respectively. The porosities of these two materials were determined in their original state and after various forms of heat treatment and conditioning. Samples based on Ordinary Portland cement had a well defined narrow pore size distribution, even after heat treatment, while the High Alumina cement samples displayed a very low total pore volume in their original state, but subsequent heat treatment led to the developement of porosity {{over a wide range}} of pore sizes. These fundamental differences in the pore size distributions had significant effects on the homogeneity and reproducibility of the microstructures of the samples. The porosity generated by heat treatment was found to be unstable in the presence of water. In general, reductions in the porosities and permeabilities were observed. This was due to the formation of fresh cement hydrate gel within the pore structure, which caused a shift in the pore size distributions towards smaller pores. British Gas; IC...|$|E
40|$|High-integrity {{castings}} require sophisticated {{design and}} manufacturing procedures {{to ensure they}} are essentially <b>macrodefect</b> free. Unfortunately, an important class of such defects—macroporosity, misruns, and pipe shrinkage—are all functions of the interactions of free surface flow, heat transfer, and solidication in complex geometries. Because these defects arise as an interaction of the preceding continuum phenomena, genuinely predictive models of these defects must represent these interactions explicitly. This work describes an attempt to model the formation of macrodefects explicitly {{as a function of}} the interacting continuum phenomena in arbitrarily complex three-dimensional geometries. The computational approach exploits a compatible set of finite volume procedures extended to unstructured meshes. The implementation of the model is described together with its testing and a measure of validation. The model demonstrates the potential to predict reliably shrinkage macroporosity, misruns, and pipe shrinkage directly as a result of interactions among free-surface fluid flow, heat transfer, and solidification...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Different {{sublimation}} {{growth conditions}} of 3 C-SiC approaching a bulk process {{have been investigated}} with the focus on appearance of <b>macrodefects.</b> The growth rate of 3 C-SiC crystals grown on 6 H-SiC varied from 380 to 460 µm/h with {{the thickness of the}} crystals from 190 to 230 µm, respectively. The formation of <b>macrodefects</b> with void character was revealed at the early stage of 3 C-SiC crystal growth. The highest concentration of <b>macrodefects</b> appears {{in the vicinity of the}} domain in samples grown under high temperature gradient and fastest temperature ramp up. The formation of <b>macrodefects</b> was related to carbon deficiency which appear due to high Si/C ratio which is used to enable formation of the 3 C-SiC polytype...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{microscopy}} {{and image}} processing {{were used to}} investigate morphological changes in CBr 4 single crystals during growth from the vapor at various levels of supersaturation and at temperatures below the compound's polymorphic phase transition. It was found that, as the temperature increased at fixed supersaturations, {{the corners of the}} crystals became rounded as a result of thermal roughening; the rounding temperatures were different for crystallographically different corners. A study of CBr 4 crystals with large-angle grain boundaries or twin boundaries (extended <b>macrodefects),</b> conducted at the temperature of polymorphic phase transition showed that the phase transition temperature, T(tr) and crystal surface morphology of these crystals depended on {{the presence or absence of}} extended <b>macrodefects.</b> Unlike the case of a perfect single crystal, where the T(tr) was about 46. 75 C, the phase transition in crystals with extended <b>macrodefects</b> occurred significantly below 46. 75...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{investigation}} of the influence of powerful ultrasonic action during compaction on porosity and pore size distribution in ZnO ceramics. Ceramic samples were obtained with a porosity of ~ 1 %. It was established that ultrasonic action, without significantly changing the integral value of the porosity of sintered samples, leads to decrease in the relative content of large pores (<b>macrodefects)</b> ...|$|R
30|$|Ribbon N 1 was {{thicker than}} the other samples and was set to {{experience}} the lowest current density. After the pulse, it retained its shape and did not show any visible cracks or <b>macrodefects.</b> On the other hand, samples N 2, N 3, and N 4 became very brittle after electrical pulsing and contained a lot of cracks. The most severe effect was observed in sample N 4. When even higher current densities were applied (not shown), the samples exploded, did not keep their wholeness and transformed into small pieces and powder particles.|$|R

Using nuclear {{microanalysis}} (NRA) and {{electron probe}} microanalysis (EPMA), concentrations of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, aluminum, and vanadium were {{measured on a}} large group of <b>macrodefects</b> formed in the course of smelting titanium alloys. A remarkable enrichment of the defect material in oxygen and nitrogen atoms was detected; histograms of defect distribution over the concentrations of oxygen, nitrogen, aluminum, and vanadium were obtained. The above results agree with the concepts according to which the defects are formed from the particles that have the melting temperature higher then the temperature of smelting...|$|R

The optical properties of the implanted samples and their dependence on ion dose were studied by means of optical absorption spectroscopy and Scanning Near-field Optical Microscopy (SNOM).

40|$|A review. Sintered {{corundum}} components with submicrometer grain sizes exhibit properties which enable numerous new applications. Wet powder processing {{is developed}} to associate minimum grain sizes at highest densities {{with the lowest}} population of <b>macrodefects.</b> A closest ratio of powder particle size and sintered grain size is important for obtaining most fine-grained microstructures. This target was approached best by using powders with particle sizes {{in the range of}} 100 - 200 nm rather than with smaller nanoparticles. New components are presented from the fields of ceramic milling media, tool ceramics for cutting and grinding, bioceramics, transparent windows and armor applications...|$|R

The research described includes a statistical formulation for individual fiber breakage and fragmentation and clustered fiber breakage, termed <b>macrodefects</b> wherein the aligned composite may represent a structural component such as a reinforcing bar element, a rebar. Experimental work conducted {{in support of the}} future exploitation of aligned composite rebar elements is also described.

40|$|The pitt ing probabil ity of 2 S {{aluminum}} {{was determined}} in Kingston tap {{water as a}} function of area, for areas ranging in size from 0. 06 cm 2 to 243 cmt The pitt ing prob-ability was found to vary uniformly with area, from 0. 001 to 1 as the area increased from 0. 06 cm 2 to 60 cm~; extrapolation i dicated that the pitt ing probabil ity becomes zero at an exposed area of about 0. 055 cm ~. This work supports the contention that pitt ing sites in aluminum are not specific <b>macrodefects</b> in the metal surface, but rather arise in a random fashion through the interaction of myriads of anodic and cathodic elements on the metal surface...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a new simple method for {{avoiding}} particle-induced macroscopic defects using the liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) of GaN as an example. In a series of growth experiments by LPE of GaN it is demonstrated {{that the number of}} particle-induced <b>macrodefects</b> in the epitaxial layers correlates strongly and reproducibly with the density of the solution. In solutions with a density higher than that of the deleterious particles, the particles float on the solution and hence are hindered to get into contact with the seed, which is placed {{at the bottom of the}} crucible. Consequently, so-called depressions - a typical particle-induced defect in GaN-LPE layers - are avoided. The principle of avoiding the formation of macroscopic defects originating from particles by adapting the density of the solution (density criterion) should be generally applicable to solution growth processes, regardless of the material system...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{combined}} thermodynamic and diffusion kinetic approach in predicting the product morphology developed during solid-state displacement reactions is exemplified by the interactions in the GaSb/Co and SiC/Me (where Me=Cr,Pt,Co) systems. The influence of mechanical stresses induced during the interaction on the formation of microstructures is demonstrated. It was shown that the manifestation of the effects accompanying reactive-phase formation in inorganic solids (like the Kirkendall effect and the net volume change during internal precipitation) causes the generation and relaxation of the stresses. This significantly contributes to the morphological evolution of the reaction zone. Different micro- and <b>macrodefects</b> (vacancies, dislocations, pores, cracks, etc.) that can be generated inside the diffusion zone can also affect (or even control) {{the course of the}} reaction and determine the topological arrangement of the product phases within the resulting microstructure...|$|R
40|$|Barrier {{performance}} of continuous coatings {{is determined by}} the defect population in the barrier layer. In this paper we consider two classes of defects: those in which the permeant does not interact with the barrier material, ‘macrodefects’, and those in which there is an interaction between the permeant and the barrier material, ‘nanodefects’, thus leading to a greater activation energy for permeation than that of permeation through the underlying polymer. If a barrier is improved by reducing the density of <b>macrodefects</b> then typically the transmission rate will decrease, and eventually the activation energy will increase as the proportion of permeation that takes place through the nanodefect population becomes significant. Recent studies, however, have highlighted examples in which a greater activation energy is associated with a greater permeation. This is explored in terms of a simple double-Arrhenius model, which highlights the significant contribution from nanodefect permeation even in cases in which the overall barrier performance is not that high...|$|R
40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of this work}} is to form a methodical, scientific-based approach {{and the application of}} this experience in solving problems of quality control and improvement, as well as to identify ways of eliminating defects and small lifetime of the materials, used in critical parts and units of mining equipment. The aim of scientific research of the article is the study of discrepancy of structural steels quality problem, used for the manufacture of parts and components of mining equipment, established by standards. The goals are also, development and practical application of quality control methods in delivery condition and at all main stages of parts manufacture in accordance with the current state standards. As a result of steel quality complex control in delivery condition, it was possible to identify: the deviation of the chemical composition of steels and alloys, <b>macrodefects,</b> microdefects, deviation in hardness. Practical recommendations to eliminate and reduce and prevent the defects in parts and units used in mining engineering were developed. The paper presents practical experience in evaluation the quality of construction materials, which may be useful in design, manufacture and operation of mining industry and related manufacture industries...|$|R
40|$|Using {{rheological}} {{parameters of}} ceramic suspensions, {{it is possible}} to taylor the structure of the ceramic foams produced by replica. This method consists in the impregnation of a polymeric flexible template (polyurethane foam) with a ceramic suspension (slurry) containing the appropriate additives, followed by burning out organic compounds and additives and sintering the ceramic structure. In this work, ceramic foams were produced by the replica method from Al 2 O 3 and 3 % Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2. Rheological parameters of the ceramic suspensions were investigated to improve the mechanical performance of final structures. Different types and quantities of raw materials were combined in order to select the formulations for ceramic foams. The parameters that have a significant influence on the process are the binder type and the amount of solids. Significant changes on the hysteresis area of the suspensions resulted in a lower density of <b>macrodefects</b> in the material. Likewise, when the shear rate viscosity is enhanced, the thickness of the struts increased proportionally. Lastly, when the hysteresis area magnitude and the ceramic thickness increased, the material with higher uniformity was internally densified, and the stress concentration of the internal defects was smoothe...|$|R
40|$|Pera-Titus, Marc Fite, Carles Sebastian, Victor Lorente, Esther Llorens, Joan Cunill, FidelA {{modified}} version of the adsorption-diffusion model derived form the Maxwell-Stefan theory developed in a previous study (Pera-Titus, et al. Catal. Today 2006, 118, 73) is presented in this paper to describe the dehydration behavior of zeolite NaA membranes for pervaporation of ethanol/water mixtures. Compared to the former version, two additional contributions are included in the model: (1) the adsorbed solution theory of Myers and Prausnitz is used instead of the extended Langmuir isotherm to account for binary adsorption equilibria of water and ethanol on zeolite A, and (2) the explicit role of pressure-driven mechanisms in large intercrystalline defects (<b>macrodefects)</b> to permeation is considered. These refinements in the Maxwell-Stefan equations provide a superior description of solvent dehydration using zeolite NaA membranes. The fitted surface diffusivities at 323 K and at zero loading of water and ethanol for weak confinement show values in the order of 10 (- 12) and 10 (- 13) m(2). s(- 1), respectively. The former values are 3 - 4 orders of magnitude higher than those that have been measured from water adsorption kinetics experiments. This difference might be ascribed to a certain role of nanosized grain boundaries between adjacent zeolite A crystals. Grain boundaries might behave as fast diffusion paths or nanoscopic shortcuts due to anisotropy of zeolite layers, resulting in higher apparent water surface diffusivities and lower apparent activation energies for surface diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Water {{permeation}} in inorganic moisture permeation barriers occurs through macroscale defects/pinholes and nanopores, {{the latter}} with size approaching the water kinetic diameter (0. 27 nm). Both permeation paths {{can be identified}} by the calcium test, i. e., a time-consuming and expensive optical method for determining the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) through barrier layers. Recently, we have shown that ellipsometric porosimetry (i. e., a combination of spectroscopic ellipsometry and isothermal adsorption studies) is a valid method to classify and quantify the nanoporosity and correlate it with the WVTR values. Nevertheless, no information is obtained about the macroscale defects or the kinetics of water permeation through the barrier, both essential in assessing {{the quality of the}} barrier layer. In this study, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is shown as a sensitive and versatile method to obtain information on nanoporosity and macroscale defects, water permeation, and diffusivity of moisture barrier layers, complementing the barrier property characterization obtained by means of EP and calcium test. EIS is performed on thin SiO 2 barrier layers deposited by plasma enhanced-CVD. It allows the determination of the relative water uptake in the SiO 2 layers, found to be in agreement with the nanoporosity content inferred by EP. Furthermore, the kinetics of water permeation is followed by EIS, and the diffusivity (D) is determined and found to be in accordance with literature values. Moreover, differently from EP, EIS data are shown {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of local <b>macrodefects,</b> correlated with the barrier failure during the calcium test...|$|R
