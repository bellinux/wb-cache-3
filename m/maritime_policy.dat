5|$|Issues {{specific}} to his South Coast and Cape Cod–based district, such as <b>maritime</b> <b>policy,</b> {{have been a}} major target of Keating's work. In June 2012, he organized the Federal Fishing Advisory Board, a body to research and address fisheries management concerns between lawmakers and industry stakeholders. In 2012 he and his Massachusetts peers successfully pushed the Commerce Department to issue a federal disaster declaration for fisheries in the northeastern U.S., which would open up the opportunity for financial aid. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, he proposed to redirect $111 million of relief funding to fisheries throughout the country, although the proposal was not adopted by the House Rules Committee.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 1423, the Doge Tommaso Mocenigo died at a {{critical}} juncture: the next Doge {{would have to make}} decisions affecting the course of the Republic, particularly regarding the continued expansion in the Terraferma or a reaffirmation of the traditional <b>maritime</b> <b>policy.</b> A successful commander, well educated and a capable orator, Loredan had all the prerequisites necessary for the position, but {{in the end it was}} his old rival, Francesco Foscari, who was elected. The two men were fierce rivals, their political differences reinforced by personal relationships. Thus two of Loredan's daughters, Maria and Marina, were married to Francesco Barbaro and Ermolao Donà respectively, both of them opponents of Foscari. Furthermore, when Foscari proposed a marriage between his own daughter and one of Loredan's sons, it was rejected.|$|E
25|$|While {{military}} action suppressed the pirates, {{a change in}} Ming <b>maritime</b> <b>policy</b> allowing overseas trade was instrumental in keeping them from rising again. As early as 1530, the maritime prohibitions had in fact been lifted in the southern coastal province of Guangdong, where non-tribute trade were taxed. Provincial authorities had hoped that by opening trade, the economically marginalized of Guangdong would have legitimate livelihoods and would not need to descend into piracy. Indeed, Guangdong was spared from {{the brunt of the}} pirate raids during the peak years of wokou activity, and those who had invaded Guangdong were put down with relative ease. In 1554, the provincial authorities entered into an historic agreement with the Portuguese — who came back to Guangdong after their misfortunes at Zhejiang and Fujian — where the Portuguese would be allowed to settle in Macau and trade in Guangzhou for an annual fee. The Portuguese would thence help the Ming destroy pirate fleets in the area, for which they were eventually rewarded with the imperial acknowledgement of their occupation of Macau by the Wanli Emperor (r. 1563-1620). This occupation lasted all the way until 1999, when Macau was handed over to the People's Republic of China.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the {{decision-making}} process of China's <b>maritime</b> security <b>policy.</b> In particular, it addresses {{the question of what}} factors have led to the inconsistent nature of China's <b>maritime</b> security <b>policy,</b> a phenomenon as yet little examined. In contrast to existing studies regarding China's maritime power which have implied that there is a clear driver dominating China's <b>maritime</b> security <b>policy,</b> this thesis highlights inter-agency competition in the policy process. It argues that due to the fragmentation of its decision-making authority, China does not have a clear driving force dominating the making of its <b>maritime</b> security <b>policy.</b> Instead, its policy is influenced and shaped by various loosely coordinated actors in the policy process and is a product of extensive bureaucratic bargaining. Consequently, even though Beijing has an overarching policy guideline to build the country into a maritime power (haiyang qiangguo), relevant decisions on specific maritime security issues are made disjointedly and slowly, which contributes to the inconsistent nature of its <b>maritime</b> security <b>policy.</b> The theoretical foundation of this thesis is the Fragmented Authoritarianism (FA) model {{which is one of the}} most important analytical frameworks for the study of Chinese politics and decision-making process. Four case studies inform the empirical analysis: Beijing's policy on the East China Sea dispute, its policy on the South China Sea dispute, the Chinese aircraft carrier program and China's counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. They help explain the roles played by policy actors in the decision-making process of China's <b>maritime</b> security <b>policy</b> when the country confronts various security challenges. This thesis provides a comprehensive analysis to explain the inconsistent nature of China's <b>maritime</b> security <b>policy</b> and, on a broader level, offers new thoughts for the future study in relation to China's foreign and security policy. In addition, it extends the FA framework by dividing policy actors into two groups, primary and marginal, according to the weight of their influences on policy outcomes...|$|R
