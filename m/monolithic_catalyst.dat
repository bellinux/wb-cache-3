50|$|<b>Monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> {{supports}} are extruded substrates {{that are}} widely used in automotive and stationary emission control devices and other kind of reactors in the chemical industry. In automotive applications ceramic monoliths are made of synthetic cordierite, 2MgO*2Al2O3*5SiO2 which has a low thermal expansion coefficient. A <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> support consists of many parallel channels separated by thin walls that are coated with the catalytic active substance, most commonly a metal like platinum. The channels may be round or polygonal (mainly square or hexagonal). The structure is reminiscent of a honeycomb. The cell density may be from 30 to 200/cm2 with the separating walls from 0.05 to 0.3 mm. Because of a high open frontal area (the open spaces in the cross-sectional area) of 72 to 87% pressure loss of gases flowing through the structure is low, an important feature to minimize efficiency losses in vehicles.|$|E

First of all, a straightforward synthetic strategy was discovered to fabricate manganese oxide nanoarrays on two-dimensional substrates (e. g. Si wafers and conductive FTO glass). Then, the generic one-pot hydrothermal synthesis route has been successfully utilized to in-situ grow uniform manganese oxide nanoarrays onto the cordierite honeycomb monolithic substrates, forming a series of nanoarray-based <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalysts</b> with different morphology, surface area, and reactivity of carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation., denoted as HM-DCM, HM-PCR, and HM-PSF, respectively. Next, copper manganese oxide (CuMn 2 O 4) was combined with the manganese oxide nanoarray-based <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalysts</b> to enhance reactivity. Nanosheet layers of CuMn 2 O 4 were uniformly coated onto the manganese oxide nanoarrays (HM-PCR). Compared to traditional <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalysts</b> with alumina support, the benefit of nanoarray morphology was demonstrated by correlating the variation of surface area with the reactivity. The incorporation of cobalt ions promoted the higher surface area and C 3 H 8 conversion as well. Last but not least, a continuous flow synthesis system was attempted to scale-up the size of manganese oxide nanoarray-based <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalysts.</b> Overall, the straightforward synthetic processes of nanoarrays and transition metal oxide coatings show a scalable, low-cost, and template-free method to fabricate <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalysts</b> for exhaust treatment...|$|R

40|$|To {{support the}} {{development}} of Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS) in the space program, a metabolic simulator has been selected {{for use in a}} closed chamber to test functions of the CELSS. This metabolic simulator is a catalytic reactor which oxidizes the methyl acetate to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor. In this project, kinetic studies of catalytic oxidation of methyl acetate were conducted using monolithic and pellet catalysts with 0. 5 % (by weight) platinum (Pt) on aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3). The reaction was studied at a pressure of one atmosphere and at temperatures varying from 160 C to 420 C. By-products were identified at the exit of the preheater and reactor. For the kinetic study with the <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst,</b> a linear regression method was used to correlate the kinetic data with zero-order, first-order and Langmuir-Hinshelwood models. Results indicate that the first-order model represents the data adequately at low concentrations of methyl acetate. For higher concentrations of methyl acetate, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model best represents the kinetic data. Both rate constant and adsorption equilibrium constants were estimated from the regression. A Taguchi orthogonal array (L(sub 9)) was used to investigate the effects of temperature, flow rate, and concentration on the catalytic oxidation of methyl acetate. For the <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst,</b> temperature exerts the most significant effect, followed by concentration of methyl acetate. For the pellet catalyst, reaction temperature is the most significant factor, followed by gas flow rate and methyl acetate concentration. Concentrations of either carbon dioxide or oxygen were seen to have insignificant effect on the methyl acetate conversion process. Experimental results indicate that the preheater with glass beads can accomplish thermal cracking and catalytic reaction of methyl acetate to produce acetic acid, methanol, methyl formate, and 1 -propanol. The concentration of all by-products was measured in ppmv (parts per million by volume). At higher temperatures, greater amounts of these products are produced, as expected. In all cases, methanol was the predominant concentration detected, followed by methyl formate. At temperatures lower than 320 C for the P-type <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst,</b> methanol, acetic acid, and acetone were detected, whereas, for the E-type <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst,</b> only methanol was detected at 160 C. Both P and E types of the <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> were specified with the same substrates (ceramic), washcoat (Al 2 O 3), and promoter (Pt). However, the manufacturing and treatment procedures were quite different. It was therefore concluded that the performance of the E-type <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> is superior to that of the P-type for oxidation of methyl acetate. At higher reaction temperatures, e. g., above 420 C, all reactants and byproducts were completely oxidized using these two types of <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor. A complex heterogenous catalytic reaction mechanism was proposed to explain the formation of the byproducts (methanol, acetic acid, and methyl formate) as the methyl acetate traveled through the preheater packed with glass beads. The by-product, 1 -propanol, may be formed only through a homogeneous reaction, since it is difficult to develop a reasonable sequence of heterogeneous reaction steps to explain its formation. The homogeneous thermal decomposition of methyl acetate to form free radicals was proposed to explain the formation of 1 -propanol, and also methanol, in the preheater. A dual-site catalytic reaction mechanism was proposed for the oxidation of methyl acetate over Pt/Al 2 O 3 <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst.</b> The dual-site mechanism describes the chemisorption of oxygen molecules as well as a physical adsorption of methyl acetate on the active sites. On the active sites, methyl acetate is oxidized rapidly to form carbon dioxide and water vapor. A rate equation derived from this mechanism gives the Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate formula which has been observed from the experimental data obtained in this project for high methyl acetate concentration (greater than 1000 ppmv) over a <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst.</b> If the oxygen concentration is very high and methyl acetate concentration is very low, the reaction rate equation is then reduced to a first-order with respect to methyl acetate concentration. The first-order model has also been observed from the experimental data obtained in this project for low methyl acetate concentration (less than 1000 ppmv) ...|$|E

30|$|In practice, high {{dispersion}} of Ni active sites can be realised through innovative synthesis methodology. For example, Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts synthesised by sol–gel method own smaller particle sizes than the catalysts synthesised through conventional impregnation methodology, while the synthesis necessitates expensive and moisture-sensitive organic precursors [8]. Reverse-emulsion synthesis offers large surface areas and smaller particle sizes of the resultant catalysts, {{though it is}} costly and complicated to fabricate catalyst in the large scale [9]. The combustion-synthesis has been well explored for preparing Ni-based nanocatalysts, however, the great concerns on safety and environment are raised [10]. Ni-based aerogel catalysts prepared by supercritical drying (SCD) of the catalysts precursor hydrogel represent a simple and cost-effective technique to synthesise the finite Ni-based catalysts with high surface area and excellent performance in dry reforming [11]. However, the aerosol itself could not fully overcome the issue of deactivation due to coking in the fixed bed reformer [12].

40|$|Removal of {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H{sub 2 }S) from coal gasifier gas and sulfur recovery are key {{steps in the}} development of Department of Energy's (DOE's) advanced power plants that produce electric power and clean transportation fuels with coal and natural gas. These plants will require highly clean coal gas with H{sub 2 }S below 1 ppmv and negligible amounts of trace contaminants such as hydrogen chloride, ammonia, alkali, heavy metals, and particulate. The conventional method of sulfur removal and recovery employing amine, Claus, and tail-gas treatment is very expensive. A second generation approach developed under DOE's sponsorship employs hot-gas desulfurization (HGD) using regenerable metal oxide sorbents followed by Direct Sulfur Recovery Process (DSRP). However, this process sequence does not remove trace contaminants and is targeted primarily towards the development of advanced integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants that produce electricity (not both electricity and transportation fuels). There is an immediate as well as long-term need for the development of cleanup processes that produce highly clean coal gas for next generation power plants. To this end, a novel process is now under development at several research organizations in which the H{sub 2 } in coal gas is directly oxidized to elemental sulfur over a selective catalyst. Such a process is ideally suited for coal gas from commercial gasifiers with a quench system to remove essentially all the trace contaminants except H{sub 2 }S In the Single-Step Sulfur Recovery Process (SSRP), the direct oxidation of H{sub 2 }S to elemental sulfur in the presence of SO{sub 2 } is ideally suited for coal gas from commercial gasifiers with a quench system to remove essentially all the trace contaminants except H{sub 2 }S. This direct oxidation process has the potential to produce a super clean coal gas more economically than both conventional amine-based processes and HGD/DSRP. The H{sub 2 } and CO components of syngas appear to behave as inert with respect to sulfur formed at the SSRP conditions. One problem in the SSRP process that needs to be eliminated or minimized is COS formation that may occur due to reaction of CO with sulfur formed from the Claus reaction. The objectives of this research are to formulate monolithic catalysts for removal of H{sub 2 }S from coal gases and minimum formation of COS with <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> supports, {gamma}-alumina wash or carbon coats, and catalytic metals, to develop a catalytic regeneration method for a deactivated <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst,</b> to measure kinetics of both direct oxidation of H{sub 2 }S to elemental sulfur with SO{sub 2 } as an oxidizer and formation of COS {{in the presence of a}} simulated coal gas mixture containing H{sub 2 }, CO, CO{sub 2 }, and moisture, using a <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> reactor, and to develop kinetic rate equations and model the direct oxidation process to assist in the design of large-scale plants. This heterogeneous catalytic reaction has gaseous reactants such as H{sub 2 }S and SO{sub 2 }. However, this heterogeneous catalytic reaction has heterogeneous products such as liquid elemental sulfur and steam. To achieve the above-mentioned objectives using a <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> reactor, experiments on conversion {{of hydrogen}} sulfide into elemental sulfur and formation of COS were carried out for the space time range of 40 - 560 seconds at 120 - 150 C to evaluate effects of reaction temperatures, total pressure, space time, and catalyst regeneration on conversion of hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur and formation of COS.

40|$|In this work, an Al 2 O 3 -coated SiC foam {{monolith}} {{was used}} as the support of a Ni-based catalyst, which was applied for coupling partial oxidation and steaming reforming of methane to produce syngas or hydrogen. This <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> showed excellent structural stability in a 900 h endurance test. Its catalytic activity and stability were also excellent during the first 500 h of the endurance test with a CH 4 conversion (similar to 96 %) near thermodynamic equilibrium. Subsequently, it deactivated gradually and its activity was reduced by 7 % in the following 400 h. This deactivation is ascribed to deposited carbon that originated from methane cracking in {{the upper part of the}} stainless steel reactor. Fresh and used catalyst samples were characterized by XRD, BET, SEM and XRF methods. The results showed that the active coating consisting of Al 2 O 3, and the components loaded on it was partially dislodged from the SiC substrate during the reaction, but the loss of Ni loaded on the Al 2 O 3 coating was less than the loss of Al 2 O 3. This is ascribed to most Ni species being located on the outer surface of the monolithic support, which was more weakly corroded by the reactant flow. The shrinkage of the active coating and the sintering of nickel particles were also observed in the endurance test. Moreover, the SiC foam supported Ni-based <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> showed a more homogeneous bed temperature distribution compared with a traditional Ni/Mg-Al spinel catalyst.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} develop of economy recently, power and fuel supply {{problem has been}} more and more serious, more {{attention}} is paid on energy problem. Of all the sources of renewable energy, biomass is the unique renewable source of carbon and named as green coal. Biomass to liquid technology {{is one of the}} most promising routine for the liquid fuel which can replace fossil fuel. Production of synthesis gas is the key step. In this article, high stable NiO-MgO solid solution <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> was used to produce synthesis gas. It is very important to the production of carbon neutral fuels, solve the shortage problem of energy and rapid development of economy Biomass gasification and liquid fuel synthesis technologies are mature. Biomass fuel gas deeply cleaning and quality promotion are the bottleneck of the utilization of biomass. Commercial steam reforming Ni-based catalysts will rapidly lost their activity in real biomass gasification conditions because of carbon deposition. In order to promote the stability and reduce cost. In the present work, highly stable NiO-MgO solid solution <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> was prepared by two step impregnation. The effect of preparation conditions on the catalysts structure and performance was investigated. The performance of different reforming conditions were also investigated. Biomass fuel gas reforming character and synthesis gas adjust were also studies. Plasma-catalytic reforming of biomass fuel gas was also investigated. The results obtained are listed below: 1. Ni-based <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> can effectively reforming biomass fuel gas. The conversion of CH 4 and CO 2 are 90 % under 750 oC, H 2 /CO ratio was also kept at 1. 0. In 108 hours reforming test, no pressure change was detected, catalyst showed good anti-carbon and pressure drop abilities because of the straight structure. In life test, conversion of CH 4 and CO 2 were kept at 90 % which means the catalyst has high activity and good stability. NiO-MgO solid solution <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> has excellent reforming activity and high stability. Conversion of CH 4 can be higher than 95 % at 750 oC and H 2 /CO ratio was promoted to 1. 2. 60 hours life test shows that NiO-MgO solid solution <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> has excellent reforming activity, stability and anti-carbon deposition ability. Tar model compound naphthalene was completely converted to gas and lighter compounds over both catalysts. Two catalysts showed good tar elimination ability. 2. Partial oxidation reforming can effectively promote the reaction efficiency, CH 4 conversion and H 2, CO content in synthesis gas. It can also promote the H 2 /CO ratio to 1. 1. The addition of O 2 raised the tar elimination ability of the catalyst, especially the high concentration species and derivative of benzene which were difficult to convert in dry reforming. 60 hours life tests of partial oxidation reforming and dry reforming showed that catalyst in partial oxidation reforming had higher activity and stability, H 2 /CO ratio in outlet synthesis gas over partial oxidation reforming was higher than dry reforming. Synthesis gas produced by partial oxidation reforming is more suitable for liquid fuel synthesis. The addition of O 2 will promote the stability and activity of the catalyst. TG results showed that O 2 content change will change the carbon content and species on the surface of the catalyst. When O 2 /fuel reached 0. 127, catalyst showed excellent anti-carbon deposition ability. Steam reforming can promote the H 2 /CO ratio and adjust it between 1 - 5. The addition of steam can also promote the conversion of CH 4 in biomass fuel gas, which is caused by active oxide produced by H 2 O cracking during reforming. 60 hours life test showed that steam reforming can effective promote the stability and reforming efficiency, steam reforming can also prevent carbon deposition on the surface of the catalyst. 3. High voltage plasma excite biomass fuel gas molecules and then use catalytic reforming at 750 oC to adjust gas components in outlet synthesis gas can promote the quality of synthesis gas make it more suitable for liquid fuel synthesis. Experiments with different frequency show that higher frequency will promote CH 4, CO 2 conversion, H 2 /CO ratio and H 2 selectivity. Plasma-catalyt coupled reforming can eliminate tar in biomass fuel gas effectively. Higher reaction temperature will produce higher conversion of CH 4 and CO 2, it can also promote the selectivity of H 2. XRD patterns show that plasma-catalyt coupled reforming can effectively prevent the catalyst from sintering and carbon deposition on the surface of the catalyst. 4. Heat transfer is the main effect of catalyst performance, a suitable burner can produce enough power to the reformer. The design of reformer should pay more attention on heat transfer to the catalyst. Pressure test results showed that NiO-MgO solid solution <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalyst</b> can avoid pressure raise rapidly because of its special structure. NiO-MgO solid solution catalysts can adjust biomass fuel gas. Plenty of ash is the main reason of pressure raise in reformer. 近年来，随着我国经济的飞速发展造成电力和燃料供应日趋紧张，能源问题已引起高度重视。生物质由于其产量巨大、可再生，被喻为循环利用的地表绿色煤炭，其大规模利用问题已引起全球的广泛关注。其中，生物质气化技术因原料适应性广、系统简单、效率高、环境友好、产物用途广泛而成为世界各国研究开发的热点。 目前，生物质气化和合成燃料技术已经相当成熟。生物质粗燃气的深度净化和品质提升已经成为制约生物质高端利用的瓶颈。商业水蒸气重整镍催化剂在生物质气化实际条件下重整净化粗燃气，会由于严重积碳而快速失活，与实际应用存在较大距离。为提高镍催化剂的稳定性并降低成本，本文在对镍基整体式催化剂研究的基础上，采用分步浸渍法制备了高稳NiO-MgO固溶体整体式催化剂，考察了重整条件对催化剂结构与稳定性的影响。在NiO-MgO固溶体整体式催化剂上，对生物质气化粗燃气的重整反应特性以及合成气的组分调变工艺进行了研究，并结合脉冲电晕对生物质重整净化进行了研究，得到了如下结论： 1 ．镍基整体式催化剂能较好的重整净化生物质粗燃气。在 750 oC条件下，粗燃气中的CH 4 和CO 2 转化率均能达到 90 %左右而合成气的H 2 /CO值均能保持在 1. 0 左右， 108 h连续重整反应过程中，反应器内未观测到压力变化，表明整体式催化剂的直通结构能够有效的避免催化剂表面的积碳引起的压力升高。连续反应过程中生物质粗燃气中的CH 4 和CO 2 转化率均保持在 90 %左右，表明催化剂具有较好稳定性。NiO-MgO固溶体整体式催化剂对生物质粗燃气也具有良好的重整净化效果，在 750 oC条件下，CH 4 转化率能达到 95 %以上而H 2 /CO值较镍基催化剂能提高到 1. 2 左右，可以作为合成液体燃料的理想气源。 60 h连续重整实验也表明了该催化剂具有良好的反应活性、稳定性和抗积碳性能。两种催化剂均能使生物质焦油模型化合物萘的转化率达到 99 %以上。两种催化剂均表现出了良好的焦油裂解性能。 2 ．采用临氧重整可以有效地提高反应效率，改善催化剂反应特性，提高CH 4 的转化率至 92 %以上，同时提高了合成气中H 2 、CO的含量，并能够提高H 2 /CO值，使其达到 1. 1 左右。O 2 的加入提高了重整反应对粗燃气中焦油的净化能力，特别是对干重整条件下难于转化的高浓度物种和苯的含氧衍生物的有较高的转化率，焦油转化率达到 99 %以上。连续 60 h的临氧和干重整实验显示，临氧条件下催化剂表现出了更好催化活性和稳定性，出口合成气的H 2 /CO值更高，更适合于合成液体燃料，O 2 的加入有助于提高催化剂的稳定性和活性。热重分析结果表明，O 2 含量的变化直接影响着催化剂表面积碳量和积碳物种，其中在O 2 /fuel为 0. 127 时，催化剂表现出较好的抗积碳性能。水蒸汽重整不但可以显著提升生物质粗燃气的H 2 /CO值，并在 1 - 5 之间任意调变，也对提高生物质粗燃气中CH 4 的转化率也有较大帮助，这是由于H 2 O分子能够在重整过程中裂解产生较多活性氧化基团，提高重整效率。连续 60 h的水蒸汽和干重整对照试验表明，水蒸汽重整可以有效提高反应稳定性和反应效率，并有效抑制催化剂表面积碳的发生。 脉冲电晕-催化耦合重整采用高压高频放电使生物质粗燃气形成等离子体，后进行催化重整能够起到调节出口合成气体组成的效果，使之更适宜应用到液体燃料的合成。在较高放电频率时，原料气中的CH 4 、CO 2 的转化率、出口气的H 2 /CO值及H 2 的选择性都有所提高，耦合重整能有效消除生物质粗燃气中的焦油。反应温度升高时，原料气中的CH 4 、CO 2 转化率也会随之升高，H 2 的选择性也会随温度升高而增加。但出口合成气的H 2 /CO值随温度的升高有所降低。脉冲电晕-催化耦合重整生物质粗燃气，能减轻催化剂表面活性金属的烧结情况。有效降低催化剂表面的积碳。 4 ．重整炉的传热是影响到催化剂效果好坏的重要因素，采用外加热方法能够保证催化剂在适当的温度进行重整净化。重整炉的设计应当能保证催化剂温度的均匀。重整炉前后压差实验表明，NiO-MgO固溶体整体式催化剂由于其直通结构的存在能够有效的避免催化床层压力升高过快。催化剂对生物质粗燃气有着明显的调变作用。气化过程中所产生的大量灰分沉积在管路中是导致重整炉压力升高的主要原因...|$|E

La 0. 8 Ce 0. 2 NiO 3 with a crystal structure of perovskite was developed both in pellet and on cordierite substrate by citrate method. Autothermal reforming of gasoline or its surrogates. n-octane with or without thiophene additive, was carried out on either bulk perovskite pellet or <b>monolithic</b> perovskite <b>catalyst.</b> During the 220 -h long-term test, the pellet catalyst exhibited high thermal stability and activity with hydrogen yield approaching to the theoretical maximum value and only minor amount of CH 4 slipping through. It possessed fairly good sulfur tolerance, almost immune to 5 ppmw sulfur although could still be seriously poisoned when subjected to high concentration of sulfur or gasoline. The <b>monolithic</b> perovskite <b>catalysts</b> were developed by screening slurries, binders as well as Substrates with or without pre-washcoating CeZrO 2. The monolithic La- 0. 8. Ce 0. 2 NiO 3 formed in situ on the raw cordierite monolith could be an effective catalyst for ATR of gasoline, exhibiting superior performance to the catalyst of 0. 3 wt. %Rh/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 /Cordierite at a temperature range 650 - 800 degrees C. On whatever the pellet or <b>monolithic</b> <b>catalysts,</b> the active sites were presumably the in situ reduced Ni- 0 which were well dispersed and stabilized by the perovskite crystal structure. The good performances of La 0. 8 Ce 0. 2 NiO 3, better thermal stability and immunity to carbon foul and sulfur poison than LaNiO 3 could be ascribed to the increased oxygen mobility {{with the presence of}} sesquioxide of cerium.
