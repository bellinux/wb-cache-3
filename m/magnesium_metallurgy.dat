40|$|Magnesium {{production}} {{is considered to}} be one potential source of unintentional persistent organic pollutants (unintentional POPs). However, studies on the emissions of unintentional POPs from <b>magnesium</b> <b>metallurgy</b> are still lacking. Emissions of unintentional POPs, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/ dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), hexachlorobenzene (HxCBz) and pentachlorobenzene (PeCBz) are covered under the Stockholm Convention. In this study, these emissions were investigated through a magnesium smelting process. Stack gas and fly ash samples from a typical magnesium plant in China were collected and analyzed to estimate the emissions of unintentional POPs from <b>magnesium</b> <b>metallurgy.</b> Emissions factors of 412 ng TEQ t(- 1) for PCDD/Fs, 18. 6 ng TEQ t(- 1) for dl-PCBs, 3329 mu g t(- 1) for PCNs, 820 mu g t(- 1) for HxCBz, and 1326 mu g t(- 1) for PeCBz were obtained in 2009. Annual emissions from <b>magnesium</b> <b>metallurgy</b> in China were estimated to be 0. 46 g WHO-TEQ for PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs, 1651 g for PCNs, 403 g for HxCBz and 653 g for PeCBz, respectively.

The {{traditional}} silicothermic {{process of}} <b>magnesium</b> <b>metallurgy</b> with dolomite at high temperature and under high vacuum condition results in high operation costs, discontinuous production and huge production consumption. Based on this, a new thermal reduction process of magnesium preparation is proposed with serpentine {{as raw material}} at ordinary pressure. It is shown by thermodynamic analysis that the calcined products of serpentine is the compound of 2 MgO·SiO 2 and MgO·SiO 2. Furthermore, the thermal reduction process at ordinary pressure is determined by using calcined products of serpentine as raw material, CaC 2 as reductant and CaO as additive. Comparing with traditional silicothermic process, the new process has many advantages due to higher magnesium content of serpentine, lower price of the reductant CaC 2, lower reaction temperature in calcined and thermal reduction process, and ordinary pressure reaction conditions for continuous production...|$|E

40|$|Mg-based {{materials}} are especially attractive as biodegradable implants, but they degrade so fast in physiological media that some corrosion protection is needed. This paper evaluates the long-term biodegradation kinetics of powder metallurgy Mg and AZ 31 alloy {{coated with a}} phytic acid chemical conversion layer and tested in a saline phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at 37 °C. The morphology and chemical nature of the conversion coating and the corrosion products were analysed by SEM/EDX, XRD and FTIR. Corrosion resistance of the as-received and coated specimens was determined by hydrogen release, mass loss and potentiodynamic polarisation curves. The {{results indicate that the}} inherent heterogeneity and porosity of the powder <b>metallurgy</b> <b>magnesium</b> specimens, both as-received and coated with phytic acid, promoted rapid hydrogen release and led to their premature fragmentation and complete dissolution before 250 h of immersion. In contrast, the phytic acid coating on AZ 31 improves corrosion resistance in long-term tests up to 336 h without affecting biocompatibility, biodegradability and resorbability for use as a temporary endoprosthetic implant.
