5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either <b>metronidazole</b> or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to <b>metronidazole.</b> The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|First {{report of}} {{resistance}} of H. pylori to the antibiotic <b>metronidazole.</b> Resistance of H. pylori to treatment {{will lead to}} the development of many different antibiotic and proton pump inhibitor regimens for eradication.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibiotics}} neomycin and <b>metronidazole</b> {{are other}} antibiotics {{used to treat}} hepatic encephalopathy. The rationale of their use {{was the fact that}} ammonia and other waste products are generated and converted by intestinal bacteria, and killing these bacteria would reduce the generation of these waste products. Neomycin was chosen because of its low intestinal absorption, as neomycin and similar aminoglycoside antibiotics may cause hearing loss and kidney failure if used by injection. Later studies showed that neomycin was indeed absorbed when taken by mouth, with resultant complications. <b>Metronidazole,</b> similarly, is less commonly used because prolonged use can cause nerve damage, in addition to gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having sex or having few sexual {{partners}} and using condoms. Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's sexual partners should also occur. In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly <b>metronidazole</b> by mouth is recommended. For {{those who do not}} improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibiotic}} rifaximin may be {{recommended in}} addition to lactulose for those with recurrent disease. It is a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the rifamycin class. This is thought {{to work in a}} similar way to other antibiotics, but without the complications attached to neomycin or <b>metronidazole.</b> Due to the long history and lower cost of lactulose use, rifaximin is generally only used as a second-line treatment if lactulose is poorly tolerated or not effective. When rifaximin is added to lactulose, the combination of the two may be more effective than each component separately. Rifaximin is more expensive than lactulose, but the cost may be offset by reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, <b>metronidazole,</b> sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if the}} blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. <b>Metronidazole</b> is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as <b>metronidazole</b> or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and <b>metronidazole</b> (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{of choice}} for the {{treatment}} of bacterial vaginosis include <b>metronidazole</b> and clindamycin. The treatment {{of choice for}} bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women include <b>metronidazole</b> oral twice daily for seven days, or <b>metronidazole</b> gel intravaginally once daily for five days, or clindamycin intravaginally at bedtime for seven days. For pregnant women, the treatment of choice is <b>metronidazole</b> oral three times a day for seven days. Data does not report routine treatment of male sexual partners.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metronidazole</b> {{has also}} been used in women to prevent preterm birth {{associated}} with bacterial vaginosis, amongst other risk factors including the presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN). <b>Metronidazole</b> was ineffective in preventing preterm delivery in high-risk pregnant women (selected by history and a positive fFN test) and, conversely, the incidence of preterm delivery {{was found to be}} higher in women treated with <b>metronidazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|When H. pylori {{infection}} is present, {{the most effective}} treatments are combinations of 2 antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, <b>metronidazole)</b> and a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), sometimes together with a bismuth compound. In complicated, treatment-resistant cases, 3 antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin + clarithromycin + <b>metronidazole)</b> may be used together with a PPI and sometimes with bismuth compound. An effective first-line therapy for uncomplicated cases would be amoxicillin + <b>metronidazole</b> + pantoprazole (a PPI).|$|E
25|$|<b>Metronidazole</b> {{is listed}} as a {{possible}} carcinogen according to the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer. A study in those with Crohn's disease also found chromosomal abnormalities in circulating lymphocytes in people treated with <b>metronidazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vancomycin by {{mouth is}} {{preferred}} for severe disease. Additionally, vancomycin {{may be used}} to treat mild-to-moderate disease if diarrhea persists after a course of <b>metronidazole.</b> Since <b>metronidazole</b> has the potential to cause birth defects, pregnant women with Clostridium difficile infection may be treated with vancomycin regardless of disease severity. Vancomycin may be more effective than <b>metronidazole.</b> Typical vancomycin dosage is taken four times daily for 10 days. Vancomyin may be given rectally if the person develops an ileus and cannot take medications by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Flagyl (<b>metronidazole)</b> for {{bacterial}} and protozoal infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metronidazole</b> {{is of the}} {{nitroimidazole}} class. It inhibits {{nucleic acid}} synthesis by disrupting the DNA of microbial cells. This function only occurs when <b>metronidazole</b> is partially reduced, and because this reduction usually happens only in anaerobic cells, it has relatively little effect upon human cells or aerobic bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{antibiotics}} like rifapentine, rifampicin, rifabutine, isoniazid, nitrofurantoin and, possibly, <b>metronidazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Initial {{antibiotic}} therapy for less-severe Clostridium difficile colitis (pseudomembranous colitis) consists of oral <b>metronidazole</b> or oral vancomycin. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated equivalent efficacy of oral <b>metronidazole</b> and oral vancomycin in treating this colitis. However, oral vancomycin {{is shown to}} be more effective in treating patients with severe C. difficile colitis.|$|E
25|$|Systemic {{antibiotics}} such as amoxicillin or <b>metronidazole</b> {{are sometimes}} used {{in addition to}} debridement based treatments.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Dracunculus (guinea worm), <b>metronidazole</b> just eases worm {{extraction}} rather than killing the worm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metronidazole</b> (MNZ), marketed {{under the}} brand name Flagyl among others, is an {{antibiotic}} and antiprotozoal medication. It is used either alone or with other antibiotics to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and bacterial vaginosis. It is effective for dracunculiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and amebiasis. It is the drug of choice for a first episode of mild-to-moderate Clostridium difficile colitis. <b>Metronidazole</b> is available by mouth, as a cream, and intravenously.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metronidazole</b> alone rarely causes Stevens–Johnson syndrome, but is {{reported}} to occur at high rates when combined with mebendazole.|$|E
25|$|For 95-97% of cases, {{infection}} is resolved after one dose of <b>metronidazole.</b> Studies suggest that 4-5% of trichomonas cases {{are resistant to}} <b>metronidazole,</b> which may account for some “repeat” cases. Without treatment, trichomoniasis can persist for months to years in women, and is thought to improve without treatment in men. Women living with HIV infection have better cure rates if treated for 7 days rather than with one dose.|$|E
25|$|High-risk {{exposure}} such as {{that which}} occurs in rape cases may be treated preventatively using antibiotic combinations such as azithromycin, cefixime, and <b>metronidazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|After a first {{treatment}} with <b>metronidazole</b> or vancomycin, C. difficile recurs in about 20% of people. This increases to 40% and 60% with subsequent recurrences.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial vaginosis: The most {{commonly}} used antibiotics are <b>metronidazole,</b> available in both pill and gel form, and clindamycin available in both pill and cream form.|$|E
25|$|Oral <b>metronidazole</b> is a {{treatment}} option for giardiasis, however, the increasing incidence of nitroimidazole resistance {{is leading to}} {{the increased use of}} other compound classes.|$|E
25|$|Medications {{with good}} {{evidence}} include ivermectin and azelaic acid creams and brimonidine, doxycycline, and isotretinoin by mouth. Lesser evidence supports <b>metronidazole</b> cream and tetracycline by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Invasive colitis and extraintestinal disease {{including}} liver abscesses, pleuropulmonary infections, {{and brain}} abscesses {{can result from}} infection with Entamoeba histolytica. <b>Metronidazole</b> is widely used in patients with these infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metronidazole</b> {{typically}} is {{the initial}} {{drug of choice}} for mild to moderate disease, because of lower price. Typically it is taken {{three times a day}} for 10 days.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metronidazole</b> {{may cause}} mood swings. Some {{evidence}} from studies in rats indicates the possibility it {{may contribute to}} serotonin syndrome, although no case reports documenting this have been published to date.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{for both}} {{pregnant}} and non-pregnant women is usually with <b>metronidazole,</b> by mouth once. Caution {{should be used}} in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Sexual partners, even if they have no symptoms, should also be treated.|$|E
25|$|Antimicrobials {{that reduce}} the number of the strict {{anaerobic}} component of the gut flora (i.e., <b>metronidazole)</b> generally should not be given because they may enhance systemic infection by aerobic or facultative bacteria, thus facilitating mortality after irradiation.|$|E
25|$|Because {{infection}} is rarely symptomatic, treatment is rarely required. There {{have been no}} published trials so treatment remains empirical. Agents {{that have been used}} include albendazole, <b>metronidazole</b> and cotrimoxazole for myositis. Corticosteroids have also been used for symptomatic relief.|$|E
25|$|Following treatment, {{if there}} are {{systemic}} signs and symptoms, such as facial or neck swelling, cervical lymphadenitis, fever or malaise, a course of oral antibiotics is often prescribed,. Common antibiotics used are from the β-lactam antibiotic group, clindamycin and <b>metronidazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Trichomoniasis is {{a common}} STI that is caused by {{infection}} with a protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. Trichomoniasis affects both women and men, but symptoms are more common in women. Most patients are treated with an antibiotic called <b>metronidazole,</b> which is very effective.|$|E
