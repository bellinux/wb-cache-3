5|$|The Noronha skink {{probably}} lacked predators before Fernando de Noronha {{was discovered}} by humans, but several species that arrived since do prey on it, most commonly the cat (Felis catus) and cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis).

5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house <b>mouse</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus)</b> excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent to its {{discovery}} at the Mikea Forest, Petter's big-footed mouse {{was also}} found as a subfossil in cave deposits at Andrahomana in far southeastern Madagascar, a find reported in 2006. There, it was found together with more abundant remains of the introduced black rat and house <b>mouse</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus),</b> as well as indigenous rodents such as the bastard big-footed mouse. Two Petter's big-footed mouse bones were radiocarbon dated to 790–410BCE and 150–390CE, respectively, a period when the local climate became drier and humans first appeared. Macrotarsomys species are thought to burrow in sandy ground {{and would not be}} expected to enter caves; therefore, the subfossils are probably remains of animals eaten by birds of prey. Although Petter's big-footed mouse could conceivably persist in remnant pockets of wet habitat in southeastern Madagascar, searches at two sites near Andrahomana failed to confirm its presence. It may have become locally extinct in the area because of the drying climate and competition with the black rat.|$|E
5|$|A 1998 {{study in}} Bundjalung National Park in {{northern}} New South Wales found that B.aemula inflorescences are foraged {{by a variety}} of small mammals, including marsupials such as yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes), and rodents such as pale field rat (Rattus tunneyi), Australian swamp rat (R. lutreolus) and grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) and even the house <b>mouse</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus).</b> These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators. Grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) were also observed visiting B.aemula and their heads and bellies were noted to contact stigmas while feeding. Bird species that have been observed feeding at the flowers of B.aemula include rainbow lorikeet and scarlet and Lewin's honeyeaters. Several other honeyeaters were recorded on B.aemula inflorescences for The Banksia Atlas, including the New Holland, brown, white-cheeked, and tawny-crowned honeyeaters, noisy miner, little wattlebird and noisy friarbird. The Bundjalung field study found the brown honeyeater carried much higher loads of B.aemula pollen than other species measured, which included white-cheeked and yellow-faced honeyeaters and silvereyes. Insects such as ants and bees (including the introduced honeybee) have also been recorded.|$|E

25|$|Two {{introduced}} mammals {{are established}} on the islands. The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) {{was introduced to}} Rat Island around 1900, and the house <b>mouse</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus)</b> was introduced onto North Island in the 1970s, presumably with food.

In addition, three introduced mammals were previously established in the Houtman Abrolhos, but have since been eradicated. The black rat (Rattus rattus) was established on Pigeon and Rat Islands, but has been eradicated by poisoning.

25|$|Because {{they are}} easy to keep and breed, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans have long been the most intensively studied metazoan model organisms, and were among the first life-forms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their genomes, but as many genes, introns, and linkages lost, these ecdysozoans can teach us little about the origins of animals in general. The extent of this type of evolution within the superphylum will be revealed by the crustacean, annelid, and molluscan genome projects currently in progress. Analysis of the starlet sea anemone genome has emphasized the importance of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates, also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to the Eumetazoa. An analysis of the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela also suggests that the last common ancestor of sponges and the eumetazoan animals was more complex than previously assumed. Other model organisms belonging to the animal kingdom include the house <b>mouse</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus),</b> laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio).|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY-Wild house <b>mice</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus)</b> {{from one}} {{trapping}} area in southern California {{had a much}} higher incidence of spontaneous lymphoma and a markedly higher incidence of murine type C virus particles and group-specific antigen in their spleens than did wild mice of comparable age from several other areas. This association strongly supported an etiologic role for the indigenous type C virus in naturally occurring murine Iymphoma. -J Natl Cancer Inst 50 : 1571 - 1579, 1973. ASSOCIATIONS between the incidence of spontaneous lymphoma {{and the degree of}} activity of the indigenous murine type C virus suggest that expression of this usually latent genome in mice is an important, perhaps fundamental, requirement for leukemogenesis (1 - 4). This theory would be greatly strengthened if a similar association were demonstrated in a natural population of outbred feral mice.

These extinction mechanisms are common for island endemic species.
