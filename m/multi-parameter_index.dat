40|$|Coral {{health in}} St. John, US Virgin Islands, has shown {{tremendous}} declines in recent years, {{with more than}} 50 % declines in live coral cover. As one component of a group project to assess the possible impacts of anthropogenic development on coral health, a Coral Health Assessment Tool (CHAT) was developed using Microsoft Access ® and used to assess coral health in four bays in St. John. The tool builds on data management techniques that are currently employed by the National Park Service in St. John. The CHAT includes an Access form-based user interface that allows for random image selection and iterative analysis of still images that have been extracted from video of coral conditions. The database is dynamically linked to Microsoft Excel ® Pivot Table outputs that provide users with extensive data manipulation and exploration capabilities. The CHAT is constructed to allow extensibility and customization by developers and users. While this implementation of CHAT was specific to St. John, the tool's structure lends itself to further development and implementation in coral reef assessment programs worldwide. The health assessment employed a <b>multi-parameter</b> <b>index,</b> allowing bays to be ranked by relative coral health. (cont.) This index combined multiple coral health factors, including percent cover, percent healthy, and others to create a single numerical score for each bay. Combined with the conclusions of other group members, results of the health assessment generally indicate that coral health is adversely affected by development. by William Robert Detlefsen.

40|$|Abstract. Let A have {{a locally}} finite and <b>multi-parameter</b> <b>indexed</b> {{filtration}} F and let B be a homomorphic image of A. Thus B has the locally finite and <b>multi-parameter</b> <b>indexed</b> filtration induced from F. Here we study a {{relation between the}} associated graded algebra of A and that of B and use this result to calculate the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of several algebras related to quantized algebras and Poisson enveloping algebras...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} arousal {{of people with}} high {{stress-related}} sleep vulnerability {{and the effect of}} music intervention on hyperarousal. Methods A total of 33 healthy subjects from China Rehabilitation Research Center were enrolled in this study. Based on the median value (17 score) of Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test-Chinese Version (FIRST-C), they were divided into 2 groups: 16 cases of high stress-related sleep vulnerability and 17 cases of low stress-related sleep vulnerability. <b>Multi-parameter</b> physiological <b>indexes</b> monitoring system of Thought Technology Ltd. was used to gather physiological indicators [blood volume pulse (BVP), skin temperature, skin conduction, respiration rate, respiration amplitude and heart rate], and brain wave [δ wave, θ wave, low α wave and high α wave, α wave, sensory - motor rhythm (SMR), low β wave and high β wave].   Results Compared with low vulnerability subjects, high vulnerability subjects had significantly higher skin conduction (P = 0. 003, 0. 001), amplitude of SMR (P = 0. 015, 0. 031) and low β wave (P = 0. 000, 0. 001) before and after treatment, while had significantly increased high β wave after treatment (P = 0. 004). After treatment, all subjects had significantly reduced BVP (P = 0. 000), increased skin temperature (P = 0. 000), increased respiration rate (P = 0. 008) and reduced heart rate (P = 0. 000). Compared with before treatment, high vulnerability subjects had significantly reduced skin conduction (P = 0. 001), respiratory amplitude (P = 0. 032), high α wave (P = 0. 017)  and low β wave (P = 0. 013) after treatment. Compared with before treatment, low vulnerability subjects had significantly reduced skin conduction (P = 0. 039), low α wave (P = 0. 035), high α wave (P = 0. 031), α wave (P = 0. 044) and low β wave (P = 0. 015) after treatment.   Conclusions Both physiological and cortical hyperarousal are presented in people with high stress-related sleep vulnerability in resting state. Music intervention can improve the hyperarousal of high vulnerability people, especially their physiological indicators. It {{can be used as a}} health management technique to prevent people with high stress-related sleep vulnerability from developing into chronic insomnia.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2017. 05. 005 </p...|$|R
