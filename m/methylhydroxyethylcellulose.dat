40|$|A {{detailed}} rheological {{study of}} aqueous solutions of <b>methylhydroxyethylcellulose</b> {{has been carried}} out in the presence of different acrylate-based graft polymer used as additive contents. Both polymer components are used in cement formulations to improve the flow performances of the concretes, but no physicochemical studies can be easily found in the literature. The content of the graft polymer has been varied between 0. 1 and 2. 7 wt% in an aqueous solution with a fixed content of 6. 5 wt% of <b>methylhydroxyethylcellulose.</b> Creep curves were performed at different stresses in order to build up the flow curves for the various solutions. We found that the addition of the graft polymer triggers a phase transition, which is made more dramatic by the presence of an external flow. A "flow-phase diagram" has been obtained, which {{could be used as a}} guide for determining the critical conditions for the onset of the flow-induced instability...|$|E
40|$|So far, isotachophoretic (ITP) {{analyses}} {{have been}} carried out in commercially available or laboratory-made ITP instruments, generally in closed systems. At present several instruments are commercially available, originally designed for capillary zone electrophoresis with open capillaries, and these instruments can also be used for ITP. If ITP experiments are carried out using such apparatus, however, an electroosmotic flow (EOF) will act on the ITP system. The velocity of the EOF strongly varies with the choice of the leading electrolyte and terminating electrolyte and also the composition of the sample. Hence the reproducibility in quantitative analyses is a serious problem. For quantitative experiments at least an internal standard must be used to correct for undesirable fluctuations in the EOF and irreproducible injections. Better results can be obtained by effectively suppressing the EOF by using additives such as <b>methylhydroxyethylcellulose.</b> Results of quantitative experiments using the Beckman P/ACE System 2000 HPCE are presented, showing some of the problems in quantitative analyses with ITP in open capillaries...|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{separation of}} bovine whey proteins [a-lactalbumin and b-lactoglobulin (A 1 B) ] and soybean proteins was performed, {{for the first}} time, by capillary electrophoresis. Different experimental conditions were tested. The most suitable consisted of 0. 050 M phosphate buffer (pH 8) with 1 M urea and 1. 2 mg/ml <b>methylhydroxyethylcellulose,</b> UV detection at 280 nm, 15 kV applied voltage, and 308 C temperature. Quantitation of bovine whey proteins in a commercial powdered soybean milk manufactured by adding bovine whey to its formulation was performed using the calibration method of the external standard. Direct injection of a solution of the powdered soybean milk only enabled quantitation of a-lactalbumin in the commercial sample. Detection of b-lactoglobulin (A 1 B) required acid precipitation of {{the solution of the}} sample in order to concentrate bovine whey proteins in the supernatant prior to the analysis of this protein in the whey obtained. Since a-lactalbumin could also be quantitated from the injection of the whey, the simultaneous determination of a-lactalbumin and b-lactoglobulin (A 1 B) was possible upon acid precipitation of the powdered soybean milk solution. Detection limits obtained were 14 mg/g sol. for a-lactalbumin and 52 mg/g sol. for b-lactoglobulin (A 1 B) which represent protein concentrations about 60 mg/ 100 g sample for a-lactalbumin and 100 mg/ 100 g sample for b-lactoglobulin (A 1 B). ï›™ 1999 Elsevier Science B.
