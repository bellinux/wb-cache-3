A programme to prevent blindness and control eye diseases has been developed and is being adopted in Zambia.

40|$|In Britain {{doctors and}} others {{concerned}} with the treatment of offenders in prison may consult the Butler Report (see Focus, pp 157) and specialist journals, but these sources are {{concerned with the}} system in Britain only. In America the situation is different, both in organization and in certain attitudes. Dr Peter L Sissons has therefore provided a companion article to that of Dr Paul Bowden (page 163) describing the various medical issues in prisons. The main difference between the treatment of offenders in prisons in America and in Britain lies {{in the nature of the}} federal system which means that each state may operate a different system in a variety of prisons and prison medical services are as various. Nationally, the prison systems are 'structured to treat and cure the offender'. Therefore it follows that the prison medical officer is only one of the professionals concerned with this 'cure' of the offender. This principle also applies to any form of research: medical research in prisons is part of a programme which covers a wide field of social and judicial research. The prison medical officer (where there is one) has of course to look after sick prisoners, and the American idea of 'cure' is also expressed in the need for more corrective surgery where, for example, it is necessary to remove physical impediments to social rehabilitation. But a doctor is only found on the staff of those institutions which are large: in the smaller prisons there may be only first-aid facilities, and no specially appointed doctor in the community. Moreover medicines are often dispensed by <b>medical</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> who are sometimes prisoners themselves. Finally, in America prisoners are regularly invited to volunteer as subjects for medical and social research for which they are paid. In short, although it is hoped to 'cure' a prisoner he is a criminal first and a patient second...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a history}} of sleeping sickness research work and prevention programs during the German colonial period in East Africa, focusing on the regions around Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika. It examines efforts to study and prevent sleeping sickness, analyzing how both fit into the social, political, and economic dynamics of African life. It covers two phases of German colonial attention to epidemic sleeping sickness between 1902 and 1914 : an initial phase of research and scientific expeditions from 1902 to 1906, then a period dominated by the introduction of disease prevention measures in affected areas from 1907 to 1914. Highlighting the local complexity and far-reaching impact of sleeping sickness, I show that sleeping sickness research and prevention emerged from the intersection of tropical medicine expertise, African mobility, and German colonial and African politics. Sleeping sickness, and subsequent efforts toward its treatment and prevention, redefined the boundaries of political power and social influence within African communities during a crucial period of change in the region. By creating new arenas of engagement between African communities and European scientists, specifically in newly-built sleeping sickness camps and among the African <b>medical</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> employed in them, sleeping sickness work created economic relationships, reshaped social and political hierarchies, and set new ground rules for African agriculture and trade. Kings, chiefs, and colonial scientists contended with African communities' demands for treatment, their resistance to examination, and their claims on the use of land and waterways. Further, inter-colonial sleeping sickness research and subsequent prevention programs played a pivotal {{role in the development of}} tropical medicine, strengthening disciplinary boundaries and defining the trajectory of future research. My work weaves together narratives of research and disease prevention from metropolitan Europe and East Africa, in contrast to strictly colonial and national histories of health and medicine that have preceded it...|$|E
40|$|Shiftworking is {{a common}} {{characteristic}} of modern societies. At present nearly one-fifth of the total global work force works in shifts {{and at the same}} time 19 % of EU’s workforce work night shift. Continuity, rotation and scheduling are the main characteristics of shiftworking. Healthcare personnel and nurses provide and are responsible for healthcare services on 24 hour basis. Shiftworkers tend to experience problems in four main areas caused by the desychronization of endogenous physiological system, the circadian rhythms. The first relates to increased fatigue and sleepiness caused by the decreased amount of sleep which results in a cumulative sleep debt when trying to sleep during the day. The second relates to their health; shiftworkers tend to suffer from poorer general health, physiological and psychological, including an increase in gastrointestinal and cardiovascular problems, neurotisicm and burn-out. The third area of concern relates to their family and social life. Shiftworkers tend to suffer from poorer family and social relationships because their working hours often coincident with societal and family obligations. The fourth area concerns the satisfaction and performance from workplace. The aim of this study was to investigate the burden experienced by nursing personnel working irregular shift system in Greece and the promotion of a theoretical frame of designing shiftwork system less health damaging. The instrument used for the data collection is the scales of Standard Shiftwork Index questionnaire completed by nurses and <b>medical</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> working a) irregular shift system concluding night shifts and b) permanently morning shifts. The study was carried out from November 2006 to November 2007 and conducted at three general hospitals of Athens. The study has documented the working conditions concerned the rotating shift system. The results showed that bachelor degree nurses reported lesser job satisfaction. Female nurses and nurses diagnosed with chronic disease reported higher scores in the SSI scales. The divorced/widow nurses had higher score in the chronic fatigue scale and the employes with more than three persons under their consideration reported greater sleep problems. Personnel working rotating shift system reported greater score in the chronic fatigue and the languidity scale and lesser score in the scale which measures the amount of time the shift system leaves compared to those working permantly morning shifts. The basic conclusion of this study is the recognition of the need for more explanation of the consequences of the rotating shift system in clinical basis and the adoption of the shift system with lesser implications on physical, psychological health and family/social life. Finally, it is regarded as necessary the shiftworkers to be informed and educated on the implications of the shifts in order to use the appropriate coping strategies. ...|$|E
