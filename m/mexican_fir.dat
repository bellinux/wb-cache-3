50|$|White fir is {{very closely}} related to grand fir (Abies grandis), with {{subspecies}} lowiana being particularly similar to the interior variety of grand fir A. grandis var. idahoensis, intergrading with it where they meet in the Cascades of central Oregon. To the south in Mexico, it is replaced by further close relatives, Durango fir (A. durangensis) and <b>Mexican</b> <b>fir</b> (A. mexicana)....|$|E
50|$|A 2004 USDA {{report on}} Mexican Christmas tree farming {{noted that the}} {{majority}} of Mexican produced Christmas trees were of the species Mexican White Pine (Pinus Ayacahuite), Mexican Pinyon (Pinus Cembroides), and Sacred Fir (Oyamel - Abies Religiosa). In 2011 the USDA included a more exhaustive list in a report of Mexican tree farming that included: Mexican White Pine (Pinus ayacahuite), Douglas <b>Fir,</b> <b>Mexican</b> Pinyon, Sacred <b>Fir,</b> and the Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis).|$|R
50|$|Further inland, coast Douglas fir is {{replaced}} by another variety, Rocky Mountain or interior Douglas fir (P. menziesii var. glauca). Interior Douglas fir intergrades with coast Douglas fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia, and from there ranges northward to central British Columbia and southeastward to the Mexican border, becoming increasingly disjunct as latitude decreases and altitude increases. <b>Mexican</b> Douglas <b>fir</b> (P. lindleyana), which ranges {{as far south as}} Oaxaca, is often considered a variety of P. menziesii.|$|R
