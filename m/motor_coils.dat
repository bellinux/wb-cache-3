50|$|While a {{motor-generator}} set may consist of distinct motor and generator machines coupled together, a single unit dynamotor (for dynamo-motor) has the <b>motor</b> <b>coils</b> and the generator coils wound around a single rotor; both the motor and generator therefore {{share the same}} outer field coils or magnets. Typically the <b>motor</b> <b>coils</b> are driven from a commutator {{on one end of}} the shaft, while the generator coils provide output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a pair of machines, and does not require exposed drive shafts.|$|E

40|$|A 12 - 8 switched-reluctance motor (SRM) is {{studied in}} bearingless (or self-levitated) {{operation}} with coil currents {{limited to the}} linear region to avoid magnetic saturation. The required motoring and levitating currents are summed and go into a single <b>motor</b> <b>coil</b> per pole to obtain the highest power output of the motor by having more space for <b>motor</b> <b>coil</b> winding. Two controllers are investigated for the bearingless SRM operation. First, a model-based controller using the radial force, which is adjusted by a factor derived from finite element analysis, is presented. Then a simple and practical observation-based controller using a PD (proportional-derivative) control algorithm is presented. Both controllers were experimentally demonstrated to 6500 rpm.

A dynamotor combines both functions into a single unit with coils for both the motor and the generator functions wound around a single rotor; both coils share the same outer field coils or magnets. Typically the <b>motor</b> <b>coils</b> are driven from a commutator {{on one end of}} the shaft, when the generator coils output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft.

The Halbach magnetic circuit outperforms the conventional magnetic circuit due to the confined magnetic flux. To investigate the performance of the Halbach magnetic circuit, we analyze air gap flux density with the various shapes and thickness of the magnets using 3 -dimensional finite element analysis. Consequently the optimum shape of the Halbach magnetic circuit is proposed.

50|$|Several {{methods of}} {{starting}} a polyphase motor are used. Where a large inrush current and high starting torque can be permitted, the motor can be started across the line, by applying full line voltage to the terminals (direct-on-line, DOL). Where {{it is necessary to}} limit the starting inrush current (where the motor is large compared with the short-circuit capacity of the supply), the motor is started at reduced voltage using either series inductors, an autotransformer, thyristors, or other devices. A technique sometimes used is star-delta (YΔ) starting, where the <b>motor</b> <b>coils</b> are initially connected in star configuration for acceleration of the load, then switched to delta configuration when the load is up to speed. This technique is more common in Europe than in North America. Transistorized drives can directly vary the applied voltage as required by the starting characteristics of the motor and load.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} data-based {{approach}} for modeling and controller {{design of a}} dual-stage tape servo actuator. Our method uses step response measurements and a generalized realization algorithm to identify a multivariable discrete-time model of the actuator. The data acquisition and modeling can be implemented in the servo firmware of a tape drive. We have designed a dual-stage controller, based on the model, using loop shaping techniques adopted for multivariable control problems. We applied the procedure to the prototype of a dual-stage actuator tape head to reduce the effect of lateral tape motion. The prototype consists of a conventional voice <b>coil</b> <b>motor</b> for coarse positioning and a micro-actuator for fine positioning. The micro-actuator, which is mounted on the voice <b>coil</b> <b>motor,</b> uses a piezo crystal to follow high-frequency lateral tape motion (up to the kilohertz regime), while the voice <b>coil</b> <b>motor</b> follows only low-frequency lateral tape motion. Compared to a single-stage design, the dual-stage servo design provides a 25 % bandwidth improvement and a voice <b>coil</b> <b>motor</b> control signal that is much smaller in magnitude.

40|$|AbstractThe term motor {{should be}} {{understood}} as the converter of an electrical energy into a mechanical energy. The stepper motor converts electrical signals in form of impulses, for the angle of rotation. The relationship is proportional, so that the stepper motor rotation speed {{is dependent on the}} frequency of the control impulses. The research concerns developed prototype of glue distributing machine. Its task is to glue coating parts and seats used in machines and mass transit vehicles. Parts to be bonded are characterized by great variety and complicated geometry. Due to the high requirements for constant quality of applied adhesive layer and the shortest possible operation time, it is necessary to apply specialized propulsion and control system. The article presents the results of research regarding the identification of torque characteristics in a function of rotational speed of the stepper motor. In addition, torque variations for different values of the supply current of <b>motor</b> <b>coils</b> where determined. Actual characteristics of stepper motor were necessary due to the frequency increase selection method applied in the project. This will enable the accurate control of the stepper motor...|$|E
40|$|A {{magnetic}} spring, or {{a spring}} and motor combination, providing a linear spring force characteristic {{in each direction}} from a neutral position, in which the spring action may occur for any desired coordinate of a typical orthogonal coordinate system. A set of magnets are disposed, preferably symmetrically about a coordinate axis, poled orthogonally to the desired force direction. A second set of magnets, respectively poled opposite the first set, are arranged on the sprung article. The magnets {{of one of the}} sets are spaced a greater distance apart than those of the other, such that an end magnet from each set forms a pair having preferably planar faces parallel to the direction of spring force, the faces being offset so that in a neutral position {{the outer edge of the}} closer spaced magnet set is aligned with the inner edge of the greater spaced magnet set. For use as a motor, a coil can be arranged with conductors orthogonal to both the magnet pole directions and the direction of desired spring force, located across from the magnets of one set and fixed with respect to the magnets of the other set. In a cylindrical coordinate system having axial spring force, the magnets are radially poled and <b>motor</b> <b>coils</b> are concentric with the cylinder axis...|$|E
40|$|High Temperature (HT°) <b>motor</b> <b>coils</b> {{open new}} {{perspectives}} for extending the applications of electrical motors or generators to very harsh environments or for designing very high power density machines working with high internal temperature gradients. Over {{a temperature of}} 300 °C, the classic enameled wire cannot work permanently, the turn-to-turn insulation must be inorganic and made with high temperature textiles or vitro-ceramic compounds. For both cases, a diffusion barrier must protect the copper wire against oxidation. The usual solution consists of adding a nickel layer that yields an excellent chemical protection. Unfortunately, the nickel has ferromagnetic properties that change a lot the skin effect in the HT wire at high frequencies. For many applications such as aeronautics, electrical machines are always associated with PWM inverters for their control. The windings must resist to high voltage short spikes caused by the fast fronted pulses imposed by the feeding inverter. The nickel protection layer of the HT° inorganic wire has a large influence on the high frequency behavior of coils and, consequently, on {{the magnitude of the}} voltage spikes. A good knowledge of the non-linear magnetic characteristics of this nickel layer is helpful for designing reliable HT inorganic coils. The paper presents a method able to characterize non-linear electromagnetic properties of this nickel layer up to 500 °C...|$|E

Two real-time executable position-tracking algorithms, based on predictors with different levels of complexity, are developed and compared in terms of false alarms rejection and fault-detection capabilities, by using a high-fidelity model of the actuator. The algorithms’ performances are evaluated by simulating severe flight manoeuvres, with the actuator in normal condition and with relevant faults (<b>motor</b> <b>coil</b> faults, <b>motor</b> magnet degradation, voltage supply decrease).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} sliding {{friction}} and the forming behaviour of enamel {{insulated copper wire}} during the die-forming process. It also aims to determine potential damage mechanisms to the wire during bending process for electric <b>motor</b> <b>coils.</b> In this investigation a wire-bending machine was designed and built in order to simulate the wire forming process in a laboratory scale. Bending angle of the wire and the bending radii were used to control the strain on the wire surface. The effect of speed on COF was investigated for different speeds of of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm/s. A positive correlation was observed between the COF and the testing speed. Additionally, the effect of strain on COF was studied for 2 % and 23 % to determine its influence on the COF. A general trend was observed of decreased COF with increased strain in wires. Finally, {{the ability of the}} enamel coating to resist external damage and wire strain was investigated by tensile testing of pre-scratched magnet wire.

40|$|Mechanical cryocoolers {{represent}} a sigmficant enabling technology for precision space instruments by providing cryogenic temperatures for sensitive infrared, gamma-ray, and x-ray detectors. However, the vibration {{generated by the}} cryocooler's refrigeration compressor has long {{been identified as a}} critical integration issue. The key sensitivity {{is the extent to which}} the cooler's vibration harmonics excite spacecraft resonances and prevent on-board sensors from achieving their operational goals with respect to resolution and pointing accuracy. To reduce the cryocooler's vibration signature to acceptable levels, a variety of active vibration suppression technologies have been developed and imple-mented over the past 15 years. At this point, nearly all space cryocoolers have active vibration suppression systems built into their drive electronics that reduce the peak unbalanced forces to less than 1 % of their original levels. Typical systems of today individually control the vibration in each of the cryocoolers lowest drive harmonics, with some controlling as many as 16 harmonics. A second vibration issue associated with cryocoolers is surviving launch. Here the same pistons and coldfingers that generate vibration during operation are often the most critical elements in terms of surviving high input accelera-tion levels. Since electrical power is generally not available during launch, passive vibration suppression technologies have been developed. Common vibration damping techniques include electrodynamic braking via shorted <b>motor</b> <b>coils</b> and the use of particle dampers on sensitive cryogenic elements. This paper provides an overview of the vibration characteristics of typical linear-drive space cryocoolers, outlines the history of development and typical performance of the various active and passive vibration suppression systems being used...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved micro-step voltage-fed actuator {{for an automobile}} active grill shutter (AGS) system. A novel structured stepper motor, which contains both the main and auxiliary teeth in the stator, is proposed for the actuator. In a normal permanent magnet (PM) <b>motor</b> <b>coils</b> are generally wound on all the stator teeth, however, in the proposed motor, the winding is only on the main teeth. Because {{of the absence of}} coils in the auxiliary teeth, the proposed stepper motor possesses the following advantages: simple structure, lighter weight, smaller volume, and less time consumption. The unique auxiliary poles in the stepper motor supply the flux path to increase the step resolution even without any coils. The characteristics of the proposed stepper motor were investigated using finite element analysis. In particular, the effect of the magnetization distribution of the PM on the motor performance was investigated during the analysis. Cogging torque, which causes noise and vibration issues, was minimized by the tooth-shape optimization. In addition, a micro-step voltage-fed algorithm was implemented for a high-resolution position control. By employing a current close to a sine wave using space vector pulse-width modulation, a high-quality current waveform with a high resolution was obtained. Finally, the proposed prototype was fabricated, and the cogging torque, back-electromotive force, and current characteristics were measured by mounting the prototype on the AGS system. Both the analysis and experimental results validate the performance improvement from the proposed motor and its possible application for the flap control of the AGS system...|$|E
