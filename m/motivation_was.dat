5|$|Keating {{motivated}} Tonelli {{by showing}} {{him the best}} times recorded by American boys of the same age, as documented in Swimming World Magazine. Unaware that the Americans were swimming in 50yd pools, roughly 10% shorter than those in Australia, Tonelli could not understand his inability to match and better their times. He said that his greatest <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> the desire to impress his parents.|$|E
5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of the peasant, who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that the peasant class' primary <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> to own their land, and that they were capitalists; instead, they saw the proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E
5|$|Cyber Rights {{analyzes}} {{the legal issues}} involved with communicating on the Internet, including those relating to Internet privacy and government involvement. The book is written with a first-person perspective: the reader learns of the author's morning ritual, {{the fact that his}} cat is named Francie and that he married a woman he met through a Bulletin Board System. Godwin's <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> to keep the Internet safe from government actions that restrict freedom of speech. He asserts that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution should apply equally to the Internet as it does to other media.|$|E

40|$|Raw Materials for a {{learning}} activity about motivation. It will explore the students own motivations before introducing them to some theories of <b>motivation.</b> Students <b>are</b> {{then asked to}} self-reflect {{in the light of}} these theories, in particular, in relation to their choice of career. Methods of increasing <b>motivation</b> <b>are</b> then explored before two methods of increasing others’ <b>motivation</b> <b>are</b> introduced and practised. ...|$|R
50|$|Another set of {{key terms}} {{similar to the}} two the Greek’s used to {{describe}} hedonic <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> appetitive emotion and aversive <b>motivation.</b> Appetitive emotions <b>are</b> described as goals that {{can be associated with}} the positive hedonic processes of survival and pleasure, such as food and sex. Aversive <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> about removing oneself from unpleasant situations.|$|R
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them; his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned {{with any}} {{political}} party, decided independently {{to pursue the}} annexation of Texas {{in a bid to}} gain a base of popular support for another four years in office. His official <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844.|$|E
5|$|In a 1982 {{interview}} with Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Henson said ideas for his feature film The Dark Crystal originated from his efforts at character creation on Saturday Night Live. Henson told the Associated Press in 1982 that The Dark Crystal characters evolved directly from his Saturday Night Live creations. Henson described the evolutionary process from The Land of Gorch to Dark Crystal, saying that because The Land of Gorch was featured on late-night television, it helped {{expand the scope}} of his puppets, including risqué behavior. He described the challenge that motivated him to further develop concepts from The Land of Gorch on Dark Crystal, saying his next <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> to draft a universe of puppets for a feature film without humans.|$|E
5000|$|Vallerand and Reid (1984) {{found that}} college students' {{perceived}} competence and intrinsic <b>motivation</b> <b>were</b> increased by positive feedback and decreased by negative feedback. Further, a path analysis {{suggested that the}} effects of feedback on the students' intrinsic <b>motivation</b> <b>were</b> mediated by perceived competence.|$|R
25|$|<b>Motivation</b> <b>is</b> {{the driving}} force of desire behind all {{deliberate}} actions of humans. <b>Motivation</b> <b>is</b> based on emotion—specifically, on the search for satisfaction (positive emotional experiences), and the avoidance of conflict. Positive and negative is defined by the individual brain state, which may be influenced by social norms: a person may be driven to self-injury or violence because their brain is conditioned to create a positive response to these actions. <b>Motivation</b> <b>is</b> important because it is involved in the performance of all learned responses. Within psychology, conflict avoidance and the libido are seen to be primary motivators. Within economics, <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> often seen to be based on incentives; these may be financial, moral, or coercive. Religions generally posit divine or demonic influences.|$|R
30|$|Self-determination theory It {{is assumed}} that {{learning}} takes place when positive emotions are involved. Since intrinsic <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> more strongly related to positive emotions (driven by the feeling of autonomy), we hypothesized that intrinsic oriented forms of <b>motivation</b> <b>are</b> stronger predictors of student performance than extrinsic forms. The decreasing regression coefficients confirm these assumptions. In accounting, intrinsic and identified <b>motivations</b> <b>are</b> obviously emotionally loaded, positive drivers of academic success. Furthermore, as expected, student satisfaction with school is also positively related to student competence development.|$|R
5|$|Minor Crusading efforts lingered {{into the}} 14thcentury, and several Crusades were {{launched}} during the 14th and 15th centuries {{to counter the}} expansion of the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. In 1309 as many as 30,000 peasants gathered from England, north-eastern France, and Germany proceeded as far as Avignon but disbanded there. Peter I of Cyprus captured and sacked Alexandria in 1365 in {{what became known as the}} Alexandrian Crusade; his <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> as much commercial as religious. LouisII led the 1390 Barbary Crusade against Muslim pirates in North Africa; after a ten-week siege, the Crusaders signed a ten-year truce.|$|E
5|$|The Ormulum {{consists}} of 18,956 lines of metrical verse, explaining Christian teaching {{on each of}} the texts used in the mass throughout the church calendar (Treharne 2000, p.273). As such, it is the first new homily cycle in English since the works of Ælfric of Eynsham (c. 990). The <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> to provide an accessible English text {{for the benefit of the}} less educated, which might include some clergy who found it difficult to understand the Latin of the Vulgate, and the parishioners who in most cases would not understand spoken Latin at all (Treharne 2000, p.273).|$|E
5|$|One {{striking}} {{difference was}} that late army doctrine (and practice) aimed at avoiding open battle with the enemy if possible, unlike the early doctrine from the Principate of seeking to bring the enemy to battle as often and as quickly as possible. The main <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> likely not a reduced ability to win such encounters. The late army continued to win {{the great majority of}} its battles with barbarians. Rather, the primary concern seemed to be the need to minimise casualties. Pitched battles generally resulted in heavy losses of high-grade comitatenses troops, which could not be easily replaced. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the late army had greater difficulty than the Principate in finding sufficient recruits, and especially high-quality recruits. The late army preferred to attack the enemy by stealth or stratagem: ambushes, surprise attacks, harassment and manoeuvres to corner the enemy in zones where they could not access supplies and from which they could not escape (e.g. by blocking mountain passes or river crossings).|$|E

40|$|Within the {{classroom}} context, albeit school or university, intrinsic <b>motivation</b> can effectively <b>be</b> described and changed if a process-oriented approach is employed. The question is posed whether a process-oriented approach to <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> acceptable to Christian education. To answer this question, intrinsic motivation and the process-oriented approach to <b>motivation</b> <b>are</b> described. A Christian view of self-knowledge and control, {{which are the}} main components of a process-oricnted approach to <b>motivation,</b> <b>is</b> subsequently given and the process-oriented approach to <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> subjected to a Christian evaluation. The conclusions are drawn that this approach can fruitfully be used in Christian education, given that self-knowledge and control arc interpreted {{within the context of the}} concept of the student as God’s representative on earth and the fact that God equipped him adequately with cognitive, affective and conative abilities to respond to His call to discover, develop and rule the earth actively...|$|R
30|$|Our main <b>motivations</b> <b>are</b> {{inspired}} by the following reasons.|$|R
5|$|Operation PBHISTORY was {{an effort}} by the CIA to analyze {{documents}} from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup after the fact, in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union. Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed Soviet ties. The CIA also believed this would help it better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little real information. A final <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and the CIA wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment. The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz's personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} Gregory's main <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> {{to increase the}} number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was the only part of the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them, as his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{proposal}} {{had called}} for locating the station in Ny-Ålesund due to its topographical advantage. In January 1964, ESRO started informal discussions with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who stated {{that they had no}} initial objections. By then, supported by Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, ESRO instead proposed situating the station at Longyearbyen because it was less remote and would incur lower costs. This was opposed by Norwegian authorities; mining in Ny-Ålesund had ceased after the 1963 Kings Bay Affair and the authorities wanted permanent activity in the town. An official request was made by ESRO in February, and in May, official political support for the project was awarded. The main <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> to establish a permanent space technology center in Norway that could stimulate further scientific growth.|$|E
5|$|Use of {{the airport}} area as a {{civilian}} airport was launched by Varangfly director Odd Bentzen in 1964. After visiting Iceland he proposed a series of short and simple airports in Finnmark which could serve the airline's air ambulance service. A different proposal was launched in 1966 by several of the larger airlines, including Scandinavian Airlines System, Braathens SAFE and Widerøe, to establish a network of short take-off and landing airports in rural areas; Berlevåg was one of six original proposals for Finnmark. A county committee was established in 1966 to look into building small airfields in Finnmark, including Berlevåg. In the following years the municipality made investments to allow the airfield {{to be used for}} air ambulance services. Part of the <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> Berlevåg's poor port conditions, which often forced seaplanes to land at Kongsfjord.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bart enlists Lisa to {{help find}} out what Sideshow Bob is up to, but only ends up being {{discovered}} rummaging in Bob's trash and angrily escorted home by him. They finally decide to search in Bob's trailer at the dam construction site, and discover a briefcase full of cash. On being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing anything about it, stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe that Bob is cutting back on construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up {{with a gun and}} reveals that {{he is the one who}} embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses. He officially declares his greed of the money motivated him to enact his plan, though he privately admits to Bob that his true <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> because of Bob being chosen as Krusty's sidekick instead of Cecil. Without hesitation, Cecil locks Bob, Bart and Lisa in the dam and prepares to blow it up, taking the money with him.|$|E

25|$|Thus, a person’s {{attitude}} toward {{these two factors}} will influence his or her motivation level and subsequent group behavior. Karau and Williams (1993, 2001) found that <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> highest when the individual believed that the goal was easily attainable and very valuable. On the other hand, <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> lowest when the goal seemed impossible {{and not at all}} valuable.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study by}} Kliegel et al. (2008), it was shown that motivational state {{affected}} performance in two age groups (three-year-olds and five-year-olds) completing the same prospective memory task. There was no difference for the two age groups when <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> high but performance of the three years old was reduced when <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> low. If a person considers a task to be unimportant or is affected by fatigue, {{they will not be}} motivated to remember the intention. Less attention will be given to relevant cues and the memory {{is more likely to be}} forgotten. Therefore, prospective memory can be enhanced by avoiding low motivational states.|$|E
40|$|Self Determination Theory (SDT) {{distinguishes the}} quality of {{motivation}} from its quantity or intensity (Vansteenkiste, Sierens, Soetens, Luyckx, & Lens, 2009).

Being autonomously motivated, as opposed to controlled, {{has been found to}} lead to more volitional persistence, better relationships in social groups, more effective performance, greater health and wellbeing (Deci & Ryan, 2002), deep-level cognitive processing (Vansteenkiste et al., 2009), and creativity (Ryan & Deci, 2000 a).

2500|$|Pull <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> the {{opposite}} of push. It {{is a type of}} <b>motivation</b> that <b>is</b> much stronger. [...] "Some of the factors are those that emerge {{as a result of the}} attractiveness of a destination as it is perceived by those with the propensity to travel. They include both tangible resources, such as beaches, recreation facilities, and cultural attractions, and traveler's perceptions and expectation, such as novelty, benefit expectation, and marketing image." [...] Pull <b>motivation</b> can <b>be</b> seen as the desire to achieve a goal so badly that it seems that the goal is pulling us toward it. That <b>is</b> why pull <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> stronger than push <b>motivation.</b> It <b>is</b> easier to be drawn to something rather than to push yourself for something you desire.|$|R
