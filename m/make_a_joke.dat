25|$|No other {{candidates}} were proposed and the Returning Officer called for Dyer {{to give a}} speech to the electors regarding what he would advocate for and his goals if he became the Member of Parliament for Bruce. However, before Dyer made his speech John Hardy stepped in and asked if he could say some words as Henry Clapcott's representative, an action opposed by other electors. Hardy said that in reply to some observations by J. L. Gillies regarding the state of the province of Otago without a treasurer— he would then also like to nominate Marryatt—who was himself an elector for the by-election. The observations were concerning the fact that Clapcott would be forced to resign as Treasurer to take up his role as MP for Bruce. Marryatt had opposed the stepping in of Hardy, without a clue that he would be nominated for the role. Laughingly, J. L. Gillies seconded that nomination. However, Gillies said that an elector may only nominate one person for a role at an election. The Returning Officer then justified that an elector may nominate as many people as they like. Returning the compliment, Marryatt nominated Hardy for the role, seconded by George E. Brown. However, the Returning Officer took no notice of the nominations, stating that it was immature of the electors to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> on such a serious duty. Multiple electors then said that some fun at an election was expected, a stance which the Returning Officer disagreed with.|$|E
500|$|According to Branco, the show's past writing {{teams had}} {{proposed}} creating a Marty and Todd love story, {{but it never}} happened, mostly because Haskell and Howarth had refused to participate. In Branco's opinion, the push toward the storyline was the reason Howarth eventually left OLTL for As the World Turns. By contrast, at a fan gathering in 2008, St. John joked about Todd and Marty bonding during the Carlivati storyline, stating, [...] "I'm all for gang rape." [...] He later issued an apology for the comment: [...] "I should {{know better than to}} ever try and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about such a serious subject. I intended no disrepect and apologize to anyone I offended." ...|$|E

500|$|Lennon's {{most intense}} {{feelings}} were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking {{him through the}} lyrics of How Do You Sleep?, Lennon argued with him through the press for {{three years after the}} group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of Saturday Night Live in which Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. The pair considered going to the studio to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired. Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: [...] "Throughout my career, I've selected to work with... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono... That ain't bad picking." ...|$|E
500|$|Lawrence Tierney {{was cast}} as Alton Benes. He {{was known for}} his bad-guy roles in films during the 1940s and 1950s, such as Dillinger, The Hoodlum and Born to Kill. Tierney's {{appearance}} in the episode is one of his only comedic roles. Cast and crew members were very impressed with Tierney's performance, and intended to make Alton Benes a recurring character. However, they were frightened of him; during filming it was discovered that Tierney had stolen a butcher knife from the knife block in Jerry's apartment set. Various cast members remember Seinfeld encountering Tierney and stating [...] "Hey Lawrence, what do you got there in your jacket?". Tierney, realizing he had been caught, tried to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about how he thought taking the knife would be funny, by reenacting a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), holding the knife above his head and making threatening motions towards Seinfeld. Tom Cherones, Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus saw this happen, and, as Alexander recalled, it [...] "scared the living crap out of all of us." [...] Cherones stated that, afterwards, Larry David would jokingly threaten to have Tierney back on the show if Cherones did his work badly.|$|E
500|$|On 8 December, PewDiePie's channel reached 50 million subscribers, {{becoming}} the first YouTube channel to do so. After reaching the milestone, PewDiePie tweeted [...] "will delete tomorrow 5pm gmt," [...] in reference to his channel, before later uploading a celebratory video featuring fireworks. Ultimately, he did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead shut down the joke Jack septiceye2 channel, stating [...] "You know when you <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> and it just blows up way bigger than you'd imagined?" [...] PewDiePie's stunt received negative reception from Fortune. The publication's Mathew Ingram opined, [...] "this is just a temper tantrum by a man-baby who makes millions of dollars playing video games," [...] adding, [...] "at first glance, the video in which he threatens to delete his channel seems like the whining of a rich, entitled celebrity who has noticed that his videos aren’t getting as many views as they used to, and blames the platform for not supporting {{him as much as}} he thinks they should." [...] On 18 December 2016, he received a Ruby Play Button from YouTube as a reward for hitting 50 million subscribers.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{live for}} the first time the 2011 Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011. During the performance she danced with her male backup dancers and the official video of the song was played on a screen behind them. Later, in May 2012, Beyoncé performed a funky version of the song as a part of her revue show [...] in Atlantic City, New Jersey at Revel. While reviewing the show, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Then she makes some of the most thorough and gold-plated declarations of self-worth ever rendered in pop. 'There’s nothing not to love about me,' she sang... without needing to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> out of it." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice was also positive about the performance of the song, saying, [...] "Live, she threw herself into the track, from tsk-tsk-tsk opening to impassioned ending; after that, the song's frenetic beat got transformed into an extended outro that showcased her band's prowess in such a convincing way, she took off her shoes to dance along with it." [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was included in the set list of Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013-2014).|$|E

2500|$|St. John {{felt the}} need to {{apologize}} following comments he made at an August 2008 Fan Club Luncheon. When asked about the controversial storyline, he replied, [...] "I'm all for gang rape." [...] He issued the following apology to SOAPnet.com: [...] "I regret the way I responded to the question about the upcoming Todd and Marty storyline. It was meant in jest and I should know better than to ever try and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about such a serious subject. I intended no disrepect and apologize to anyone I offended." ...|$|E

2500|$|A rising {{number of}} {{households}} (especially in the south-east) were putting added pressure on housing during Prescott's tenure as the minister responsible. An increase in the housebuilding was proposed, primarily on brownfield sites, but also on some undeveloped greenfield areas {{and as a result}} he was accused of undermining the Green Belt. During a radio interview in January 1998, Prescott was asked about housing development on the green belt; intending to convey that the government would enlarge green belt protection, Prescott replied [...] "It's a Labour achievement, and we mean to build on it". He had not intended to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> and was distressed when it prompted laughter.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, ScrewAttack ranked Shao Kahn as {{the fourth}} best Mortal Kombat character.

Even having fellow MK character Johnny Cage <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about his appearance in MK9. In UGO's 2012 list of the top Mortal Kombat characters, Shao Kahn placed as 16th. In their retrospection listing of MK characters, UGO stated most favorite thing about him {{was the fact that}} [...] "his speaking voice is the voice of the announcer heard throughout the series." [...] Complex placed him seventh on her 2013 list of most brutal fighters in Mortal Kombat, adding that [...] "he was brutal not only in his strength but his cunning, too." [...] He was voted the series' ninth greatest character in a poll by Dorkly that same year.|$|E
2500|$|His down-to-earth manner was {{attested to}} by a White House butler who {{recalled}} that, {{on a visit}} in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation, and poured them drinks. As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip is noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, [...] politically incorrect or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. In {{an address to the}} General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: [...] "Dontopedalogy  is  the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years." [...] Later in life he suggested his comments {{may have contributed to the}} perception that he is [...] "a cantankerous old sod". The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of [...] "HRH Victor Meldrew". For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, [...] "No wonder you are deaf listening to this row." [...] Later Philip wrote, [...] "The story is largely invention. It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing." [...] When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: [...] "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing". Menary later said: [...] "I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> I certainly didn't take any offence." [...] During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, [...] "If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed." [...] The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go [...] "round-eyed". His comment had no effect on Sino-British relations, but it shaped his own reputation.|$|E
