40|$|The PCPro {{method is}} {{characterized}} by the application of CAD/CAM, CNC-milling and casting technologies. This article describes the PCPro method by means of the fabrication of sample parts. In addition, the manufacturing of a prototype machine is presented. The PCPro method entails several advantages compared to common process chains such as Rapid Prototyping/vacuum casting. In this chapter the main benefits and limitations of the process will be outlined. Quality: PCPro is a simple casting procedure without any gate system. Mold turbulence and thus air bubbles cannot occur. The wear of the lower <b>mold</b> <b>half</b> can be easily repaired by shifting the NC-programs and overhauling this tool half. It is not necessary to build a new tool. Complicated features (for example threads) that cannot be made by casting procedures are easy to manufacture using the integrated CNC-machining. Precision: Finish machining takes place after curing and shrinkage of the casting materials. Thus, the parts have a higher precision compared to other casting technologies. Narrow tolerances can be obtained. The complete machining is done in one set-up, therefore no inaccuracy results between inner and outer contour. There is no misalignment between lower and upper mold. Additional clamping for finish machining is avoided. Time and costs savings: The second <b>mold</b> <b>half</b> exists only in the form of NC-programs. A physical master model is not necessary, thus the costly and time-consuming model-making process with expensive Rapid Prototyping equipment and materials is avoided. The expense for mold making is reduced, because only one <b>mold</b> <b>half</b> is manufactured. Construction of the second tool half including gating system, risers, mold venting and mold parting is avoided. 3 D-CAD effort is reduced. Construction of mold release slopes and fillets for inner contours are not necessary. Preparation of the mold is reduced, since only one half has to be cleaned. Cycle time depends on the number of molds used in the machining system. Automation of the entire process chain by the usage of exchangeable modules or transfer lines makes this process capable of Rapid Manufacturing. Integration in existing machining centers is possible...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} numerical {{prediction of}} the mold filling process of long and thin walled parts {{is dependent on}} numerous factors. This paper investigates the effect of various influencing variables on the filling pattern by means of simulation and experimental validation. It was found that mold temperature, process settings and venting conditions have {{little effect on the}} predicted filling pattern. However, in the actual case study, the filling behavior observed during the experiments was significantly different compared to the numerical prediction. A structural finite element analysis of the moving <b>mold</b> <b>half</b> showed an unacceptable large deformation of the mold plates under injection pressure. A very good correlation between simulation and experiment was attained after improving the stiffness of the mold. Therefore it can be concluded, that the elasticity of the mold may have a significant influence on the filling pattern when long and thin walled products are considered. Furthermore, it was shown, that even an apparently stiff mold can exhibit a distinct deformation during filling and packing stage...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the feasibility of}} creating a hybrid polymer-glass achromatic microlens array by compression molding. This affordable and high precision microlens array design has potential applications in the optical industry for its capability of correcting chromatic aberration. In this research a doublet design was investigated. Specifically, polycarbonate and P-SK 57 glass were selected as the equivalents of flint and crown glass for their opposite dispersion properties. Ultraprecision diamond machining was utilized to manufacture the mold with an asymmetric pattern. The optical quality in the mold surface was obtained without post-machining-polishing. Both the glass and polymer microlens arrays were fabricated by thermal compression molding at different forming temperatures. After the glass microlens array was molded, it {{was used as the}} top <b>mold</b> <b>half</b> for polymer compression molding. Two chisel-shaped cavities were fabricated simultaneously when the glass lens ar ray mold was machined. These two cavities were used as fiducial marks for assembling the P-SK 57 glass part and the polycarbonate part during the second molding action. The single uninterrupted operation was developed in this study to create both optical surfaces and the fiducial marks such that high assembly tolerance could be achieved. Furthermore, numerical simulation for compression molding was conducted to study the geometry profile error of the microlens. Finally, the geometry and optical measurements were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid polymer-glass achromatic microlens array...|$|E
50|$|The {{innovative}} use of molds {{around the}} 1st century BC {{allowed for a}} much greater variety of shapes and decorative style, and the skill of the lamp maker was demonstrated {{by the quality of}} the decoration found typically on the flat top of the lamp, or discus, and the outer rim, or shoulder. The production process took several stages. The decorative motifs were created using small individual molds, and were then added as appliqué to a plain archetype of the lamp. The embellished lamp was then used to make two plaster <b>half</b> <b>molds,</b> one lower <b>half</b> and one upper <b>half</b> <b>mold,</b> and multiple copies were then able to be mass-produced. Decorative motifs ranged according to the lamp's function and to popular taste.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{established}} {{operations in}} a garage in Hollywood in January 1927. [...] While Loughead continued his real estate business, he arrived every afternoon to help on the plane. The first major task was to build a concrete mold, shaped like an elongated bath tub, for <b>molding</b> <b>half</b> of the laminated wood fuselage. Two halves were made and then fastened to a skeleton framework of wood to form the fuselage. Next came {{the construction of the}} plywood-covered cantilever wing, the tail surfaces, the landing gear and mounting the engine. When completed, the company had invested nearly $17,500 in the plane, which was named the Vega. [...] The result was a successful high-speed monoplane with a range of 1,000 miles, a cruising speed of 185 miles per hour, and capacity of six people.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effect of baicalin on the {{autophagy}} and Beclin- 1 expression in rats with cerebral ischemia, {{and the role of}} autophagy in the cerebral ischemia injury. Methods: The healthy male SD rats were randomized into the sham operation group, the ischemia model group, baicalin treatment group (100 mg/kg), and 3 MA group (15 mg/kg), with 10 rats in each group. Transient focal cerebral ischemia injury model in rats was induced by occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 180 min. The rats were given the corresponding drugs through the tail veins 30 min before <b>molding.</b> <b>Half</b> of the specimens were used for TTC staining to analyze the cerebral infarction volume. The others were used to determine the expression of Beclin- 1 in the brain tissues by Western-blot. Results: When compared with the ischemia model group, the cerebral infarction volume in 3 MA group was significantly increased, while that in baicalin treatment group was significantly reduced, and the comparison among the groups was statistically significant. When compared with the ischemia model group, Beclin- 1 expression level in baicalin treatment group was significantly elevated, while Beclin- 1 expression level in 3 MA group was significantly higher than that in the sham-operation group but lower than that in the ischemia model group. Conclusions: The autophagy level of brain tissues in normal rats is low. The cerebral ischemia can activate autophagy. The activated autophagy is probably involved in the neuroprotection of cerebral ischemia injury. Application of 3 MA to inhibit the occurrence of autophagy can aggravate the cerebral injury. Baicalin can significantly improve the cerebral ischemia injury and promote the occurrence of autophagy, whose mechanism is probably associated with the up-regulation of Beclin- 1 expression to promote the activation of type III PI 3 K signal transduction pathway...|$|R

The material mixed by the paddle was poured into the mixing machine. The thoroughly mixed material by the mixing machine (clay slurry) was put into the circular plaster mold as a fixed mold. This plaster mold looked like hollow cone (12.0  cm height, inner diameter 15.6  cm at top and 9.6  cm at bottom). The clay slurry was poured into the plaster <b>mold</b> until about <b>half</b> of its volume. The plaster mold of the clay slurry was set under the arm of jigger machine. As the clay slurry came into contact with the vertically rotating head piece, it was pressed and spread until it finally became the shape of plaster mold.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} from sheets of plywood, skinned over wooden ribs.

The two fuselage halves were then nailed and glued over a separately constructed rib framework. With the fuselage constructed in this fashion, the wing spar couldn't cut through the fuselage, so the single spar cantilever wing was mounted atop the aircraft. Only the engine and landing gear remained essentially unstreamlined, and on the production versions the undercarriage had teardrop shaped [...] "spats" [...] covering the wheels, while only the earliest versions lacked NACA cowlings and had the engine cylinders exposed to the airstream. It was powered by the Wright Whirlwind air-cooled radial engine, which delivered 225 horsepower (168kW).|$|R
40|$|Resumo: A carne de frango é um alimento altamente suscetível à oxidação lipídica em função do alto teor de ácidos graxos insaturados na sua composição. A formação de óxidos de colesterol e as alterações na composição de ácidos graxos, e a consequente formação de compostos voláteis provenientes da oxidação lipídica, possuem um papel de destaque dentre os fatores que causam perda de qualidade e das características nutricionais durante o processamento e o armazenamento da carne de frango. A adição de antioxidantes é uma das alternativas utilizadas para minimizar a formação destes compostos indesejados. A otimização dos parâmetros utilizados para extração e saponificação de carne de frango para determinação simultânea de colesterol e óxidos de colesterol foi realizada através de planejamentos experimentais sequenciais, visando obter resultados confiáveis e reprodutíveis, além de minimizar o consumo de reagentes e o tempo de análise. A metodologia foi validada para linearidade, recuperação, repetibilidade e limites de detecção e de quantificação. Amostras de peito de frango cru, frito, cozido e assado em forno comum e elétrico giratório foram analisadas para aplicação da metodologia validada. A formação de hexanal, pentanal e malonaldeído em hambúrgueres de frango cru e grelhado durante o armazenamento a - 18 ºC por 90 dias foi avaliada por microextração em fase sólida (SPME) no headspace, utilizando fibras DVB/CAR/PDMS, e cromatografia gasosa. As condições de extração foram otimizadas para obtenção de resultados reprodutíveis e evitar a saturação da fibra, mesmo para as amostras mais oxidadas. O desempenho de diferentes fibras de DVB/CAR/PDMS foi verificado durante a estocagem e o coeficiente de variação (CV) foi calculado para 60 determinações em duplicata. Não foram observadas diferenças (p 0. 05) were {{observed}} among the RSD of the fibers regardless {{the number of}} times they were used. The raw samples presented significant (p< 0. 05) Pearson correlations between all analysed parameters, varying from 0. 93 to 0. 99; however, for the grilled samples, only the a correlation of 0. 98 hexanal and pentanal was significant. Fifty one Cobb chicken were raised and controled fed specially for the development of this research project. The chicken filets were minced after the remotion of skin and apparent fat tissue, and dried sage, dried garlic and salt were added to the meat. Sixty grams patties were <b>molded</b> and <b>half</b> was grilled at 170 oC, for 4 minutes each side, untill core tempertaure reached 70 oC. Raw and grilled patties were packed in polyethylene bags permeable to oxygen, and stored in the dark at - 18 oC during 90 days. The addition of sage to the chicken meat proved to be an efficient way to minimize and delay lipid and cholesterol oxidation, sage was also able to partially counteract the pro oxidative effects of salt addition. On the other hand, garlic addition presented variable results according to the applied methodology, confirming the controversial results found in literature for garlic action in meat, and suggesting that garlic has no antioxidant effect this matrix. Frozen chicken filets were acquired from industry (Rose Poultry, Denmark). After thawing and removing the connective and adipose tissues, the meat was minced. Dried sage, dried garlic and the mixture of both spices were added to the minced meat and 30 g meat balls were formed, vacuum packed in polyethylene bags, and immediately submmited to high pressure treatment. Sage was able to control lipid oxidation in minced chicken meat submitted to high pressure during subsequent storage at 4 ºC for 2 weeks, while garlic showed pro oxidative effect, which was minimized by the simultaneous addition of sage. From the analysis of the rate of development of lipid oxidation, measured as TBARS, the apparent volume of activation for pressure-induced lipid oxidation was estimated, showing that the pro oxidative effect of garlic and pressure were additive. The mechanisms involved in sage and garlic action on lipid oxidation were studied by the evaluation of pressure effect on free radical formation in a chicken meat model system by electron spin ressonance spectroscopy (ESR), indicating that the high capacity of sage to scavenge free radicals in the lipid phase is the main mecanism behind the protective effect of sag...|$|R
