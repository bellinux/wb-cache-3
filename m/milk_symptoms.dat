Discontinuing the feeding resolved symptoms, but after resuming feeding rectal blood loss reappeared. There were no signs of necrotizing enterocolitis. Suspecting cow's milk allergy, the feeding was changed to a casein-based protein hydrolysate, without effect. Meanwhile, laboratory tests indicated cow's <b>milk</b> allergy. <b>Symptoms</b> only resolved after introducing an amino acid-based formula supporting a definite diagnosis of cow's milk-induced allergic colitis. This is the first description of a premature infant with symptoms of allergic colitis, appearing within hours after birth, suggestive of intrauterine sensitization.

40|$|Salmonella typhimurium {{phage type}} (PT) or {{definitive}} type (DT) 104 is a virulent pathogen for {{humans and animals}}, particularly cattle. It has been isolated increasingly from humans and animals in the United Kingdom and several other European countries and, more recently, in the United States and Canada. Humans may acquire the infection from foods of animal origin contaminated with the infective organism. Farm families are particularly at risk of acquiring the infection by contact with infected animals or by drinking unpasteurized <b>milk.</b> The <b>symptoms</b> in cattle are watery to bloody diarrhea, a drop in milk production, pyrexia, anorexia, dehydration and depression. Infection may result in septicemic salmonellosis and, upon necropsy, a fibrinonecrotic enterocolitis may be observed. The infection occurs more commonly in the calving season than at other times. Feedlot cattle and pigs may also be affected. Prolonged carriage and shedding of the pathogen may occur. Symptoms in humans consist of diarrhea, fever, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and, less frequently, blood in the stool. Salmonella typhimurium DT 104 strains are commonly resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline...|$|R

40|$|A two month old male {{presented}} {{with a history of}} bloody, mucous diarrhoea 6 days after the introduction of cow’s milk formula. Cow’s milk protein allergy was suspected and breast feeding with exclusion of all cow’s milk products from his mother’s diet was suggested. As a consequence the symptoms disappeared. One month later, when his mother tried to give him again cow’s milk formula, diarrhoea with severe rectal bleeding reappeared. A limited colonoscopy was performed suggesting allergic colitis. Despite the exclusion of all cow’s milk products from his mother’s diet combined with the use of an aminoacid containing formula, diarrhoea and rectal bleeding were not improved. At that time a diagnosis of perinatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was made, based on CMV detection in infant’s blood and urine as well as in maternal <b>milk.</b> The <b>symptoms</b> were resolved one week after discontinuation of breast feeding.

Suppletion of vitamins and calcium will be necessary and alternative protein sources have to be used. Many individuals eliminate all dairy products from their diet when they experience discomfort after milk use or when tests to measure lactose digestion have indicated lactose maldigestion. As stated before none of the available test methods has been proved to be reliable enough in accurately determining the amount of lactose that can be digested. Most test results only indicate an “all or nothing” phenomenon, while functional lactase capacity should be quantified.

40|$|This {{investigation}} studied 487 babies for {{symptoms of}} allergic disease {{during their first}} year of life. Because of their positive family histories all the babies are at high risk of becoming allergic. The babies were randomly divided such that cows' milk was deliberately withheld from one group; infants in this group were fed with a soya substitute where required. No benefit resulted from withholding cows' <b>milk,</b> indeed <b>symptoms</b> were more usually associated with this group. Breast feeding, even for a short period, was clearly associated with a lower incidence of wheeze, prolonged colds, diarrhoea, and vomiting. It seemed that the duration of breast feeding was less important than whether or not the child had been breast-fed at all. Wheezing was both more common among boys than girls (P less than. 05) and if the mother was a smoker. Other environmental features related to wheezing were social class, month of birth, lack of breast feeding, exposure to dampness, mould and coal fires, but not to domestic pets nor to the numbers of mites found in bedding and carpets. Mite exposure was, however, associated with prolonged colds. Eczema was the only allergic symptom not positively associated with any environmental factor; moreover, it was neither associated with a lack of breast feeding nor with inclusion of cows' milk in the diet. Eczema was associated with the incidence of positive skin prick tests and IgE antibodies to egg white. IgE and IgG 4 antibodies were estimated at birth (mothers' and cord bloods) and 3 and 12 months later. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

It`s necessary to investigate the decreasing causes of exclusive Breastfeeding. Methods & Materials: This cross-sectional survey was about 320 mothers who had babies within one year old. They`ve gone to consulting centers for lactation in Kerman city. Information gathered by a questionnaire. It consisted of demographic information of mother and child, start time of Breastfeeding, age of starting, type of complementary feeding and usage causes of that before six months. The data's analyzed by SPSS software. Results: The findings showed that just 1. 6 % of babies have had exclusive Breastfeeding until {{end of the first}} 6 months. 60. 3 % of mothers have started complementary feeding for their babies under one month old. Average of Starting age was p= 1. 98 ± 1. 5. The most common type was Formula (99. 7 %). The most important reason for complementary feeding was inadequate milk of mothers (92. 7 %), 72. 1 % was due to doctor`s recommendations. 68. 5 % of mothers believed that child crying was due to their milk insufficiency. There was a statistically significant relation between type of labor and starting age of complementary feeding (P = 0. 016).

40|$|Aim: The main aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} the differences between some Northern countries regarding what foods, according to the patients, elicit hypersensitivity symptoms. Methods: At the participating clinics, patients with a history of food hypersensitivity (n = 1139) were asked to fill in a questionnaire in which 86 different foodstuffs were listed. Skin-prick tests (SPT) were performed with common inhalant allergens. Results: The foods that were reported as eliciting symptoms differed between countries. In Russia, Estonia, and Lithuania; citrus fruits, chocolate, honey, apple, hazelnut, strawberry, fish, tomato, egg, and milk were most often reported as causes of hypersensitivity. In Sweden and Denmark; birch pollen (BP) related foods, such as nuts, apple, pear, kiwi, stone fruits, and carrot were the most common causes. In all countries, children, more often than adults, had symptoms of allergic reaction to citrus fruits, tomato, strawberry, milk, egg, and fish. Most patients (95 %) reported hypersensitivity to several foodstuffs (median: eight foods). The most common symptoms were oral allergy syndrome and urticaria. Severe symptoms were most common with fish, shellfish, nuts, and <b>milk.</b> Slight <b>symptoms</b> were most common with rice, coriander, poppy seed, lingonberry, corn, caraway, red currant, and fig. Earlier well-known correlations, such as that between BP sensitization and some fruits and vegetables, as well as that between mugwort and some spices, were corroborated. Positive correlations were found between self-reported hypersensitivity to crustaceans and SPT with horse. A negative correlation was seen between hypersensitivity to crustaceans and SPT with BP. Conclusions: The foodstuffs that often are reported to cause food hypersensitivity, differ between Sweden/Denmark on one side and the Baltic States and Russia on the other. BP-related foods dominate in Scandinavia, whereas some mugwort-related foods are of more importance in Russia and the Baltic States...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT There is much {{disagreement}} about milk {{and its use}} in feeding programs both in the United States and internationally. A few authors suggest that milk consumption should not be encouraged in lactose intolerant populations due to adverse symptoms.

Data are {{presented in this paper}} that show that 1) the Masai regularly drink considerable quantities of <b>milk</b> without apparent <b>symptoms,</b> 2) <b>milk</b> is an important constituent of the Masai diet, and 3) 62 % of 21 Masai examined were malabsorbers of lactose as measured by the lactose tolerance test.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundFood protein-induced {{enterocolitis}} syndrome (FPIES) is a severe, cell-mediated {{food allergy}} in which digestive {{symptoms such as}} severe vomiting and diarrhea are induced by cow's milk and/or soy protein in infants. Generally, a food-specific IgE is not detected, and FPIES {{may be caused by}} inadvertent exposure to allergenic foods. Case SummaryThe patient in our case was a male infant in whom vomiting had been induced by ingestion of a cow's milk-based formula and bloody diarrhea had been caused by ingestion of breast milk during the neonatal period. Accidental ingestion of a new and extensively hydrolyzed casein/whey formula, MA-mi, caused watery diarrhea at 8 months of age, and FPIES was diagnosed based on these symptoms. In antigen-specific lymphocyte stimulation tests, New MA- 1 was negative, but MA-mi and cow's milk antigens were positive. The only causative antigens were derived from cow's <b>milk,</b> and the <b>symptoms</b> were not induced by another extensively hydrolyzed casein formula, New MA- 1.

A total of 1, 363 patients with atopic dermatitis, urticaria, enterocolitis syndrome, bronchial asthma or allergic rhinitis were recruited. First, we estimated the prevalence of sensitization to soy in children sensitized to cow’s milk. Specific IgE levels> 0. 7 kU/L by CAP assay were considered positive. Next, the prevalence of soy allergy in cow’s milk allergy (CMA) patients was investigated. Those children whose parents agreed to participate the open challenge test with soy had a convincing history of allergic reactions elicited by cow’s <b>milk</b> and these <b>symptoms</b> were relieved by elimination. All of them had negative soy-specific IgE. Patients with positive soy-specific IgE accounted for 18. 3 % of 224 children sensitized to cow’s milk protein.

Ten infants showing GER symptoms and 10 normal babies, all fed with breast-milk substitutes, were enrolled. Clinical symptom scores related to GER were assessed for one week. The Gastric Emptying Time (GET) was determined by means of dynamic echography after feeding with cow's milk-derived formulae and again after a week feeding with eHF in subjects previously showing GER symptoms. All infants with a clinical diagnosis for GER showed an abnormally high average GET in comparison to normal subjects (205 vs 124 min, p = 0. 000). Switching to the eHF led to a significant clinical improvement (p = 0. 0039) especially in babies skin-test and RAST positive to cow's milk, and to a significant decrease toward the normal value of the GET (167 min, p < 0. 001).

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of a lactoferrin formulation isolated from cow’s <b>milk</b> on menstrual <b>symptoms</b> in volunteers. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of the iron-lactoferrin complex (FeLf) was performed in thirty-five healthy Japanese women.

Analysis of twin cases may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of allergy. Though several studies have indicated the importance of a genetic contribution to the expression of allergic diseases based on twin analyses, very few data are available regarding twins with Food Protein-Induced Gastrointestinal Syndrome (FPIGS). Two pairs of identical and fraternal twins with FPIGS are presented. Case SummaryThe twins were born with no abnormalities and fed breast milk and supplemental formula. The identical twins developed vomiting and bloody stool simultaneously. The fraternal twins developed prolonged vomiting and loose stools at different times. Since their symptoms disappeared with when formula feeding was stopped, the symptoms were thought to indicate the presence of an allergy to cow's <b>milk.</b> The clinical <b>symptoms</b> and laboratory findings of the four patients were highly suggestive of FPIGS. The identical and fraternal twins showed very similar symptoms, including their onset and clinical courses. However, a substantial clinical disparity existed in the clinical features of the two pairs of twins.

40|$|Dairy {{farmers with}} stray voltage {{symptoms}} in their cattle often spend {{thousands of dollars}} to do neutral isolation, which isolates the primary neutral of the electricity provider from the farm neutral to suppress stray voltage from off-farm sources without knowing what results to expect. Dairy cows exposed to stray voltage exhibit behavioral <b>symptoms,</b> <b>milking</b> and production characteristics that are detrimental to their ability to produce milk. This study determined the effects of neutral isolation on these three general classifications of stray voltage symptoms in dairy cattle. A survey of sixty-three dairy farms throughout Wisconsin was done to determine what stray voltage symptoms in dairy cattle were eliminated on these dairy farms that have neutral isolation. This study will serve as a resource for dairymen, agriculture i educators, and consultants who deal with the problems and symptoms associated with stray voltage in dairy cattle. To answer the questions of this study, dairy farmers who installed neutral isolation devices to correct the problems associated with stray voltage were sent a mail-back survey. They were asked what common stray voltage symptoms were present on their dairy farms prior to isolation, compared to what symptoms were eliminated by neutral isolation. Questions about type of milking facility, milk production, and cost of isolation were asked. Comments were requested to illicit opinions and comments from participants in the study. The subjects selected for this study were a convenience sample taken from th...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al Food Allergy an Anaphylaxis Meeting celebrado en Nice (Francia) del 7 al 9 de febrero de 2013. [Background]: Milk allergy is {{the most}} common food allergy in infants and young children. Typical <b>milk</b> allergy <b>symptoms</b> involve hives, vomiting, or even anaphylaxis. For cow’s milk, strict {{avoidance}} is difficult because milk proteins are very ubiquitous. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an effective therapeutic option to induce milk oral tolerance. However, the immune mechanisms underlying this treatment have not been fully identified yet. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the clinical and immune responses against several milk allergens of a pediatric population before an OIT protocol with a non-atopic population of the same age range. [Methods]: A group of 9 patients with IgE-mediated milk allergy, confirmed by positive double blind placebo controlled test (DBPCT), was compared with a group of 8 non-atopic people on a milk-containing diet. The mean age of milk-allergic patients was 4. 7 years compared with 6. 0 years in the control group. No significant differences regarding sex or age were found between them. In both groups, PBMCs were isolated from peripheral blood and stimulated during 7 days with β-casein (β-Cn), α-lactalbumin (α-La) and β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg). Culture supernatants were analyzed for IL- 5, IL- 13, IL- 1 β, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL- 10 production by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA). [Results]: During the DBPCT with milk, 6 milk-allergic patients had urticaria, 1 referred digestive symptoms and 1 respiratory symptoms. The mean positive dose in the DBPCT was 15. 4 mL of milk, within a range of 0. 3 - 64 mL. Specific IgE measurements were, on average, 37. 9 kU/L for milk, 40. 1 kU/L for casein, 28. 63 kU/L for α-La and 17. 45 kU/L for β-Lg. CBA analysis revealed a significantly increased production of β-Lg and β-Cn-specific IL- 5 and IL- 13 (P< 0. 05), together with a trend towards lower α-La (P= 0. 09) and β-Lg (P= 0. 06) -stimulated TNF-α, in milk-allergic patients as compared with control children. [Conclusion]: Under the conditions studied, milk-allergic patients showed a significantly enhanced Th 2 cytokine production after stimulation with milk allergens in comparison with non-atopic controls. In addition, a trend towards lower TNF-α production was observed. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that stimulation with both β-Lg and β-Cas shifted the T-cells phenotype to a Th 2 profile, which is well correlated with the clinical response observed during the DBPCT. Studies are underway aiming to establish the role of the evolution of the cytokine profile during an OIT protocol. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE This {{pilot study}} aimed to {{determine}} whether raw milk reduces lactose malabsorption and/or lactose intolerance symptoms relative to pasteurized milk. METHODS We performed a crossover trial involving 16 adults with self-reported lactose intolerance and lactose malabsorption confirmed by hydrogen (H 2) breath testing. Participants underwent 3, 8 -day milk phases (raw vs 2 controls: pasteur-ized, soy) in randomized order separated by 1 -week washout periods. On days 1 and 8 of each phase, milk consumption was 473 mL (16 oz); on days 2 to 7, milk dosage increased daily by 118 mL (4 oz), beginning with 118 mL (4 oz) on day 2 and reaching 710 mL (24 oz) on day 7. Outcomes were area under the breath H 2 curve (AUC ∆H 2) and self-reported symptom severity (visual analog scales: flatulence/gas, audible bowel sounds, abdominal cramping, diarrhea). RESULTS AUC ∆H 2 (mean ± standard error of the mean) was higher for raw vs pasteurized on day 1 (113 ± 21 vs 71 ± 12 ppm·min· 10 - 2, respectively, P =. 01) but not day 8 (72 ± 14 vs 74 ± 15 ppm·min· 10 - 2, respectively, P =. 9). Symptom severities were not different for raw vs pasteurized on day 7 with the highest dosage (P>. 7). AUC ∆H 2 and symptom severities were higher for both dairy milks compared with soy milk. CONCLUSIONS Raw milk failed to reduce lactose malabsorption or lactose intol-erance symptoms compared with pasteurized milk among adults positive for lactose malabsorption. These results do not support widespread anecdotal claims that raw <b>milk</b> reduces the <b>symptoms</b> of lactose intolerance...|$|R
40|$|Background: Genetically {{programmed}} adult-type hypolactasia affects 56 % of Chilean population. Ideally, diagnosis {{should be}} confirmed. Aim: To compare diagnostic yield of genetic test, hydrogen (H 2) expiratory test and a validated symptomatic structured survey (SS). Material and Methods: Patients submitted to H 2 test answered a historic (anamnestic) and current SS (after the ingestion of 25 g of lactose). A blood sample was obtained for determination of genetic polymorphisms C/T_ 13910, C/G_ 13907 and G/A_ 22018 by polymerase chain reaction. The {{gold standard for}} diagnosis of lactose intolerance (LI) was the agreement {{of at least two}} of three tests. Results: Sixty-one participants aged 39 ± 12 years (21 males), were studied. Anamnestic SS was diagnostic of LI in all cases (score > 7), while current SS detected LI in 27 / 61 (46 %). H 2 test (an increase > 15 ppm after ingestion of 25 g of lactose) showed LI in 31 / 61 (51 %). The locus C/G_ 13907 showed no polymorphism and locus G/A_ 22018 was in complete linkage disequilibrium with C/T_ 13910. Genotype C/C_ 13910, associated to hypolactasia, was present in 30 / 58 (52 %). According to the gold-standard, 32 / 61 (52. 5 %) patients were diagnosed as LI. Sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 79 % and 69 % for current SS, 93 % and 93 % for H 2 test and 97 % and 93 % for the genetic test. The last two showed a positive likelihood ratio (LR) > 10 and a negative LR < 0. 1, figures within the range considered clinically useful. Conclusions: Genotype C/C_ 13910 is responsible for hypolactasia in this population. Anamnestic report of <b>symptoms</b> after <b>milk</b> ingestion and <b>symptoms</b> after lactose ingestion, are not accurate enough. H 2 and genetic tests are simple and similarly accurate to diagnose lactose intolerance in adults...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn November 2012, a {{dairy farmer}} in the {{district}} Kleve first observed a reduction in <b>milk</b> yield, respiratory <b>symptoms,</b> nasal discharge, fever, sporadic diarrhoea and sudden deaths in dairy cows and calves. In the following months, further farms were found infected with cattle showing similar clinical signs. An epidemiological investigation was carried out to identify the source of infection, the date of introduction, potential transmission pathways and to analyse {{the extent of the}} epidemic. Furthermore, laboratory analyses were conducted to characterise the causative agent. BVDV had been diagnosed in the index herd in December 2012, but due to the atypical clinical picture, the virus was not immediately recognised as the causative agent. Further laboratory analysis showed that this outbreak and subsequent infections in the area were caused by a BVD type 2 c virus with a characteristic genome insertion, which seems {{to be associated with the}} occurrence of severe clinical symptoms in infected cattle. Epidemiological investigations showed that the probable date of introduction was in mid-October 2012. The high risk period was estimated as three months. A total of 21 affected farms with 5325 cattle were identified in two German Federal States. The virus was mainly transmitted by person contacts, but also by cattle trade and vehicles. The case-fatality rate was up to 60 % and mortality in outbreak farms varied between 2. 3 and 29. 5 %. The competent veterinary authorities imposed trade restrictions on affected farms. All persons who had been in contact with affected animals were advised to increase biosecurity measures (e. g. using farm-owned or disposable protective clothing). In some farms, affected animals were vaccinated against BVD to reduce clinical signs as an “emergency measure”. These measures stopped the further spread of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} gastrointestinal pathology in {{computed tomography}} (CT) scan, optimum distention, mural visualization and gastrointestinal tract discrimination are necessary. High attenuation oral contrast {{material in the}} form of iodine solution has drawbacks in mural visualization and tolerance. Milk {{can be used as a}} low attenuation CT oral contrast agent in gastrointestinal tract discrimination and mural visualization with better tolerance. Objective: The purpose of our study was to compare the effectiveness, cost, and tolerance of milk and iopamiro (iodinated positive contrast medium) in patients undergoing abdominal CT with oral and IV contrast media. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and twelve patients were purposively assigned to receive either whole milk (n = 110) or iopamiro (n = 100). Results were independently reviewed by radiologists. Degree of bowel distention, mural visualization and gastrointestinal tract discrimination were qualitatively scored on a 4 - point scale. A questionnaire regarding oral contrast tolerability was provided to each patient. Cost comparison of the two agents was performed. Results: No statistically significant differences were seen between whole milk and iopamiro with respect to degree of bowel distention and gastrointestinal tract discrimination for all segments of bowel studied (p > 0. 05). Mural visualization is better with whole milk compared with iopamiro (p < 0. 05). Significantly more patients ranked milk as pleasant in taste compared with iopamiro (p < 0. 05). Milk was better tolerated than iopamiro, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, including abdominal discomfort (p = 0. 065), cramping (p = 0. 309), nausea (p = 0. 001), vomiting (p = 0. 003) and diarrhea (p = 0. 347). The cost per patient for iopamiro is 900 BDT compared with 60 BDT for milk. Conclusion: Whole milk is comparable to iopamiro with respect to bowel distention and gastrointestinal tract discrimination and better in bowel wall visualization and has better patient acceptance, and fewer adverse <b>symptoms.</b> <b>Milk</b> is a costeffective alternative to iopamiro as a low-attenuation CT oral contrast agent...|$|R
40|$|In {{developed}} countries 3 % of infants exhibit cow’s milk allergy (CMA). Although most infants outgrow CMA, immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated CMA may predispose {{for development of}} other allergies and asthma later in life. Clinical symptoms may involve the skin, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract, and can even lead to a systemic anaphylactic reaction. Both whey and casein allergic mice exhibited systemic acute allergic symptoms as reflected {{by an increase in}} ear swelling upon intradermal challenge. However striking differences were observed between the sensitizing capacities of whey and casein. Whey sensitized mice revealed enhanced serum levels of whey- specific IgE, the classical allergic marker whereas casein sensitized mice had allergic symptoms in the absence of casein-specific IgE. However, immunoglobulin free light chain (Ig-fLC) antagonist (F 991) abrogated the development of allergic symptoms in the casein sensitized mice only. The relevance for Ig-fLC in human allergic disease was confirmed in infants at risk for allergy. Serum Ig-fLC concentrations were enhanced in infants that had developed atopic dermatitis (AD). In order to investigate the preventive effect of dietary short-chain galacto-(scGOS) and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (lcFOS) and/or Bifidobacterium breve M- 16 V mice were fed the diets during oral whey sensitization. The scGOS/lcFOS (ratio 9 : 1) mixture (Immunofortis) contains non-digestible carbohydrates that selectively stimulate the growth of bacteria which supports host health. These prebiotics mimick non-digestible carbohydrates such as present in breast milk. The synbiotic mixture containing both the prebiotics and Bifidobacterium breve M- 16 V was most effective in diminishing the acute allergic skin and anaphylactic response upon allergen challenge hence protecting against development of CMA symptoms. In order to examine the contribution of regulatory T-cells (Treg) in the protective effect of prebiotics, in vivo Treg depletion and adoptive transfer studies were performed. In these studies pectin-derived acidic-oligosaccharides (pAOS) were added to the scGOS/lcFOS mixture. The in vivo depletion studies revealed CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + Treg to {{play a crucial role in}} the preventive effects of the scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS. In the adoptive transfer studies it was shown that protection against allergic symptoms generated by the diet could be transferred using spleen cells. Depletion of Treg-cells abrogated this. Furthermore these results showed that the protective effect of the prebiotic diet was antigen specific. Another potentially important regulatory cell type in allergy is the invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) -cell. Stimulation with ?-galactosylceramide (?GalCer), a specific iNKT-cell agonist, almost completely depleted the iNKT-cells from the liver and worsened the acute allergic skin response, which was most pronounced in whey sensitized mice. Hence, these data suggested iNKT-cells to have immunomodulatory capacities, in particular relevant in mice orally sensitized with whey. In conclusion, induction of cow’s milk allergy in mice via oral sensitization revealed IgE dependent allergic symptoms in whey sensitized mice while casein allergic symptoms were caused by immunoglobulin free light chain. Dietary intervention studies with in particular synbiotics, combining both specific non-digestible carbohydrates and Bifidobacterium breve M- 16 V most effectively prevented the occurrence of cow’s <b>milk</b> allergic <b>symptoms</b> in mice. The induction of allergen specific regulatory T-cells was involved in the mechanism underlying the protective effect of prebiotics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The role {{of breast}} milk on {{the risk of}} {{childhood}} asthma is in dispute. The aim of this prospective study {{is to determine the}} relationship of immune markers in maternal serum during gestation and breast <b>milk</b> to asthma-like <b>symptoms</b> (AS) in infancy. Methods Pregnant women were recruited in Columbia and Charleston, South Carolina. Blood (median: three weeks before delivery) and breast milk (three weeks after delivery) samples were collected. Concentrations of interferon (IFN) -γ, IFN gamma-induced protein 10 (IP- 10 or CXCL 10), CCL 11, interleukin (IL) 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, CXCL 8, IL- 10, IL- 12 (p 70), IL- 13, transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1, and immunoglobulin (Ig) A in both maternal serum and milk whey were determined via immunoassays. Asthma-like symptoms (AS) of the infant were ascertained at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Generalized estimating equations assessed relative risks (RRs) of immune markers for repeated measurements of AS, considering intra-individual correlations and adjusting for confounders. To provide comparable risk estimates, quartiles of the immune markers were used, except for IL- 5 in whey and IgA in serum, which were dichotomized. Results Of 178 women, 161 provided blood and 115 breast milk samples. IL- 12 (p 70), IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 1 β, and CCL 11 in serum and in whey were not further considered for the statistical analyses since the proportion of non-detectable values was high. Most immune markers in serum and milk whey were moderately or highly correlated; however, IgA was negatively correlated. Infants in the highest quartile of IL- 13 in both serum and whey were at a higher risk of AS (RR = 3. 02 and 4. 18; respectively) compared to infants in the first quartile. High levels of IL- 5 in serum and whey was also identified as a risk. In addition, increased secretory IgA and TGF-β 1 in breast milk reduced the risks of AS. Conclusions Maternal serum and whey levels of IL- 5 and IL- 13 are risk markers for AS; whey IgA and TGF-β 1 seem to be protective. Only focusing on breast milk portend that milk cytokines IL- 5 and IL- 13 have adverse effects. However, similar immune exposures during late gestation and via milk suggest that both may enhance AS among infants. </p...|$|R
