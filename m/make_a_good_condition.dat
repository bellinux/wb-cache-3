Based on empirical studies, {{there is a need to}} analyze non performing loan determinants comprehensively using macroeconomic and bank-specific factors to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition</b> on bank, because combining macroeconomic and bank-specific variable as NPL determinants has made a big improvement to analyze NPL. The object of present study is 20 Banks listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) between q 12005 -q 42014. Using dynamic panel data GMM-system method shows that the previous period of NPL (non performing loan), change of PDB (Gross Domestic Product) and inflation rate have a significantly negative impact on NPL. However, BOPO (Operations Expenses to Operations Income) and ROE (Return on Equity) has a significantly positve relationship to NPL. On the other hand, this research does not find any significance on BI rate (interest rate), solvency ratio, and size to NPL. From the result, it can be concluded that combining macroeconomic and bank-specific variable could be an alternative method to analyze NPL determinants on bank...|$|E

Whereas, before that government regulation is legislated, merger {{restraint system}} in Indonesia was regulated by Commission for the Supervision of Business Competition Regulation Number 1 year 2009 which use pre-merger notification system. The problem will be researched are how {{is the impact of}} that Government Regulation toward the merger notification of business; which regulation give law certainty so must be used in merger of business. This research use normative law research method which focus on law norm, examine literature and interview. The conclusion of this research is Government Regulation Number 57 year 2010 can’t gives a law certainty toward merger activity, because merger who had declared legally, had been implemented and had {{spent a lot of money}} is deemed illegal after investigated by KPPU (Commission for the Supervision of Business Competition). From the law certainty, KPPU Regulation gives more certainty of law.

40|$|Recently it is {{said that}} the number of {{children}} who don't like to study Science increases in elementary school and junior high school. I have investigated using a questionnaire to find out what topics of Science children want to or hate to study, and how to change their favorite topics to advance their year of school. As the result, some new findings are as follows. The rate of children who prefer very much or just prefer Science is very high in the middle grade of elementary school. Many children think that Science is their most favorite subject. Children in third grade on the average like all fields of Science or prefer topics of air and water. Children in fourth grade prefer the work of electricity and light. Children's interests in Science gradually decrease in higher grades of elementary school. They begin to prefer biological topics compared to physical, chemical and Earth Science topics. Children in junior high school become not interested in Science and they begin to hate even having a Science class. They begin to hate toics of force, pressure, buoyance, electric current, change of materials and earth. Children's favorite subjects change from physics, chemistry and Earth Science topics to biological topics relative to the change from third grade of elementary school to the third year of junior high school. Reasons for this change are as follows. The reduction of topics connected with daily scientific experience, the increase of topics that the children simply have to remember, the topics become difficult to understand and it takes complicated calculation and logical thinking. A consideration of teachers for the children, as a secondary factor, is also very important to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> educational <b>condition</b> for children in class. 近年、小学校、中学校では理科嫌いの児童や生徒が増加していると言われている。児童や生徒が理科の授業でどんな学習内容を好んだり嫌いと感じているか、またそれが学年進行と共にどのように移り変わっていくかをアンケート調査をもとに調べた。この結果、次のことが明かになった。小学校の中学年では、理科の学習内容を大好きまたは好きと回答する者の割合は非常に高く、多くの児童や生徒が理科を大好きな科目の一つと考えている。内容的には小学校 3 年生（小 3 ）では授業で扱うどの内容にも好き嫌いに大きな差は見られないが、空気や水の内容、小 4 では電気や光のはたらきの内容に興味を示した。小学校高学年になると共に理科に対する興味はだんだんと減少してくる。内容的には物理、化学、地学的内容よりも生物的内容に興味を示す傾向が見られる。中学校では、さらに一段と理科に対する興味は稀薄となり嫌いとする者が増加する。内容的には物理、化学、地学領域の力、圧力、浮力、電流、物質の変化、大地の内容を嫌いとする者が増える。小 3 から中 3 への学年進行にしたがい、好きとする内容が物理、化学、地学的内容から生物的内容に移り変わってくる。このような変化の理由は、日常的な直接的経験に結びつく内容が減少すること、学習内容が多くなり単純に覚えることが増加すること、内容が複雑となり複雑な計算をする必要があったり理論的に思考する必要が生じることがあげられる。また、好き嫌いを左右する二次的要因として教師の子供に対する配慮に起因する場合もある...|$|R

Waste problem such as {{infrastructures}} capacity which can???t fulfill all of the waste, transporting problem, modes of transportation until transport regularity. Based on this condition, there are some question to be answered. For example, what is the component Level Of Service of waste, how about the condition of waste in planning area, until do the services in that area showing good act or not based on Level Of Service? Methods that using to collect data is by observation or directly view to the location and also do interview. Directly viewed do with met with all of head of RW in Kel. Maccini, Makassar. Then, Interview method do with give some questions to the people which are near with the theme. People who met are head of each RW in Kel, Maccini, Makassar, until Head of Wasting & Gardening Department of Makassar. By the past methods, produce primary data and secondary data. Primary data such as citizens data dan the condition of the waste in that area, and the secondary data is the result of interview with all of the people. The result of directly view and observation showing that the waste services in that area is still so far from the general. Recommendation that giving are to makes better waste services based on people environment. In this case, it have to make easy the next act in TPS/TPA until give profit to the people itself.

40|$|Background and Aims: This {{research}} {{was done in}} purpose of workplace's hazards risk reduction(work accident frequency and severity) in Petrokaran Company, one of the Arak Petr, ChimicalCompany's contractor. Because {{of the existence of}} many units, large number of workers how workat risk, and extent of units, after precision assessment the unit of Building and Facility wasadmitted as the field of this research. The reasons were: 1 - The ratio of injuried worker per all worker in each unit was more in this unit than the others unit; 2 -In this unit worker worked and in the morning shift, so it was more easier monitor their behavior 3 - This unit just have one manager, and it had not a complex organizational system. Therefore it was easier to communicate with that manager. Method: At first the relationship between accident and personal, job, and environmental factorswas assesscal by x 2. The results illustrate that accident had significant relationship with personalfactor (age and studies level), environmental factory (month, day & hour) and job factor(employment type and job) (x = 1 %). As the accident scenario analyses showed that worker behavior had man role in these accidents,operating and support. Hazard analysis method was used to hazard identification and evaluation,and giving control approach. Results:When types of accidents in this unit determined, the second step of research, interventionwas done with purpose of accidents severity and frequency reduction. Intervention methodfocused on unsafe condition correction and human errors reduction. Intervention consist offourmain strategy: 1 - Education, 2 - Workers behavior continue monitoring, 3 - <b>Make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition</b> for involveworkers in safety matters, 4 - Unsafe condition correction.

40|$|Nowadays English {{has a very}} {{important}} role because it is particularly used in almost all of the countries as a native and international language. Based on the fact above, it becomes one foreign language, which has to be mastered by all people in the world. That is why English has to be taught in all levels of education. The widespread need for English as a second or foreign language needs a considerable pressure on the educational resources of many countries. Teaching and learning English in Junior High School has its scope including competence to comprehend and to produce spoken and written texts through four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing; competence to comprehend and to create many short functional texts and monolog also essay in the form of procedure, description, recount, narrative, and report. For this reason the teacher must have various methods in teaching genre to make the students more interested in teaching learning process. Reading, one of the language skills, should be mastered well by the students because reading is an essential factor that influences one’s activity in communication. Reading is a part of daily life for those who live in literate communities. People consider reading as an important activity, so that people usually say that reading is the way to open the world. Reading is interesting activity, because by reading, people can get some information widely without going anywhere. Teaching English is not easy because it requires motivation and creativity in order to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition</b> and achievement of English Learning and teaching goal. Students in Junior High School still find many difficulties in reading. For example, when the students read a text, they can not comprehend that text because the text is very long. For that reason, the students need an interesting technique to improve their reading comprehension. Aebersold and Field (1997 : 15) define that reading is something which people look at the text and assign to the written symbols in that text; in other words, we assume that reading activity is people’s activity to read a text; there is interaction between the reader and the text when people read that text. Wallace (1992 : 3) states that reading in a first or any other language, is an awareness {{of the way in which}} we use language. It means that reading is above all to do with language. commit to user It can be concluded that reading is a process of reacting and understand a written text as a piece of communication. Reading does not necessarily need to look everything in a given piece of text. It is important to comprehend genre in order to catch the information and message in written text. Text comprehension is related to reading skill, as reading is one of the important skills in order to communicate using English to fulfill daily needs such as reading newspaper, instruction, rule, book, advertisement, magazine etc. Reading is not the activity to read aloud but to comprehend the message and information in the text.

Additionally, offers the possibility of protonation, hydrogen bond formation, and chelation through the nitrogen atoms. Phthalazine derivatives have applications as therapeutic agents, chemiluminescent materials, ligands in transition metal catalysis, and as optical materials. Some time ago, our research group developed a methodology for the preparation of phthalazine derivatives in three steps, affording halo-thienyl-phthalazine derivatives that {{play an important role}} in diazine chemistry since they offer great potential for further functionalization by nucleophilic displacement of the halogen, making numerous otherwise inaccessible diazines become available. In continuation of the work developed before by our research group, we report in this communication the synthesis and the evaluation of the optical properties of two novel thienyl-phthalazine derivatives, having in mind further functionalization to prepare push-pull heterocyclic systems for several optical and photovoltaic applications. These studies showed that the optical properties could be readily tuned by varying the π-conjugation path length through the introduction of a second thiophene unit.
