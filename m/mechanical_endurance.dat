40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{simulate}} acrylic bone cement damage accumulation around implants. The method combines the finite element method (FEM) with the theory of continuum damage mechanics (CDM). Damage was considered a tensorial variable, resulting in anisotropic material behavior when the material was damaged. The method was applied to an axi-symmetric structure, consisting of a taper pushed in a cement mantle. Varying the taper/cement interface conditions revealed that these had considerable effects on the damage process. Not only the <b>mechanical</b> <b>endurance</b> of the structure changed, but also {{the way in which}} damage progressed was affected. Two mesh densities were considered, to study the effects of mesh refinement. It was concluded that, although further research is required to obtain more realistic survival times, the method can be used on a comparative, qualitative basis.

Four wheel configurations were fabricated (one open wheel and three closed wheel) (and subjected to a series of soft soil, <b>mechanical,</b> and <b>endurance</b> tests. Results show that the open wheel has lower draw-bar pull (slope climbing) capability in loose soil due to its higher ground pressure and tendency to dig in at high wheel slip.

There is, however, a 1. 0 to 1. 8 lb/wheel weight penalty associated with the wheel enclosure. Also the button cleats used as grousers for the closed-type wheels result in local stress concentration and early fatigue failure of the wire mesh. Load deflection tests indicate that the stiffness of the covered wheel increased by up to 50 % after soil bin testing, due to increased friction between the fabric and the wire mesh caused by the sand.

40|$|Aims: It {{has been}} shown that {{increased}} contractile activity results in heat shock protein 72 (HSP 72) accumulation in various skeletal muscles. By contrast, there is no consensus for muscle HSP 72 response to muscle disuse for short duration (5 - 8 days). On the basis of a greater constitutive HSP 72 expression in slow-twitch muscles we tested the hypothesis that mechanical unloading for a longer period (2 weeks) would affect this phenotype to a greater extent. Secondly, we evaluated the effects of a physiological muscle heat shock protein (HSP) enhancer (endurance training) on HSP response to unloading and muscle remodelling. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were assigned randomly to four groups: (1) sedentary weight-bearing; (2) hindlimb-unloaded (HU) via tail suspension for 2 week; (3) trained on a treadmill (6 week) and (4) trained 6 week and then HU for 2 week. Results: Unloading resulted in a preferential atrophy of slow muscles [soleus (SOL), adductor longus (AL) ] and a slow-to-fast fibre transition with no change in HSP 72 level. HSP 72 levels were significantly lower in fast muscles [extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and plantaris (PLA) ], and did not change with <b>mechanical</b> unloading. <b>Endurance</b> training was accompanied by a small (SOL) or a large (EDL, PLA) increase in HSP 72 level with no change in AL.

Conclusion: The results {{of this study indicate that}} (1) after 2 weeks of unloading no change occurred in HSP 72 protein levels of slow-twitch muscles despite a slow-to-fast fibre transition; and (2) the training-induced increase of HSP 72 content in skeletal muscles did not attenuate fibre transitio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the development and characterized the physicochemical properties of films obtained from by-products (BP) from the preparation of propolis extracts. Films were produced in the presence and absence of a polymeric adjuvant (gelatin or ethylcellulose) and propylene glycol by a solvent casting method.

The films were a transparent, light greenishyellow colour, with a uniform surface, and were flexible and easy to handle. The thickness and density of the preparations indicated that the compounds were homogeneously dispersed throughout the film. Mechanical properties were influenced by the film composition; films containing gelatin were more resistant to stress, while those containing ethylcellulose were more flexible. Increasing the adjuvant concentration decreased the elasticity and the rupture resistance, but increased the moisture uptake capacity and WVP of the formulations.

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of the porose {{areas and}} their accessory glands {{was investigated in}} Haermphysaliis longicornis. The porose areas symmetrically located on the dorsal surface of the basis capituli are openings of their accessory glands. The cuticle of the basis capituli is penetrated by the duct, the mid-region of which has a valve-like structure. In the unfed stage the duct cells, secretory cells and sheath cells are present just below the cuticle. As feeding proceeds, duct cells and external sheath cells extend very long and their distal end reach the anterior idiosomal cavity. Abundant microtubules traversing the cytoplasm of duct cells and sheath cells may have a <b>mechanical</b> role maintaining <b>endurance</b> of the cells during extreme extension. Secretory cells hypertrophy during feeding and become a simple branched acinar gland consisting of 6 - 8 acini at the distal end of duct cells during oviposition. Rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complexes, secretory granules undergoing exocytosis suggest that secretory cells have a protein-synthesis ability. Secretions discharged into the secretory canaliculi are released into the duct lumen and out from the pore of the porose areas.

Multi-axial {{mechanical}} testing with servo-hydraulic cylinders is used {{as essential}} tool within the development and manufacturing process of mechanical components and structures, enabling the experimental validation of the fatigue behavior and related <b>mechanical</b> <b>endurance</b> limits. In this paper we derive the analytical model of servo-hydraulic cylinders feasible for fatigue tests to enable the incorporation of the derived actuator dynamics within multi-axis test control strategies.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the mechanical and geometric properties as well as bone tissue and mineral density of long bones in mink dams exposed to deoxynivalenol (DON) since one day after mating, throughout gestation (ca. 46 d) and lactation to pelt harvesting. Material and Methods: Thirty clinically healthy multiparous minks (Neovison vison) of the standard dark brown type were used. After the mating, the minks were randomly assigned into two equal groups: nontreated control group and DON group fed wheat contaminated naturally with DON at a concentration of 1. 1 mg·kg- 1 of feed. Results: The final body weight and weight and length of the femur did not differ between the groups. However, DON contamination decreased <b>mechanical</b> <b>endurance</b> of the femur. Furthermore, DON reduced the mean relative wall thickness and vertical wall thickness of the femur, while vertical cortical index, midshaft volume, and cross-sectional moment of inertia increased. Finally, DON contamination did not alter bone tissue density, bone mineral density, or bone mineral content, but decreased the values of all investigated structural and material properties. Conclusion: DON at applied concentration probably intensified the process of endosteal resorption, which was the main reason for bone wall thinning and the weakening of the whole bone...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the cyclic {{performance}} of two different Ni-Ti endodontic rotary files made from different alloys under bending using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). When experimentation is not available, this is not a trivial task and most papers on the subject rely on static analysis only. Two Ni-Ti rotary instruments are selected, ProFile GT and a GT Series X (GTX). The latter file is made from M-Wire, which has been thermo-mechanically processed to have larger flexibility, according to its manufacturer. The mechanical response was studied by considering different scenarios in the FEA package, in which the material properties were introduced according to existing literature. The method and results are presented and discussed so that this paper can be used as a guideline for future works. Although not fully reflective of the instrument???s behavior in a dynamic rotation intra-canal system, the models used constitute a good approximation when a comparison between two instruments is at stake. It is shown that the GTX file has a lower risk of fatigue fracture during its clinical use when compared to the GT file, especially when the root canal makes the file deform into an extreme geometry. However, if the root canal does not make the file deform more than a certain amount, the GT file is equally good from the point of view of <b>mechanical</b> <b>endurance...</b>|$|E

Mechanical properties analyzed included tensile strength and modulus of elasticity. GFRP rods with vinylester matrix and GFRP rods with a polyester matrix were tested in ten-sion and compared. The # 4, # 5 and # 6 vinylester bars showed ultimate strength capacities of 70 ksi, 70 ksi, and 96 ksi and moduli ofelasticity of 4. 9, 5. 3, and 6 million psi, respectively, based on cross-sectional areas assumed for steel rebars of the same size number. The ulti-mate strength ofpolyester rods average 85 ksi for the # 4 sizes, 70 ksi for the # 5 sizes, and 96 ksi for the # 6 sizes; all calculated based on equivalent steel area.

40|$|As a {{solution}} of high efficiency and clean energy, fuel cell technologies, especially proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), have caught extensive attention. However, after decades of development, the performances of PEMFCs are far from achieving the target from the Department of Energy (DOE). Thus, further understanding of the degradation mechanism is needed to overcome this obstacle. Due {{to the importance of}} proton exchange membrane in a PEMFC, the degradation of the membrane, such as hygrothermal aging effect on its properties, are particularly necessary.

40|$|The {{effects of}} dietary β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation during {{gestation}} on bone, growth plate, and articular cartilage in newborns were determined. Thermal analysis of articular cartilage {{was performed to}} examine the structural changes in collagen.

Maternal HMB supplementation enhanced body weight, bone length, and diameter in males. It also improved geometric and mechanical properties contributing to increased bone morphology and endurance. In turn, alteration of the length was only observed in females. The positive effects were mediated by increased serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor- 1 and leptin. HMB-treatment enhanced the concentration of FSH, LH, estradiol, and testosterone. Serum TAP was enhanced by the HMB-treatment by 34 % in females and 138 % in males. Beneficial effects of the HMB-treatment on trabecular bone and content of proteoglycans in articular cartilage were shown. The HMB-treatment significantly changed the collagen structure in cartilages, especially in the females, which was demonstrated by the PSR analysis. Differences between the HMB-supplemented and the control females in the calorimetric peak temperatures were presumably related to different collagen fibril density in the articular cartilage structure. In summary, maternal HMB supplementation in the mid-gestation period significantly improved general growth and <b>mechanical</b> <b>endurance</b> of long bones by the influence on the somatotropic and pituitary-gonadal axes in the offspring...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{wearable}} robotic exoskeleton needs to consider the interaction, either physical or cognitive, between the human user and the robotic device. This paper presents a method to analyse {{the interaction between the}} human user and a unilateral, wearable lower-limb exoskeleton. The lower-limb exoskeleton function was to compensate for muscle weakness around the knee joint. It is shown that the cognitive interaction is bidirectional; on the one hand, the robot gathered information from the sensors in order to detect human actions, such as the gait phases, but the subjects also modified their gait patterns to obtain the desired responses from the exoskeleton. The results of the two-phase evaluation of learning with healthy subjects and experiments with a patient case are presented, regarding the analysis of the interaction, assessed in terms of kinematics, kinetics and/or muscle recruitment. Human-driven response of the exoskeleton after training revealed the improvements {{in the use of the}} device, while particular modifications of motion patterns were observed in healthy subjects. Also, <b>endurance</b> (<b>mechanical)</b> tests provided criteria to perform experiments with one post-polio patient. The results with the post-polio patient demonstrate the feasibility of providing gait compensation by means of the presented wearable exoskeleton, designed with a testing procedure that involves the human users to assess the human-robot interaction...|$|R
40|$|Masteroppgave - Norges idrettshøgskole, 2014 Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of 12 weeks of concomitant resistance training and endurance on patella tendon (PT) <b>mechanical</b> properties in <b>endurance</b> trained women. We also wanted to investigate if any potential findings would affect running performance and economy. Methods: 17 female endurance recreational athletes were randomly assigned into two groups. Resistance + endurance training group (RT+END) (n= 9) and endurance group (END) (n= 8). The RT+END group performed 2 sessions of resistance training per week in addition to their regular endurance training regimen. The END group maintained their regular endurance training regimen. vastus lateralis muscle thickness and patella tendon force, elongation length and cross-sectional area (CSA) was assessed by the use of ultrasound. Isometric knee extension peak torque and squat 1 RM as well as VO 2 max and distance covered in 40 and 5 minutes of running was tested. The above variables were used to calculate PT stiffness, strain, Young’s modulus and running economy. All the subjects were tested at baseline and < 7 days after the end of the intervention. Results: The present study revealed an increase in PT CSA (+ 4, 8 ± 2, 3 % p=< 0, 01) and squat 1 RM (45 % ± 23 % p=< 0, 01) as a result of 12 weeks of concomitant resistance and endurance training. No changes in Isometric knee extension peak torque, vastus lateralis muscle thickness, PT mechanical properties, running performance or economy was found. Conclusion: In conclusion, PT stiffness did not change as a result of concomitant resistance and endurance training in endurance trained women. Furthermore, resistance training does not seem to be sufficient stimuli to improve running performance and economy via adaptations in PT mechanical properties.
