5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the <b>mental</b> <b>anguish</b> and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} that Hogeboom had murdered Fontaine and kidnapped Elsa, Phelps and Kelso pursue {{him into the}} Los Angeles River Tunnels as a heavy rain begins, fighting their way through corrupt policemen and thugs. The pair rescue Elsa, with Kelso killing Hogeboom to put {{him out of his}} <b>mental</b> <b>anguish.</b> With the water level rising, the group use an open manhole to escape, but Phelps is swept away in the current. Whilst the SRF scam is exposed, several members escape justice by making a deal with the Assistant D.A. to testify. They attend Phelps's funeral, each delivering eulogies to his memory, much to the disgust of Elsa. Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend, to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps' enemy.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the <b>mental</b> <b>anguish</b> of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
50|$|A suicidal, pot-smoking {{photographer}} with schizophrenic episodes, a sex addicted {{plastic surgeon}} {{with a bad}} conscience, and a secretive financier with legal trouble. These three childhood friends come together to relate common memories, future ambitions and share their deepest secrets. Searching for the Elephant is a raw, innovative film that portrays the decadent lives of the successful metropolitan in a cynical world. Materialistic dreams and <b>mental</b> <b>anguishes</b> collide as {{the lives of the}} three confused friends, and the women surrounding them, spirals out of control. The film is a stylistic psychological study, with its gritty story portrayed with creative images, disjointed cuts and a slick, stylistic camera work and aesthetics. Creating a beautiful contrast to the dark, disturbing story unfolding.|$|R

5|$|A lead {{scientist}} for a pharmaceutical company is {{killed by a}} blue powder that turns his bones into dust. The Fringe division traces {{the source of the}} package which contained the powder to a former Marine; when they search his home, Peter (Joshua Jackson) finds the man nearby and gives chase, but the man is hit by a car and knocked into a coma. Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears that there may be others involved in targeted attacks. Walter (John Noble) suggests they read the man's mind to learn of any such plot using the ability of one of his undocumented nootropic Cortexiphan patients, Simon Phillips, (Omid Abtahi). Simon, who is unable to control his telepathic abilities, has isolated himself from the general population for two decades, but finds some comfort in not being able to read the mind of Olivia (Anna Torv)—a fellow Cortexiphan patient. Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the <b>mental</b> <b>anguish</b> he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, wondering if he still feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe. Meanwhile, three military contractors are killed by the release of the compound in an elevator, confirming Broyles' fears.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Goldstein and Travis Barker began collaborating {{under the}} name TRV$DJAM. They {{performed}} at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards on September 7, 2008. On September 19, after performing at a college event, he and Barker were aboard a Learjet 60 when it crashed upon takeoff in Columbia, South Carolina. The crash killed both crew members {{and the other two}} passengers, a security guard and Barker's assistant, critically injuring Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein suffered third-degree burns to his arm and parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. Moore flew to be by Goldstein's side in hospital, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's charter company, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence {{on the part of the}} pilots, and a manufacturing defect on part of the plane. He asked for damages for pain and suffering, <b>mental</b> <b>anguish,</b> disfigurement and loss of earnings. The lawsuit was settled by his estate in 2010, a year after his death.|$|E

40|$|Mental {{health is}} a common human topic that we all face at every step of our life. Yet there are still {{individuals}} who endure anguish, who are locked up in psychiatric institutions, which – apart from the negative influences of the hospitalisation itself – brings an irrefutable stigma that hinders these individuals in living a higher quality of life. The diploma thesis at hand deals with the mental health topic, presents the cultural attribution of the aspect on »mental illnesses« {{as well as the}} role of hospitalisation in lives of the users. The thesis sets out the scopes of a medical model which is being complemented and surpassed by the psychosocial model in the segments of help to individuals with mental health problems on different life areas. The research part presents a life story of a person with history of <b>mental</b> <b>anguishes</b> and hospitalisations as well as the analysis of perception of a relationship which forms in the process of research between the author in the role of a volunteer and the person mentioned above. The findings have a value of insight into the experiences of two individuals in an unrepeatable context of a specific lifetime. ...|$|R

Jean Laurent brought 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to him by Reynaud.

25|$|Given the {{emphasis}} placed on the necessity of all buddy divers to be fully able to aid their buddy {{in case of an}} emergency, over the last decade there have been some agency-approved diving practices established where certain types of buddies do not actually meet this criteria. This is evident in the practice of scuba diving for children. Initiated by PADI, in an effort to expand scuba diving into the realm of becoming a “family activity” like skiing, the certification of children has been adopted by most other recreational diving agencies with their own diving programmes for children. These typically include two levels, depending of the child's age. PADI has six courses/levels for children, in which a child from the age of 10 can become a buddy diver in open water situations. The other buddy in this team can be a certified parent or a dive professional. Serious concerns have been expressed about this general policy of having child buddies, among the concerns is the <b>mental</b> <b>anguish</b> and psychological damage that may be caused to a child who fails to rescue a buddy parent. The first child buddy death in British waters occurred in 2008. The first double fatality of a buddy pair in which one diver was a minor occurred with a British father and son in Gozo in 2006. Proponents of dive training for children point to the great enjoyment and sense of wonderment the children feel when introduced to the underwater world and point out that other family sporting activities also have unfortunate incidents of serious injury to children.|$|E

Initially, the grounds were planted with many conifers and large growing trees, oaks, elms and Moreton Bay figs; and trees indigenous to the area, river red gum, yellow box, and lightwood were retained in the landscape. In 1913 the landscape gardener Hugh Linaker was employed to lay out the grounds of Mont Park Asylum.

40|$|Abstract Although no {{guidelines}} {{support the}} use of benzodiazepines in bereavement care, clinicians continue to use this medication for surviving family members. An anonymous survey about perinatal death was sent to 1500 United States obstetricians. One question assessed beliefs about prescribing sedatives to bereaved mothers. Almost half (49 %) of 804 obstetricians endorsed the use of sedatives, such as benzodiazepines, for acute bereavement. Grieving families may experience <b>mental</b> and physical <b>anguish</b> after a death; however, benzodiazepines are not part of recommended care for bereavement. The surprisingly high support from physicians for the use of sedatives in the case of maternal grief raises important questions about how physicians can best support bereaved mothers and what effect benzodiazepines may have in the grieving process...|$|R
40|$|Vsevolod M. Garshin's story "Four Days" ("Четыре дня") {{made the}} author famous {{when it was}} {{published}} in 1877. Intended as a strong anti·war statement and based on a true incident during the Russian-Turkish war (1877 - 78), "Four Days" is the interior monologue of a wounded soldier left for dead on an empty battlefield. His last name, Ivanov, which is traditionally considered to be the most common one in Russia, may suggest the idea of "everyman" in order to generalize the protagonists terrible experience on the battlefield into a broad anti-war message. The protagonist finds himself pinned down next to 0 the body of a Turkish soldier whom he had killed just before being wounded. Forced to look at the corpse for a long time, Ivanov experiences terrible guilt, since he has never killed before. After four days of physical and mental agony, during which Ivanov reassesses his formerly idealistic attitude toward war and ends up condemning it as something far from glorious and noble, the protagonist is found by his regiment, and, unlike his real-life prototype, he survives (Henry. 47). Throughout the text we do not lave the confines of the protagonist's mind; as a result, the intense, relentless focus on his <b>mental</b> and physical <b>anguish</b> created by the interior monologue: immobilized by his wound, he becomes a prisoner of his own mind; as a result, the intense, relentless focus on his <b>mental</b> and physical <b>anguish</b> created by the interior monologue technique enhances the "horrors of war" effect intended by the author.
