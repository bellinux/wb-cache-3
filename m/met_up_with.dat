5|$|The {{band had}} already {{released}} their debut album, Survivors, in 1979 on an independent label, {{two months before}} Dickinson joined. Immediately following the completion of his University work, he <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the band at Greenwich's Wood Wharf studios to learn the Survivors album.

5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff. A large wagon train left in July 1862 and <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide. Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} trials {{following a}} refit, the Gnat <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Ladybird, {{who also had}} a ship's dog. However Judy had to be kept away as while he took a fancy to her, she did not care for him. In the early morning after the Ladybird departed, Judy alerted the ship {{to the presence of}} river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly tried to use her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure.|$|E

Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman first went to the University of Illinois, where the men {{disassembled}} the Cockcroft–Walton generator and particle accelerator while Beverly catalogued all the parts.

There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, {{for the rest of}} the war.

He also <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Queen Victoria, who had become a personal friend of Abu Bakar, within the same course of his visit. Queen Victoria consented to his wishes, and a treaty was signed on 11 December 1885 which formalised relations between Great Britain and Johor, was concluded between Abu Bakar and the Colonial Office.

A year later, {{he moved on to}} Chernivtsi in Bukovina, where he edited the Yiddish-language daily Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be gauged from his inability to pay a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to Iaşi on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850–1930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, when M-40 was extended, M-89 was rerouted out of Allegan to the {{southeast}} along its present-day alignment to terminate at US131 in Plainwell. Just a few years later, the road was extended further to {{the southeast}} to Richland then east along its present-day routing to end at M-96 in Augusta. In 1931, the route was realigned to run east, rather than south into Augusta, where it then <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> M-96 just inside the Calhoun County line. The road remained in this fashion for the next 20 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{engagement}} was confusing {{for both}} sides, {{and the view}} was soon obscured by gunpowder smoke. Many ships on both sides were badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Dutch and escorted them into the harbor of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached the beleaguered Danish town.

5|$|After {{the recent}} events, Queen Margaret still {{considered}} Warwick {{a threat to}} the throne, and cut off his supplies. In August 1457, however, a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off fears of a full-scale French invasion. Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast. In disregard of royal authority, he then conducted highly successful acts of piracy, against the Castilian fleet in May 1458, and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later. He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip the Good of Burgundy. Developing a solid military reputation and with good international connections, he then brought a part of his garrison to England, where he <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his father and York in the summer of 1459.|$|E
5|$|Around 3 August García {{moved his}} entire army forward to Chunpich, and by October Spanish {{soldiers}} had established themselves near {{the source of}} the San Pedro River. By November Tzuktok' was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki; in that month García once again returned to Campeche. By December 1695 Ursúa was under pressure to complete the conquest of the Itza, and he approved the despatch of reinforcements along the Camino Real to join the main garrison. The reinforcements included 150 Spanish and pardo soldiers and 100 Maya soldiers, together with labourers and muleteers. An advance group of 150 mixed Maya and non-Maya soldiers <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> García at Campeche and proceeded southwards along the Camino Real towards the San Pedro River. The rest of the reinforcements did not leave Campeche until March 1696.|$|E
5|$|Elle Bishop is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who {{appeared on the}} American psychological thriller science fiction series Heroes, which aired on NBC from 2006 to 2010. The character was created by series creator Tim Kring and portrayed by actress Kristen Bell. Elle was created by Kring {{to act as a}} contrast {{to the rest of the}} characters, who had all recently found out they had abilities, whereas Elle had known her whole life. Bell, who had previously starred in the then recently cancelled series Veronica Mars, was a fan of the series and had <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the writers that informed her they would love to have her on the show. While the character of Elle was created before Bell was cast, following her casting, the character was slightly altered to better resemble her. Elle was one of the new characters introduced in the second season and according to contract, would continue on the series for at least 13 episodes into season three.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{lost control}} {{of power in the}} 1260s, {{resulting}} in the Second Barons' War across England. Following the Royalist defeat in 1264, the rebel leader Simon de Montfort seized Ludlow Castle, but it was recaptured shortly afterwards by Henry's supporters, probably led by Geoffrey de Geneville. Prince Edward escaped from captivity in 1265 and <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his supporters at the castle, before commencing his campaign to retake the throne, culminating in de Montfort's defeat at Evesham later that year. Geoffrey continued to occupy the castle {{for the rest of the}} century under Edward I's rule, prospering until his death in 1314. Geoffrey built the Great Hall and the Solar block during his tenure of the castle, either between 1250 and 1280, or later, in the 1280s and 1290s. The town walls of Ludlow also began to be constructed in the 13th century, probably from 1260 onwards, and these were linked to the castle to form a continuous ring of defences around the town.|$|E

When Trigg received word of their attack on Bryan Station, he was commanding the fort at Harrodsburg. He quickly assembled 135 local militiamen and <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Colonel Daniel Boone and Major Levi Todd and more militia at Bryan Station. When they approached the Blue Licks, a salt lick next to the Licking River, officers suspected a trap and convened a war council, but unruly troops lost patience and crossed the river. The three leaders formed a column each, with Trigg commanding the right. When they met with the opposing force, Trigg's column was ambushed. Trigg was killed and his men fell back after only five minutes of battle. When troops returned to the scene of battle, Trigg's body was found quartered.|$|E
5|$|Life is {{a memoir}} {{covering}} Keith Richards's life, starting with {{his childhood in}} Dartford, Kent, through to his success with the Rolling Stones and his current life in Connecticut.

In his teens he <b>met</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Mick Jagger, who he had known in primary school, and discovered that they both shared a love of blues music.

Húrin and his outlaws brought the treasure, including the Nauglamír, to Doriath, insulting Thingol by giving it as a fee for his 'good care' of Húrin's kin. Húrin thus brought a curse on Doriath as well, eventually leading to its downfall.|$|R
