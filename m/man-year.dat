40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe United States Army is making {{changes in the}} Officer Education System for 2 nd lieutenants to majors. These changes affect the size of Transient, Holdee and Student account (THS). The current Officer Basic Course changes to a two-phased system called Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC II and III). A twenty-week Captains' Career Course (CCC) replaces the current CCC and Combined Arms and Service Staff School (CAS 3). Currently, Command and General Staff College (CGSC), where 50 % of a year group attends resident CGSC, shifts to a two-phased approach with a Common Core Course and a Career Field Qualification Course. This thesis includes an Excel simulation model producing monthly predictions for six years for officers in THS account because of schooling. Assignments are Permanent Change of Station (PCS), Temporary Duty (TDY) Enroute, or TDY and Return. Therefore, if 30 % of majors attend Officer Education System (OES) as a PCS or TDY Enroute, the THS account sees a <b>man-year</b> increase of between 166 and 552 personnel. For CCC, if 30 % of captains attend CCC as PCS/TDY Enroute, THS shows a <b>man-year</b> decrease of between 1162 and 1171.

During fiscal year 2001 (the most recent complete time-awaiting-training data), Marines exceeded 2, 800 man years of time awaiting training. Non-infantry personnel comprise 80 % {{of the more}} than 30, 000 recruits shipped to Marine Corps Recruit Depots each year, but they constitute almost 95 % of the 2, 800 <b>man-year</b> loss. Marine Corps manpower planners consider the current level of loss unacceptable and believe significant improvement can be gained by optimally scheduling courses at Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) schools. This thesis uses an integer linear program, Entry-Level Course Scheduler (ELCS), to optimize a course schedule that includes recommended seat assignments by MOS and gender. ELCS seeks to minimize the time awaiting training while successfully meeting yearly classification requirements. ELCS results using fiscal year 2003 data indicate time awaiting training can be reduced to only 1, 700 man years (a 1, 100 <b>man-year</b> improvement, when compared with fiscal year 2001 data).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a particular inference mechanism {{which has been}} successfully used {{for the implementation of}} an expert system and a generic shell supporting consulting-type expert systems. The main features of Boolean Constraint Propagation Networks (BCPN) are: the inference flows in all directions, unlike inference modes of forward or backward chaining systems; all possible consequences of a fact are derived as soon as the user enters the fact, therefore the system is very interactive; if the user withdraws an assertion then all propositions depending on it are retracted; the inference architecture is simple and uniform. After a general description of BCPN we give an account of the problems encountered and the approaches we used to solve them. Some possible extensions of the mechanism and its applicability to various areas are also discussed. The current version of BCPN is written in C++ and took about one <b>man-year</b> to develop.
