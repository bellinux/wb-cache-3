40|$|Cycas beddomei Dyer {{is one of}} the medicinally {{important}} plants {{belonging to}} the family Cycadaceae. In the present study, the methanolic extract of the cones of Cycas Beddomei analyzed by GC-MS, while the mass spectra of the compounds found in the extract was matched with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library. Twelve phytochemical constituents have been identified. The major chemical constituents are 1, 3 -Propanediol, 2 -(hydroxymethyl) - 2 -nitro (61. 14 %), <b>Methyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate</b> (4. 77 %), Hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester (9. 00 %) and Methyl cis- 7 -octadecenoate (4. 73 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Cultures of the Gram-positive {{bacterium}} Corynebacterium sp. strain 7 E 1 C contained up to 300 mg dodecanedioic acid 1 - ’ after {{growth on}} dodecane. Small amounts of tetradecanedioic acid (17 to 45 mg 1 -’) were produced during growth on tetradecane or <b>methyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate.</b> No dicarboxylic acids were detected after growth on hexadecane, hexadecanoic acid or 16 -hydroxyhexadecanoic acid. Studies on {{the rates of}} degradation of exogenous dicarboxylic acids showed {{that this is not}} a significant factor influencing the accumulation of dodecanedioic and tetradecanedioic acids. The activities and substrate specificities of a number of enzyme activities involved in dicarboxylic acid metabolism were investigated. The specificities of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and thioesterase, alcohol dehydrogenases and P-oxidation are consistent with the accumulation of dodecanedioic acid from dodecane and the lack of production of hexadecanedioic acid from hexadecane. The co-hydroxy fatty acid may occupy a pivotal position in determining whether significant production of dicarboxylic acid occurs with this organism...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} molar heat capacity, phi-c, its associative part, phi-c(assoc), and {{the excess}} heat capacity, C(p) E, {{have been obtained}} at 25 -degrees-C through the concentration range for methanol, hexan- 1 -ol and decan- 1 -ol {{in a series of}} proton acceptor solvents: methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, octyl acetate, methyl octanoate, decyl acetate and <b>methyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate.</b> The results are explained quantitatively by the Tresczanowicz-Kehiaian (TK) association model and the Flory lattice model in terms of alcohol self-association into tetramers, characterized by an OH-OH equilibrium constant and enthalpy, and by alcohol-ester complex formation characterized by an OH-COO equilibrium constant and enthalpy, each independent of alcohol and ester chain length. As predicted, phi-c(assoc) at infinite alcohol dilution is independent of the choice of alcohol, but increases with increasing ester chain length. With increasing alcohol concentration phi-c(assoc) passes through a maximum which is much reduced compared with the inert solvent case. For each alcohol, C(p) E increases with increasing ester chain length, while for the same ester, C(p) E decreases with increasing alcohol chain length. dC(p) E/dT is positive for mixtures of methanol and methyl acetate, as predicted by the TK model. It is negative for decanol with methyl acetate, contrary to the TK model, but consistent with a non-random distribution of alcohol tetramers in the solution...|$|E
40|$|Wine aroma is an {{important}} characteristic and {{may be related to}} certain specific parameters, such as raw material and production process. The complexity of Merlot wine aroma was considered suitable for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCGC), as this technique offers superior performance when compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC). The profile of volatile compounds of Merlot wine was, for the first time, qualitatively analyzed by HS-SPME-GCxGC with a time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector (TOFMS), resulting in 179 compounds tentatively identified by comparison of experimental GCxGC retention indices and mass spectra with literature 1 D-GC data and 155 compounds tentatively identified only by mass spectra comparison. A set of GCGC experimental retention indices was also, for the first time, presented for a specific inverse set of columns. Esters were present in higher number (94), followed by alcohols (80), ketones (29), acids (29), aldehydes (23), terpenes (23), lactones (16), furans (14), sulfur compounds (9), phenols (7), pyrroles (5), C 13 -norisoprenoids (3), and pyrans (2). GCxGC/TOFMS parameters were improved and optimal conditions were: a polar (polyethylene glycol) /medium polar (50 % phenyl 50 % dimethyl arylene siloxane) column set, oven temperature offset of 10 ºC, 7 s as modulation period and 1. 4 s of hot pulse duration. Co-elutions came up to 138 compounds in 1 D and some of them were resolved in 2 D. Among the coeluted compounds, thirty-three volatiles co-eluted in both 1 D and 2 D and their tentative identification was possible only due to spectral deconvolution. Some compounds that might have important contribution to aroma notes were included in these superimposed peaks. Structurally organized distribution of compounds in the 2 D space was observed for esters, aldehydes and ketones, alcohols, thiols, lactones, acids and also inside subgroups, as occurred with esters and alcohols. The Fischer Ratio was useful for establishing the analytes responsible for the main differences between Merlot and non-Merlot wines. Differentiation among Merlot wines and wines of other grape varieties were mainly perceived through the following components: ethyl dodecanoate, 1 -hexanol, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, dehydro- 2 -methyl- 3 (2 H) thiophenone, 3 -methyl butanoic acid, ethyl <b>tetradecanoate,</b> <b>methyl</b> octanoate, 1, 4 butanediol, and 6 -methyloctan- 1 -ol. 201...|$|R
40|$|High {{pressure}} phase equilibria measurements of long chain saturated methyl esters (methyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, <b>methyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate,</b> methyl hexadecanoate, methyl octadecanoate and methyl docosanoate) in supercritical ethane have been measured for temperatures between 312 K and 355 K and for methyl ester mass fractions from 0. 65 to 0. 018. The results show a generally linear {{relationship between the}} phase equilibria pressure and the temperature with complete mutual solubility above 17 MPa. No three-phase regions or temperature inversions (change in sign of gradient of temperature-pressure relationship at constant composition) were observed while maxima in the phase transition pressures were found for methyl ester mass fractions usually between 0. 2 and 0. 3. When the phase transition pressure is plotted {{as a function of}} carbon number at constant temperature and mass fraction methyl ester, a linear relationship is realised. This linear relationship can be used to determine the solubility of any saturated methyl ester with between 10 and 22 carbon atoms, with limited extrapolation being possible. Thermodynamic modelling of the measured phase equilibria with the sPC-SAFT and Peng Robinson equations of state showed that, even with the use of an interaction parameter, these equations of state are not able to model the phase behaviour and the linear pressure-carbon numbers provide more accurate predictions. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Propolis is a Bee (Apis mellifera) {{product of}} plant origin with varied {{chemical}} composition {{depending on the}} ecology of the botanical origin. It has been reported in literatures to possess various therapeutic effects both traditionally, clinical trial and animal study. Objectives In the present study bioactive principle in methanol extract of Nigerian bee (Apis mellifera) propolis was determined GC-MS study. Methods The methanol extract of Nigerian bee (Apis mellifera) propolis was characterized for its chemical composition by preliminary phytochemicals and GC and ndash;MS using standard procedures and methods. Results: Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, tannins, cardiac glycosides, anthraquinones phlobatannins and steroids while GC and ndash;MS chromatogram revealed nineteen peaks representing sixty (60) different chemical compounds. The first compounds identified with less retention time (13. 33 s) were <b>Methyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate,</b> Tridecanoic acid, methyl ester, Decanoic acid, methyl ester while Squalene, All-trans-Squalene, 2, 6, 10 -Dodecatrien- 1 -ol, 3, 7, 11 -trimethyl-, (E,E) - and Farnesol isomer a took longest retention time (23. 647 s) to identify. Methyl 14 -methylpentadecanoate, Hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, Methyl isoheptadecanoateand Methyl tridecanoate were the most concentrated constituent as revealed by there peak height (26. 01 %) while eicosanoic acid was the least concentrated (Peak height 0. 81 %) constituent of Nigerian bee propolis. Conclusion: The presence of these chemical principles is an indication that methanol extract of Nigeria bee propolis, if properly screened could yield a drug of pharmaceutical importance [J Intercult Ethnopharmacol 2016; 5 (1. 000) : 43 - 48...|$|E
