5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought it was time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> my own.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca seems to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken us {{further into the}} danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend {{at a time when}} departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E

25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
500|$|During an {{exhibition}} game against the Chicago White Sox on September 9, 1931, Hartnett was photographed while signing an autograph for gangster Al Capone. After the photograph was published in newspapers across the United States, Hartnett received a telegram from Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis instructing him not to have his photograph taken with Capone in the future. Hartnett replied with a telegram to the Commissioner whimsically stating, [...] "OK, but if you don't want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> my picture taken with Al Capone, you tell him." ...|$|E

Other Stax {{artists such}} as Eddie Floyd and Johnnie Taylor also {{made significant contributions to}} soul music. By 1968, the soul music movement had begun to splinter, as James Brown and Sly & the Family Stone began to expand upon and abstract both soul and rhythm and blues into other forms. Guralnick wrote that more [...] "than anything else ... what seems to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> brought the era of soul to a grinding, unsettling halt was the death of Martin Luther King in April 1968".|$|E

In an {{answer to a question}} at a press conference, Kennan compared his conditions at the ambassador's residence in Moscow to those he had encountered while interned in Berlin during {{the first few months of}} the Second World War. While his statement was not unfounded, the Soviets interpreted it as an implied analogy with Nazi Germany. The Soviets then declared Kennan persona non grata and refused to allow him to re-enter the USSR. Kennan acknowledged retrospectively that it was a [...] "foolish thing for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> said".|$|E
500|$|On Christmas Day 1947, Kolish and his {{son were}} struck by a drunk driver while driving to spend the holiday with Sarria and his family. Both were killed.

[...] "I would have gotten one of the houses", Sarria claimed, [...] "but he only gave me a little money and one ring.

500|$|McCain {{graduated}} from the Naval Academy in June 1958; he was fifth from the bottom in class rank, 894th out of 899. [...] Despite his difficulties, McCain later wrote that he never defamed the more compelling traditions of the Academy – courage, resilience, honor, and sacrifice for one's country – and he never wavered in his desire to show his father and family that he was of the same mettle as his naval forebears. Indeed, Slew and Jack McCain had not had sterling records at the Academy themselves, finishing in the bottom third and bottom twentieth respectively. McCain realized later that the Academy had taught him that [...] "to sustain my self-respect for a lifetime {{it would be necessary}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the honor of serving something greater than my self-interest", a lesson that he would need to carry him through a [...] "desperate and uncertain" [...] time a decade later.|$|E

500|$|Extant {{biographies of}} Epaminondas universally {{describe}} {{him as one of}} the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: [...] "Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> left not one undone." [...] Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas's military record: [...] "For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: Pelopidas the Theban, [...] Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, you would find the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior".|$|E
500|$|Nutter joined Conference National side Lincoln City on a free {{transfer}} in July 2011. Signing a two-year deal with Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "I {{think it will}} benefit <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a fresh start, play in front of new people and show what I can do. I feel I'm better than this level but I've got to show that {{and we have to}} show that as a team". His Lincoln debut came on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match as Lincoln twice squandered a lead to draw 2–2 with Southport at Haig Avenue. He scored his first goal for the club in November 2011, netting Lincoln's third with a shot from outside the area in a 3–0 home win over Ebbsfleet United. Nutter would add to his goal tally once more during the campaign when he scored a 20-yard free-kick in an important 2–0 win against relegation rivals Newport County on 24 March 2012. Nutter played in all 51 of Lincoln's matches during the season, with the club struggling to adapt during their first season back in non-league, finishing just above the relegation places.|$|E
500|$|Harold Pinter {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for being notoriously pugnacious, enigmatic, taciturn, terse, prickly, explosive and forbidding. Pinter's blunt political statements, and the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature, elicited strong criticism and even, at times, provoked ridicule and personal attacks. [...] The historian Geoffrey Alderman, author of the official history of Hackney Downs School, expressed his own [...] "Jewish View" [...] of Harold Pinter: [...] "Whatever his merit as a writer, actor and director, on an ethical plane Harold Pinter seems to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been intensely flawed, and his moral compass deeply fractured." [...] David Edgar, writing in The Guardian, defended Pinter against what he termed Pinter's [...] "being berated by the belligerati" [...] like Johann Hari, who felt that he did not [...] "deserve" [...] to win the Nobel Prize. [...] Later Pinter continued to campaign against the Iraq War and on behalf of other political causes that he supported. [...] As Alderman points out, for example, Pinter signed the mission statement of Jews for Justice for Palestinians in 2005 and its full-page advertisement, [...] "What Is Israel Doing? A Call by Jews in Britain", published in The Times on 6 July 2006, and he was a patron of the Palestine Festival of Literature.|$|E

500|$|Agnew's first {{marriage}} was to Beverley in 1983; it {{ended in divorce}} in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played {{in the collapse of}} the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident that for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away {{for months at a time}} each and every winter?... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour... my children continue to ask me why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer." [...] Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.|$|E
500|$|In the {{regional}} finals, Kentucky trailed top-seeded Duke by 12 {{in the second}} half, but battled back to force overtime. With 2.1 seconds left in overtime, Sean Woods hit a running bank shot to put Kentucky up one. Then, Duke's Christian Laettner caught a long inbounds pass, faked right, and hit {{a shot at the}} buzzer to give Duke the 104103 victory. The game, which ended Farmer's playing career, is widely {{regarded as one of the}} greatest college basketball games of all time. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski later recalled, [...] "The thing I'll always remember about that game is Richie Farmer's face as the ball went in. That, to me, helped <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a better understanding of that game. ... To me, that was the deepest emotion that was on the court, the emotion that was on Richie Farmer's face." [...] Describing the impact of the game, Jerry Tipton wrote, [...] "On one fateful night, the Cats obliterated any lingering association with $1,000 packages and academic fraud. Alluring images of courage, honest effort and heartracing excitement became symbols of UK basketball." [...] Local media gave the seniors the nickname [...] "The Unforgettables". Collectively, they were voted as the Lexington Herald-Leaders 1992 Sportsmen of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Orosius' wording {{is echoed}} by the Origo Constantini Imperatoris, an {{anonymous}} work usually dated {{to the late}} 4th century. [...] "Constantine {{was also the first}} Christian emperor, with the exception of Philippus, who seemed to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> become a Christian merely in order that the one-thousandth year of Rome might be dedicated to Christ rather than to pagan idols." [...] ("Item Constantinus imperator primus Christianus, excepto Philippo, qui Christianus admodum ad hoc tantum constitutus fuisse mihi visus est, ut millesimus Romae annus Christo potius quam idolis dicaretur", tr. J.C. Rolfe) The scholar Samuel N. C. Lieu holds that this passage is a later interpolation, designed to give the work's pagan core a Christian gloss. According to Lieu, this passage, along with others, was probably taken from Orosius' history and inserted into the Origo Constantini during the reign of Constantine III (r. 417–21), a period that witnessed substantial anti-pagan polemic. Shahîd argues that, since the author of the Origo Constantini was a biographer of Constantine, and not a historian of the 3rd and 4th centuries, his reference to Philip is unnecessary. The conflicting claims of Philip and Constantine to primacy may have been at issue {{at the turn of the}} 5th century, when the Origo Constantini and Historia adversum paganos were written.|$|E

500|$|Lofton {{was again}} on the move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, $6.2 million contract. During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E
500|$|Shadows Fall {{released}} their sixth album, Retribution, on September 15, 2009, {{through the}} band's own label, Everblack Industries, {{which was created}} in conjunction with Warner Music Group's ILG, Ferret Music and ChannelZERO Entertainment.

Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs {{are a little more}} on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some fun.

500|$|In 2002, Carey {{signed a}} new record deal with Island Records and in 2005 she {{released}} her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi. It became the best-selling album of 2005 the United States, and the second best-seller around the world, with over 12 million units sold. It earned a myriad of music industry awards, and brought Carey {{back to the top}} of pop music following her commercial decline in 2001. After completing The Adventures of Mimi Tour, she began working on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC². E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the most}} anticipated albums of 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. Carey began writing and producing the music she saw fit, and not anything to please record executives. Throughout 2007, Carey recorded the album in a studio built into her private villa in Anguilla, in the Caribbean. She describe E=MC² as one of her most expressive albums, and one that she felt free on, and able to express herself through her music. In an interview with The Bryan Times, Carey spoke of her sentiments on the album [...] "It's hard for me to sit here and talk about it without sounding like if I'm bragging if I'm in love with it, but I am I love with this album. I think that having the success with the last record allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more [...] freedom...and just make records that I like. Its kind of a really fun record.|$|E
