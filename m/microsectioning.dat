40|$|Background: The {{opportunity}} {{offered by}} whole slide scanners of automated histological analysis implies an ever increasing importance of digital pathology. To {{go beyond the}} importance of conventional pathology, however, digital pathology may need a basic histological starting point {{similar to that of}} hematoxylin and eosin staining in conventional pathology. This study presents an automated fluorescence-based microscopy approach providing highly detailed morphological data from unstained <b>microsections.</b> This data may provide a basic histological starting point from which further digital analysis including staining may benefit. Methods: This study explores the inherent tissue fluorescence, also known as autofluorescence, as a mean to quantitate cardiac tissue components in histological <b>microsections.</b> Data acquisition using a commercially available whole slide scanner and an image-based quantitation algorithm are presented. Results: It is shown that the autofluorescence intensity of unstained <b>microsections</b> at two different wavelengths is a suitable starting point for automated digital analysis of myocytes, fibrous tissue, lipofuscin, and the extracellular compartment. The output of the method is absolute quantitation along with accurate outlines of above-mentioned components. The digital quantitations are verified by comparison to point grid quantitations performed on the <b>microsections</b> after Van Gieson staining. Conclusion: The presented method is amply described as a prestain multicomponent quantitation and outlining tool for histological sections of cardiac tissue.

40|$|The anodic {{sectioning}} of a metal permits successive atomically thin layers (2. 6 - 17 nm in {{the case}} of Be) to be removed from the surface of macroscopic specimens. The procedure with Be is based on forming an amorphous anodic film in an ethylene-glycol based electrolyte containing sulfate and phosphate ions, followed by dissolving the film in 10 % KOH. The inorganic ions replace part of the O 2 - in the anodic film, the empirical result of this being that P-con-taining ions reduce the dissolution rate during anodizing whereas S-contain-ing ions increase the dissolution rate of already-grown films in KOH. Thick-ness calibrations, based on a combination of measuring weight changes and analyzing depth-distr ibution curves for implanted radioactive ions, may be expressed as follows metal-removal thickness [...] 0. 18 -t- 0. 066 • volts ~g/cm~ anodic-film thickness [...] 0. 7 ~ 0. 23 • volts ~g/cm 2 The logic used for arriving at the results is developed So that it can in pr in-ciple be used as a guide for establishing anodic-sectioning procedures with still unstudied systems. Examples of depth distributions of 5, 15, and 80 keV Kr § in both Be and the anodic film on Over the past 20 years, various approaches for the <b>microsectioning</b> of solids have been developed. These include chemical dissolution (1 - 3), anodic sectioning (4 - 15), formation and issolution of films other than oxides (16), vibratory polishing (17), bombardment-induced solubility of surface layers (18, 19), and sput-tering (20 - 22). These techniques have their main ap-plications in measuring depth distributions of im-planted ions and radiation damage, and in determining diffusion coefficients at low temperatures (23).

40|$|Recently, the Mediterranean {{region has}} {{experienced}} unprecedented drought. Climate models predict {{an increase in}} drought frequency and duration. Therefore, quantifying the response of Mediterranean plants to drought is important. We contrasted wood anatomy and dendroecological features of a Mediterranean shrub, Arbutus unedo, at a xeric and a mesic site on the Italian island of Elba. Radial <b>microsections</b> of Arbutus unedo were stained, described, and crossdated. Annual ring widths of radial <b>microsections</b> were measured and compared with regional temperature and precipitation. False rings are common and distinguishable from true annual ring boundaries only by viewing radial <b>microsections</b> under high magnification. False ring formation was more common at the xeric site and was caused by below average rainfall in late summer (xeric site) and below average rainfall and high temperatures in spring and summer (mesic site). Given the predictions for increased drought, plants currently growing at mesic sites will likely adopt the growth patterns of plants currently growing at xeric sites. Thus, late summer precipitation will limit growth rates for woody plants.

Joints are formed {{at the moment}} of rock creation and also later in response to e. g. tectonic stress or uplift. In engineering geology the intensity of jointing is a particular measure of rock quality, as it largely defines the mechanical properties of rocks i. e. in respect to its suitability as building ground. Archean granites of the Elkon deposit, situated in the Aldan shield (South Yakutia, Russia), where chosen as the object of research. Microcracks of petrogenetic (formed due to magma cooling and crystallization) and tectonic origin have been observed in the rocks and the main goal was to analyze t he ef fect of microcracks on rock strength and deformation. Density, porosity, uniaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of the rocks were determined according to standard approaches (Sergeev 1984). Elastic constants were determined with two methods: 1) calculated from the measured wave velocities and the bulk density (dynamic testing), and 2) unconfined compressive loading and stressstrain curve (static testing). Micro jointing has been explored by various research methods, such as: 1) macroscopic description of polished <b>microsections,</b> 2) examination of polished <b>microsections</b> with reflected light optical microscopy, 3) examination of polished <b>microsections</b> with fluorescent luminophore saturation. Acquired images of polished <b>microsections</b> were used to calculate the joint hollowness coefficient. It was calculated as a ratio between square of joints and total square of polished section. According to the joint hollowness coefficient rock samples were classified as moderately and intensely jointed. It was observed, that the higher joining rate, the lower ultimate uniaxial compressive strength. This tendency is controlled by t he presence of sliding surfaces which were formed due to tectonic movement and also microfractures in crystals. The elastic modulus also decreases with an increase of the rock jointing rate. It should be noted, that dynamic elastic modulus is higher than the static by 2. 5 – 3 times. The effect of rock jointing on the dynamic elastic modulus is explained by the abundance of open cracks – {{in the case of the}} open cracks shear-waves attenuate and primary waves slow down considerably. For the statistic elastic modulus, the loading of the sample leads to the closing of rock joint surfaces, thus increasing the inelastic (residual) strain component. Residual strain displayed inversely proportional dependence with uniaxial compressive strength. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej. KEYWORDS: measure, rock quality, building ground...|$|R
