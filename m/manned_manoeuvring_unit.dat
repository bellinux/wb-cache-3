40|$|As {{an amateur}} {{it can be}} {{difficult}} filming from several angles {{at the same time as}} this requires several cameras. It´s also hard to film at occasions when it´s not appropriate to manoeuvre the camera manually. Systems for solving these problems already exist, but it´s either more expensive, professional systems or cheaper systems with limited functionality. The purpose of this project is to develop a cost efficient solution to the problem above that offers a better functionality then existing commercial systems. The biggest difference from existing products is the wireless video feedback from the camera to the remote unit. The result of the project is a system consisting of two <b>units,</b> a <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>unit</b> with a cradle for the video camera and a remote unit from which the operator can control pan and tilt of the video camera. Communication between the two units is wireless. On the remote unit there is a joystick and a display mounted. In addition to this, there is also an IR receiver that is capable of reading the signal from the cameras own remote and sending it to the <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>unit.</b> The <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>unit</b> is equipped with one motor to control the tilt function and one motor to control the pan. There is also a connector for an IR LED to control the video cameras functions. The casing for the <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>unit</b> is made of a plastic material through a process known as SLS, selective laser sintering. The cradle that the video camera is attached to is designed to rotate around the center axises of the camera in order to develop a minimal torque...|$|R

Kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>unit,</b> or Ikar, was mated.

50|$|Command is the {{authority}} to allocate resources, typically by assigning artillery formations or units. Terminology and its implications vary widely. However, very broadly, artillery units are assigned in direct support or in general support. Typically, the former mostly provide close support to <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>units,</b> while the latter may provide close support and or depth fire, notably counter-battery. Generally, 'direct support' also means that the artillery unit provides artillery observation and liaison teams to the supported units. Sometimes, direct support units are placed under command of the regiment/brigade they support. General support units may be grouped into artillery formations; for example, brigades, even divisions, or multi-battalion regiments, and usually under command of division, corps, or higher HQs. General support units tend to be moved to where they are most required at any particular time. Artillery command may impose priorities and constraints to support their combined arms commander's plans.|$|R

50|$|Battle {{dimension}} {{defines the}} primary mission {{area for the}} operational object within the battlespace. An object can have a mission area above the Earth's surface (i.e., in the air or outer space), on it, or below it. If the mission area of an object is on the surface, it can be either on land or sea. The subsurface dimension concerns those objects whose mission area is below the sea surface (e.g., submarines and sea mines). Some cases require adjudication; for example, an Army or Marine helicopter <b>unit</b> is a <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>unit</b> (i.e., a unit whose ground support assets are included) and is thus represented in the land dimension. Likewise, a landing craft whose primary mission is ferrying personnel or equipment to and from shore is a maritime unit and is represented in the sea surface dimension. A landing craft whose primary mission is to fight on land, on the other hand, is a ground asset and is represented in theland dimension.|$|R

50|$|From June 1891 onwards, Schlieffen {{began to}} push for {{transforming}} Ersatzbataillone into brigade-sized <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>units</b> in the field army. There were major drawbacks to this design. These units were not cohesive, combat-capable forces. Replacement units as field units would also {{not be able to}} replace field army casualties. Because the War Ministry had no intention of creating such armed hordes with practically no equipment or command and control, nor was it willing to incur the political cost, it turned down Schlieffen's proposals and nothing was done until 1911, six years after Schlieffen's retirement, when 6 ersatz divisions entered the German order of battle thanks to Ludendorff's efforts. Schlieffen continued to believe in the veracity of his idea and the mass use of Ersatzbataillone in combat formed the keystone of the January 1906 Schlieffen plan Denkschrift. The Schlieffen plan Denkschrift was therefore not a war plan, an impossibility because Schlieffen had retired on 31 December 1905 and the 96 divisions needed to carry out this one-front war plan never existed (in 1914 the German army had 79, of which 68 were deployed in the west), but a demonstration of what Germany might accomplish if she instituted true universal conscription.|$|R
40|$|The {{newspapers}} and airwaves are awash with exotic sounding military terms, as pundits and armchair generals {{try to explain}} complex military concepts, strategies and acronyms to a de-militarised general public in sound-bite terms. From the large <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>units</b> advancing on Baghdad during the high intensity phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation TELIC, to the on-going low intensity operations against terrorists and insurgents around the world, many of these ideas are presented as being “new” ways of operating, sometimes even “revolutionary”. But are they really as novel as their proponents would have us believe? In fact, many such ‘innovations’, in both the low and high intensity domains of conflict, were current by the time of, and during, the Roman Empire 2000 years ago. Roman commanders were fully aware {{of many of the}} same principals – and pitfalls – as modern day commanders. High-intensity Combat Long before Cromwell’s New Model Army, the Romans had a standing, professional Army, with individually numbered Legions, and a sophisticated recruitment, training and logistics organisation.

40|$|For {{better or}} for worse, the {{politics}} of Brexit, {{in combination with the}} implementation of the new EU Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy, have generated renewed momentum for European defence cooperation. EU member states have tabled a range of proposals. Some consolidation will be necessary, especially if effective defence integration is the aim – and that is the way to overcome current fragmentation. National forces can cooperate and be made interoperable with other forces in various formats simultaneously, but they can be integrated only once. Two levels of defence cooperation and integration must be addressed. At the level of the EU as such, and using EU incentives such as Commission funding for R&T, largescale projects for the development and acquisition of strategic enablers can be mounted, with the European Defence Agency acting as manager. At the level of state clusters, large deployable multinational formations can be created (such as army corps and air wings), with fully integrated maintenance, logistics and other structures in support of the national <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>units</b> that each participant can contribute. By pooling all-too-limited national military sovereignty in this way, defence cooperation and integration can revive sovereignty, understood as the capacity for action, at a higher level...|$|R
40|$|The study {{addresses}} {{hybrid warfare}} and its relevance to land operations {{conducted by the}} Norwegian Armed Forces. While the first part explores the recent phenomenon of hybrid warfare, the second asks whether hybrid warfare has any bearing on land operations. A land operation is a ground operation on Norwegian territory in which Norwegian Armed Forces engage conventional adversaries. Military theory traditionally recognises a dichotomy between guerrilla warfare and conventional warfare. Hybrid warfare is a fusion of both. In {{order to understand the}} theory of hybrid warfare better, this study investigates the 2006 Lebanon War and Hezbollah’s conduct of operations – focusing on strategies, tactics, techniques and procedures. Based on an analysis of Norway’s strategic culture, the authors find some elements of hybrid warfare of relevance to the Norwegian context, particularly the ability to absorb an enemy attack and to strategically strike the enemy. To succeed, land forces have to maintain fighting power, delay an enemy advance, and inflict maximum enemy losses. Land forces composed of a mix of light and heavy <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>units,</b> able to utilise complex terrain, speed and joint fires can achieve this. The Norwegian land forces’ ability to strategically strike the enemy is essentially indirect, and works by protecting and supporting other Norwegian and NATO capabilities such as Air Force assets...|$|R
