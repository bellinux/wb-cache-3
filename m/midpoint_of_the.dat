5|$|The vector of {{the eclipse}} path at the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eclipse {{aligning}} with the vector of the earth's rotation (i.e. not diagonal but due east).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>midpoints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{three sides}} and <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three altitudes all lie {{on a single}} circle, the triangle's nine-point circle. The {{remaining}} three points {{for which it is}} named are <b>the</b> <b>midpoints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> portion <b>of</b> altitude between <b>the</b> vertices and the orthocenter. <b>The</b> radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nine-point circle is half that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circumcircle.

5|$|Having {{arrived in}} Melbourne, O'Halloran was rested, along with Rose and Henricks, in the heats of the relay. Devitt, Chapman, Graham Hamilton and Garretty {{finished}} third in their heat behind Great Britain and the Soviet Union, and qualified fifth-fastest behind Japan and the United States. Australia led from the start and reached the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race with a lead of 4.5s. Hamilton swam a very slow third leg of 2min 15.4s and conceded 8.8s to the British.|$|E
5|$|The law {{requires}} the lowering {{of the flag}} to the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flagpole {{on the days of}} mourning or during mourning ceremonies. A black ribbon needs to be placed {{at the top of the}} flag; the length of the ribbon should be equal to the length of the flag. The flying flag has to be raised in its entirety, clean, and unfaded; moreover, the lower part of the flag should be at least 2.5 m off the ground.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins {{are roughly}} equal {{in size and}} placed far back on the body: the first {{originates}} behind the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fin bases and the second behind the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anal fin base. The pectoral fins are large, while the pelvic fins are small and low, with angular margins. The anal fin is much larger than either dorsal fin; its base measures 13–18% of the total length and greatly exceeds {{the distance between the}} pelvic and anal fins, or between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is laterally compressed, {{with the end of the}} anal fin very close to the caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises around a quarter of the total length; the upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near the tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is very thick and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. There is a prominent row of enlarged denticles, resembling saw teeth, along the upper edge of the caudal fin. The body is grayish-brown above, with 15–18 dark, rounded saddles, blotches, and/or spots that run onto the tail; each marking is highlighted by a paler border. The underside is white, as are the tips of the dorsal and caudal fins. The inside of the mouth is black.|$|E

5|$|Wales {{lies within}} the north {{temperate}} zone. It has a changeable, maritime climate {{and is one}} of the wettest countries in Europe. Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53° 43′ N and 51° 38′ N). Aberystwyth, at the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's west coast, has nearly 17hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over sevenandahalf hours.|$|E
5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26. All of NY99 was initially a gravel road; however, most of the road was paved in the early 1970s {{through the use of}} state funds procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh. The western and eastern extents of the road were paved soon afterward; however, the road was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route—even though the necessary gravel base was applied to the entire highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the roadway}} loops around itself at a {{section in the}} roadway locally known as The Helix, {{descending}} the New Jersey Palisades to reach {{the entrance to the}} Lincoln Tunnel under the Hudson River. The route has a westbound exit for CR677 (John F. Kennedy/Hudson Boulevard East) and another exit for Boulevard East with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. After interchanging with Boulevard East, the road features an eastbound toll plaza and enters the Lincoln Tunnel. At the New York state line, which is located at the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hudson River, the road continues as NY 495, which is separate from I-495, and heads into Midtown Manhattan in New York City.|$|E
25|$|For a convex {{quadrilateral}} with at most {{two parallel}} sides, the Newton {{line is the}} line that connects <b>the</b> <b>midpoints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two diagonals.|$|R

25|$|If M1 and M2 are <b>the</b> <b>midpoints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diagonals AC and BD {{respectively}} in a {{tangential quadrilateral}} ABCD with incenter I, and if <b>the</b> pairs <b>of</b> opposite sides meet at J and K with M3 being <b>the</b> <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> JK, then <b>the</b> points M3, M1, I, and M2 are collinear. The line containing them is <b>the</b> Newton line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quadrilateral.|$|R
5|$|Downtown, {{maintenance}} of NY10 shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{to the village}} at Mohawk Street. The highway remains locally owned for three blocks to Incinerator Road, where the route becomes state-maintained once more. During this stretch, NY10 intersects NY5S at Main Street. North of Incinerator Road, the route passes under the Thruway before crossing into the neighboring village of Palatine Bridge at the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mohawk River. On the northern riverbank, NY10 meets NY5 and overlaps the route westward for a block before continuing northward into the largely rural town of Palatine.|$|E
5|$|In a {{practical}} implementation, the variables {{used to represent}} the indices will often be of fixed size, and this can result in an arithmetic overflow for very large arrays. If the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> span is calculated as (L + R) / 2, then the value of L + R may exceed the range of integers of the data type used to store the midpoint, even if L and R are within the range. If L and R are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the midpoint as L + (R minus& L) / 2.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} his sophomore season that Weber evolved {{into one of}} Nashville's most {{important}} players. By the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season, Weber already had 26 points, and his play was recognized on January 14, 2007, when he {{was named to the}} Western Conference roster for the 2007 NHL YoungStars Game in Dallas, Texas. Weber went on to finish the season with 40 points, finishing eighth on the Predators roster in total points. He added an additional three assists in five playoff games before the Predators were eliminated by the San Jose Sharks for the second consecutive season.|$|E

50|$|A cuboctahedron has {{octahedral}} symmetry. Its first stellation is <b>the</b> compound <b>of</b> a cube and its dual octahedron, with <b>the</b> vertices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cuboctahedron {{located at}} <b>the</b> <b>midpoints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> either.|$|R
5|$|NY10 begins {{concurrent}} with NY8 at an interchange {{with the}} Quickway (NY17) {{southeast of the}} village of Deposit near the Broome-Delaware County line. The two routes continue north along the eastern extents of Deposit to {{the banks of the}} west branch of the Delaware River, where NY8 breaks from NY10 to cross over the river. NY10, however, continues northeast along the riverbank, passing south of the Cannonsville Dam and the resulting Cannonsville Reservoir behind it. Near the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water body, NY10 crosses over the reservoir on the Cannonsville Bridge and proceeds to follow the northern edge of the reservoir. As the reservoir begins to narrow, NY10 intersects NY268, a connector route leading south to the village of Hancock.|$|E
5|$|NY418 begins just {{southwest}} of Thurman Station, a hamlet within {{the town of}} Thurman, where Athol Road shifts from county maintenance (as CR4) to state maintenance (as NY418). It heads northeastward along the base of Sugarloaf Mountain, one of the Three Sisters Mountains, as it passes an area with very little development. The route continues along a northeasterly trek to Thurman Station, where it intersects with River Road {{in the center of}} the isolated community. At this point, the route turns southeastward and crosses the Upper Hudson River Railroad at-grade before passing over the Hudson River on the Thurman Station Bridge. NY418 passes into the town of Warrensburg at the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route64 (NY64) is a north–south {{state highway}} in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States. Its {{southern}} terminus {{is at an}} intersection with NY21 in the hamlet of Bristol Springs within the town of South Bristol, Ontario County. The northern terminus is at a junction with NY96 and NY252 {{in the village of}} Pittsford, Monroe County. NY64 is a mostly two-lane highway that primarily serves as a connector between the southeastern suburbs of the city of Rochester and the Canandaigua Lake area, home to Bristol Mountain Ski Resort. Near the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route, NY64 has an overlap with U.S. Route20 (US20) and NY5 that takes the route through the village of Bloomfield.|$|E
50|$|Every {{triangle}} has an infinitude of inscribed ellipses. One {{of them is}} a circle, and one <b>of</b> them is <b>the</b> Steiner inellipse {{which is}} tangent to the triangle at <b>the</b> <b>midpoints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sides.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, a {{quadrilateral}} ABCD with intersection P <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diagonals is orthodiagonal if {{and only}} if <b>the</b> circumcenters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangles ABP, BCP, CDP and DAP are <b>the</b> <b>midpoints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quadrilateral.|$|R
50|$|A convex {{quadrilateral}} is orthodiagonal (has perpendicular diagonals) if {{and only}} if <b>the</b> <b>midpoints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sides and <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four altitudes are eight concyclic points, on what is called the eight-point circle.|$|R
5|$|The Rookie of the Year Award {{is given}} to the highest-finishing musher who has never before competed in a Yukon Quest. The Dawson Award {{consists}} of four ounces of gold, and it {{is given to}} the first musher to reach Dawson City, the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, and complete the race. The final award is the Red Lantern, a $1,000 prize awarded to the last official finisher of that year's race. Two awards have been discontinued: the Kiwanis Award, given to the first musher to cross the Alaska-Yukon border, and the Mayor's Award, given to the Yukon Quest champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} campaign, Edler {{improved to}} career-highs of 37 assists, first among team defensemen, and 42 points, second to Christian Ehrhoff. He missed six games near the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign {{due to a}} left arm injury, sustained in December 2009. In the post-season, he added six points in 12 games as the Canucks lost again {{in the second round}} to the Blackhawks. Edler was injured in the sixth and deciding game of the series after opposing forward Dustin Byfuglien stepped on his right ankle after hitting him along the boards. Requiring a walking cast for five weeks, he rehabilitated his ankle during the off-season.|$|E
5|$|The {{lopsided}} victory allowed Texas to play several less-experienced players. Back-up quarterback Matt Nordgren {{entered the}} game in the thirdquarter, replacing Vince Young. Third-string quarterback Matt McCoy replaced Nordgren just past the <b>midpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourthquarter. Since Colt McCoy was listed third on the UT depth chart, television broadcasters referred to Matt McCoy (no relation) as Colt McCoy, a mistake they repeated over the season. The Longhorns did not play Colt in the 2005season, choosing to redshirt him instead. After viewing this game as part of a recruiting visit to UT, Jevan Snead – ranked {{as one of the top}} high school quarterbacks in the nation, elected to switch his commitment from University of Florida to Texas.|$|E
