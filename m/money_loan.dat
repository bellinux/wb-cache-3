25|$|The papal {{prohibition}} on usury {{meant that it}} was a sin to charge interest on a <b>money</b> <b>loan.</b> As set forth by Thomas Aquinas, the natural essence of money was as a measure of value or intermediary in exchange. The increase of money through usury violated this essence and according to the same Thomistic analysis, a just transaction was one characterized by an equality of exchange, one where each side received exactly his due. Interest on a loan, in excess of the principal, would violate the balance of an exchange between debtor and creditor and was therefore unjust.|$|E
50|$|To ensure {{repayment}} of a <b>money</b> <b>loan,</b> gemachs will typically ask {{the borrower}} to provide two guarantors as co-signers on the loan. (In halakha {{this is known}} as areivut.) Should the borrower fail to repay on time, the gemach owner can turn to these co-signers and demand repayment, a claim which will be upheld in a beit din (Jewish rabbinical court).|$|E
50|$|A credit {{provider}} is {{the party}} who supplies goods or services (in terms of an instalment sale agreement, for example), or who pays money (in terms, for example, of a secured or unsecured <b>money</b> <b>loan,</b> overdraft facility, pawn transaction or mortgage loan). The credit provider is often {{also referred to as}} “the creditor,” in particular when steps are taken to recover amounts due from the consumer.|$|E
50|$|Unsecured <b>money</b> <b>loans</b> {{are usually}} smaller <b>money</b> <b>loans</b> (micro-loans) re-payable in instalments, where the lender is given no {{security}} for re-payment of the debt.|$|R
50|$|The private <b>money</b> <b>loans</b> {{provided}} by TDICs are {{also known as}} hard money loans—a reference to the hard assets that provide collateral for the <b>loans.</b> Hard <b>money</b> <b>loans</b> are usually short-term, bridge loans designed to meet temporary cash needs for projects that will eventually be refinanced with conventional bank loans.|$|R
50|$|Hard <b>money</b> <b>loans</b> are high-interest {{mortgages}} {{available from}} private investors. Desperate borrowers with poor credit scores, bankruptcies, no verifiable income, {{or too much}} debt often take out hard <b>money</b> <b>loans</b> when {{they are unable to}} qualify for traditional mortgages. Hard money becomes a last resort when borrowers cannot meet the lending standards set by banks or government sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the primary}} basis {{for making a}} hard <b>money</b> <b>loan</b> is the {{liquidation}} value of the collateral backing the note, hard money lenders will always want to determine the LTV (loan to value) prior to making any extension of financing. A hard money lender determines {{the value of the}} property through a BPO (broker price opinion) or a independent appraisal done by a licensed appraiser in the state in which the property is located.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bridge loan}} {{is similar to}} and {{overlaps}} with a hard <b>money</b> <b>loan.</b> Both are non-standard loans obtained due to short-term or unusual circumstances. The difference is that hard money refers to the lending source, usually an individual, investment pool, or private company {{that is not a}} bank in the business of making high risk, high interest loans, whereas a bridge loan is a short term loan that [...] "bridges the gap" [...] between longer term loans.|$|E
50|$|If the {{property}} requires substantial repair, traditional lenders like banks will often not lend on a {{property and the}} investor {{may be required to}} borrow from a private lender utilizing a short term bridge loan like a Hard <b>money</b> <b>loan</b> from a Hard money lender. Hard money loans are usually short term loans where the lender charges a much higher interest rate because of the higher risk nature of the loan. Hard money loans are typically at a much lower Loan-to-value ratio than conventional mortgages.|$|E
50|$|There {{were nine}} S-Series transactions, {{into which the}} RTC contributed more than 1,100 loans having a total book value of {{approximately}} $1 billion and a DIV of $466 million. The RTC purchase <b>money</b> <b>loans,</b> aggregating $284 million for the nine S-transactions, were all paid off within 22 months of the respective transaction closing dates (on average, the purchase <b>money</b> <b>loans</b> were retired in 16 months).|$|R

5000|$|Although {{not widely}} used, {{the notion of}} [...] "Christian finance" [...] refers to banking and {{financial}} activities which came into existence several centuries ago. Whether {{the activities of the}} Knights Templar (12th century), Mounts of Piety (appeared in 1462) or the Apostolic Chamber attached directly to the Vatican, a number of operations of a banking nature (<b>money</b> <b>loan,</b> guarantee, etc..) or a financial nature (issuance of securities, investments) is proved, despite the prohibition of usury and the Church distrust against exchange activities (opposed to production activities).|$|E
50|$|Under {{the terms}} of the {{agreement}} negotiated by Starwood, secured lenders would receive a new $50 million loan plus 80% of the new stock. Lenders who provide $20 million in a so-called new <b>money</b> <b>loan</b> would receive 8% of the new stock plus warrants for another 10%. Creditors who provide a $10 million working capital loan would receive 7% of the new stock. The last 5% of the new stock goes to the lenders in return for providing a backstop insuring availability for the $30 million in loans. Existing Riviera shareholders received nothing.|$|E
50|$|Later {{secretary-general}} in the UN, Trygve Lie {{served as}} secretary in Grorud TIF, {{and became an}} honorary member of Grorud IL. He was a central person in the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, and helped the club get a <b>money</b> <b>loan</b> in Akers Sparebank, which financed the field and hill construction. In 1929, Grorud IL decided to join the Workers' Sports Confederation Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund (AIF), where Trygve Lie also was a central figure. This connection ended in 1946 when the AIF was disbanded. By that time the club had got their club house, designed by noted architect Frode Rinnan.|$|E

5000|$|The hard <b>money</b> <b>loan</b> {{mortgage}} market has greatly expanded since the 2009 mortgage crisis {{with the passing}} of the Dodd Frank Act. The reason for this expansion is primarily due to the strict regulation put on banks and lenders in the mortgage qualification process. The Dodd Frank and Truth in Lending Act set forth Federal guidelines requiring mortgage originators, lenders, and mortgage brokers to evaluate the borrower's ability to repay the loan on primary residences or face huge fines for noncompliance. Therefore hard money lenders only lend on business purpose or commercial loans {{in order to avoid the}} risk of the loan falling within Dodd Frank, TILA, and HOEPA guidelines.|$|E
50|$|FMPA {{was created}} on February 24, 1978, by {{the signing of}} the Interlocal Agreement Creating the Florida Municipal Power Agency. Originally, 17 {{municipal}} electric utility systems were members of FMPA. FMPA was created largely in response to the Arab oil embargo that hit the U.S. economy hard in the 1970s. At that time, many of Florida's municipal electric utilities were trying to determine how to survive, and small cities needed the economies of scale that a larger organization could provide. With a $2 million seed <b>money</b> <b>loan,</b> the original members of FMPA created an organization to serve and support them, and to ensure the survival and vitality of Florida's municipal electric utilities in the future.|$|E

50|$|A hard <b>money</b> <b>loan</b> is a {{specific}} type of asset-based loan financing through which a borrower receives funds secured by real property. Hard money loans are typically issued by private investors or companies. Interest rates are typically higher than conventional commercial or residential property loans, starting at 7.7%, because of the higher risk and shorter duration of the loan. Most hard money loans are used for projects lasting from a few months to a few years. Hard money is similar to a bridge loan, which usually has similar criteria for lending as well as cost to the borrowers. The primary difference is that a bridge loan often refers to a commercial property or investment property that may be in transition and does not yet qualify for traditional financing, whereas hard money often refers to not only an asset-based loan with a high interest rate, but possibly a distressed financial situation, such as arrears on the existing mortgage, or where bankruptcy and foreclosure proceedings are occurring.|$|E
50|$|Private {{money lenders}} exist {{throughout}} most of the United States, seeking a chance to earn above average rates of return on their money. With that comes the risk that a private <b>money</b> <b>loan</b> may not be re-paid on time or at all without legal action. However, {{in the case of a}} real estate transaction the lender can ask for a deed on the property in their name & Insurance on the property the same as a bank lending money would require as collateral to help insure they be repaid in the event of a default on the loan or catastrophe to the property. In that case the lender gets the property and can sell it to recoup their investment. Private money is offered to clients in many cases in which the banks have found the risk to be too high or credit too poor. There are a few Private Money Lenders who offer a no credit check and loan amortization.|$|E
50|$|When a feudal tenant or {{landlord}} needed liquid resources, {{they could}} pledge their estate in land, as collateral, for a <b>money</b> <b>loan.</b> Since the gaged collateral was typically {{a piece of}} real property which generated revenue (e.g. a farm which produced crops, a mill which processed food, a pasture that provided milk or wool, etc.), the lender-gagee received the rents and profits of the land. Under {{the terms of a}} living gage, these rents and profits reduced the amount the borrower-gagor owed, while under a dead gage they did not. This meant that if the property was prosperous enough, or the loan small enough, a property in living gage could pay off the debt itself; in other words, it was self-redeeming. On the other hand, with a dead gage, the property's rents and profits did not go toward satisfying the principal, but instead constituted interest on the loan, which made it a form of usury. As a result, dead gages were denounced as immoral/illegal among Catholic theologians.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2016, ASLIC is able {{to charge}} between 6.99% and 12% {{interest}} on their [...] "Not So Hard Money" [...] loans because their loans are considered non-conforming loans. Typically, either the real estate securing the loan or the borrower (or both) are unable {{to qualify for a}} conforming loan with a bank. Often American Savings' borrowers are business persons who have profitable business but do not fit the conforming loan criteria. ASLIC's [...] "Not So Hard Money" [...] loans are designed to fill the niche between conforming bank <b>loans</b> and private <b>money</b> or hard <b>money</b> <b>loans.</b> ASLIC fills the niche by charging lower interest rates, lower loan origination costs, and offering longer loan terms than typical hard <b>money</b> <b>loans.</b>|$|R

50|$|Raj {{tries to}} quit his {{life of crime}} {{to work at a}} factory, but his {{employers}} fire him when they find out that he was a thief. Rita invites him to her birthday, to the disapproval of the Judge, who believes that the impoverished Raj must come from a bad family. Remembering the humiliation he felt as a child when he could not afford a gift for Rita's birthday, Raj goes back to Jagga for a <b>money</b> <b>loan.</b> Jagga mocks his attempts to reform and asks him to commit more crimes. Raj refuses, but ends up stealing a necklace from a man on the street, not knowing the man was the Judge. At Rita's birthday, when Raj gives her a necklace without a case and the Judge gives her a case without a necklace (he did not realise it had been stolen until then), she discovers that Raj is indeed a thief. Rita goes to Raj's mother and learns his whole life story. She decides that Raj is not bad, but was forced into committing crimes by bad influence and the desperation of living in poverty. Raj is ashamed, still believing he is no good for her, but she forgives him.|$|E
