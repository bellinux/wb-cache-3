40|$|Fatigue {{is often}} a design driver for large (e. g. 5 - 10 MW) {{offshore}} wind turbines (OWTs), necessitating a thorough examination of damping sources: aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, structural, and soil. Of these sources, soil damping has been least considered by researchers with respect to OWTs. Aeroelastic programs, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) code FAST, are typically used for time history analysis of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads experienced by OWTs. To take into account foundation flexibility while minimizing computational expense, reduced-order foundation models such as the <b>mudline</b> stiffness matrix are often used. <b>Mudline</b> stiffness and damping matrices are derived here for the NREL 5 MW reference turbine.

40|$|Offshore {{wind turbine}} (OWT) support {{structures}} account for 20 - 25 % {{of the capital}} cost for offshore wind installations, making it essential to optimize {{the design of the}} tower, substructure, and foundation to the extent possible. This dissertation focuses on monopile foundations, as the vast majority (approximately 75 %) of currently installed OWTs are supported by monopile structures. The objective of this dissertation is to provide information on the behavior of monopile support structures to better substantiate design and planning decisions and to provide a basis for reducing the structural material costs. In pursuit of these objectives, research is presented on the topics of hysteretic soil-structure damping (referred to as foundation damping), cyclic degradation of soil properties, and the impact of marine growth on OWT monopile support structures. OWTs are lightly damped structures that must withstand highly uncertain offshore wind and wave loads. In addition to stochastic load amplitudes, the dynamic behavior of OWTs must be designed with consideration of stochastic load frequency from waves and mechanical load frequencies associated with the spinning rotor during power production. The close proximity of the OWT natural frequency to excitation frequencies combined with light damping necessitates a thorough analysis of various sources of damping within the OWT system; of these sources of damping, least is known about the contributions of damping from soil-structure interaction (foundation damping), though researchers have back-calculated foundation damping from “rotor-stop” tests after estimating aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and structural damping with numerical models. Because design guidelines do not currently recommend methods for determining foundation damping, it is typically neglected. The significance of foundation damping on monopile-supported OWTs subjected to extreme storm loading was investigated using a linear elastic two-dimensional finite element model. A simplified foundation model based on the soil-pile <b>mudline</b> stiffness matrix was used to represent the monopile, and hysteretic energy loss in the foundation was converted into a viscous, rotational dashpot at the <b>mudline</b> to represent foundation damping. The percent critical damping contributed to the OWT structural system by foundation damping was quantified using the logarithmic decrement method on a finite element free vibration time history, and stochastic time history analysis of extreme storm conditions indicated that <b>mudline</b> OWT foundation damping can significantly decrease the maximum and standard deviation of <b>mudline</b> moment. Further investigation of foundation damping on cyclic load demand for monopile-supported OWTs was performed considering the design situations of power production, emergency shutdown, and parked conditions. The NREL 5 MW Reference Turbine was modeled using the aero-hydro-elastic software FAST and included linear <b>mudline</b> stiffness and damping matrices to take into account soil-structure interaction. Foundation damping was modeled using viscous rotational <b>mudline</b> dashpots which were calculated as a function of hysteretic energy loss, cyclic <b>mudline</b> rotation amplitude, and OWT natural frequency. Lateral monopile capacity can be significantly affected by cyclic loading, causing failure at cyclic load amplitudes lower than the failure load under monotonic loading. For monopiles in clay, undrained clay behavior under short-term cyclic soil-pile loading (e. g. extreme storm conditions) typically includes plastic soil deformation resulting from reductions in soil modulus and undrained shear strength which occur as a function of pore pressure build-up. These impacts affect the assessment of the ultimate and serviceability limit states of OWTs via natural frequency degradation and accumulated permanent rotation at the <b>mudline,</b> respectively. Novel combinations of existing p-y curve design methods were used to compare the impact of short-term cyclic loading on monopiles in soft, medium, and stiff clay. Marine growth increases mass and surface roughness for offshore structures, which can reduce natural frequency and increase hydrodynamic loads, and can also interfere with corrosion protection and fatigue inspections. Design standards and guidelines do not have a unified long-term approach for marine growth on OWTs, though taking into account added mass and increased drag is recommended. Some standards recommend inspection and cleaning of marine growth, but this would negate the artificial reef benefits which have been touted as a potential boon to the local marine habitat. The effects of marine growth on monopile-supported OWTs in terms of natural frequency and hydrodynamic loading are examined, and preliminary recommendations are given from the engineering perspective on the role of marine growth in OWT support structure design...|$|E

Surface heat-flow values from Leg 110 (calculated from geothermal gradients forced through the bottom-water temperature at <b>mudline)</b> of 92 to 192 mW/m** 2 are 80 % to 300 % higher than values predicted by standard heat flow vs. age models for oceanic crust, but are compatible with earlier surface measurements made at the same latitude.

These results are consistent with the flow of warm fluid through the complex along sub-horizontal, high-permeability conduits, including thrust faults, the major decollement zone, and sandy intervals. Simple calculations suggest that this flow is transient, occurring on time scales of tens {{to tens of thousands of}} years.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Caissons on {{permeable}} seabeds {{have been}} designed and constructed {{for a variety of}} needs in coastal and offshore engineering. An evaluation of the adequacy of the foundation beneath the structure is required for an economic and safe design. To address this requirement, a two-dimensional analytical model of the foundation response is developed. The caisson is assumed to be placed on a rubblemound bedding layer overlying a soil of finite depth. The soil is considered to be homogeneous, isotropic, and linearly poroelastic. The soil responses, including displacements, stresses and porewater pressure, are modeled by Biot consolidation theory. This theory couples the soil skeleton motion and fluid flow. A boundary layer approximation technique is employed which enables the soil motion and pore pressure in the Biot theory to be solved separately. Linearity allows the wave-soil-caisson system to be decomposed into scattering and radiation problems. In the scattering problem, the caisson is assumed to be fixed and the soil response depends on the wave pressure on the <b>mudline</b> alone. In the radiation problem, the soil and wave forces on the caisson determined in the scattering problem impose caisson motion which in turn forces the soil response. Both problems are solved for the total stress employing classical elasticity. In the vicinity of the <b>mudline,</b> the boundary layer approximation yields one-dimensional Terzaghi consolidation theory to adjust the soil response due to fluid flow. In solving both scattering and radiation problems, a mixed-type boundary condition arises at the <b>mudline.</b> This mathematical complication is simplified by applying a solution technique developed for a contact problem of a rectangular stamp on a thin elastic layer. This thin layer limitation is to ensure negligible shear stress and vertical normal stress along the exposed surface of the seabed. The analytical solution is verified by comparison with a numerical solution developed for an elastic soil of finite depth. Results are in good agreement. In addition, large-scale experiments were conducted at the 0. H. Hinsdale Wave Research Facility at Oregon State University. The wave flume is 342 ft long, 12 ft wide, and 15 ft deep. A 10 -ft-high, 8 -ft-long and 4 -ft-wide caisson was placed on a bedding layer and 1 to 3 ft of underlying soil. The caisson was exposed to 0. 68 to 4. 40 ft waves with periods of 1. 77 to 8. 84 sec. Wave pressures were measured {{on the face of the}} caisson. Pore pressures were monitored in the bedding layer and soil under the caisson. Displacements of the caisson were also monitored. Comparison indicates that the theory may underestimate the horizontal and vertical displacements, but the predicted pore pressure is in good agreement with the data...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Ocean waves {{propagating}} over cohesionless seabed deposits produce cyclic {{shear stresses}} within the deposit. Under certain conditions these stresses may cause a progressive build-up of pore pressure. Pore pressure accumulation {{can result in}} liquefaction or a substantial decrease in the effective stress with attendant large deformations of the seabed deposit. In recognition {{of the need to}} study ocean wave-induced liquefaction, a series of large scale wave flume tests were conducted. The test program consisted of generating a series of uniform waves over a sand deposit and measuring the pore pressure response. The pore pressure response was studied for a variety of soil and wave conditions. Specific variables addressed in the study included drainage conditions near the surface of the deposit, relative density of the deposit, magnitude of wave loading, and previous wave loading history. Both the cyclic and mean pore pressure responses in the deposit were determined. Cyclic shear stresses within the deposit are generated by wave-induced cyclic pressure fluctuations at the <b>mudline.</b> For a given wave length, the cyclic shear stresses increase with increasing wave height. Wave-induced liquefaction of a fine sand was observed. A decrease in effective stress and liquefaction resulted from an increase in the mean pore pressure during undrained wave loading. The mean pore pressure increased owing to a transfer of intergranular stress to the pore fluid. Pore pressures cycled about the shifting mean pressure at the same frequency as the wave loading. <b>Mudline</b> pressure fluctuations were not affected by pore pressure changes occurring below the <b>mudline.</b> Liquefaction resulted in gross disturbance of the deposit. Pore pressure accumulation was not observed during drained loading. Several drained tests were conducted for a range of initial relative density and wave conditions. During the drained tests, the relative density of the sand layer increased and settlement of the sand was observed. The increased density of the sand layer was accompanied by attenuation of the cyclic pore pressure fluctuations during the initial wave loading cycles of the test. Following attenuation, the cyclic pore pressure fluctuations remained constant {{to the end of the}} test. The effect of previous wave loading was evaluated by comparing the response of tests subjected to previous wave loading with those not subjected to previous wave loading. Previous wave loading resulted in increased stability of the sand with respect to liquefaction potential. The increased stability was the result of an increase in relative density as well as changes in the structure of the deposit. Measured mean pore pressure responses for all the tests were compared to the response predicted by a theoretical model. Theoretical predictions agreed with the measured response except for the case where the deposit was subjected to a previous wave loading history. The potential for pore pressure accumulation and liquefaction of a seabed deposit decreases with: 1) increased drainage at the surface of the deposit, 2) increased relative density, 3) decreased magnitude of wave loading, and 4) previous wave loading...|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{the oil and}} gas {{industry}} has typically used the single gradient system to drill wells offshore. With this system the bottom hole pressure was controlled by a mud column extending from the drilling rig to the bottom of the wellbore. This mud column was used to achieve the required bottom hole pressure. But, as the demand for oil and gas increased, the industry started exploring for oil and gas in deep waters. Because of the narrow margin between the pore and fracture pressures it is somewhat difficult to reach total depth with the single gradient system. This led to the invention of the dual gradient system. In the dual gradient method, heavy density fluid runs from the bottom hole to the <b>mudline</b> and a low density fluid from the <b>mudline</b> to the rig floor so as to maintain the bottom hole pressure. Several methods have been developed to achieve the dual gradient drilling principle. For this research project, we paid more attention to the liquid lift, dual gradient drilling (riser dilution method). This method of achieving dual gradient drilling was somewhat different from the others, because it does not utilize elaborate equipment and no major changes are made on the existing drilling rigs. In this thesis the technical feasibility of using the liquid lift method over the other methods of achieving dual gradient drilling was determined. A computer program was developed to simulate the wellbore hydraulics under static and dynamic conditions, injection rate and base fluid density required to dilute the riser fluid and finally, u-tubing phenomena. In this thesis we also identified some problems associated with the liquid lift method and recommendations were made on how these problems can be eliminated or reduced. Emphases were placed on the effect of u-tubing, injection rate of base fluid at the bottom of the riser and well control issues facing this system...|$|E

40|$|Suction-induced seepage is pivotal to the {{installation}} of caisson foundations in sand. Indeed, the upward pore water flow {{on the inner side}} of the caisson wall causes a release of a fraction of soil resistance due to the reduction of the lateral effective stress. A safe caisson installation requires a reliable prediction of soil conditions, especially soil resistance and critical suction for piping. These soil conditions must be predicted for the whole installation process. In this paper, we examine the effect on such prediction of the assumed permeability profile, which is described as a function of depth below the <b>mudline.</b> This study is motivated by the fact that marine sediments generally exhibit a permeability that decreases with depth because of consolidation under gravity. Hence, the question is whether conventional theories based on a constant permeability lead to a conservative prediction of soil conditions or not. Our conclusion is affirmative only regarding piping condition. As for soil resistance, a prediction based on the assumption of a constant permeability is non-conservative. This is due to an overestimated reduction in effective stresses under suction-induced seepage...|$|E

In the literature, these loads are often represented using a frequency plot where the power spectral densities (PSDs) of wave height and wind turbulence are plotted against the corresponding frequency range.

Secondary steel, such as a boat landing and J-tube, influences wave loads. A way of taking the secondary steel items into account in the wave load calculation is through modifying the hydrodynamic coefficients. Wave loads are calculated using four design standards and the design of the monopiles of the Prinses Amalia Wind Farm. The wave loads results with and without secondary steel items can be used for a buckling check at the <b>mudline</b> for the specific case. This gives insight in the influence of the secondary steel items on wave load and wall thickness. Determining the drag coefficient using different standards will result in differences of the drag coefficient between 18 % and 22 %.

This result can be used for considerations in the design of future support {{structures for}} offshore wind turbines. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Eleven short gravity cores (up to 102 cm {{in length}} {{at time of}} collection) were {{obtained}} through the Browning access hole at Ross Ice Shelf Project Site J 9 during December 1977 (P. N. WEBB : Ross Ice Shelf Rep., 78 / 1, 46 p., 1978; P. N. WEBB and H. T. BRADY : EOS, 59, 309, 1978; P. N. WEBB et al. : Science, 203, 435, 1979). Site J 9 is located at 82 ° 222 ̆ 7 S; 186 ° 382 ̆ 7 W (Fig. 1). The <b>mudline</b> at this site is 597 m below present sea level. The seafloor in this area exhibits a very subdued relief. At J 9 the Ross Ice Shelf is 420 m thick and overlies a marine water column of about 237 m. The site is some 400 km from the open water of the Ross Sea. The collection of gravity cores took place over a two week period. The daily movement of the ice shelf in this area amounts to about 1 m/day in a northerly direction. The short sedimentary succession obtained during repeated coring may be separated into two distinct lithological units, an upper light olive gray diatomaceous (± 15...|$|E
