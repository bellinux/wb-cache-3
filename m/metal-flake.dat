2500|$|Among its {{standard}} performance features, all The Machine models included a special set of wheels {{with the appearance}} of a cast alloy wheel. Painted silver <b>metal-flake</b> with a rough texture, they have a mag-style appearance. AMC described them as [...] "15-inch styled road wheels" [...] in brochures and catalogs. Enthusiasts call them [...] "Machine wheels" [...] and the wheel's came with a chrome center cap adorned with a blue trim disc featuring a gear icon in the center and the words American Motors around it. The [...] x [...] wheels made by Kelsey-Hayes. They have five narrow cooling slots positioned atop risers stamped around the center of the wheel. The trim ring is unusual because it does not overlap the rim (to allow for attaching wheel balancing weights) and it is permanently press-fit.|$|E
5000|$|Also in June 1971, {{the first}} Ducati 750 GT models {{came out of}} the factory, {{distinguished}} by silver frames, <b>metal-flake</b> paint, fibreglass fuel tanks, 1 1/8" [...] (1.125") Amal carburettors, and twin leading shoe rear brakes.|$|E
5000|$|On September 16, 2013, DOD {{returned}} with updated {{versions of the}} venerable [...] "Overdrive Preamp/250", and [...] "Phasor/201". Both feature true bypass, blue LEDs, modern power jack, lighter aluminum chassis, two tone flat-black and <b>metal-flake</b> paint jobs. The 2013 250 also features an LM741 op-amp to replicate {{the sounds of the}} original 250. In 2014 three more updated DOD pedals were released, the [...] "BIFET Boost 410", and the [...] "Envelope Filter 440", and the [...] "Electro-Optical Compressor 280". The 410 features a new buffer on/off toggle and the 440 features an up/down voicing toggle, and the 280 circuit is untouched except for the addition of true bypass, LED, and modern PSU jack. All feature true bypass, blue LEDs, modern power jack, lighter aluminum chassis, two tone flat-black and <b>metal-flake</b> paint jobs.|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s, candy colored paint, often multicolored and <b>metal-flaked</b> with {{different}} patterns, became {{a trend that}} allowed builders to further express their individuality and artistry. Soon many parts were being offered by small companies expressly for use in building choppers, not necessarily as performance parts as was common in the Bobber Era.|$|R
5000|$|The Digger became {{another popular}} style. Similar to the Frisco {{choppers}} Diggers were frequently even longer than earlier bikes, but still low. The coffin and prism shaped tanks on these bikes were frequently mated with very long front ends (12" [...] over stock and more), with the archaic girder fork often {{being used to}} accomplish this instead of the more common springer or telescopic types. Body work was also moulded to flow seamlessly, using copious amounts of bondo. New paint colors and patterns included paisleys, day-glo and fluorescent, along with continuing use of <b>metal-flakes</b> and pearls.|$|R
40|$|The pilot set-up of a {{horizontal}} high energy ball mill (Simoloyer®) {{that has been}} successful in reactive milling, mechanical alloying, and formation of ductile <b>metal-flakes</b> is used for semi-continuous processing of organic solid-solid reactions which proceed rapidly and without wastes in the absence of solvents. 200 g batches were run in the exploratory investigation. Stoichiometric 1 : 1 -mixtures of a-(D) -glucose and urea formed the 1 : 1 -complex with quantitative yield after 5 min at a rotor frequency of 900 min- 1. Similarly the condensation reaction of solid p-hydroxybenzaldehyde with solid p-aminobenzaldehyde was complete after 15 min yielding the pure imine derivative in quantitative yield without waste producing work-up procedures. Further scale-up appears possible also with other solid-solid reactions. 1...|$|R
50|$|Also in June 1971, {{the first}} Ducati 750 GT models {{came out of}} the factory, {{distinguished}} by silver frames, <b>metal-flake</b> paint, fibreglass fuel tanks, 30 mm Amal carburettors, and twin leading shoe rear brakes. Taglioni experimented with four valve heads at this time, but failed to produce better power figures than his two valve heads, so the two valve racers continued. He continued to experiment with four valve heads right up to 1973.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, Tunberg was a {{recipient}} of the California Arts Commission Award, [...] "Eyes and Ears Foundation Grant", to design and produce art to be exhibited on a 48 x 16 ft billboard. Tunberg's Pat Tap was exhibited on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California and {{referred to in the}} book Megamurals & Supergraphics: Big Art. During the 1970s, Tunberg's assemblages were encased in boxes painted in high gloss <b>metal-flake,</b> to invite the viewer into the inner workings and tough narratives of his artwork.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Wood was {{inducted}} into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. On May 23, 2012, Wood was named as {{one of the members of}} the 2013 NASCAR Hall of Fame inductees, and {{was inducted}} on February 8, 2013. Wood earned 57 percent of the votes, tied with Herb Thomas. At the 2012 Brickyard 400, Wood Brothers Racing honored Wood with a special paint scheme with candy apple red instead of <b>metal-flake</b> red, which the team switched to in 1971, and Wood's head shot on the hood.|$|E
40|$|In 2013 the European Metrology Research Program (EMRP) funded a 36 months {{research}} project, "Multidimensional Reflectometry for Industry, xD-Reflect", {{to investigate}} the macroscopic optical properties related to visual appearance of modern surfaces. During the three years duration of the project, over in August 2016, several visual experiments have been performed to investigate appearance of materials with goniochromatic and sparkling effects. <b>Metal-flakes</b> produce shiny effects whose definitions, quantities and metrological characterizations are still under development. This paper relates to the measurement and visual estimation of graininess and brightness perceived of metal flakes achromatic pigments materials. The subjective ranking on graininess and brightness of three different sample sets different for particles shape (silver dollar and corn-flakes) and dimension, were compared under similar viewing conditions on two commercial lighting booths, one based on LED lighting and one on fluorescent light, both reproducing CIE D 65 illuminating conditions. The subjective rankings were compared with the graininess measured with a Byk-Mac instrument and the luminance measured with a luminancemeter in the experimental conditions inside both lighting booths. The performances of the two lighting cabinets and of the two different flake shapes were also compared. The results are useful both for shops lighting arrangements and industrial panelist investigations...|$|R
50|$|The car was previewed at the Sport Car Show in Monza and {{presented}} officially at the Turin Auto Show in 1969. It {{was the first}} Alfa Romeo model designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro as head of his own carrozzeria, and {{was based on the}} Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale road-going version of the Tipo 33/2. Although it did not go into production, the Iguana is reflected in Giugiaro's later work. The body of the Iguana was painted a <b>metal-flake</b> grey, while the roof frame and cabin pillars were finished in brushed metal, a treatment Giugiaro later applied to the DeLorean DMC-12.|$|E
5000|$|Wonderbugs {{alter ego}} [...] "Schlepcar" [...] (so named {{due to its}} {{personalized}} California license plate [...] "SCHLEP") was an old, beat up, conglomeration of several junked cars {{that looked like a}} rusty dune buggy. Like Herbie of Disney movie fame, Schlepcar was alive and could drive itself, and could also talk in a mumbling voice. It was found in a junk yard by teenagers Barry Buntrock (David Levy), C.C. McNamara (John-Anthony Bailey) and Susan Talbot (Carol Anne Seflinger). Schlepcar transformed into the shiny <b>metal-flake</b> orange Wonderbug whenever a magic horn (which played the bugle call for [...] "cavalry charge") was sounded. In his Wonderbug identity, Schlepcar had the power of flight and was able to help the three teens capture crooks and prevent wrongdoing.|$|E

The 15 in x 7 in wheels made by Kelsey-Hayes. They have five narrow cooling slots positioned atop risers stamped around the center of the wheel. The trim ring is unusual because it does not overlap the rim (to allow for attaching wheel balancing weights) and it is permanently press-fit.|$|E
50|$|Custom Culture {{is usually}} {{identified}} with the greasers of the 1950s, the drag racers of the 1960s, and the lowriders of the 1970s. Other subcultures that have had an influence on Custom Culture are the Skinheads, mods and rockers of the 1960s, the punk rockers of the 1970s, the metal and rockabilly music, along with the scooterboys of the 1980s, and psychobilly of the 1990s. Each separate culture has added their own customizations to the cars, their own fashions, influenced the music, and added their own ideas of what is cool, of what is acceptable, and what is not. Everything from wild pinstriped paintjobs, to choptop Mercurys, to custom Harley-Davidson and Triumph Motorcycles, to <b>metal-flake</b> and black primer paint jobs, along with music, cartoons, and monster movies have influenced what defines anyone and anything who {{is part of this}} automobile subculture.|$|E
40|$|<b>Metal-flake</b> powder {{coatings}} are a special class of metallic paint finishes {{composed of two}} superimposed layers: a pigmented decorative base coat and an overlaying transparent protective top coat. In the present investigation, a novel curing procedure for such bilayer coatings is proposed. Flash IR pre-curing of the base coat promotes {{the formation of a}} surface diffusion barrier and limits movement of the decorative pigments and metal flakes around their initial positions. Oven baking after deposition of the top coat then completes curing of the bilayer coating. The influence of the IR intensity and irradiation time on the final properties of bilayer coatings was investigated. The visual appearance, surface morphology and scratch resistance were evaluated. Experimental findings revealed that the hybrid IR/oven baking curing procedure is a viable method for obtaining bilayer {{powder coatings}} with outstanding properties in a shorter processing time and with considerable energy savings. © 2011 Elsevier B.
