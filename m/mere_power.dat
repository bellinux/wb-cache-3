The story is cast {{in terms of a}} good side, and a bad side, beauty against {{ruthless}} ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save <b>mere</b> <b>power,</b> and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. But if you have, as it were, taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the questions of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, noting that it [...] "turns the complex into something easy and obvious". Shearman and Pearson felt that the character of Sara Bangs was [...] "treated as an object by the episode", and that Carter's script [...] "takes a very real issue and trivialises it" [...] by presenting such an [...] "open and shut case". However, they noted that the episode was [...] "very well acted", and was [...] "clearly well intentioned". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B+, noting that it [...] "tries some interesting things with the Millennium template". VanDerWerff felt {{that several of the}} episode's scenes [...] "are as horrifying as anything I've seen on TV", adding that [...] "they accomplish much of this through the <b>mere</b> <b>power</b> of suggestion". However, he also noted that the character of Joe Bangs was too simplistic, claiming that he is [...] "so damned blatant about what he does that it eventually stops being horrifying and becomes preposterous". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 2.5 out of 5, finding that its focus on legal issues and counselling [...] "fragments the tone and atmosphere" [...] built by previous episodes. However, Gibron felt that [...] "Carter's script handles the horrifying subject very well".|$|E

500|$|There is a {{requirement}} that the beneficiaries of a trust, known as the objects, be certain. Within express trusts this is a particularly complex area, because the test used to determine certainty varies between fixed trusts, <b>mere</b> <b>powers</b> and discretionary trusts. Fixed trusts are trusts for a specific, named list of individuals, with Alastair Hudson giving the example of [...] "£10,000 to be held upon trust equally for the complete team of 11 Sunderland Football Club players who started the 1992 Cup Final at Wembley". The test for fixed trusts is that the trustees {{must be able to}} give a complete list of the beneficiaries, as laid down in IRC v Broadway Cottages. If there are any potential beneficiaries who the trustees are not certain of, or the trustees cannot compile a complete list, the trust is void for uncertainty.|$|R

60|$|Nor are we {{to wonder}} that powers make {{a great part of}} our complex ideas of substances; since their {{secondary}} qualities are those which in most of them serve principally to distinguish substances one from another, and commonly make a considerable part of the complex idea of the several sorts of them.

Our cries of pain, fear, surprise, anger, together with their appropriate actions, and the murmur of a mother to her beloved child, are more expressive than any words.

This scheme doesn’t reduce the energy utilisation and communication overhead of the network. Based on our inquiry it is erect that routing procedure is to be altered relatively than controlling the transmission power and permitting only certain nodes in routing process. Routing mechanism is to be changed based on the assessment of received signal strength and relative remaining energy. Using this only specific nodes in the network are permitted to receive and validate the routing request. Aforementioned form of routing procedure is adopted to Ad-hoc on-demand multipath distance vector (Ad-hoc-OMDV) routing protocol and a maximal transmission range and remaining energy based multipath protocol called AOMDV_RR is proposed and analysed under various dimensions of network. Commendable dissimilarity in capabilities are found and the suggested AOMDV_RR shows better performance than the normal AOMDV with reference to all the selected QoS entities...|$|R

60|$|The {{reader will}} find I have {{borrowed}} several incidents {{as well as}} names from Ashmole, and the more early authorities; but my first acquaintance with the history was through the more pleasing medium of verse. There is a period in youth when the <b>mere</b> <b>power</b> of numbers has a more strong effect on ear and imagination than in more advanced life. At this season of immature taste, the author was greatly delighted with the poems of Mickle and Langhorne, poets who, though by no means deficient in the higher branches of their art, were eminent for their powers of verbal melody above most who have practised this department of poetry. One of those pieces of Mickle, which the author was particularly pleased with, is a ballad, or rather a species of elegy, {{on the subject of}} Cumnor Hall, which, with others by the same author, was to be found in Evans's Ancient Ballads (vol. iv., page 130), to which work Mickle made liberal contributions.

Another ever-present {{question}} {{on my mind}} has been, whether electricity has an actual and independent existence as a fluid or fluids, or was a <b>mere</b> <b>power</b> of matter, like what we conceive of the attraction of gravitation. If determined either way {{it would be an}} enormous advance in our knowledge; and as having the most direct and influential bearing on my notions, I have always sought for experiments which would in any way tend to elucidate that great inquiry. It was in attempts to prove the existence of electricity separate from matter, by giving an independent charge of either positive or negative power only, to some one substance, and the utter failure of all such attempts, whatever substance was used or whatever means of exciting or evolving electricity were employed, that first drove me to look upon induction as an action of the particles of matter, each having both forces developed in it in exactly equal amount. It is this circumstance, in connection with others, which makes me desirous of placing the remarks on absolute charge first, in the order of proof and argument, which I am about to adduce in favour of my view, that electric induction is an action of the contiguous particles of the insulating medium or dielectric[A].|$|E
500|$|Discretionary trusts are trusts {{which require}} that the {{trustees}} exercise their powers, {{in the same way}} as a fixed trust, but allow some discretion in how to do so, in a similar manner to <b>mere</b> <b>powers.</b> Since trustees hold the discretionary power to choose how to act under an established boundary set out by the settlor of a trust, evidential certainty is not relevant and does not affect discretionary trusts anyway. The leading test of certainty of objects here is also the [...] "any given postulant test", applied to discretionary trusts in McPhail v Doulton. The courts attempted to mitigate this test in Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (no 2); however, all three judges of the Court of Appeal gave separate reasons. Stamp LJ had an approach based entirely on the facts, with no greater impact on certainty of objects. Sachs LJ took the approach that the burden of proof was on the claimants to prove they were beneficiaries, not on the trustees to prove the trust was valid. Megaw LJ, however, took the approach that a trust could be valid, even with uncertain beneficiaries, if there was a [...] "core number" [...] of beneficiaries who were certain. Megaw LJ's stand reflects the current position. Otherwise, trusts would have been failed if there is one individual who cannot be said to be the [...] "given postulant".|$|R
