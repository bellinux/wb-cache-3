500|$|The Hurricane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory {{created the}} r-CLIPER (rainfall {{climatology}} and persistence) model {{to act as}} a baseline for all verification regarding tropical cyclone rainfall. [...] The theory is, if the global forecast models cannot beat predictions based on climatology, then there is no skill in their use. [...] There is a definite advantage to using the forecast track with r-CLIPER because it could be run out 120hours/5days with the forecast track of any tropical cyclone globally within a short amount of time. [...] The short range variation which uses persistence is the Tropical Rainfall Potential technique (TRaP) technique, which uses satellite-derived rainfall amounts from <b>microwave</b> <b>imaging</b> satellites and extrapolates the current rainfall configuration forward for 24hours along the current forecast track. [...] This technique's main flaw is that it assumes a steady state tropical cyclone which undergoes little structural change with time, which is why it is only run forward for 24hours into the future.|$|E

50|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>imaging</b> is {{a science}} which has been evolved from older detecting/locating {{techniques}} (e.g., radar) in order to evaluate hidden or embedded objects in a structure (or media)using electromagnetic (EM) waves in microwave regime (i.e., ~300 MHz-300 GHz). <b>Microwave</b> <b>imaging</b> techniques can be classified as either quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative imaging techniques (are also known as inverse scattering methods) give the electrical (i.e., electrical and magnetic property distribution) and geometrical parameters (i.e., shape, size and location) of an imaged object by solving a nonlinear inverse problem. The nonlinear inverse problem is converted into a linear inverse problem (i.e., Ax=b where A and b are known and x (or image) is unknown) by using Born or distorted Born approximations. Despite the fact that direct matrix inversion methods can be invoked to solve the inversion problem, this will be so costly when {{the size of the}} problem is so big (i.e., when A is a very dense and big matrix). To overcome this problem, direct inversion is replaced with iterative solvers. Techniques in this class are called forward iterative methods which are usually time consuming.On the other hand, qualitative <b>microwave</b> <b>imaging</b> methods calculate a qualitative profile (which is called as reflectivity function or qualitative image) to represent the hidden object. These techniques use approximations to simplify the imaging problem and then they use back-propagation (also called time reversal, phase compensation, or back-migration) to reconstruct the unknown image profile. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and frequency-wave number migration algorithm {{are some of the most}} popular qualitative <b>microwave</b> <b>imaging</b> methods1.|$|E

40|$|<b>Microwave</b> head <b>imaging</b> is a {{promising}} technique for brain injury detection. In that technique, electromagnetic waves are sent into {{the head by}} an antenna array surrounding the head and the scattered signals are processed to form an image for brain injury detection purposes. Strong wave reflections from the outer layers {{of the head and}} their overlapping with target 2 ̆ 7 s signals can cause a strong clutter in the received signal. This clutter can adversely affect the accuracy of reconstructed image by masking the target response.
