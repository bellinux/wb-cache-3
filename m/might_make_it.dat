5|$|During the {{streaming}} of the series, Silverman {{criticized the}} animation {{because of the}} low lighting levels that <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> hard to understand. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which {{is known for its}} flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.|$|E
5|$|Proactiv {{is aimed}} at {{customers}} with mild to moderate acne. According to a 2011 review, {{there have been few}} studies examining its efficacy. A 2007 study saw inflammatory lesions reduced by 39 percent in subjects using a combination of butenafine and benzoyl peroxide, compared with 34 percent in those using Proactiv containing only benzoyl peroxide. A physician suggested in Salon that its three-step system <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for teenagers to comply, but that the key to its success lay with its celebrity endorsements.|$|E

25|$|Several {{theoretical}} and simulatory {{studies have shown}} that some lifeforms from Earth can potentially survive under Martian conditions. In particular, certain lichens from the arctic permafrost are able to photosynthesize and grow {{in the absence of any}} liquid water, simply by using the humidity from the atmosphere. They are also highly tolerant of UV radiation, using melanin and other more specialized chemicals to protect their cells. The air on Mars approaches 100% humidity in evening and morning, and at those times frosts form on the surface. These are also conditions which <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> possible for lichens to survive there.|$|E

25|$|However, few {{initially}} foresaw {{the extent}} of the influence of containerization on the shipping industry. In the 1950s, Harvard University economist Benjamin Chinitz predicted that containerization would benefit New York by allowing it to ship its industrial goods more cheaply to the Southern United States than other areas, but he did not anticipate that containerization <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> cheaper to import such goods from abroad. Most economic studies of containerization merely assumed that shipping companies would begin to replace older forms of transportation with containerization, but did not predict that the process of containerization itself would have a more direct influence on the choice of producers and increase the total volume of trade.|$|E

Many physicists, such as Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne and others, therefore argue that such effects <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> possible to stabilize a traversable wormhole. Physicists have not found any natural process that would be predicted to form a wormhole naturally in the context of general relativity, although the quantum foam hypothesis is sometimes used to suggest that tiny wormholes might appear and disappear spontaneously at the Planck scale, and stable versions of such wormholes have been suggested as dark matter candidates. It has also been proposed that, if a tiny wormhole held open by a negative mass cosmic string had appeared {{around the time of the}} Big Bang, it could have been inflated to macroscopic size by cosmic inflation.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, {{the most}} {{significant}} flaw in the constitution left by Augustus concerned the matter of succession. This deadly flaw was violently exposed in the year 69. Augustus had established a standing army, where individual soldiers served under the same military governors in the same provinces {{over an extended period}} of time. The consequence was that the soldiers in the provinces developed a degree of loyalty to their commanders, which they did not have for the emperor. Thus the empire was, in a sense, a union of inchoate principalities, which could have disintegrated at any time. The first indication of a nationalist movement appeared in Gaul (modern France) in 68, but this movement ended when its leader, C. Julius Vindex, was defeated by an army under L. Verginius Rufus. Rufus was the governor of Upper Germany, and while he was declared imperator by his soldiers, he decided not to use his support to march on Rome and make himself emperor. He did not decline this opportunity because he was loyal to the emperor Nero, but rather because of his own low birth, and his belief that his low birth <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> difficult for him to accomplish anything as emperor. Shortly after Rufus had been declared imperator, Ser. Sulpicius Galba, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, was proclaimed emperor by his troops. In Rome, the emperor Nero quickly lost his supporters and committed suicide. Galba, however, did not prove to be a wise leader. He chose to punish Rufus' troops, and to antagonize the Praetorian Guard by not fulfilling promises which had been made to them.|$|E

[...] In October, when the report appeared with six pages cut from the testimony, The White House stated that the changes were made due to concerns regarding the accuracy of the science. However, according to the former senior adviser on climate change to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson, Cheney's office was directly responsible for nearly half of the original testimony being deleted.|$|E
500|$|With {{the help}} of Kirstie McLellan Day, Fleury wrote his autobiography, Playing with Fire, which was {{released}} on October 16, 2009.

While he stated he [...] "doesn't want to become the poster boy for abuse by James", Fleury hoped that speaking out <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for other childhood sexual abuse victims to come forward. He blamed the abuse for turning him into a [...] "raging, alcoholic lunatic", and claimed to have placed a loaded gun in his mouth and contemplated suicide in 2004. He revealed that he had spent most of his income on alcohol, drugs, gambling and women. Fleury also claimed that he failed 13 consecutive drug tests while playing for the Rangers, but that the league did not want to suspend him because he was a leading scorer. The league disputed this, and stated that its substance abuse program functioned appropriately.|$|E
