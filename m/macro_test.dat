40|$|On-chip memory arrays {{are widely}} used in systems-on-chip. Prior {{research}} has shown that timing critical paths often go through these memories. Embedded memories are typically tested using memory built-in self-test and <b>macro</b> <b>test.</b> However, these techniques have relatively low small delay fault coverage, so functional test must be used to accurately determine maximum operating frequency. In this work we achieve high delay fault coverage by testing the timing critical paths in and out of embedded memories, including the paths in the surrounding logic. We use our prior work on pseudo functional K longest path per gate test generation and extend it to handle memory test. In pseudo functional test, low-speed preamble cycles are used to stabilize the supply voltage before the at-speed launch and capture cycles. Since the memory cells are non-scan, a value that is captured in the memory must be moved to a scan cell using low-speed coda cycles. This approach tests any path through a non-scan latch. Our approach eliminates the coverage ?shadows? around embedded memories and non-scan latches. We have established a flow to test industrial circuits with embedded memory. Industrial circuits with different size memory arrays are used to justify the efficiency of the flow. Our results demonstrate that we can effectively generate patterns that cover paths {{in and out of the}} memories...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{goal of this}} {{publication}} is to present a new laboratory methodology for simulation of industrial melting, solidification and heat treatment using the patented Universal Metallurgical Simulator and Analyzer (UMSA) Technology Platform [10]. Two examples to demonstrate UMSA’s capabilities are presented for optimized heat treatment processes {{at the request of}} the North American automotive industry. Design/methodology/approach: The unique UMSA Platform was used to rapidly physically simulate very complex industrial heat treatment processes using stationary <b>macro</b> <b>test</b> samples and computer controlled heating and cooling source. Findings: The UMSA simulations proved to be very accurate in order to simulate the non-linear temperature/time profile of the solidification process combined with the continuous heat treatment operation. Moreover, the complex industrial heat treatment process was successfully replicated for an 800 g test sample and the targeted structural and mechanical properties were met. Research limitations/implications: Selected examples of the heat treatment have been presented for aluminum based alloys only. The current research addresses Mg and Ti based alloys and thermal processing under vacuum and inert/active environments. Practical implications: The presented methodology is capable of dissecting all processes and linking the cast component’s optimized performance with individual production steps. The technical capabilities of the UMSA Platform have been recognized and have already been applied by industrial partners. Originality/value: The simulation method that is presented here will greatly improve the ability of laboratory investigators to simulate and assess the effects of the heat treatment variables...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Development of the {{understanding}} of the effect of the solidification rate with the alloy microstructures for the structural AM 60 B and the creep resistant AE 44 Mg casting alloys. Design/methodology/approach: Tubular <b>macro</b> <b>test</b> samples of magnesium alloys AM 60 B and AE 44 were melted and quenched at maximum instantaneous cooling rates ranging from - 5 °C/s to - 500 °C/s in the Universal Metallurgical Simulator and Analyzer (UMSA) Technology Platform while recording the temperature-time traces. Such rapid cooling rates are typical in water-cooled dies used in high pressure die casting (HPDC). Characteristic reactions on these curves corresponding to the formation of individual phases during solidification were quantified based on cooling curve analysis combined with metallographic and micro-chemical analysis, with the aid of literature data. Findings: The results indicate that these phases, their size and location in the microstructure, their chemistry and their relative proportions all change in response to the increase in the cooling rate. The results are drastically different for the two alloy systems studied. Solidification of AM 60 B alloy yields small, equiaxed a-Mg rosettes whose size is mostly independent of the cooling rate. These rosettes nucleate heterogeneously on Al 8 Mn 5 phases that are first to form, and are surrounded by the eutectic structure of Mg and Mg 17 Al 12. In contrast, the AE 44 has very large a-Mg grains at all cooling rates. These grains are filled with Al 11 RE 3 platelets or dendrites. Results suggest that the Al 11 Re 3 phase is completely ineffective in heterogeneous nucleation of a-Mg grains. Originality/value: In this research the authors significantly extended the thermal analysis methodology. The specific results obtained on the structural and creep-resistant Mg casting alloys are of significant value to the development of automotive light metal structures and power train components as well as further development of solidification codes for the commercial HPDC process...|$|E

40|$|<b>Macro</b> stress <b>tests</b> and crises: {{what can}} we learn? 1 Few, if any, of the <b>macro</b> stress <b>tests</b> {{undertaken}} before the current crisis uncovered significant vulnerabilities. This article examines {{the reasons for the}} poor performance by comparing the outcomes of simple stress tests with actual events for a large sample of historical banking crises. The results highlight that the structural assumptions underlying stress testing models do not match output growth around many crises. Furthermore, unless macro conditions are already weak prior to the eruption of the crisis, the vast majority of stress scenarios based on historical data are not severe enough. Last, stress testing models are not robust, as statistical relationships tend to break down during crises. These insights have important implications for the design and conduct of stress tests in the future. JEL classification: E 44, G 01, G 17. The current crisis has underlined the importance of complementing the microprudential approach to regulation and supervision with a macroprudential perspective. One important issue is how to measure vulnerabilities and risks on a system-wide level. 2 <b>Macro</b> stress <b>tests</b> are seen as a promising tool. Central banks and the IMF had made extensive use of stress tests prior to the crisis, but generally without identifying significant vulnerabilities. For example, over a third of the countries considered in this article published <b>macro</b> stress <b>testing</b> results as part of an IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program in 2005, 2006 or the first half of 2007. The overwhelming majority concluded that their banking systems were robust {{even in the face of}} very severe adverse scenarios. 3 To be sure, not all of these countries subsequently experienced a full-blown banking crisis.

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{comparison}} between the characterisation of material properties on micro and macro scale was made. Spherical indentations were performed at the micro scale while tensile experiments represent the macro scale behaviour. The samples for both types of experiments were made of the same polyurethane elastomer sheet film. The experimental test setups were load controlled and consisted of a loading phase followed by a holding phase in which the material exhibited a creep response under a fixed load. In order to visualise and quantify the occurring strain levels during the indentation experiment, a FE-model was build. Based {{on the outcome of}} this FE-model, the <b>macro</b> tensile <b>test</b> setup was established. According to this procedure, the material experienced a similar level of deformation during both types of testing. As described by M. Oyen (J. Mater Res., 20, 2094 - 2100, 2005) the standard linear solid model was applied to capture the material behaviour during indentation testing. The model was adapted for <b>macro</b> tensile <b>testing</b> and applied to fit the experimental data. This fitting procedure was executed through the use of different scripts and revealed quantitative values for all components (spring and time constants) of the standard linear solid model. The dependence of the results on different loading rates and hold values was investigated. The results of these experiments indicate an overall stiffer response of the material during the nanoindentation tests compared to the <b>macro</b> tensile <b>tests.</b> This observation {{can be explained by the}} obstruction of the poisson effect during the indentation test. An extra boundary condition like biaxial tensile tests could be introduced in the future in the <b>macro</b> scale <b>tests.</b> The influence of the loading rate and hold value was minimal and validated the use of a linear viscoelastic analysis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Memory arrays {{cannot be}} as easily tested as other storage {{elements}} in a chip. Most of the flip-flops (FFs) in a chip can be replaced by scan cells in scan-based design. However, the bits in memory arrays cannot be replaced by scan cells, due to the area cost and the timing-critical nature {{of many of the}} paths into and out of memories. Thus, bits in a memory array can be considered non-scan storage elements. Test methods such as memory built-in self-test (MBIST), functional test, and <b>macro</b> <b>test</b> are used to test memory arrays. However, these tests aren?t sufficient to test the paths through the memory arrays. During structural (scan) test generation, memory arrays are treated as ?black boxes? or memory arrays are bypassed to a known value. Black boxes decrease coverage loss while bypassing increases chip area and delay. Path delay test through memory arrays is proposed using pseudo functional test (PFT) with K Longest Paths Per Gate (KLPG). In this technique, any longest path that is captured into a non-scan cell (including a memory cell) is propagated to a scan cell. The propagation of the captured value from non-scan cell to scan cell occurs during low-speed clock cycles. In this work, we assume that only one extra coda cycle is sufficient to propagate the captured value to a scan cell. This is true if the output of the memory feeds combinational logic that in turn feeds scan cells. When we want to launch a transition from a memory output, different values are written into different address locations and the address is toggled between the locations. The ATPG writes the different values into the memory cells during the preamble cycles. In the case of launching a transition out of a non-scan cell, the cell must be written with an initial value during the preamble cycles, and the next value set on the non-scan cell input. Thus, it is possible to capture and launch transitions into and from memory and non-scan cells and thus test the path delay of the longest paths into and out of memory and non-scan cells...|$|E
40|$|As {{satellite}} missions {{begin to}} require smaller satellites, launch systems and attitude control thrusters of reduced mass will be required. Microrocket engines {{could provide a}} low mass, high specific impulse, modular answer to these needs. These small rocket engines would produce thrust of order of 10 's of Newtons at a thrust-to-weight of over 1000, over 10 times the thrust-to-weight of conventional chemical liquid bipropellant engines. The first microrocket engine thrust chamber and nozzle design measures 18 x 14 x 3 mm and is fabricated from single crystal silicon using MEMS microfabrication techniques offering the promise of low cost in production. This thesis describes an experimental investigation of bi-propellant microrocket engines and encompasses the fields of materials, microfabrication, combustion and chemical kinetics, instrumentation, packaging, and fluid dynamics. It builds on London's earlier gaseous propellant work, expanding the operating envelope of his motors to higher thrust levels and using these results to design liquid bi-propellant regeneratively cooled engines. Failure analysis of the original devices indicated failures were primarily caused by structural design flaws. Second generation gaseous propellant devices were built and tested. Providing reliable packaging interfaces between the <b>macro</b> <b>test</b> setup and the device proved very difficult. Two packaging methods involving modified geometries and glass seals were developed and allowed higher performance tests. Combustion experiments spanned a range of oxidizer-to-fuel ratios by mass of 1. 6 to 2. 5 and reached a maximum chamber pressure of 30 bar with a maximum thrust of 3 N at a thrust coefficient of 1. 12. A maximum c* of 1650 m/s has been recorded. (cont.) Experimental results were compared with CFD predictions which suggest that the low thrust coefficient of these devices {{is due to the}} overexpansion of gases in the nozzle at the test pressures in combination with the planar extruded nozzle geometry. CFD suggests that at higher chamber pressures the thrust coefficient will approach values up to 90 - 95 percent of the 1 -D ideal case. Experimental values of characteristic exhaust velocity are in agreement with non- adiabatic predictions indicating that combustion is nearly complete. The chamber pressure and thrust limits in the current devices are due to localized failures at bond interfaces in the coolant passages. The potential of the current design is limited to approximately 60 bar by the coolant passage pressure limit, chamber structural limit, and injector manifold pressure limit. Potential liquid propellants for a regeneratively cooled storable bipropellant microrocket engine are examined. The design space for devices using these propellants is explored based on the thermal, structural, and fabrication constraints, and a design for a regeneratively cooled microrocket engine utilizing liquid nitrogen tetroxide and liquid JP- 7 as propellants at a vacuum specific impulse of 267 s is presented. Directions for improved specific impulse engines include increasing the engine size by a factor of 2 to 4 and continuing research on hydrogen peroxide as a coolant. by Christopher S. Protz.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{framework}} for <b>macro</b> stress <b>testing</b> of China's banking system.

Following the financial crisis, banks and regulators are increasingly relying on stress tests to understand portfolio risk. Particularly important has been <b>macro</b> stress <b>testing</b> in which the effects of macroeconomic scenarios on bank portfolios are traced through. The second exercise builds on Pesaran, Schuermann, and Weiner (2004) in devising and implementing <b>macro</b> stress <b>testing</b> techniques for a bank credit portfolio. In contrast to this and earlier studies, richer dependencies of credit market conditions on macroeconomic variables are developed. Specifically, the model allows sovereign ratings, the credit quality of corporate credit exposures (categorized by rating and maturity) and credit spreads to be driven by macroeconomic developments The challenges in understanding enterprise-wide risk are exacerbated when very different financial organizations are combined. The third exercise devises a unified framework for analysing risk in bancassurance organizations and employs this to examine the diversification benefits of conglomerates involving general insurance and traditional banking.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model to conduct <b>macro</b> stress <b>test</b> of credit risk for the banking system based on {{scenario}} analysis. We employ an original bank level data set with disaggregated credit loans for business and consumer loans. The results corroborate {{the presence of a}} strong procyclical behavior of credit quality, and show a robust negative relationship between (the logistic transformation of) NPLs and GDP growth, with a lag response up to three quarters. The models also indicate substantial variations in the cyclical behavior of NPLs across credit types. Stress tests suggest that the banking system is well prepared to absorb the credit losses associated with a set of distressed macroeconomic scenarios without threatening financial stability. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} stress tests {{encompassing}} the entire banking sector (<b>macro</b> stress <b>tests)</b> {{can be designed}} to improve welfare. We develop a multi-receiver framework of Bayesian persuasion {{to show that a}} banking supervisor can create value when he commits to disclose the stress-testing methodology (signal-generating process) together with the stress test result (signal). By optimally choosing the two signals, supervisors can deliver superior information that will deliver a higher expected utility to prudent investors when acting accordingly. The paper uses an equilibrium construction with a continuum of receivers. We find that banking supervisors create welfare as optimal disclosure reduces uncertainty and leads to better risk-adjusted behavior on the investors' side and to less financial market volatility...|$|R
