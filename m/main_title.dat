5|$|Elliot Goldenthal {{was hired}} by Schumacher to compose the film score before the {{screenplay}} was written. In discussions with Schumacher, the director wanted Goldenthal to avoid taking inspiration from Danny Elfman, and requested an original composition.

5|$|Many of {{the iconic}} {{aspects of a}} typical James Bond film were {{established}} in Dr. No: the film begins with {{an introduction to the}} character through the view of a gun barrel and a highly stylised <b>main</b> <b>title</b> sequence, both created by Maurice Binder. Production designer Ken Adam established an elaborate visual style {{that is one of the}} hallmarks of the film series.|$|E

5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>title</b> music, a tense, hurtling piece, {{sets the}} tone of {{impending}} violence, and returns three times on the soundtrack. Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15–20 minutes of the film, the title music remains in the audience's mind, lending tension to these early scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film {{through the use of}} ostinato.|$|E
5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were {{still to be}} filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the Red Grant training sequence {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the <b>main</b> <b>title),</b> a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E

5|$|Despite early success, the series, {{along with}} the overall rhythm game genre, {{suffered}} from poor sales starting in 2009. Company spokesman Eric Hollreiser said consumer research suggested continued solid demand for the series. Still, by early 2011, Activision stated that the series was on hiatus for 2011, while a seventh <b>main</b> <b>title</b> in the series was under development; this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product. Activision later shut down sales of the series' downloadable content, although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what they bought.|$|E

5|$|Forward Unto Dawn {{received}} a Streamy Award {{and several of}} the crew {{received a}}wards for their work editing, producing and filming of it. The series also won a Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award for sound editing. Reviewers were impressed by the special effects and action-packed second act, but found that the plot was too slow {{in the first half and}} most of the characters were under-developed. The series was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for <b>main</b> <b>title</b> design.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{the success}} of A Real American Hero lead Marvel to produce a second title: G.I. Joe: Special Missions which lasted 28 issues. Herb Trimpe was the artist {{for most of the}} run, with Dave Cockrum {{providing}} pencils on several issues. Spinning out of G.I. Joe #50 and set in the same continuity, the series presented more intense violence and a more ambiguous morality than the <b>main</b> <b>title,</b> and the Joes faced enemies who were not related to Cobra. Each issue usually featured a stand-alone mission focusing on a small group of Joes.|$|E
