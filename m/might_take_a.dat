25|$|As long as Australia has Bradman {{she will}} be invincible...To keep alive the {{competitive}} spirit, the authorities <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> hint from billiards. It is almost time to request a legal limit {{on the number of}} runs Bradman should be allowed to make.|$|E
25|$|A {{prospective}} study is forward-looking and includes subjects {{who did not}} originally have symptoms of the disease being studied. Many retrospective, or backward-looking, studies <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> group of alcoholics and try to determine what common traits might have caused their alcoholism. A {{prospective study}} takes a group of healthy individuals and tries to predict which ones would become alcoholic based on their histories—a much broader technique that often yields surprising results.|$|E

50|$|Both these {{algorithms}} are infinite: {{the first}} is continuous and the second <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> infinite time to converge. In fact, envy-free divisions of connected intervals to 3 or more people cannot be found by any finite protocol.|$|R
25|$|The {{controller}} {{monitors the}} speed sensors at all times. It {{is looking for}} decelerations in the wheel {{that are out of}} the ordinary. Right before a wheel locks up, it will experience a rapid deceleration. If left unchecked, the wheel would stop much more quickly than any car could. It <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> car five seconds to stop from 60mph (96.6km/h) under ideal conditions, but a wheel that locks up could stop spinning in less than a second.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} pains as special qualia known {{absolutely}} but exclusively by the solitary minds that perceive them, {{this may be}} taken to ground a Cartesian view {{of the self and}} consciousness. Our consciousness, of pains anyway, would seem unassailable. Against this, one might acknowledge the absolute fact of one's own pain, but claim skepticism about the existence of anyone else's pains. Alternatively, one <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> behaviorist line and claim that our pains are merely neurological stimulations accompanied by a disposition to behave.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, Burnett enlisted as {{a private}} in the Imperial Yeomanry in order {{to fight in the}} Second Boer War. Burnett claimed to be 18 when he was in fact only 17. He was {{discharged}} in 1901 in order that he <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> commission and he was gazetted as a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry in October 1901. Burnett was then attached to the Imperial Yeomanry for the next three years. He temporarily held the rank of lieutenant from 26 April 1902 to 7 February 1903.|$|E
5000|$|This {{resulted}} in {{nearly half of}} the book being devoted to combat tables, and correspondingly long and complex combat. A simple one on one confrontation <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> hour or more. A simplified version of the combat rules, using only 6 body areas, and correspondingly fewer tables, is also given, and does cut down on some of the complexity.|$|R

25|$|After the {{departure}} of long time Cowboy favorites DE/LB DeMarcus Ware and DT Jason Hatcher to free agency, coupled with a season ending knee injury to MLB Sean Lee during Organized Team Activity in late May, the Dallas Cowboys, {{were one of the}} most heavily admonished, and second guessed NFL franchises through the entire preseason, and half-way into the 2014 regular season. Much of the criticism was in response to the Cowboys selecting Notre Dame offensive guard Zack Martin over the perceived Cowboys savior (Texas A QB Johnny Manziel) {{in the first round of}} the NFL draft. Even Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was uncharacteristically down playing expectations for the upcoming season during spring training, emphasizing to the media and fans, that it <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> little more time for the Cowboys young players to mature into a NFL championship caliber team.|$|E
500|$|A more {{moderate}} conception has been expounded by Thomas Nagel, {{which holds that}} the mind body problem is currently unsolvable at the present stage of scientific development and that it <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> future scientific paradigm shift or revolution to bridge the explanatory gap. Nagel posits {{that in the future}} a sort of [...] "objective phenomenology" [...] might be able {{to bridge the gap between}} subjective conscious experience and its physical basis.|$|E
500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she looks as if she <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> bite out of the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate {{when you look back}} on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E
50|$|The painter {{plasters}} and paints only {{as much as}} can {{be completed}} in a day, which explains the Italian term for each of these sections, giornata, or a day's work. The size of a giornata varies according to the complexity of the painting within it. A face, for instance, <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> entire day, whereas large areas of sky can be painted quite rapidly.|$|R
60|$|The Dowager {{expressed}} her lively satisfaction at this intelligence, {{and with}} some general opinions upon young hussies as a race, and especially upon their demerits after being spoiled by Miss Dombey, withdrew to prepare the Nipper's wages. Susan then bestirred herself to get her trunks in order, that she <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> immediate and dignified departure; sobbing heartily all the time, as she thought of Florence.|$|R
6000|$|... "The wild {{mountain}} {{heart is}} faithful and true. Yonder man {{is more like}} the giants in romaunts than a man of mould like ourselves; and yet Christians <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> example from him for his lealty. A simple contrivance this, though, to finger a man from off their enemies' chequer, as if {{there would not be}} twenty of the wildcats ready to supply his place." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{graphics}} received mixed reviews. Sliva {{referred to}} the locations as [...] "visually interesting and varied", while VanOrd said the player [...] "can't help but gawk at the beautiful spectacle before [...]" [...] Juba liked the overall look and design of the main cast and environment, but critiqued the environment textures and NPCs. Elliot praised the CG cutscenes, but said that [...] "the tired, boxy side streets feel unfinished." [...] However, he further said that the expansive nature of environments balanced this issue out. The environments were praised by Famitsu, which stated that due to the expansive nature of the environments {{and the lack of}} hints concerning quests, new players <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> bit of time getting used to it. It also generally called the game [...] "quite nice".|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky began {{showing a}} keen {{interest}} in Glazunov shortly after hearing about the premiere of Glazunov's First Symphony from Taneyev. At that time, Tchaikovsky wrote Balakirev, [...] "Glazunov interests me greatly. Is there any chance that this young man could send me the symphony so that I <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> look at it? I should also like to know whether he completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help." [...] Balakirev replied, [...] "You ask about Glazunov. He is a very talented young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help." [...] Tchaikovsky studied the score for Glazunov's First String Quartet, and wrote his brother Modest, [...] "Despite its imitation of Korsakov ... a remarkable talent is discernible." [...] Glazunov later sent Tchaikovsky a copy of his Poème lyrique for orchestra, about which Tchaikovsky had written enthusiastically to Balakirev, and had recommended for publication to his publisher P. Jurgenson.|$|E
500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] {{took place}} in the Upper Boat Studios on 23 March 2012, alongside that for the episode [...] "Asylum of the Daleks". The final episode Gillan and Darvill shot as Amy and Rory was actually the previous episode, [...] "The Power of Three". Nevertheless, Gillan and Smith got very emotional filming the final graveyard scene. Amy and Rory's scene on the rooftop was filmed in a car park in Cardiff, Wales, with a greenscreen standing in for the New York skyline. To create the effect of the two plunging down, Gillan and Darvill were suspended upside-down by wires and raised and lowered. Much of the episode was filmed in Central Park in New York City in April 2012. The filming was attended by thousands of American fans, which surprised the cast and crew. Other scenes were shot at night in the city, {{as well as by the}} East River in front of the Brooklyn Bridge and in the Tudor City apartment complex. Moffat was in New York City when he came up with the story, and thought it was appropriate for the Weeping Angels. He described the city as [...] "a different backdrop" [...] to shoot a Doctor Who story in, and made use of its architecture. Fellow executive producer Caroline Skinner felt that the location [...] "has such scale and romance" [...] which [...] " [...] the episode a real atmosphere and a very different tone for Doctor Who". The week spent filming in the city was done by a [...] "small unit by American standards" [...] according to producer Marcus Wilson. They did not take any props of Angels or the TARDIS, which were instead added in post-production. Filming for the episode also occurred at a cemetery in Llanelli. During post-production, the New York skyline was inserted into the cemetery scenes. Gillan insisted on reading Amy's afterword to Smith when his reaction was filmed. They were not expecting it to be in front of a crowd in Central Park, and Smith said he had to [...] "treat this like a play". Because the content was so secret, Gillan had to read very quietly and Smith could not hold the real page because a spectator <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> picture of it. Gillan found that she only had one page of the script, and had to improvise the rest.|$|E

50|$|If {{we want to}} {{make sure}} that Alice gets an IA over a {{specific}} player (e.g. Bob), then a much more complicated procedure is required. It successively divides the cake to smaller and smaller pieces, always giving Alice a piece that she values more than Bob's, so that an IA is maintained. This <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> unbounded time - depending on the exact valuations of Alice and Bob.|$|R
5000|$|The {{severity}} of different AI risk scenarios is widely debated, and {{rests on a}} number of unresolved questions about future progress in computer science. Two sources of concern are that a sudden and unexpected [...] "intelligence explosion" [...] <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> unprepared human race by surprise, and that controlling a superintelligent machine (or even instilling it with human-compatible values) may be an even harder problem than naively supposed.|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, in an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Westerberg mentioned that the Replacements had been considering a reunion. He said, [...] "We'll get together again one day. It will take a while, or it <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few legal swipes of the pen, but we ain't over." [...] A partial reunion nearly occurred in March 2002, when Tommy Stinson planned to join Westerberg {{on a tour of the}} Midwest, but Stinson's prior commitments with Guns n' Roses prevented it from happening.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{difficulty}} in reaching molecular nanotechnology is design. [...] Hand {{design of a}} gear or bearing {{at the level of}} atoms <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few to several weeks. While Drexler, Merkle and others have created designs of simple parts, no comprehensive design effort for anything approaching the complexity of a Model T Ford has been attempted. [...] Advocates respond {{that it is difficult to}} undertake a comprehensive design effort in the absence of significant funding for such efforts, and that despite this handicap much useful design-ahead has nevertheless been accomplished with new software tools that have been developed, e.g., at Nanorex.|$|E
2500|$|Half Tricks: In this variation, {{the first}} partner {{of a team}} to bid may, if he chooses, bid tricks in {{increment}} of one-half instead of one, i.e. [...] "I bid three-and-one-half". His partner is then required to bid such that the team bid rounds out to a whole number, i.e. [...] "I'll bid two-and-one-half" [...] for a team bid of six tricks. This gives some information between partners; a player is bidding that they will take three tricks and <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> fourth. Their partner can then use this in determining {{the other half of}} the partnership's bid.|$|E
60|$|Look at all {{the things}} they can learn to do. Read with their fingers. Tune pianos. Or we are {{surprised}} they have any brains. Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday. Hates sewing. <b>Might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> objection. Dark men they call them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that my {{explanation}} may disillusion you but {{it has always been}} my habit to hide none of my methods, either from my friend Watson or from any one who <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> intelligent interest in them. But, first, as I am rather shaken by the knocking about which I had in the dressing-room, I think that I shall help myself to a dash of your brandy, Colonel. My strength had been rather tried of late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>might</b> <b>take</b> you <b>a</b> {{week or two}} if {{you went}} on foot through the mud," [...] {{answered}} the second man. And then he continued: [...] "I suppose you came from a distance, eh?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The show {{featured}} {{a panel of}} four celebrities who questioned the contestants. On the initial program of February 2, 1950, the panel was former New Jersey governor Harold Hoffman, columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, poet Louis Untermeyer, and psychiatrist Richard Hoffmann. [...] The panel varied somewhat in the following weeks, but {{after the first few}} broadcasts, during the show's earliest period the panel generally consisted of Kilgallen, actress Arlene Francis, Untermeyer and comedy writer Hal Block. [...] At various times, a regular panelist <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> vacation or be absent from an episode to due outside commitments; on these occasions, a guest panelist would take their spot. The most frequent guest panelist was Arlene Francis's husband Martin Gabel, who appeared 112 times over the years.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, it <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> {{very long}} time for a signal from the {{flagship}} to be relayed to the entire formation. It was usually necessary for a signal to be confirmed by each ship {{before it could be}} relayed to other ships, and an order for a fleet movement would have to be received and acknowledged by every ship before it could be executed. In a large single-column formation, a signal could take 10 minutes or more to be passed {{from one end of the}} line to the other, whereas in a formation of parallel columns, visibility across the diagonals was often better (and always shorter) than in a single long column, and the diagonals gave signal [...] "redundancy", increasing the probability that a message would be quickly seen and correctly interpreted.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{device to}} {{compensate}} for this error was the mercury pendulum, invented by George Graham in 1721. [...] The liquid metal mercury expands in volume with temperature. In a mercury pendulum, the pendulum's weight (bob) is a container of mercury. With a temperature rise, the pendulum rod gets longer, but the mercury also expands and its surface level rises slightly in the container, moving its centre of mass closer to the pendulum pivot. By using the correct height of mercury in the container these two effects will cancel, leaving the pendulum's centre of mass, and its period, unchanged with temperature. Its main disadvantage was that when the temperature changed, the rod {{would come to the}} new temperature quickly but the mass of mercury <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> day or two to reach the new temperature, causing the rate to deviate during that time. [...] To improve thermal accommodation several thin containers were often used, made of metal. Mercury pendulums were the standard used in precision regulator clocks into the 20th century.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{very long}} time before Tom said 'Certainly;' so long, that he <b>might</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> nap in the interval, but he did say it at last.|$|R
6000|$|... "She has it, as I live!" [...] thought Tom to himself. [...] "'Frailty, thy name is woman!' The canting, little, methodistical humbug! She {{must have}} slipped it off my waist as I lay senseless. I suppose she means {{to keep it}} in pawn, till I redeem it by marrying her. Well I <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> uglier mate certainly; but when I do enter into the bitter bonds of matrimony, I should like to be sure, beforehand, that my wife was not a thief!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{driver had}} gone out to look after his horses. When questioned, he stated that they might return by a {{roundabout}} way through the village of Neckbury, but that it <b>might</b> <b>take</b> half <b>an</b> hour or so longer.|$|R
