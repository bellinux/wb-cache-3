2500|$|Hamburgers and veggie burgers {{served with}} chips and salad, are {{standard}} pub grub menu items. Many pubs specialize in [...] "gourmet" [...] burgers. These are usually high quality <b>minced</b> <b>steak</b> patties, topped with {{items such as}} blue cheese, brie, avocado et cetera. Some British pubs serve burger patties made from more exotic meats including venison burgers (sometimes nicknamed Bambi Burgers), bison burgers, ostrich burgers and in some Australian themed pubs even kangaroo burgers can be purchased. These burgers are served {{in a similar way}} to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce including redcurrant sauce, mint sauce and plum sauce.|$|E
50|$|Beefsteak is {{typically}} used, although other meats such as lamb and pork {{may also be}} used. Ground, chopped, or <b>minced</b> <b>steak</b> {{is typically}} used in a steakburger. The steak meat may also be prepared using a food processor. In Australia a steak burger or steak sandwich always contains a whole steak fillet; ground meat would not be used. Steak burgers may be cooked to various temperatures, such as medium-rare. Some steak burgers are prepared using Angus beef.|$|E

5000|$|Georgie Pie - A flaking pie pastry {{containing}} either <b>Steak</b> <b>Mince</b> And Cheese or Bacon and Egg.|$|R
5000|$|August 2014 McDonald's Sutton Forest and Sutton Forest Southbound {{stores in}} NSW Australia are selling <b>Steak</b> <b>Mince</b> 'n' Cheese Georgie Pies for $3.95 'for {{a limited time}} only' between 5am and 11pm.|$|R
5000|$|Bridies {{are said}} [...] "to have been 'invented' by a Forfar baker in the 1850s". The name may {{refer to the}} pie's {{frequent}} presence on wedding menus, or to Margaret Bridie of Glamis, [...] "who sold them at the Buttermarket in Forfar". They are similar to pasties, {{but because they are}} made without potatoes, are much lighter in texture. Bakers in Forfar traditionally use shortcrust pastry for their bridies, but in the rest of Scotland, flaky pastry is preferred. The filling of a bridie consists of <b>minced</b> <b>steak,</b> butter, and beef suet seasoned with salt and pepper. It is sometimes made with minced onions. Before being baked, the bridie's filling is placed on pastry dough, which is then folded into a semi-circular or triangular shape; finally, the edges are crimped. If the baker pokes one hole in the top of a bridie, this indicates that it is plain, or without onions; two holes means that it does contain onions.|$|E
50|$|Kangaroo {{meat was}} legalized for human {{consumption}} in South Australia in 1980, and in all other Australian states in 1993. Kangaroo was once limited in availability, although consumption in Australia is becoming more widespread. However, only 14.5% of Australians were reported in 2008 as eating kangaroo meat {{at least four times}} per year. Many Australian supermarkets now stock various cuts of kangaroo including fillets, <b>steaks,</b> <b>minced</b> meat and 'Kanga Bangas' (kangaroo sausages). Many Australian restaurants serve kangaroo meat.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, the New Zealand {{affiliate}} {{bought out}} failing local fast food chain Georgie Pie, which based itself around Australian and New Zealand meat pies. McDonald's trialed a partial relaunch of the Georgie Pie brand in May 2013 with one pie flavor sold through eleven of its restaurants. In October 2013, the affiliate {{announced it would}} expand the sale of Georgie Pie to 107 of its 161 restaurants {{by the end of}} 2013. As of January 2017, two pie flavors are available: <b>Steak</b> <b>Mince</b> 'n' Cheese and Bacon 'n' Egg.|$|R
50|$|In 1977, {{during the}} time that American fast food {{restaurants}} moved into New Zealand, Progressive Enterprises created Georgie Pie, a fast food restaurant with a menu based on meat pies. The pies were batch made and frozen at Progressive's Mangere plant. The first Georgie Pie restaurant opened in Kelston, Auckland, and at its peak in the mid-1990s had become a chain of 32 restaurants across New Zealand. However, after a major expansion, Georgie Pie became uneconomic to run and was eventually sold to McDonald's New Zealand in 1996. The last restaurant at Mission Bay, Auckland, closed in 1998. In June 2013, McDonald's started a trial relaunch of Georgie Pie, selling one flavour of pie (<b>Steak</b> <b>Mince</b> 'n' Cheese) through eleven of its restaurants in Auckland and Hamilton.|$|R
50|$|On 9 May 2013, McDonald's {{announced}} {{the return of}} Georgie Pie on a trial basis. From 5 June 2013, the original recipe <b>Steak</b> <b>Mince</b> 'n' Cheese pie (minus the monosodium glutamate) has been sold for $4.50 at the Queen Street and Greenlane McDonald's restaurants (the latter being a former Georgie Pie restaurant) in Auckland. The trial was quickly expanded to five more McDonald's restaurants in Auckland (including at Kelston, {{the location of the}} original Georgie Pie restaurant), three restaurants in Hamilton, and the Te Awamutu restaurant. The relaunch proved so popular that special queues and security staff were brought in to handle the crowds. At times, the lines went out of the restaurant and stretched across the car park. In July 2013, the trial was expanded to four more Auckland restaurants, as well as two restaurants in Palmerston North, and restaurants in Feilding and Bulls.|$|R
50|$|In Iceland, {{it is both}} eaten <b>minced</b> and as <b>steak,</b> {{also used}} in stews and fondue, prized for its strong flavor. It has a {{particular}} role in the culture {{and history of the}} island. The people of Iceland supposedly were reluctant to embrace Christianity for some time largely over the issue of giving up horse meat after Pope Gregory III banned horse meat consumption in 732 AD, as it was a major part of many pagan rites and sacrifice in Northern Europe. Horse meat consumption was banned when the pagan Norse Icelanders eventually adopted Christianity in the year 1000. The ban became so ingrained that most people would not handle horse meat let alone consume it. Even during harsh famines in the 18th Century most people would not eat horse meat, and those who did were castigated. In 1757 the ban was decriminalised, but general distaste for horse meat lasted well into the 19th Century, possibly longer and its consumption often regarded as an indication of poverty. Even today horse meat is not popular (3.2% of Iceland’s meat production in 2015), although this {{has more to do with}} culinary tradition and the popularity of equestrianism than any religious vestiges.|$|R
