25|$|None of the Macau {{hospitals}} are independently assessed through international healthcare accreditation. There are no western-style medical schools in Macau, and thus all aspiring physicians in Macau have to obtain {{their education and}} qualification elsewhere. Local nurses are trained at the Macau Polytechnic Institute and the Kiang Wu Nursing College. Currently there are no training courses in midwifery in Macau. A study by the University of Macau, commissioned by the <b>Macau</b> <b>SAR</b> government, concluded that Macau {{is too small to}} have its own medical specialist training centre.|$|E
25|$|Although Hong Kong SAR and <b>Macau</b> <b>SAR</b> are {{constituents}} of China, they maintain their own immigration policies, which are vastly {{different from those}} of Mainland China, and individual border controls, which separate the territories from the Mainland. The Chinese government, however, does not consider Chinese nationals with resident status of Hong Kong and Macau travelling to China as international travelers, and hence the SAR passports or British National (Overseas) passports cannot be used when entering or transiting through China, regardless of whether they are arriving from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan or from overseas.|$|E

50|$|Under One Country Two Systems, {{legislation}} in mainland China {{does not apply}} in Hong Kong and <b>Macau</b> <b>SARs</b> {{and there are no}} similar restrictions in the SARs. Therefore, the GPS shift problem does not apply. However, at the border between the SARs and mainland China, the data shown by online maps are broken where the shifted data and correct data overlap. This poses problems to users travelling across the border, especially visitors not aware of the issue.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese People's Congress have {{granted the}} powers to naturalize non-Chinese {{nationals}} to Governments of Hong Kong and <b>Macau</b> <b>SARs,</b> so the naturalization process {{in these two}} territories is different than the process in Mainland China. In Hong Kong, the Immigration Department is responsible for naturalization applications, and its equivalent in Macau, Direcção dos Serviços Identificação (abbreviated DSI, known in English as the Identification Services Bureau) is responsible for applications filed in Macau. The ultimate decisions are made by the officials in either departments. In Mainland China, one must file an application to the sub-divisions of Ministry of Public Security.|$|R
25|$|The {{government}} in Macau {{is headed by}} the Chief Executive of Macau, who is appointed by the central government upon the recommendation of an election committee, whose three hundred members are nominated by corporate and community bodies. The recommendation is made by an election within the committee. The chief executive's cabinet {{is made up of}} five policy secretaries and is advised by the Executive Council of Macau, which has between seven and eleven members. Edmund Ho, a community leader and former banker, was the first chief executive of the <b>Macau</b> <b>SAR,</b> replacing General Vasco Rocha Vieira at midnight on 20 December 1999. Fernando Chui is the current Chief Executive. The chief executive and the cabinet have their offices in the Macau Government Headquarters, located in the area of São Lourenço.|$|E

500|$|The Regional {{flag of the}} Macau Special Administrative Region is [...] "Macau green" [...] with a lotus flower above {{a stylized}} image of the Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge and water in white, beneath an arc of five gold, five-pointed stars: one large star {{in the center of}} the arc and four smaller ones. The lotus was chosen as the floral emblem of Macau. The Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge is a bridge linking the Macau Peninsula and the island of Taipa. The bridge is one of the most {{recognizable}} landmarks of the territory. The water beneath the lotus and the bridge symbolize Macau's position as a port and its role played in the territory. The five five-pointed stars echo the design of the national flag, symbolizing the relationship Macau has with its mother country. The design was chosen on 15 January 1993 by a committee that was drafting the Basic Law for the <b>Macau</b> <b>SAR</b> and was formally adopted by the <b>Macau</b> <b>SAR</b> Preparatory Committee on 16 January 1999. The flag was first officially hoisted on 20 December 1999, in the handover ceremony marking the transfer of sovereignty from Portugal to China.|$|E
50|$|The {{governments of}} Hong Kong and <b>Macau</b> <b>SARs</b> {{require that the}} {{applicant}} must still have his PR status in Hong Kong or Macau prior to the restoration of one's Chinese nationality and currently residing in Hong Kong or Macau {{at the time of}} application. Non-Chinese national's PR status usually expires after 36 months of continuous absence from Hong Kong or Macau and can only be recovered after seven years of continuous residence, although it is possible for an ex-Chinese national to retain the status by visiting Hong Kong or Macau at least once every 36 months. Simply visiting Hong Kong or Macau as a PR is insufficient for the restoration.|$|R
50|$|The {{legal system}} is {{based largely on}} Portuguese law. The {{territory}} has its own independent judicial system, with a high court. Judges are selected by a committee and appointed by the chief executive. Foreign judges may serve on the courts. In July 1999 the chief executive appointed a seven-person committee to select judges for the SAR. Twenty-four judges were recommended by the committee and were then appointed by Mr. Ho. Included are three judges who serve on the <b>Macau</b> <b>SAR's</b> highest court, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA): 39-year-old Sam Hou Fai (who will be chief justice), 32-year-old Chu Kin, and the 46-year-old Viriato Manuel Pinhiero de Lima.|$|R

50|$|Citizens of the People's Republic of China who are {{residents}} of the mainland are required to apply for exit and entry endorsements in order to enter the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and <b>Macau</b> (and <b>SAR</b> residents require a Home Return Permit to visit the mainland).

2500|$|Therefore, {{in order}} to enter Mainland China, all {{permanent}} residents and some non-permanent residents of Hong Kong SAR and <b>Macau</b> <b>SAR</b> with Chinese nationality are required {{to apply for a}} Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents (commonly called a [...] "Home Return Permit"), a travel document which also serves as the de facto ID card in Mainland China. The permit is valid for 5 years for individuals under 18 or 10 years for those over 18. All first-time applicants must submit their applications to the China Travel Service (CTS) branch in Hong Kong or Macau while subsequent renewals of the permit can be done in either Mainland China or the two SARs. It is not possible to apply or renew the permit outside the PRC. Holders of the permit can enter Mainland China regardless of purpose of entry and can remain in Mainland China indefinitely, although their social benefits are restricted unlike Chinese nationals with residency in Mainland China. Home Return Permit holders also need to obtain an employment authorization from the municipal governments {{in order to}} work legally in Mainland China.|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, not all Chinese {{nationals}} in Hong Kong or Macau have a Home Return Permit. Unlike the compulsory Hong Kong Identity Card, {{application for}} a Home Return Permit is voluntary. Those who do not apply for the Permit are still eligible for an HKSAR passport issued by the Immigration Department of Hong Kong, or an MSAR passport by the Identification Services Bureau of <b>Macau.</b> The <b>SAR</b> passports are only issued to Chinese nationals with the right of abode in Hong Kong or Macau. The HKSAR passport allows the holder to travel to other countries and regions, {{but it may not}} be used for travelling to Macau. The HKSAR passport is also used as a travel document for travel to Taiwan in conjunction with the Exit and Entry Permit issued by the government of Republic of China. Chinese nationals holding an HKSAR passport cannot use it to enter Mainland China, and the HKSAR Government has stated that [...] "in line with the one country principle, it was considered inappropriate to adopt HKSAR passport as a travel document to enter the Mainland." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{sovereignty}} of Macau was transferred from Portugal to the People's Republic of China in 1999, the new government has continued to allow Macau to participate in international organisations and sporting events under the name [...] "Macau, China" [...] using the regional flag of the Macau Special Administrative Region. [...] In addition, the Macau Olympic Committee has participated in the National Games of China since 2011. Macau was elected as the host city of 2005 East Asian Games during the 11th General Assembly of East Asian Games Association in Guam in March 1996.

40|$|The moral, ethical, {{social, and}} {{political}} arguments for taking action {{on environmental issues}} are becoming more persuasive and more widely accepted. The hotel industry is also taking various initiatives {{for the sake of}} the environment, for economic reasons, or to build a positive image. Some hotels have gone one step further and adopted the internationally-recognized ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard. By applying the predictive model developed by Quazi et al. (Int. J. Manage. Sci., 29 (6) (2001) 525), this study investigates and identifies a number of variables to predict the motivation of hotels in adopting the ISO 14000 standards. Of the 1097 questionnaires mailed to hotels in the Hong Kong <b>SAR,</b> <b>Macau,</b> Shenzhen, and Guangzhou in China, 164 were returned. Using LISREL analysis, Quazi et al. ’s (Int. J. Manage. Sci., 29 (6) (2001) 525) model was found to not have a good fit with the sample data obtained from the hotel industry. An exploratory factor analysis was thereafter employed to identify interpretable orthogonal factors, resulting in the identification and interpretation of eight factors. By using a stepwise discriminant analysis, a predictive discriminant function was developed. Only two out of the eight variables were included in the model for the hotel industry.
