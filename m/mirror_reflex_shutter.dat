50|$|During {{his work}} for ARRI, he invented the {{spinning}} <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> <b>shutter</b> for film cameras, which was first used in the Arriflex 35 in 1937. It allows the operator to have a viewfinder image equal to the recorded picture.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, Arnold and Richter {{developed}} their first film camera, {{the small and}} portable Kinarri 35. In 1937, Arri introduced the world's first <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>shutter</b> in the Arriflex 35 camera, an invention of longtime engineer Erich Kästner. This technology employs a rotating mirror that allows a continuous motor to operate the camera while providing parallax-free reflex viewing to the operator, {{and the ability to}} focus the image by eye through the viewfinder, much like an SLR camera for still photography. The reflex design was subsequently used in almost every professional motion picture film camera and is still used in the Arri Alexa Studio digital camera. The first Hollywood film to employ an Arriflex was the 1947 Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall film Dark Passage in 1947. Over the years, more than 17,000 Arriflex 35s were built. The design was recognized with two Scientific and Technical Academy Awards in 1966 and 1982.|$|R
50|$|By then a chief designer, {{he decided}} to design a <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> camera, which materialised as the Edixa {{miniature}} reflex. Wirgin joined the club of the renowned <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> manufacturers. Waaske further designed all the successors to the Edixa, including the Edixamat reflex and the Edixa Electronica.|$|R
50|$|The Contaflex Alpha and Contaflex Beta, both {{introduced}} in 1957, {{were based on}} the same body but equipped with a Zeiss Pantar 45mm f:2.8 three-element lens and a Prontor <b>Reflex</b> <b>shutter</b> up to 1/300. They were the cheaper models of the line.The Alpha had no meter and the Beta had the selenium meter of the II and IV.|$|R
50|$|Conceptually {{intermediate}} {{between the}} Rangefinder Leicas and the SLR Leicas was the Leica Visoflex System, a <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> box that {{attached to the}} lens mount of Leica rangefinders (separate versions were made for the screwmount and M series bodies) and accepted lenses made especially for the Visoflex System. Rather than using the camera’s rangefinder, focusing was accomplished via a groundglass screen. A coupling released both mirror and shutter to make the exposure. Camera rangefinders are inherently limited {{in their ability to}} accurately focus long focal-length lenses and the <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> box permitted much longer length lenses. Throughout its history, Leitz has been responsible for numerous optical innovations, such as aspherical production lenses, multicoated lenses, and rare earth lenses.|$|R
25|$|Johann Zahn's Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium, {{published}} in 1685, contains many descriptions, diagrams, illustrations and sketches {{of both the}} camera obscura and the magic lantern. A hand-held device with a <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> mechanism was first proposed by Johann Zahn in 1685, a design that would later be used in photographic cameras.|$|R
50|$|The {{camera is}} {{equipped}} with the newly developed Prontor-Compur (PC) <b>reflex</b> <b>shutter,</b> which would {{pave the way for}} reputable camera designs such as the 1953 Contaflex, the 1956 Retina Reflex, the 1957 Hasselblad 500, and the 1959 Voigtländer Bessamatic. However, it does not have the built-in eye-level pentaprism finder, which was first seen on 35mm SLR cameras in 1949. Instead, it has a waist-level finder with a central split-image rangefinder complemented by large full frame magnifier incorporating a central loupe that covers the rangefinder central area.|$|R
5000|$|... 1962: Nikkorex Zoom 35 (Japan): first 35 mm SLR with fixed {{zoom lens}} (Zoom-Nikkor Auto 43-86mm f/3.5). Had non-pentaprism, four <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> {{viewfinder}} and leaf shutter. Fixed lens SLRs {{have been an}} occasional phenomenon bridging simpler viewfinder cameras and more ambitious interchangeable lens SLRs. Presently, they are off-again with non-SLR electronic viewfinder (EVF) superzoom digital cameras occupying this market segment.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989: Yashica Samurai Z-L (Japan): first SLR {{intentionally}} {{designed for}} left-handed operation. Took up to 72 exposures of horizontal 18×24 mm single frames (also called half frames) on 135 film. Had flat-topped non-pentaprism <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> and optical relay viewfinder. Also had unique-to-Samurai-series vertical body design with fixed autofocus 25-75mm f/4-5.6 zoom lens, interlens leaf shutter, programmed autoexposure, built-in motor drive and electronic flash. Was mirror copy of auto-everything, point-and-shoot Samurai Z camera.|$|R
5000|$|... 1972: Polaroid SX-70 (USA): first {{instant film}} SLR. Had non-pentaprism <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> system and {{electronic}} autoexposure in flat-folding body with bellows and fixed 116mm f/8 lens. Took ten exposure, 3⅛×3⅛ inch frame Polaroid SX-70 instant film packs. The principle of self-developing [...] "instant photography" [...] came to Edwin Land in 1943. The first production instant camera was the non-SLR Polaroid Land Model 95 (USA) of 1948, producing sepia-toned, peel-apart pictures. Steady improvements {{culminated in the}} seven year, nearly quarter-billion dollar SX-70 camera and film project to create full-color, self-contained, develop-before-your-eyes, [...] "garbage-free" [...] prints.|$|R
50|$|Digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLR) use a <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> {{that can}} reflect {{the light and}} also can swivel from one {{position}} to another position and back to initial position. By default, the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> is set 45 degree from horizontal, blocks the light to the sensor and reflects light from the lens to penta-mirror/prism at the DSLR camera and after some reflections arrives at the viewfinder. The <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> is pulled out horizontally below the penta-mirror/prism when shutter release is fully pressed, so the viewfinder will be dark and the light/image can directly strike the sensor {{at the time of}} exposure (speed setting).|$|R
5000|$|... 1996: Minolta Vectis S-1 (Japan/Malaysia): first Advanced Photo System (APS) IX240 film SLR. Took up {{to forty}} {{exposures}} of 16.7×30.2 mm frames on polyethylene naphthalate base, singly perforated 24 mm wide film coated with invisible magnetic data encoding stripe, pre-loaded into self-locking ready-to-use cartridges. Had flat-topped non-pentaprism sideways <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> and optical relay viewfinder. Compact design with good lenses and large accessory system. APS film {{was introduced by}} Kodak, Canon, Fuji, Minolta and Nikon in 1996 as Kodak's last attempt (of many) at drop-in film loading. APS was moderately popular, but faded quickly and almost dead by 2002.|$|R

5000|$|... 1676: Johann Sturm (Germany) {{described}} {{first known}} {{use of a}} <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> in a camera obscura. The camera obscura was known to Aristotle as an aid in observing solar eclipses, but its use as an artist's aid was first expounded by Giambattista della Porta (Italy) in 1558. The <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> corrected the up-down image reversal that could make using a non-SLR camera obscura disconcerting - but not the left-right reversal.|$|R
5000|$|Pellicle mirrors {{offer some}} of the {{advantages}} of a rangefinder camera in an SLR. When taking a picture with a typical SLR camera, the mirror must flip upwards {{to move out of the}} way to allow light to pass from the lens to the film plane (or digital image sensor). Moving the mirror produces noise, introduces vibration, and causes the viewfinder to [...] "black out". The camera also must have a slight delay between when the shutter release button is pressed, and when the shutter actually opens to allow time for the mirror to move. Quiet operation, low vibration, absence of blackout, and fast response are features usually associated with rangefinder cameras, as these cameras have no <b>mirror</b> <b>reflex</b> system between the lens and the film.|$|R
5000|$|Shutter lag may be diminished, and {{pictures}} taken {{at a faster}} rate, compared to systems employing a <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In still photography, a single-lens {{reflex camera}} {{requires}} {{a space for}} the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror,</b> imposing a limit {{on the use of}} wide-angle lenses of normal designs. The retrofocus lens addressed this situation by shifting the focal plane further back, thus making wider-angle lenses usable while retaining normal viewing and focusing. Unless the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> were locked in the [...] "up" [...] position, blacking out the viewfinder, the rearmost element of a non-retrofocal lens would be in the way as the mirror flipped up and down during exposure.|$|R
50|$|The Canon Pellix is {{a manual}} focus camera {{released}} in 1965 {{that uses a}} semitransparent stationary <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> behind which a metering cell is raised during the reading.|$|R

5000|$|... 2010: Sony SLT α33 and SLT α55 (Japan): first SLRs {{without an}} optical viewfinder. What {{appears to be}} a {{pentaprism}} head is a high resolution electronic viewfinder (EVF). Had 16.2 MP (α55) or 14.2 MP (α33) APS-sized CMOS sensors with secondary 1080i high definition video capture. Also had a swiveling live view LCD panel. The SLTs' fixed so-called [...] "Translucent <b>Mirror</b> Technology" [...] <b>reflex</b> <b>mirrors</b> (a revival of pellicle mirrors Canon Pellix above) siphon off light to their fifteen phase comparison autofocus sensors to provide continuous autofocusing in their HD video mode.|$|R
5000|$|... 1965: Canon Pellix (Japan): first (really {{second after}} french Focaflex of 1959) {{pellicle}} <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> SLR. Virtually all SLRs use fast-moving <b>reflex</b> <b>mirrors</b> that swivel {{out of the}} way to take the picture, causing mirror shock vibration, blacking-out the viewfinder and delaying shutter firing. Camera shake can blur the image and the subject (which might have moved) cannot be seen at the instant of exposure. A fixed semi-transparent pellicle <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror,</b> reflecting 30% of the light to the viewfinder and transmitting 70% to the film, prevents camera shake and viewfinder blackout, and reduces shutter lag time at the costs of a dimmer viewfinder image, longer exposure times and possible image quality loss. Modern instant return mirrors are fast enough and have efficient enough shock damping systems that the trade offs are not usually considered worthwhile. Pellicle mirror SLRs are very rare and are usually specialized designs for ultra-high speed (10+ frames per second) sequence shooting.|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, {{some have}} applied the misnomer ZLR to any camera superficially {{resembling}} an SLR {{whether or not}} it actually had a <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror,</b> e.g. the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8. (See: Bridge camera) ...|$|R

50|$|The Hasselblad {{cameras were}} {{selected}} by NASA {{because of their}} interchangeable lenses and magazines.

5000|$|... 1861: Thomas Sutton (UK) {{received}} {{first patent}} for SLR photographic camera. An unknown number made but very few; no known production model; no known surviving examples. The manually levered <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> {{also served as}} the camera's shutter. Used glass plates.|$|R
50|$|Most SLR cameras permit {{upright and}} {{laterally}} correct viewing {{through use of}} a roof pentaprism situated in the optical path between the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> and viewfinder. Light, which comes both horizontally and vertically inverted after passing through the lens, is reflected upwards by the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror,</b> into the pentaprism where it is reflected several times to correct the inversions caused by the lens, and align the image with the viewfinder. When the shutter is released, the mirror moves out of the light path, and the light shines directly onto the film (or {{in the case of}} a DSLR, the CCD or CMOS imaging sensor). The Canon Pellix film camera was an exception to the moving mirror system, wherein the mirror was a fixed beamsplitting pellicle.|$|R
50|$|The instant clip-on {{design of}} the camera {{magazine}} of the Caméflex and later the NPR, ACL, EX16 and PANORAM models' coaxial magazines revolutionized filmmaking, in particular documentary films, since magazine changes could now be made in seconds without the need to spend time lacing the film in the camera. The ACL model used a focal plane shutter for exposure and a side-to-side oscillating <b>mirror</b> for <b>reflex</b> viewing to keep the camera body size to a minimum.

50|$|Cinematography uses a {{rotary disc}} shutter in movie cameras, a {{continuously}} spinning disc which conceals the image with a <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror</b> during the intermittent motion between frame exposure.

50|$|In photography, the {{pellicle}} mirror {{has been}} employed in single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras, {{at first to}} enable through-the-lens exposure measurement and possibly to reduce camera shake, but later most successfully to enable fast series photography, which otherwise would be slowed down by {{the movement of the}} <b>reflex</b> <b>mirror,</b> while maintaining constant finder vision.|$|R
50|$|This makes short-focus {{wide-angle}} lenses undesirable for single-lens reflex cameras {{unless they}} are used with the <b>reflex</b> <b>mirrors</b> locked up. On large format view cameras and rangefinder cameras, short-focus lenses are widely used because they give less distortion than the retrofocus design {{and there is no}} need for a long back focal distance.|$|R
