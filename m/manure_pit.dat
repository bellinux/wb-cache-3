A Belgian 5.9 inch gun, captured from the Germans at Pozières in France during World War I by the 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, was mounted on the grass outside the building. Living quarters for an Army staff officer were also added in 1934. The three bedroom timber house was constructed along Sylvan Road by builders NT Stansfield and Thomas Foster at a quoted price of £1500.

50|$|The Painted Bird is {{told from}} the {{perspective}} of a young boy during World War II. He is a Jewish stray struggling to live during this chaotic period, although Kosinski's narrator denies being Jewish. The story begins by introducing the war and linking it with the boy. The young boy's parents are hiding from the Germans, and he lives in a village with an elderly woman. When the woman dies, he is left to care for himself. From here, he journeys to another village where local townspeople turn him over to the Germans. He escapes and travels to another village, where he sees Jews and Gypsies headed to concentration camps. It is here that Kosinski adds some social commentary, describing the boy's belief that to have fair hair and blue eyes is to be favored by God. Kosinski sums up a Bosch-like world of harrowing excess where senseless violence and untempered hatred are the norm. The boy travels from village to village in Eastern Europe. Throughout the rest of the book, the boy endures various kinds of violence and cruelty. He wanders alone from one village to another, sometimes hounded and tortured, only rarely sheltered and cared for. He becomes an altar boy, and he is exposed to father-daughter incest. After being thrown into a <b>manure</b> <b>pit,</b> he becomes mute. Only at the end of the novel does he become reunited with his parents and regain his speech.|$|E

It is naked. It catches shrimp and crabs, and roasts them over fire and eats then. Such an animal is called Shanxiao. It cries in a way as if it is calling its own name. When a man offends such an animal, he will suffer from chills and fever. This is a disease caused by evil. The animal may appear anywhere. But it is afraid of the piercing noise of firecrackers. The book Youming Lü by Liu Yiqing: Among the mountain cliffs in Dongchang County, there is an animal that looks like a human being. It is four to five chi tall. It is naked and has disheveled hair, five to six cun long. It shouts loudly. It is very difficult to sight one. It turns over stones in streams to catch shrimp and crabs, which it roasts over a fire and eats. The book Yongji Ji: There is a kind of Shangui in Anguo County. It looks like a human being but has only one leg. It is just over one chi tall. It steals salt from woodcutters to eat with the stone crabs that it roasts over fire. Human beings dare not offend it. If a person offends or hurts such a creature, the person may become sick or his house will be burned down. The book Xuanzhong Ji: Shanjing looks like a human being. It has one leg and is about three to four chi tall. It eats mountain crabs. It hides itself during the day and comes out at night. A 11,000-year-old toad can eat it. The book Baopuzi: Shanjing looks like a baby. It has only one leg, which is turned backwards. It attacks people at night. It is called a Ji. When it attacks, one should just call out its name.

People drive it to catch tigers and leopards. The book Hailu Suishi: There is a kind of animal in the area south of the Five Ridges that has one leg and a reversed heel. There are three digits on each hand and foot. The male is called Shanzhang, and the female Shangu. It knocks on doors at night to beg for things. The book Shenyi Jing: There is a kind of animal called Ba or Hanmu in the south. It is two to three chi tall. It is naked, and its eyes are on the top of its head. It runs as fast as the wind. When such an animal is sighted, there will be a major drought. When such a thing is encountered, the person should throw it into a <b>manure</b> <b>pit.</b> In this way the drought can be avoided. The book Wenzi Zhigui: Hanba is a kind of mountain ghost. When it stays in a place, no rain will fall there. When a female Ba enters a house, it may steal things. When a male Ba enters a house, it kidnaps the woman. Li Shizhen's comment: The above books recorded creatures that are more or less similar. All of them are ghosts and devils. Now such a creature is called [...] "one-legged ghost" [...] In the past it was reported that such creatures existed everywhere. They hid themselves and sneaked into houses to copulate with the women in the house, causing trouble and disease. They might set fires or steal things from houses. Taoist masters could not drive them away, and no medicine could treat these diseases. So people worshipped it as a spirit to plead for peace. But nobody knew the nature of such things. This is recorded here for reference. When such a thing appears, one of the ways to throw off its evil is to call out its name. In this way it will not harm people. A 1,000-year-old toad can eat it. These are ways to control it, and there must be other ways to control it too. There is also a kind of Zhiniao, a bird recorded in the [...] "Category of the Fowls" [...] that is also a creature that harms people.

40|$|The {{mosquito}} species Anopheles plumbeus is {{an aggressive}} biter {{and a potential}} vector of malaria parasites and West Nile virus. It occurs naturally at low population densities, as its larval development is adapted to the specific water qualities found in tree holes. However, probably owing to environmental changes, it has recently been observed in several European countries to use increasingly often artificial breeding habitats {{that may lead to}} mass development and severe annoyance to humans living close by. The perception of mosquito nuisance, however, is very subjective, and breeding habitats are not always known, thus impeding targeted surveillance and control. To relate nuisance by An. plumbeus to specific environmental conditions, a questionnaire survey was carried out addressing persons who had submitted specimens of this particular mosquito species to the German citizen science project “Mueckenatlas”, an instrument of passive mosquito surveillance. The questionnaire was intended to find out whether a nuisance situation linked to An. plumbeus had existed, whether mosquito breeding habitats could be identified and whether control measures had been conducted. Despite some efforts, the participants who claimed to suffer from an An. plumbeus nuisance problem had rarely identified the source of the mosquitoes. Once control measures had been performed on abandoned <b>manure</b> <b>pits,</b> however, the nuisance problem disappeared or mosquito abundance was at least significantly reduced. Nevertheless, no significant effect of abandoned <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> on the probability of an An. plumbeus nuisance could be demonstrated in a multivariate logistic regression model testing various variables. Instead, a significant positive effect of a disused farm nearby was found. The reason is probably that <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> as the most frequent source of An. plumbeus mass development are often located on disused farms, without most people’s knowledge about their existence. Disused farms are therefore appropriate candidates to consider when it comes to public health issues connected to An. plumbeus such as surveillance of mass development and implementation of control measures...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of three <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> additives in commercial scale manure channels and simulated outdoor storage. The additives were American BioCatalysts (ABC), Pit Boss (PB) and Westbridge (WB). Results from two sets of indoor trials were combined to provide eight replicates of each additive. The protocol consisted of manure accumulation, pretreatment and treatment. Air and slurry samples were taken on Days 28 and 35 of the treatment phase. The outdoor phase that followed determined if residual effects resulting from indoor treatment existed. Manure was transferred from the manure channels to outdoor storage lagoons where it was stored in simulated lagoons. Samples were taken on Days 49 and 63. In terms of odour threshold reduction, the additives' effectiveness varied from producing no reduction to reductions of 66 %. The 66 % reduction produced by PB in the outdoor trial was the only significant odour threshold reduction in the experiment. During indoor storage, the additives produced minor odour threshold reductions. The additives were able to promote H 2 S reductions of 14 to 76 % and consistent yet minor NH 3 reductions in the indoor trials. None of the additives produced practical reductions in Total Solids or solubilization that could have improved manure-handling ease. Perhaps the strongest attribute of all of the additives was the ability to maintain elevated nutrients and micronutrient levels. Higher levels of TKN were maintained by all of the additives and the ability of the additives to maintain nitrogen in the available form, especially on Day 35 representing a potential of 9 to 25 % more available nitrogen during field application. Likewise, the additives resulted in 4 to 23 % more P while promoting elevated ortho-phosphate levels during the indoor trial. Improvements in nutrient value were also observed in potassium, copper and zinc results. Only with respect to waste strength reduction was the effectiveness of the additives relatively poor. In order to make more progress in the field of <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> treatment, research must be directed towards understanding the modes of action of <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> additives.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the ammonia emissions from houses for growing-finishing pigs with an outside yard. While regular emission measurements are not possible in these open systems another approach was used. Local parameters were measured and used in an existing NH 3 emission model to calculate the ammonia emissions. The following local parameters were measured/determined: total urine fouled floor area, total manure area in the <b>manure</b> <b>pit,</b> surface temperature of fouled areas of floor and <b>manure</b> <b>pit,</b> air velocity above fouled floor areas. Parameters pH and NH 4 -N content were measured by filter absorption of the urine puddles on the floor and the upper layer of the manure in the pit. These measurements were done in 3 pig houses with outside yard and in 2 regular houses, serving as reference. From the results of this study the following was concluded: 1) The floor emission is generally higher in houses with outside yard compared with regular houses, mainly caused by a larger fouled floor area. 2) The emission per m 2 pit surface area is significantly lower in houses with outside yard, especially as a result of the lower surface temperature of the manure in the pit. 3) The determination of ammonia emission in houses with outside yards using locally measured parameters provides a clear methodological perspective. Further validation of this method, however, is necessary. Particular attention should be given to what happens in the upper layer of the manure...|$|E

In this study, we propose a methodology for the determination of an alternative, more practical, pit transfer coefficient of NH 3 (PTC), and compare it with kNH(3) determined from other scientific studies. The aims of this research study were: (1) to develop a wind tunnel set-up which mimics air flow patterns between the slats and above a clean section of a slatted floor section, featuring an aqueous NH 3 -emitting solution; and (2) to assess how air velocity, turbulence intensity, NH 3 concentration ([NH 3]) and PTC are influenced by inlet airflow ventilation rate (VR) forced deflection of the air above the slats into the <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> through varying the deflection angle (DA) of a deflection panel and varying pit headspace height (HH).

40|$|Odour {{nuisance}} from agricultural {{activities is}} increasing in densely populated countries like the Netherlands. To develop adequate regulations, a large-scale, government-financed monitoring programme {{was started in}} the mid- 1990 s to establish odour emission levels for both conventional and low ammonia emission housing systems for cattle, pigs and poultry. The results indicate that high- and low-odour emission housing are difficult to distinguish {{because of the large}} variation within housing systems. Measurements on different farm locations within the same housing system show both a large variation between locations and within one location (in time). The latter, however, is significantly smaller, which suggests that farm management is an important determinant in odour emission that interferes with the effects of housing systems. The current research was aimed at determining the effect of two common ammonia-reducing pig-housing systems on odour emissions compared to conventional housing systems under similar management conditions. The respective reduction principles of these systems are reducing the emitting surface of the <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> and cooling of manure in the <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> (both pits beneath slatted floor). Five farms that combined conventional housing with one low-ammonia system (three reduced emitting surface and two manure cooling) were selected for a direct, pair-wise comparison of (olfactometric) odour emission measurements. The results show a highly significant effect (p < 0. 01) for two of the three reduced emitting surface systems and for one of the two manure cooling system. The average odour reduction percentages of these systems are 35 % (from 24. 9 to 16. 0 OUE/s per animal) and 23 % (from 30. 1 to 24. 0 OUE/s per animal) respectively.

An experiment was conducted with finishing pigs (n = 36) in a 2 × 3 factorial randomized complete block arrangement with 6 treatment combinations in 6 blocks. There were 2 dietary CP levels (low 12 %; high 18 %) and 3 digestible FC levels: (low 95. 5; medium 145. 5; and high 195. 5 g/kg feed, as-fed basis). Pigs with an initial body weight (BW) of 57. 7 ± 2. 5 kg were penned individually in partly slatted floor pens. Faeces and urine of each pig accumulated in separate <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> under the slatted floor. In the 6 th week of the collection period air samples were collected directly above the <b>manure</b> in each <b>pit.</b> <b>Manure</b> samples were taken for manure characteristics. Air samples were analyzed for odour concentration and for hedonic tone and odour intensity. Manure samples were analyzed for volatile fatty acids (VFA), indoles, phenoles, sulphurous compounds, ammonium, and total N concentrations. Dietary CP level and FC level did not affect odour emission, odour intensity and hedonic tone but their interaction affected odour emission at P = 0. 06. At a high dietary CP level, increased FC level decreased odour emission, while at a low CP level, increased FC level increased odour emission from pig manure. Total N and ammonium concentrations, and ammonia emission from pig manure were reduced at low dietary CP level (P 0. 05) in the manure. We conclude that the interaction between dietary CP and FC plays a role in odour production and emission.

The natural and forced air manure belt systems reduced CO 2 (28. 2 and 28. 7 kg yr− 1 hen− 1, respectively), CH 4 (25. 3 and 27. 7 g yr− 1 hen− 1, respectively) and N 2 O (2. 60 and 2. 48 g yr− 1 hen− 1, respectively) emissions by about 21, 16 and 9 % in comparison with the deep-pit technique (36. 0 kg CO 2 yr− 1 hen− 1, 31. 6 g CH 4 yr− 1 hen− 1 and 2. 78 g N 2 O yr− 1 hen− 1). The shift to manure belt systems needs to be encouraged since this housing system significantly decreases the production of GHG...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} growing pigs {{to determine the effects}} of content of potentially fermentable protein (FP) on odour and ammonia emissions from pig manure and on manure characteristics. Pigs (n = 18) were allocated in a randomised complete block arrangement with 3 treatments in each of 6 blocks. The three treatments had 28. 4, 38. 2 and 48. 0 g fermentable protein per kg of feed. Pigs with an initial body weight (BW) of 41. 3 ± 3. 2 kg (mean ± S. D.) were housed individually in pens with partly slatted floor and offered a daily feed allowance of 2. 8 × maintenance requirement (293 kJ net energy (NE) /BW 0. 75). Feed was mixed with water (1 / 2. 5; w/w). After a 2 -week adaptation period faeces and urine produced by each pig were collected in individual manure pits under the slatted floor. In the 5 th week of the collection period air samples were collected from each <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> for odour and ammonia analyses. Odour characteristics were measured by olfactometry and ammonia was measured by using two ammonia traps each containing 20 ml 0. 5 M HNO 3 solution. Manure samples from each <b>manure</b> <b>pit,</b> taken in the same week as air samples, were analysed for volatile fatty acids (VFAs), indolic, phenolic, sulphurous compounds, ammonium nitrogen and total nitrogen concentrations. Data were evaluated using analysis of variance. Odour and ammonia emissions from pig manure were in the range from 1. 88 to 2. 78 ouE/(s m 2) and from 0. 011 to 0. 014 mg/(s m 2), respectively and were not affected by fermentable protein content of the diet (P> 0. 05). Increased fermentable protein content resulted in higher concentrations of total nitrogen, methyl sulphide, carbon disulphide, ethanethiol, phenol, 3 -methyl indole and 4 -ethyl phenol in the manure (...|$|E
40|$|Seventy-two {{finishing}} pigs {{were used}} to evaluate the effects of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) on pig performance, manure characteristics, and odorous emissions. Three diets containing 0, 5, and 10 % DDGS were fed during six 4 -wk feeding periods. Week 1 served as a dietary adjustment period. Animals were housed in two feeding rooms (six pigs per room) with one treatment per room. A new group of animals (average initial Body Weight = 85. 8 kg) was used for each feeding period. Diets were replicated four times. Rooms were equipped with individual shallow manure storage pits that were cleaned once weekly (day 7). On day 4 and 7 of each week <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> samples and air samples in 10 -liter Tedlar bags for olfactometry analysis were collected from each room.

40|$|Abstract. Rapid {{deaths in}} {{confinement}} cattle caused {{by exposure to}} hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) gas from <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> has not {{been reported in the}} USA. In 1997, 158 cattle in 2 confinement pens were exposed to H 2 S gas as the <b>manure</b> in the <b>pits</b> under a slatted floor was agitated prior to pumping. Approximately 35 of the cattle were lying on the floor when the upper agitator was turned on. Within 5 minutes, many these cattle were down on their sides and paddling. Of these, 26 died within a few minutes. The survivors were treated and sent to slaughter. Cattle that did not show immediate signs of toxicosis remained clinically unaffected. Two steers that were near death were brought to the Purdue Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory for clinical evaluation, euthanasia, and necropsy. They were recumbent and unresponsive to visual and auditory stimuli. Necropsy examination yielded no significant gross lesions. No evidence of viral or bacterial infection was found. Ocular fluid nitrate concentrations were within normal limits, and no lead was detected in either animal. Microscopic examination revealed lesions consistent with H 2 S-induced central nervous system anoxia. Histologically, sec-tions of brain demonstrated massive, diffuse cerebral cortical laminar necrosis and edema. Portions of the outer lamina contained hypereosinophilic and shrunken neurons. The subcortical white matter was vacuolated in some areas. The history, clinical signs, and histologic lesion of cerebral laminar necrosis led to a diagnosis of H 2 S toxicosis in these cattle...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that about half of the odorous emissions from swine facilities originate in the buildings themselves. Other work in the Illinois C-FAR Swine Odor and Waste Management Strategic Research Initiative has addressed gaseous emissions from <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> and lagoons as well as dust emissions. But emissions of gaseous components from the houses per se has not been addressed in the SRI. Objective and Approach The objective of our project in this Initiative was to develop cost-effective catalytic converters for retrofitting swine-house ventilation outlets so as to reduce odor emissions. As described and discussed later in this paper, we have gone a long way toward realizing that goal. Our approach has been to use a catalyst to convert the odorous molecules into something benign. We have concentrated on catalytic systems because, in other industries, they have proven to be very cost effective. The catalysis process generates heat and removes toxic and irritating compounds, thereby reducing the need for ventilation. In other industries, the savings from reduced ventilation and heating costs have paid for th...|$|R
