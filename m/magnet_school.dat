5|$|As a <b>magnet</b> <b>school</b> founded {{to promote}} school integration, racial and {{economic}} diversity {{have been important}} factors in admissions decisions. The student body was 52.1percent black, 41.7percent low income, and 7.7percent disabled in 2009–10. In 2007, {{in response to a}} US Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial criteria for assigning students to public schools, CPS eliminated race and gender as determining factors in <b>magnet</b> <b>school</b> admissions. School officials insist this will have little impact, despite parent concerns that the decision will erode diversity.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the three}} major {{four-year}} universities in Louisville are located adjacent to Old Louisville, with Spalding University to the north and the University of Louisville to the south. DuPont Manual High School, a public <b>magnet</b> <b>school,</b> and Presentation Academy, an all-girls Catholic high school, are two other well-known schools located in Old Louisville.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{focused on}} {{industrial}} training early in its history, {{but by the}} late 1970s it had a standard curriculum. In 1980, Iowa Test of Basic Skills scores ranked Manual 23rd out of the 24 {{high schools in the}} county. Under principal Joe Liedtke, academics improved, especially after Manual became a <b>magnet</b> <b>school</b> in 1984 and could attract students from throughout the county.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Magnet</b> <b>Schools</b> of America (MSA) {{was formed}} to support <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> {{throughout}} the United States by means of goals such as desegregation, having businesses become actively involved in <b>magnet</b> <b>schools,</b> prompting federal financing, supporting legislation that supports <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> and to provide information to people {{of the benefits of}} <b>magnet</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnet</b> <b>Schools</b> of America {{established}} the <b>Magnet</b> <b>Schools</b> of Merit Award {{to recognize the}} top <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> in the United States. The <b>Magnet</b> <b>Schools</b> of Merit Award recognizes <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> that show commitment to high academic standards, curriculum innovation, successful desegregation/diversity efforts, and the consistent delivery of quality services to all stakeholders.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, <b>Magnet</b> <b>Schools</b> of America {{established}} two new {{awards for}} {{elementary and secondary}} <b>Magnet</b> <b>Schools</b> of Excellence, both with a cash award of $2,500.

5|$|Maud W. Gordon Elementary School in Bellaire {{does not}} have a zoning boundary; before 2012 it drew excess {{students}} from apartments west of Bellaire, in Houston, to relieve other schools in Houston west of Bellaire such as Benavidez, Cunningham, Elrod, and Milne. From its opening to 1953 to 1983 Gordon served as a neighborhood school. After its closure Gordon temporarily housed the Post Oak School and later served as administrative offices. It re-opened as a relief school in 1988 for Elrod and Cunningham schools. It was scheduled to re-open in September of that year. In 2012 HISD opened the Mandarin Chinese Language Immersion <b>Magnet</b> <b>School</b> Chinese language-immersion <b>magnet</b> <b>school,</b> in the former Gordon Elementary building. It is HISD's first Chinese immersion school. The school was scheduled to move to the St. George Place area of Houston; it was scheduled to open in August 2016. In 2017 HISD announced plans to demolish the Gordon/former MIMS campus so Bellaire High School's baseball practice field could be relocated there, allowing HISD to easily rebuild the high school main campus.|$|E
5|$|The Ashland School District oversees three {{elementary}} schools, one {{of which}} is a <b>magnet</b> <b>school</b> focused on science and the arts; one middle school; one high school; and a community learning center. Ashland High School was ranked 1,395th best among the nation's public high schools and 15th best in Oregon by U.S. News & World Report as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|The late 1960s and 1970s were a time {{of major}} change at Manual. A new wing {{featuring}} a gym with a seating capacity of 2,566 opened in 1971. The school had as many as 3,360 students in the 1971–72 school year, necessitating 17 portable classrooms {{in the front and}} rear courtyards. Manual still had grades seven through twelve at this time, and overcrowding gradually began to improve after Manual dropped the seventh and eight grades when Noe Middle School opened in 1974. Throughout the decade the administration gradually dropped the last vestiges of its manual training emphasis as the number of shop classes dwindled from 16 in 1971 to three in 1979. The Youth Performing Arts School, actually a <b>magnet</b> <b>school</b> within Manual, opened in 1978 and, along with the changing curriculum, presaged Manual's transition to an academically intensive <b>magnet</b> <b>school</b> in the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|Access to free {{transportation}} {{is a key}} component in facilitating racial diversity in <b>magnet</b> <b>schools.</b> According to a survey distributed at the <b>Magnet</b> <b>Schools</b> of America’s (MSA) 2008 annual meeting, in <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> with free transportation services, non-white students comprise almost 33% of the student body, which {{is higher than the}} 23% found in <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> without such services. Moreover, 11.9% of <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> that do not provide transportation are largely one-race, while only 6.4% of <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> with the provision of transportation are characterized as one-race schools. Such services are integral in ensuring that potential out-of-neighborhood students have access to these schools of choice. Ultimately, the presence of free transportation contributes to more integrated magnet environments.|$|R
5|$|The magnet {{programs}} {{succeeded in}} attracting applicants {{and by the}} mid-1990s {{only about a third}} of students who applied were accepted. In the midst of the transition to <b>magnet</b> <b>school,</b> Manual underwent a $1.9 million building improvement plan which added computer and science labs. Also in 1991, the United States Department of Education recognized Manual as a Blue Ribbon School, the highest honor the department can bestow on a school.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} new high school built in several years, many unorthodox ideas were suggested. After many of the ideas were criticized the school {{district}} requested parental input on {{the direction of the}} school's curriculum and held meetings around the city to show their plans for the curriculum. School officials wished to create a balance of college prep classes and vocational programs. The school was planned as and is now a citywide <b>magnet</b> <b>school</b> with no attendance boundary. An emphasis on technology was integrated into the plans for the school.|$|E
5|$|Schiel, {{built in}} 1911 as an {{elementary}} school for the Corryville neighborhood, was converted to a Spanish-language <b>magnet</b> <b>school</b> in 1974 and again to an arts enrichment school in 1985. Schiel students have been admitted by open enrollment on a first-come-first-served basis. With 420 kindergarten through third grade students in 2008 (around ages five through nine), 83percent of them black, 72percent economically disadvantaged, {{it has been the}} primary feeder school for SCPA, for which Schiel students have been required to audition. Schiel was one of two CPS schools recognized as a Blue Ribbon School in 2010.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} ways in which parents are involved in their children’s education is through choosing the school they attend. Parents typically choose a school de facto, according to where they live. However, within the past decade, more parents are able to exercise explicit school choice because of specific educational policies, such as <b>magnet</b> <b>schools,</b> charter schools, open enrollment, tax credits, and vouchers. In the public <b>school</b> arena, <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> are the most prevalent type of <b>school</b> choice. <b>Magnet</b> <b>schools</b> played a central role during court-ordered busing to prevent white flight by providing avenues for voluntary integration; many parents chose <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> over cross-town bus rides. However, during the past decade, the role of <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> has changed as an increasing number of federal courts have lifted desegregation orders in urban <b>school</b> districts. <b>Magnet</b> <b>schools</b> are now a mechanism to provide public school parent choice. Thus, the market-place for parents in many urban districts includes <b>magnet</b> <b>schools,</b> charter schools, and private schools. Private schools are available to a broader group of parents because of the increasing availability of private-school vouchers that are targeted to low-income households in low- income, high minority, school districts...|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnet</b> <b>schools</b> {{are public}} schools that {{often have a}} {{specialized}} function like science, technology, or art. These <b>magnet</b> <b>schools,</b> unlike charter schools, are not open to all children. Much like many private schools, some (but not all) <b>magnet</b> <b>schools</b> require a test to get in. <b>Magnet</b> <b>schools</b> are an example of open enrollment programs. Open enrollment refers to district or statewide programs that allow families to choose public schools other than the ones they are assigned. Intradistrict open enrollment programs allow school choice within a district. Interdistrict open enrollment allows families to choose schools outside of the district in other districts.|$|R

5|$|There {{are three}} primary public school {{district}}s in the city of Tulsa. Tulsa Public Schools, with nine high schools and over 41,000 students, is the second-largest school district in Oklahoma and includes Booker T. Washington High School, a <b>magnet</b> <b>school</b> judged to be the 65th best high school in the United States by Newsweek magazine in 2008. Each with one upper high school, Jenks and Union schools are the city's two other primary districts, covering the southern portion of the city near the towns of Jenks and Broken Arrow. In 2006, there were more than 90,000 students attending Tulsa County's public schools.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{opened in}} 1892 as an all-male manual {{training}} school. It {{was the second}} public high school in Louisville. Manual merged with its rival, Male High School, into a consolidated school from 1915 to 1919. Manual permanently merged with the Louisville Girls High School in 1950 and moved into their Gothic-style three-story building, built in 1934. In 2004, after conducting a poll, Louisville's Courier-Journal newspaper listed Manual as one of Louisville residents' ten favorite buildings. As a coeducational school, Manual experienced a decline in discipline and test scores in the 1970s. In 1984, Manual became a <b>magnet</b> <b>school,</b> allowing students from throughout the district to apply to five specialized programs of study, or magnets.|$|E
5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} <b>magnet</b> <b>school</b> {{students from}} {{other areas of the}} city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a waiting list. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E
