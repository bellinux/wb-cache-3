American population, Corporate units, Expatriates and all nations with their currency related to US $, are not happy in the current $ dipping situation. Even the currencies of poor nations are galloping upward in $ parity, because they are linked to Euro. This is due to USA's approach to control other nations in the world,through unilateral Army power,tie up of domestic markets towards USA, and Pumping wealth from developed nations. A Notional Balance sheet of USA, balances only with a Loss to the Assets(Debit). This off-setting entry is a <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>loss</b> expense entry,in the Profit making US Income Statement. As a Prime Developed Nation USA alone can perform the role of fighting threat to the world, lead the poor nations toward a free and democratic society, as announced by President Bush. Bush is correct. But only the current methodology and approach require a revised outlook. An Algebraic Model of the author infers that Productivity of the assisted nations should be with reference to their internal Socio-Economic development target units, Pumping money and strengthening {{the defense of the}} assisted nation only increase their everlasting liability. Strengthen their Intangible moral values {{hand in hand with the}} Wealth formation. A Geometric Bi-circular Model of the author leads to the direction that an Endogenous methodology is to introduce the latest technology (moderated to the local conditions) for domestic Techno- Commercial upgrade; and train the domestic Manpower of the assisted nation to utilise them. An Exogenous tool is to start the basic infrastructure building from assisted resources (USA, Other nations,UN,WB,IMF etc [...] ). But soon work to develop Domestic savings to Domestic investment for Self-Confidence/Reliance. These will lead USA towards a more Prosperous/Practical Inter national leader to protect theWorld in the current and future millenniums.

This product has been developed in JavaScript and HTLM protocols and it allow real time an online performance monitoring and comparison together with fault detection and causes diagnosis. The presented solution is focus on the DC side of the PV system and it includes: a simple and effective simulation model (based on the calculation normalized energy yield from the environmental irradiance and the module temperature evolution), a real time monitoring and supervision tool (based on the comparison between simulated and actual power production) and an innovative fault detection system (based on the analysis of the <b>miscellaneous</b> capture <b>losses,</b> the fault signal frequency and two indicators). The two indicators used to distinguish among the most common faults are: the ratio between maximum power point current and the short circuit one, and the ratio between maximum power point voltage and the open circuit one. An intuitive and user friendly visual interface has also been created as an on-line web page to allow the power plant operator an easy and prompt supervision of the behavior of multiple PV plants.

5000|$|The [...] "casino economy" [...] craze of {{the late}} 1980s caught on also at STS. In 1989, the bank was {{transformed}} into a commercial bank, and foundations controlled by the leftist political parties SDP and SKP bought shares, intending to fund their activities with the profits of the bank. However, loose credit policies and the subsequent credit loss due to the early 1990s recession were disastrous for the bank. Esko Seppänen has opined that STS had become a sort of a [...] "cash dispenser" [...] from which clients could get cash without any strict payback obligation. As much as 40% of the loans were given against the bank's own policies, and 22% had indications of deliberate abuse. STS {{was one of the main}} contributors to the early 1990s banking crisis in Finland, where the country was at the brink of a banking system and economic collapse. In 1992, in addition to the official loss of 500 million markka (Mmk), concealed was 740 Mmk bad debt, 700 Mmk asset overvaluation and 300 Mmk <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>losses.</b> Furthermore, STS had borrowed ½ billion to the cooperative retailer EKA and the construction company Haka, both bound for bankruptcy. An assetless shell, Siltapankki Oy, remained with the bad debt. Facing bankruptcy, the remaining parts were sold in 1992 to another major bank, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, which took over the operations and terminated its independent brand and existence. The owning foundation received only 75 million markka in the form of KOP shares (itself ripe for bankruptcy), thus leading to an immediate loss of 175 million markka (ca. 30 million euro). The government merged Siltapankki with the bad bank Arsenal in 1995. All savings customers were fully refunded. The total cost to taxpayers was ca. 2 billion Finnish markka (around 0.5 billion in 2010 euros) according to Esko Seppänen.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which banks alter the timing and {{magnitude}} of transactions such as asset sales, loan loss accruals, pension settlements and securities issues in response to primary capital, tax, and earnings goals. The authors hypothesize that each year bank managers face a cost minimization problem that encompasses the costs of deviating from primary capital, tax, and earnings goals, as well as the costs of exercising discretion over loan loss accruals, transactions such as asset sales, and securi-ties issues. The authors construct a system of five equations, one for the optimal level of each of the items over which the manager can exercise discretions to achieve the three goals. The authors find that loan charge-offs, loan loss provisions, and the decision to issue securities are jointly determined, apparently to manage primary capital ratios. The research suggests that pension settlement gains are determined independently of the other four decisions, and appear to be used to manage end-of-period earnings. <b>Miscellaneous</b> gains (<b>losses)</b> are used primarily to manage earnings; but weaker evidences suggests that they are also used to manage capital. The authors find broad support for the hypotheses that deviating from capital and earnings goals is costly, and that bank managers trade-off costly accrual and financing discretion to meet these goals. The policy implications of this recent research are intriguing. For example, mark-to-market rules that limit the manager's ability to strategically time gains from sales of securities may simply induce the manager to substitute an alternative form of discretion - delaying or accelerating charge-offs and loan loss provisions. The framework and evidence support the notion that accrual, investment, and financing decisions are not independent. In the context of contracting and monitoring motivations for accounting choices, this means that focusing solely on the accounting systems's role in mitigating these costs potentially omits important correlated factors. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Inference from dietary {{surveys and}} {{experimental}} models {{suggest that the}} female endurance athlete dietary protein requirement is 15 - 20 % less than their male counterparts, but to date empirical measurement of the habitual protein requirement has not been undertaken. Methods: 72 -h nitrogen balance (NBAL) was determined in 10 female cyclists training 10. 8 h·w- 1 (SD: 2. 82), following two habituated protein intakes: a) a diet representing normal habitual intake (NH) (Protein: 85 g. d- 1 Energy: 9078 kJ·d- 1), b) an isolcaloric high-protein diet (HP) (Protein: 166 g·d- 1, Energy: 8909 kJ·d- 1). Total 72 -h nitrogen intake was determined from Leco total combustion analysis from samples of the ingested food items, while total loss was determined from micro-kjeldahl analysis of total 72 -h urine, urea nitrogen concentration of regional resting and exercise sweat sampling, and literature-based estimates of fecal and <b>miscellaneous</b> nitrogen <b>losses.</b> Habituated protein requirement was estimated by the mean regression of the two estimates of 72 -h nitrogen balance vs. nitrogen intake. Results: Mean (SD) 24 -h dietary protein intake during the 72 -h sampling period was NH: 85 (11 g), HP: 166 (19 g). Mean 24 -h urinary nitrogen during the NH and HP blocks were 13. 19 (2. 39 g·d- 1) and 21. 53 (3. 94 g·d- 1) respectively. Sweat urea nitrogen excretion was NH: 0. 33 (0. 08 g·d- 1) and HP: 0. 54 (0. 12 g·d- 1). Normal habitual and high-protein intakes resulted in a mean negative and positive nitrogen balance, respectively (mean ± SD) (NH: - 0. 59 ± 1. 64, HP: 2. 69 ± 3. 09). Estimated mean protein requirement to achieve NBAL was calculated to be 1. 63 g·kg- 1 ·d- 1 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 14 – 3. 77). Conclusions: Our data shows that the dietary protein requirement for well-trained females taking part in daily moderate intensity and duration endurance training is {{within the range of}} measured requirement for similarly trained men and suggests that the current estimated range of protein requirement for females may be inadequate...|$|R
40|$|A {{statistical}} review {{has been}} made of the offshore fire and explosion incidents in the Gulf of Mexico from 1980 to 1990. This review generally indicates that most incidents (78. 7 %) are shown to be from the loss of process piping or equipment integrity or from miscellaneous causes and which result in minor losses. Over half of the ignition sources are from hot surfaces of equipment or exhaust gases of internal combustion processes or various <b>miscellaneous</b> sources. Major <b>loss</b> of life has generally occurred as a result of drilling activity blowouts or helicopter transport operations. The major financial risks for these facilities are property losses precipitated by blowout incidents. The early part of the decade accounts for approximately three-fourths of the incidents, while recent years have seen a considerable {{decline in the number of}} incidents. I NTRODUCTION A comprehensive review {{has been made}} of fire and explosion incidents, as recorded by the U. S. Minerals Management Service (MMS), that have occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in the period from 1980 to 19901. A total of 539 incidents occurred during this period, accounting for 60 fatalities and 246 injuries. This document uses the latest published historical listing of the MMS as the basis of the review which encompasses Gulf of Mexico incidents oc-curring from 1956 to 1990. In order to ensure relevancy of the data to current management and technology of offshore installations, only incidents occurring from 1980 to 1990 are included. 246 injuries occurred as a result of 140 separate incidents (26 %), while 60 fatali-ties were the result of 20 separate inci-dents (4 %). 43 explosions (8 % of total) were also identified as having occurred in this period. There was no damage, injuries or environmental pollution in 154 (28 %) of the reported incidents. WORST FATAL INCIDENTS The five worst fatal incidents are briefly described below; most are associated with helicopter and blowout incidents. 1. Helicopter struck leg of platform, 14 fatalities (Forest Oil- 1987); 2. Helicopter struck platform...|$|R
40|$|Differences in the {{expression}} of non-motor symptoms (NMS) by Parkinson's disease (PD) patients may {{have important implications for}} their management and prognosis. Gender is a basic epidemiological variable that could influence such expression. the present study evaluated the prevalence and severity of NMS by gender in an international sample of 951 PD patients, 62. 63 % males, using the non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS). Assessments for motor impairment and complications, global severity, and health state were also applied. All disease stages were included. No significant gender differences were found for demographic and clinical characteristics. for the entire sample, the most prevalent symptoms were Nocturia (64. 88 %) and Fatigue (62. 78 %) and the most prevalent affected domains were Sleep/Fatigue (84. 02 %) and Miscellaneous (82. 44 %). Fatigue, feelings of nervousness, feelings of sadness, constipation, restless legs, and pain were more common and severe in women. On the contrary, daytime sleepiness, dribbling saliva, interest in sex, and problems having sex were more prevalent and severe in men. Regarding the NMSS domains, Mood/Apathy and <b>Miscellaneous</b> problems (pain, <b>loss</b> of taste or smell, weight change, and excessive sweating) were predominantly affected in women and Sexual dysfunction in men. No other significant differences by gender were observed. To conclude, in this study significant {{differences between men and women}} in prevalence and severity of fatigue, mood, sexual and digestive problems, pain, restless legs, and daytime sleepiness were found. Gender-related patterns of NMS involvement may be relevant for clinical trials in PD.
