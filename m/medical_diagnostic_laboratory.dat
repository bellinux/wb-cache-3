40|$|Background and Objectives: Waste {{produced}} by health and treatment centers (hospitals) including <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> {{is one of}} the sources of municipal waste production. Waste {{produced by}} <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> due to the existence of pathogens and infectious materials by high importance {{is one of the}} environmental issues. This survey has been done on the qualitative-quantitative analytical bases, and the investigation has focused on the management strategies of the waste material of <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> of Rasht, Iran in 2009. Methods: In this descriptive study, samples were collected from 19 <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> of Rasht in 3 consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday every week), after filling the questionnaire and interviewing with the managers. Then, the samples were separated manually, and divided into 46 different constituents and weighed. Next, the constituents were classified based on characteristics and potentiality of being hazardous. Results: The total amount of annual waste production by the <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> of Rasht is 25785. 143 kg. In this study, the share of manufacturing conventional waste (domestic type wastes), especially infectious, chemical, pharmaceutical, and radioactive wastes were 1. 16 %, 95. 34 %, 1. 42 % and 2. 08 %, respectively. The highest and lowest amount of waste production relates to plastic materials and wood which are 48. 37 and 0. 43 %, respectively. In this study sharp cutting things were calculated to be 10. 52 %. Furthermore, 84 percent of the managers of the <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> had not had enough information of the circulars and instructions on the enforceable management strategies of the medical wastes. Conclusion: Concerning the management of the medical waste production in the <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories,</b> it is suggested that the managers and the personnel be trained on the separation, collection, and disinfection techniques and final disposal, and the wastes have to be treated per regulations and instructions...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and Aims Brucellosis is an {{important}} disease caused by Brucella species and is a zoonotic disease. Since Iran has focused the majority of livestock in rural areas, the epidemiological studies seems to be necessary in cities with most villages. We aim to survey the brucellosis in suspicious patients who referred to a <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratory</b> in Neyshabur from 2010 to 2015. Materials and Methods This study was cross sectional-descriptive. In this epidemiological study, the required information of all patients who were suspected by physicians (2010 - 2015) was extracted over the last 5 years by laboratory software and the collected data were analyzed by using SPSS. Results According to Wright’s test, the prevalence of brucellosis was 6. 76 % in this study. Patients had the titers of 1. 80, 1. 40 and 1. 40 for Wright, 2 -Mercapto ethanol (2 ME) and Coombs tests respectively. Most participants were in {{the age group of}} 41 - 50 years and 34. 1 % were male. Conclusions According to results, Neyshabur has categorized in the areas with high outbreak in the country that should be considered as priorities of local health networks for training and necessary acts. * Corresponding Author: <b>Medical</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Laboratory</b> of Neyshabour, Center of Medical, Pathological and Genetic Diagnostic Services.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the predisposing factors foroccupational exposure and to assess the usage of safety equipment among personnelof <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> in Birjand. Material and Methods: In this descriptive analytic study, all staff of laboratorieswas assessed by using a questionnaire including demographic data, type ofaccidental exposures and the use of protective equipment. Using SPSS software, weanalyzed the data. Results: Of 110, 84 (76 %) have at least one accidental exposure to patients’specimens in that 55 % of accidents are related to sample preparation step. In 82 %of contacts, carelessness is the underlying cause of exposure. Gown, glove, fumehood and mouth mask are routinely used by 97 %, 48 %, 34 %, 1 % of personnel,respectively. Nearly all of (97 %) personnel were vaccinated against hepatitis B and 78 % of them have performed routine blood test for detecting any infections.

40|$|Abstract: Organic {{conjugated}} polymers (conducting polymers) {{have emerged}} as potential candidates for electrochemical sensors. Due to their straightforward preparation methods, unique properties, and stability in air, conducting polymers have been applied to energy storage, electrochemical devices, memory devices, chemical sensors, and electrocatalysts. Conducting polymers are also known to be compatible with biological molecules in a neutral aqueous solution. Thus, these are extensively used in the fabrication of accurate, fast, and inexpensive devices, such as biosensors and chemical sensors in the <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Conducting polymer-based electrochemical sensors and biosensors {{play an important role}} in the improvement of public health and environment because rapid detection, high sensitivity, small size, and specificity are achievable for environmental monitoring and clinical diagnostics.

The {{purpose of this}} study is to assess and analyze the standards and criteria that each Laboratory system is required to observe and upgrade them, to determine the gap between the ideal and the current status and finally to present the strategy and executive plan in order to achieve the desirable status. Material and Methods: This study was performed in a <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratory</b> in Gorgan by using the quality system checklist related to medical diagnostic laboratories, which was revised in 2009. Internal evaluation matrix (Internal Factor Evaluation) was used to examine the main factors in the context of establishing a quality management system in a clinical laboratory. After examining the factors, determining the laboratory status, recording the results of monitoring (in terms of strengths and weaknesses) and determining the gap between existing and desirable status, we provided the appropriate and effective solutions in line with defined standard. Results: of 164 items thatshould have been done in the first assessment, 111 (67. 7 %) items are in performed group and 53 (32. 3 %) are not in. After compiling and running a plan, 147 (89. 6 %) are performed, 15 (9. 2 %) needed to be modified and 2 (1. 2 %) still not performed. It is evident that a significant difference (p< 0. 05) and a tangible improvement in current problems are seen after establishing the qualitysystem in the laboratory. The lab equipment, lab space and facilities, pre-examination process, testing process and post-examination process are considered. Regarding the health and safety in the laboratory, lab equipment, lab space and facilities, pre-examination process, testing process and post-examination process, no significant difference is observed between before and after the implementation of the program. Conclusion:after establishing the quality system in laboratory, a significant difference and tangible improvement in the current problems are observed.
