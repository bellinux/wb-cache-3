40|$|This paper {{presents}} a thermodynamic {{study of the}} rate and equilibria processes involved in the a-cyclodextrin mediated reaction {{of a range of}} 4 -substituted phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfides</b> with two peroxyacids of different binding affinities. The results for the inclusion processes show that the formation of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 (host:guest) complexes between a-cyclodextrin and phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfides</b> are generally enthalpically controlled, particularly so for the 2 : 1 complexes, as might be expected for a ternary complex. The data from this series of sulfides is presented as enthalpy-entropy compensation plots, yielding slopes of unity for each inclusion process. The formation of a 1 : 1 complex between cyclodextrin and the strongly associating 3 -chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) is also enthapically controlled. The other peroxyacid used, peroxomonosulfate, does not bind to a-cyclodextrin to any measurable degree. As described in our original study of this reaction system (Davies and Deary in J Chem Soc Perkin Trans 2 : 2423 – 2430, 1996), catalysis by a-cyclodextrin is effected by activation of the peroxide as a result its inclusion within the cyclodextrin cavity; hence for reactions of phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfides</b> with MCPBA, catalysis is observed, but is absent for PMS. In this study the reaction rates are analysed using the transition state pseudo equilibrium approach of Tee (Carbohydr Res 192 : 181 – 195, 1989), whereby the transition state pseudoequilibrium constant KTS reflects the stabilisation imparted to the transition state by the association with one molecule of cyclodextrin. Enthalpy- entropy compensation plots for KTS give slopes close to unity; this is the first reported example of such plots being applied to transition state pseudoequilibrium constants...|$|R

5000|$|Butyl <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfide</b> is an {{asymmetrical}} thioether {{which is}} achiral {{in the gas}} phase. The molecule can adsorbed to the surface through either of the sulfur's two lone pair. This {{gives rise to the}} surface bound chirality of the molecule. [...] The asymmetry of the molecular surface interface gives rise to an asymmetrical barrier to rotation. [...] The molecule rotates around this sulfur-copper bond.Electrons quantum tunneling from the STM tip electrically excite molecular vibrations which couple to rotational modes. The rotation of the motor can be controlled by adjusting the electron flux from the scanning tunneling microscope and the background temperature. The tip of the scanning electron microscope acts as an electrode. The chiralities of the tip of the STM and the molecule determine the rate and direction of rotation. Images taken of the molecule at 5 K and under non-perturbative scanning conditions show a crescent-shaped protrusion of the molecule. When the temperature is raised to 8 K, the molecule starts rotating along six orientations determined by the hexagonal structure of the copper it is adsorbed on. In this case, a STM image taken of the molecule appears as a hexagon as the timescale of the imaging is much slower than the rotation rate of the molecule.|$|E

In comparison to reagents used in pharmaceutical fine chemical syntheses, hazardous chemicals, e.g. sodium azide, halogens, <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfide,</b> phosgene, phosphorus chlorides, are more frequently used. Agrochemical companies sometimes outsource just these steps, which require specialized equipment, on toll conversion deals.

Examples within herbicides are the world’s longstanding top-selling product, Monsanto’s round-up (glyphosate). Syngenta’s cyclohexadione-type mesotrione and paraquat dichloride. Within insecticides, the traditional organophosphates, like malathion, and pyrethroids such as γ-cyhalotrin are being substituted for by neonicotinoids, like Bayer’s imidacloprid and Syngenta’s thiamethoxam and pyrazoles, such as BASF’s fipronil.

This part of the tongue is relatively dry and poorly cleansed, and the convoluted microbial structure of the tongue dorsum provides an ideal habitat for anaerobic bacteria, which flourish under a continually-forming tongue coating of food debris, dead epithelial cells, postnasal drip and overlying bacteria, living and dead.
