25|$|The {{suspension}} of the DMC-12 is a four-wheel independent suspension, coil springs, and telescopic shock absorbers.

40|$|Abstract — Optical {{amplifiers}} are {{key elements}} of any fiber-optic communication system. Even though modern optical fibers have losses below 0. 2 dB/km, a repeated amplification of the transmitted signal to its original strength becomes necessary at long enough distances. One solution for signal regeneration is {{the conversion of the}} optical signal into the electrical domain and subsequent re-conversion into a fresh optical signal. This paper has proposed the investigation of the soliton and MTDM techniques to be processed to handle both bit rate and product either per link or per channel for cables of <b>multi-links</b> (40 - 240 links/core). Two multiplexing techniques are applied, ultra wide wavelength division multiplexing (UW-WDM) and ultra wide space division multiplexing (UW-SDM), where maximum number of transmitted channels is processed to handle the product of bit rate either per channel or per link for cables of <b>multi-links.</b> The soliton and MTDM transmission bit rates and products either per link or per channel are also treated over wide range of the affecting parameters. The amplification process is essentially independent of the details of the spectral channel layout, modulation format or data rate of the transmission...|$|R

30|$|To {{verify the}} {{feasibility}} of Au-coated VSNEA for biomolecules detection, peptides having a fluorescent probe, carboxyfluorescein, were attached the surface on NWs. Peptides are well suited as the bioreceptor component of various biosensors and biomedical applications because they can selectively and tightly bind to a large diversity of biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, and protein targets through modification of their <b>multi-linking</b> polychains [19, 20].

Therefore, a 13 -mer peptide was synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) with standard Fmoc protocols.
