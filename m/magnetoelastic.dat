50|$|Thin film {{strategy}} also enables {{achievement of}} interfacial multiferroic coupling through a mechanical channel in heterostructures {{consisting of a}} <b>magnetoelastic</b> and a piezoelectric component. This type of heterostructure is composed of an epitaxial <b>magnetoelastic</b> thin film grown on a piezoelectric substrate. For this system, application of a magnetic field will induce {{a change in the}} dimension of the <b>magnetoelastic</b> film. This process, called magnetostriction, will alter residual strain conditions in the <b>magnetoelastic</b> film, which can be transferred through the interface to the piezoelectric substrate. Consequently, a polarization is introduced in the substrate through the piezoelectric process. The overall effect is that the polarization of the ferroelectric substrate is manipulated by an application of a magnetic field, which is the desired magnetoelectric effect. In this case, the interface {{plays an important role in}} mediating the responses from one component to another, realizing the magnetoelectric coupling. For an efficient coupling, a high-quality interface with optimal strain state is desired. In light of this interest, advanced deposition techniques have been applied to synthesize these types of thin film heterostructures. Molecular beam epitaxy has been demonstrated to be capable of depositing structures consisting of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive components.

50|$|Periodically driven damped {{nonlinear}} {{systems can}} exhibit complex dynamics characterized by strange chaotic attractors, where strange {{refers to the}} fractal geometry of the attractor and chaotic refers to the exponential sensitivity of orbits on the attractor. Quasiperiodically driven systems forced by incommensurate frequencies are natural extensions of periodically driven ones and are phenomenologically richer. In addition to periodic or quasiperiodic motion, they can exhibit chaotic or nonchaotic motion on strange attractors. Although quasiperiodic forcing is not necessary for strange nonchaotic dynamics (e.g., the period doubling accumulation point of a period doubling cascade), if quasiperiodic driving is not present, strange nonchaotic attractors are typically not robust and not expected to occur naturally because they exist only when the system is carefully tuned to a precise critical parameter value. On the other hand, it was shown in the paper of Grebogi et al. that SNA's can be robust when the system is quasiperiodically driven. The first experiment to demonstrate a robust strange nonchaotic attractor involved the buckling of a <b>magnetoelastic</b> ribbon driven quasiperiodically by two incommensurate frequencies in the golden ratio. Strange nonchaotic attractors have been robustly observed in laboratory experiments involving <b>magnetoelastic</b> ribbons, electrochemical cells, electronic circuits, a neon glow discharge and most recently detected in {{the dynamics of the}} pulsating RR Lyrae variables KIC 5520878 (as obtained from the Kepler Space Telescope) which may be the first strange nonchaotic dynamical system observed in the wild.|$|E

50|$|Smart RISUG is a newer {{version of}} the male {{contraception}} that was published in 2009. This polymer adds iron oxide and copper particles to the original compound, giving it magnetic properties and the name “Smart” RISUG. After injection {{the exact location of}} the polymer inside the vas deferens can be measured and visualized by X-ray and magnetic imaging. The polymer location can also be externally controlled using a pulsed magnetic field. With this magnetic field, the polymer can change location inside the body to maximize sterility or can be removed to restore fertility. The polymer has <b>magnetoelastic</b> behavior that allow it to stretch and elongate to better line the vas deferens. The iron oxide component is necessary to prevent agglomeration. With the original RISUG polymer, the SMA can possibly clump as a reaction to neighboring proteins. With the presence of iron particles, the polymer has lower protein binding and therefore prevents agglomeration. This makes Smart RISUG safer for the user as it will not accidentally block the vas deferens. The copper particles in the compound allow the polymer to conduct heat. When an external microwave applies heat to the polymer, is can liquify the polymer again to be excreted to restore fertility. Smart RISUG is therefore better choice for men who want to use RISUG as temporary birth control, since it does not require a second surgery to restore fertility. The addition of metal ions also increases the effectiveness of the spermicide. The low frequency electromagnetic field disintegrates the sperm cell membrane in the head region. This in turn causes both acrosin and hyaluronidase enzymes to leak out of the sperm, making the sperm infertile. The safety of Smart RISUG is still being investigated. With literature research, the spermicidal properties of the compound should not have negative effects on the lining of the vas deferens. The albino rats used to develop the new polymer have not had any adverse symptoms.|$|E

40|$|<b>Magnetoelastic</b> coupling, i. e., {{the change}} of crystal lattice induced by a spin order, is not only scientifically interesting, but also {{technically}} important. In this work, we propose a general microscopic model from first-principles calculations to describe the <b>magnetoelastic</b> coupling and provide a way to construct the microscopic model from density functional theory calculations.
