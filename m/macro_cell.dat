To ensure variety among pool members, a long-term memory and edge-weight perturbation strategy is employed to diversify the search when seeking for new solutions. Local search is used in the second phase, to further improve the quality of trees in the pool. Computational experiments performed on over 800 commonly used benchmarks show that the proposed algorithm is able to generate pools of optimal (or near-optimal) trees in a very small amount of time. Most importantly, the trees produced are highly dissimilar, allowing for numerous routing possibilities for each net. ...|$|R

30|$|When the {{synchronization}} {{procedure is}} performed through the <b>macro</b> <b>cell</b> air interface, the small cell needs {{to detect the}} PSS and SSS of the <b>macro</b> <b>cell</b> it is connected to. To detect the first signal (PSS), the small cell performs matched filtering on each possible PSS pattern to determine the appropriate timing. The detection of the second signal (SSS) will determine the physical cell ID of the <b>macro</b> <b>cell.</b> This is necessary to identify the <b>macro</b> <b>cell</b> the small cell needs to synchronize to. Depending on {{the proximity of the}} small cell to the <b>macro</b> <b>cell</b> and on the channel conditions, these signals might not be detected with 100 % accuracy from the first attempt. However, in PCC systems, it is safe to assume that small cells are located {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>macro</b> <b>cell</b> they are connected to by backhaul link. Hence, a 100 % detection accuracy assumption is realistic. Since PSS and SSS are both transmitted twice per radio frame (10 ms), and given the 100 % detection rate, we can assume that detecting the PSS and the SSS can be done in a radio frame (i.e., 10 ms). The total duration of the synchronization procedure is then 10 ms.|$|E
