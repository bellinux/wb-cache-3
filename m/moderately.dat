5|$|Freshwater {{resident}} {{rainbow trout}} usually inhabit and spawn in small to <b>moderately</b> large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are {{native to the}} alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks. Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in <b>moderately</b> deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.|$|E

5|$|Pluto's {{orbital period}} is {{presently}} about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially {{different from those}} of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is <b>moderately</b> inclined relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and <b>moderately</b> eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies nearer the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} soluble {{fluoride}}s, CsF is <b>moderately</b> basic, because HF is a weak acid. The low nucleophilicity of fluoride means {{it can be}} a useful base in organic chemistry. CsF gives higher yields in Knoevenagel condensation reactions than KF or NaF.|$|E
