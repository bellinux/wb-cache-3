40|$|Of intercurrent {{infections in}} {{children}} with allergic pathology use of topical bacterial lyzates as a therapy for intercurrent infections {{in children with}} allergic pathology is reviewed basing on publications and personal clinical experience. Deficient <b>mucous</b> <b>immunity</b> {{has been established in}} allergic children with recurrent and acute upper respiratory tract and herpes virus infections, thus providing base for use of immunomodulators as a part of complex treatment for this group of patients.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{describe}} an unusual mandibular bone lesion due to Candida Albicans (Candida A.) yeats, in an immunocompetent host. Candida A. is a saprophytic microorganism of skin and mucous membranes. Bone involvement, by its action, is rare but recognised entity. When tissues flora is altered by: skin or <b>mucous</b> disruption, <b>immunity</b> disease, diabetes, it results in primary candidiasis, or super infection, that may involve bone district as well. A young female underwent to magnetic resonance that revealed, as occasionally result, an osteolysis of mandibular bone. Computed tomography Denta-scan and Panorex were carried out. Operative inteventation was performed to explore the bony tissue. An extensive bone rarefaction from 3. 6 to 3. 8 roots was found, without any sharp edges. A conservative treatment was decided, waiting for hystologic exam, that was diagnostic for an osteolytic lesion with Candida A. yeats. A fluconazol and ciprofluoxacin therapy was carried out and a second operative intervention was performed. A further Panorex revealed bone regeneration after one year follow-up. Osteomyelitis lesions induced by Candida A. and its colonization in caries have been largely demonstrated in selected cases, {{but no one in}} the literature reviewed showed osteolytic lesions. The patient was an immunocompetent host. A previous orthodontic therapy about eight years ago was referred, so that authors hypothesized a mycotic diffusion from brackets or arch wire during infant age...|$|R
40|$|Medical library. {{medications}} – common {{over the}} counter medications {{the impact of a}} topical glucocorticoid flutikazon on the dynamics of the local immunity indices and microbiocenosis condition of the nasal mucosa was studied in the patients with the confirmed diagnosis of all the year round allergic rhinitis. In a year all patients demonstrated a sustained control of all the year round allergic rhinitis symptoms. A statistically significant increase of lysozyme, secretory and interferon γ concentration in the nasal and mouth mucous secretion as well as the decrease of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)  α concentration and the frequency of yeast like fungi and gram negative bacteria growth were revealed. Thus, long term flutikazon therapy has brought about a sustained remission of all the year round allergic rhinitis clinical manifestations as well as a significant improvement of microbiocenosis indices of the upper respiratory mucous membranes and local immunity indices.
