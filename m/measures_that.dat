The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote.

5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{many groups}} have {{attempted}} to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states. In 1994, South Dakota voters rejected a ballot <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> would have lowered the age requirements {{to serve as a}} State Senator or State Representative from 25 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved a similar ballot <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21.

5|$|After {{the rescue}} of Mussolini and the {{establishment}} of the Italian Social Republic (RSI), in spite of urging by local German officials, Hitler refused to officially annex South Tyrol, instead he decided that the RSI should hold official sovereignty over these territories, and forbade all <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> would give the impression of official annexation of South Tyrol. However, in practice the territory of South Tyrol within the boundaries defined by Germany as Operationszone Alpenvorland that included Trent, Bolzano, and Belluno, were de facto incorporated into Germany's Reichsgau Tirol-Vorarlberg and administered by its Gauleiter Franz Hofer. While the region identified by Germany as Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland that included Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola, Fiume (Rijeka), and Ljubljana were de facto incorporated into Reichsgau Kärnten and administered by its Gauleiter Friedrich Rainer.|$|E

However, the Cabinet approved <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> summer, including increased price supports for butter and turkeys, and raises for federal employees. Once the 23rd Canadian Parliament was opened on October 14 by Queen Elizabeth II — the first to be opened by any Canadian monarch — the government rapidly passed legislation, including tax cuts and increases in old age pensions.

5|$|Due to the Panic of 1819, many {{citizens}} in Kentucky fell deep into debt and began petitioning the legislature for help. The state's politicians {{split into two}} factions. Those who advocated for <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> were more favorable to debtors were dubbed the Relief faction while those who insisted on sound money principles and the strict adherence to the obligation of contracts were called the Anti-Relief faction. In 1820, a pro-relief measure passed the General Assembly providing debtors a one-year stay on the collection of their debts if the creditor would accept payment in devalued notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth or a two-year stay if the creditor demanded payment in sound money. Two separate circuit courts found the law unconstitutional {{in the cases of}} Williams v. Blair and Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E

5|$|During {{the post-war}} Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a {{constitution}} which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883. It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia {{to include a}} poll tax and other voter registration <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor European Americans. Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded {{due to a lack}} of political representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.|$|E

Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures {{to increase the number}} of people available for armaments production and the Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other <b>measures,</b> <b>that</b> all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|E

In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> people {{can take to}} increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E
5|$|For {{its part}} the government, not {{consulting}} Solidarity, adopted {{a plan of}} economic <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> could only be implemented by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was {{willing or able to}} back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.|$|E

5|$|From 1960, {{the regime}} {{increasingly}} implemented anti-Catholic policies, including harassment, atheistic propaganda, and <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> made carrying out religious practices more difficult. In 1965, the Conference of Polish Bishops issued the Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops. In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th {{anniversary of the}} Baptism of Poland led by the primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński and other bishops, who toured the country, turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the Catholic Church in Poland. In fierce competition, the state authorities conducted their own national celebrations, stressing {{the origin of the}} Polish statehood, but the display of the Polish Church hierarchy's command of enormous crowds in a land ruled by the communists must have impressed the Catholic prelates in the Vatican and elsewhere. The state-church dialogue, symbolized by the presence of the few Znak independent Catholic deputies in parliament, was rapidly deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Left undone, however, was {{extending}} the laws dealing with surveying and registering land claims with the registrar {{of the state}} land office. Cognizant that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on {{his experience as a}} surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.|$|E
