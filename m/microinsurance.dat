25|$|More broadly, the Moroccan {{insurance}} {{sector is}} already consolidated, with five large players controlling the market. The sector {{is set to}} be opened up to foreign competition from 2010 onward, and the consolidation of insurance companies into larger entities should strengthen the local players to better compete with eventual competition from foreign insurers. There is also the possibility that new insurance niches such as takaful (Islamic insurance) and <b>microinsurance</b> products will {{become part of the}} Moroccan market in the medium-term, but they are unlikely to appear in the near future.|$|E
25|$|While the {{original}} village bank credit and savings program remains the core {{product in the}} African programs, FINCA has partnered with leading insurance companies to offer health and life insurance products, health care, and business-interruption coverage {{in response to the}} AIDS crisis occurring in Africa. FINCA Uganda, which is a world pioneer in <b>microinsurance,</b> has partnered with AIG to provide life insurance, to ensure that the death of a village bank member does not result in hardship for the other village bank members or the family of the deceased as the client's loan is paid off. Generous funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is making it possible for FINCA and the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health's Center for Communication Programs to provide HIV/AIDS prevention education by using FINCA Malawi's established network of village bank groups.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Micro{{insurance}}</b> is insurance {{with low}} premiums and low caps / coverage. In this definition, [...] "micro" [...] {{refers to the}} small financial transaction that each insurance policy generates. [...] "General <b>microinsurance</b> product means health insurance contract, any contract covering the belongings, such as, hut, livestock or tools or instruments or any personal accident contract, either on individual or group basis, as per terms stated in Schedule-I appended to these regulations"; and [...] "life <b>microinsurance</b> product" [...] means any term insurance contract with or without return of premium, any endowment insurance contract or health insurance contract, with or without an accident benefit rider, either on individual or group basis, as per terms stated in Schedule-II appended to these regulations as those within defined (low) minimum and maximum caps. The IRDA’s characterization of <b>microinsurance</b> by the product features is further complemented by their definition for <b>microinsurance</b> agents, those appointed by and acting for an insurer, for distribution of <b>microinsurance</b> products (and only those products).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Microinsurance</b> Centre {{was created}} in 2000 by Michael J. McCord. It is as an {{independent}} institution dedicated to promoting responsible <b>microinsurance,</b> with their focus on the partner-agent model. The partner-agent model links <b>microinsurance</b> schemes (hosted primarily by MFIs) to established commercial insurance companies. This link allows {{the risk of the}} schemes to remain with the insurer, and thereby can enable greater sustainability and long-term viability.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenge for <b>microinsurance</b> is the actual delivery to clients. Methods and models for doing so {{vary depending on the}} organization, institution, and provider involved. As Dubby Mahalanobis states, one must be thorough and careful when making policies, otherwise <b>microinsurance</b> could do more harm than good. Tricky challenges In general, there are four main methods for offering <b>microinsurance</b> the partner-agent model, the provider-driven model, the full-service model, and the community-based model. Each of these models has their own advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
50|$|Full service model: The <b>microinsurance</b> {{scheme is}} in charge of everything; both the design and {{delivery}} of products to the clients, working with external healthcare providers to provide the services. This model has the advantage of offering <b>microinsurance</b> schemes full control, yet the disadvantage of higher risks.|$|E

50|$|Partner agent model: A {{partnership}} is formed between the micro insurance(partner as MFI) scheme and an agent (insurance companies), {{and in some}} cases a third-party healthcare provider. The <b>microinsurance</b> scheme is responsible for the delivery and marketing of products to the clients, while the agent retains all responsibility for design and development. In this model, <b>microinsurance</b> schemes benefit from limited risk, but are also disadvantaged in their limited control. Micro Insurance Centre is an example of an organization using this model.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Micro{{insurance}}</b> {{is the use}} {{of insurance}} as an economic instrument at the [...] "micro" [...] (i.e. smaller than national) level of society. This definition integrates the above approaches into one comprehensive conceptual framework. It was first published in 1999, pre-dating the other three approaches, and has been noted to be the first recorded use of the term [...] "microinsurance". [...] Under this definition, decisions in <b>microinsurance</b> are made within each unit, (rather than far away, at the level of governments, companies, NGOs that offer support in operations, etc.).|$|E

They have {{a wide range of}} partners that they work with, including insurers, regulators, donors, MFIs, and NGOs. They {{have played a role in}} projects in numerous countries that include Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, India, Nepal, Jordan, Peru, Laos, and Indonesia. They are also actively involved in disseminating information on micro-insurance through their periodic Briefing Notes, web site, and speaking engagements. In addition, they have conducted several country case studies and held trainings in Italy, Uganda, and Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|Insurance {{functions}} on {{the concept}} of risk pooling, and likewise, regardless of its small unit size and its activities at the level of single communities, so does <b>microinsurance.</b> <b>Microinsurance</b> links multiple small units into larger structures, creating networks that enhance both insurance functions (through broader risk pools) and support structures for improved governance (i.e. training, data banks, research facilities, access to reinsurance etc.). This mechanism is conceived as an autonomous enterprise, independent of permanent external financial lifelines, and its main objective is to pool both risks and resources of whole groups for the purpose of providing financial protection to all members against the financial consequences of mutually determined risks.|$|E

50|$|Provider-driven model: The {{healthcare}} provider is the <b>microinsurance</b> scheme, and {{similar to the}} full-service model, is responsible for all operations, delivery, design, and service.

50|$|<b>Microinsurance</b> is {{recognized}} as a useful tool in economic development. As many low-income {{people do not have}} access to adequate risk-management tools, they are vulnerable to fall back into poverty in times of hardship, for example when the breadwinner of the family dies, or when high hospital bills force families to take out loans with high interest rates. Furthermore, <b>microinsurance</b> makes it possible for people to take more risks. When farmers are insured against a bad harvest (resulting from drought), they are in a better position to grow crops which give high yields in good years, and bad yields in year of drought. Without the insurance, however, they will be inclined to do the opposite; since they have to safeguard a minimal level of income for themselves and their families, crops will be grown which are more drought resistant, but which have a much lower yield in good weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|IPA {{performs}} many {{evaluations of}} microfinance programs and products, including microcredit, microsavings, and <b>microinsurance.</b> IPA {{is part of}} the Financial Access Initiative (FAI), a consortium launched with the support of a $5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with the goal of increasing knowledge about microfinance and communicating research lessons to a broad spectrum of policy-makers, microfinance institutions, and the public at large.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microinsurance</b> {{is synonymous}} to {{community-based}} financing arrangements, including community health funds, mutual health organizations, rural health insurance, revolving drugs funds, and community involvement in user-fee management. Most community financing schemes have {{evolved in the}} context of severe economic constraints, political instability, and lack of good governance. The common feature within all, is the active involvement of the community in revenue collection, pooling, resource allocation and, frequently, service provision.|$|E
50|$|A <b>micro{{insurance}}</b> {{scheme is}} a scheme that uses, among others, an insurance mechanism whose beneficiaries are (at least in part) people excluded from formal social protection schemes, particularly, informal economy {{workers and their}} families. The scheme differs from others created to provide legal social protection to formal economy workers. Membership is not compulsory (but can be automatic), and members pay, at least in part, the necessary contributions in order to cover benefits.|$|E
5000|$|Microfinance {{management}} in the Philippines is improving substantially. In 2009, the Economist Intelligence Unit [...] "recognized the Philippines as {{the best in the}} world in terms of its microfinance regulatory framework." [...] The DOF-National Credit Council (DOF-NCC) focused on improving the state of local cooperatives by developing a supervision and examination manual, launching advocacies for these cooperatives, and pushing for the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008. A standardized national strategy for <b>microinsurance</b> and the provisions of grants and technical assistance were formulated.|$|E

Those who buy more than three policies are allowed to pay {{in as much as}} six payments per year, (there is a special loan directed at these cases). On average 130 policies are sold per month.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Microinsurance</b> is the {{protection}} of low-income people (those living on between approximately $1 and $4 per day( [...] below $4)) against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payment proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risks involved. This definition {{is exactly the same}} as one might use for regular insurance except for the clearly prescribed target market: low-income people. The target population typically consists of persons ignored by mainstream commercial and social insurance schemes, as well as persons who have not previously had access to appropriate insurance products.|$|E
