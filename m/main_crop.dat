5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the <b>main</b> <b>crop.</b> Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E
5|$|The {{service sector}} {{provides}} most {{employment in the}} town. Limited agriculture is carried out; the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> is paddy rice. During the British Raj, Sirkazhi was known for mats made {{with a kind of}} cyperus. The headquarters of the taluka and panchayat union administration, and many government offices are located in the town. There are no major industries within the town, except for several rice mills. Sirkazhi has many Hindu temples, which draw in tourism activity. Sirkali Coop Urban Bank, founded on 23 April 1918 is the oldest bank in Sirkali. All major nationalised banks and private banks have branches in the town, and all have atms.|$|E
5|$|Rice cultivation: In 2002, a Chinese and Japanese group {{reported}} the discovery in eastern China of fossilised phytoliths of domesticated rice apparently {{dating back to}} 11,900 BC or earlier. However, phytolith data are controversial in some quarters due to potential contamination problems. It is likely that demonstrated rice was cultivated in the middle Yangtze Valley by 7000 BC, as shown in finds from the Pengtoushan culture at Bashidang, Changde, Hunan. By 5000 BC, rice had been domesticated at Hemudu culture near the Yangtze Delta and was being cooked in pots. Although millet remained the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> in northern China throughout history, several sporadic attempts {{were made by the}} state to introduce rice around the Bohai Gulf as early as the 1st century.|$|E
50|$|Farming is {{the main}} {{occupation}} for the most of Jakhal residents. The <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> in the monsoon seasons are Bajara (Pearl Millet), Moth and Gwar. The <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> in the winter months are Wheat, Barley, Mustard Seed and Chana (Chickpeas).|$|R

5|$|The Masons {{lived in}} a colonial Virginia that had few roads, as most {{commerce}} was carried on Chesapeake Bay or along the waters of its tributaries, such as the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers. Most settlement took place near the rivers, through which planters could trade with the world. Thus, colonial Virginia initially developed few towns, since estates were largely self-sufficient, and could get what they needed without the need to purchase locally. Even the capital, Williamsburg, saw little activity when the legislature was not in session. Local politics was dominated by large landowners like the Masons. The Virginia economy rose and fell with tobacco, the <b>main</b> <b>crop,</b> which was raised mostly for export to Britain.|$|E
5|$|The town {{experiences}} long {{summers and}} short winters,and receives an average yearly rainfall of , {{mainly from the}} north-east monsoon between October and December. Its {{close proximity to the}} sea means that Sirkazhi receives more rainfall than neighbouring towns. Sirkazhi is part of the Cauvery delta region and has irrigation channels, called the Kollidam channels, which carry water from the rivers and provide a rich deposit of fertile silt before reaching the sea. The soil is black and contains fertile alluvial sediment. The area's <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> is rice; other crops grown in the area are coconut, tamarind and neem. The landscape mostly consists of plain lands with fields and small portions of scrub jungle. Antelope, spotted deer, wild hog, jackal and fox are present in the jungles and outlying areas of the town. Crow and ordinary game birds are found in large numbers in the town.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the <b>main</b> <b>crop.</b> They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E

25|$|San Pedro {{is largely}} an {{agricultural}} community whose <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> {{continues to be}} coffee. In 1973, San Pedro was producing nearly 700,000kilograms of coffee per year {{with a population of}} just over 1,500 people.|$|E
25|$|Coffee (Arabica type) {{used to be}} a {{significant}} produce of Huambo thanks to the favourable altitude and weather conditions of the Province, and is currently being reintroduced as the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> in many farms of the region.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 {{indeed it}} was started the Italian {{colonization}} of the area of Genale, in southern Somalia, forming a group of small and medium-sized farms. Most settlers consisted of old fascist militants of Turin who had followed in this Italian colony the new governor of Somalia, Cesare Maria De Vecchi. The first informal association between farmers, however, arose only in 1928. The <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> of the area was cotton and was done by small farms owned by those Italian settlers: about one hundred with an area varying between 75 and 600 hectares (with an average that oscillated about 200) with a total area of about 20,000 hectares. At least until 1931 the cotton was the <b>main</b> <b>crop,</b> later replaced by the banana production, whose harvest was sold to the Italian State, that did the marketing in Italy as a monopoly.|$|E

25|$|A famine {{broke out}} in 1630–32 in Deccan, Gujarat and Khandesh {{as a result of}} three <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> failures. Two million died of starvation, grocers sold dogs' flesh and mixed {{powdered}} bones with flour. Some villages were completely destroyed, their streets filled with human corpses. In response to the devastation, Shah Jahan set up Langar (free kitchens) for the victims of the famine.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} Basankusu usually keep {{vegetable}} gardens {{away from the}} town itself. They are cut into the forest and fit the slash and burn model of farming. These plots of land are often only partially cleared, with house-sized termite hills and the trunks of felled trees left to supply firewood for the year's cooking. Cassava is the <b>main</b> <b>crop.</b> It can be grown for the table {{as well as for}} the market-place. Peanuts, maize, papaya, pineapples, avocados, oil palms, and other fruits and vegetables are also grown.|$|E
25|$|Myles Keogh {{was born}} in Orchard House, Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, Ireland on 25 March 1840. The farming carried out at Keogh's home place in Leighlinbridge was arable, barley being the <b>main</b> <b>crop.</b> This meant that the Keogh family were largely {{unaffected}} by the hunger and poverty that accompanied the Irish Potato Famine and ravaged the country between 1845 and 1850 – Keogh's childhood days. However, two, or possibly three, of Keogh's siblings did die young, apparently from typhoid – a disease associated with the famine and an illness that Myles also suffered as a boy.|$|E

25|$|Most of the state’s land {{is devoted}} to {{agriculture}} (38.1%) or to forest (34.9%). Much of these crop forest lands are ejido or communal lands. The <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> is corn, with peas, barley, beans, potatoes, alfalfa, wheat, avocados and guava also grown. Livestock is raised on about 17% of the state’s farmland with cattle being the most important animal. Almost all of the forest lands in the state are used for producing forestry products such as wood and paper. However, this sector only employs 1.3% of the state’s population.|$|E
25|$|Broad {{beans are}} {{generally}} eaten while still young and tender, enabling harvesting to begin {{as early as}} the middle of spring for plants started under glass or overwintered in a protected location, but even the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> sown in early spring will be ready from mid to late summer. Horse beans, left to mature fully, are usually harvested in the late autumn, and are then eaten as a pulse. The immature pods are also cooked and eaten, and the young leaves of the plant can also be eaten, either raw or cooked as a pot herb (like spinach).|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the main}} crops for the Havasupai were corn, beans, squash, sunflowers, gourds, and some cotton. Corn, the tribe’s <b>main</b> <b>crop,</b> was {{generally}} harvested {{in the later}} summer months. While growing, a farming technique called cepukaka was used to protect the corn from being blown over when it got to a certain height. In this technique, a farmer loosened the soil around the corn and then pulled it into a hill around the stalk base. Along with their traditional crops, the Havasupai were introduced to melons, watermelons, and orchard trees {{with the arrival of}} the Spanish. By the 1940s these crops had become staples of the Havasupai diet.|$|E

25|$|The economy {{continued}} to industrialize and urbanize, with heavy industry – especially coal and steel – becoming {{important in the}} Ruhr, and manufacturing growing in the cities, the Ruhr, and Silesia. Perkins (1981) argues that more important than Bismarck's new tariff on imported grain was {{the introduction of the}} sugar beet as a <b>main</b> <b>crop.</b> Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient practices in favor of modern methods, including use of new fertilizers and new tools. The knowledge and tools gained from the intensive farming of sugar and other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in Europe by 1914. Even so, farms were small in size, and women did much of the field work. An unintended consequence was the increased dependence on migratory, especially foreign, labor.|$|E
25|$|In Chhattisgarh, rice, the <b>main</b> <b>crop,</b> {{is grown}} on about 77% {{of the net}} sown area. Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain. Of the three {{agroclimatic}} zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed. The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000ha in Chhattisgarh plains and 2300ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills. Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the main occupation of more than 80% of the population.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a number}} of fairs {{dedicated}} to local products. The Feria del Nopal (Nopal Cactus Fair) in San Bernardino Tlaxcalanzingo celebrates the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> grown in the municipality. It occurs {{during the first week}} of June. The Feria del Queso (Cheese Fair) is held in Santa Maria Tonantzintla and is held in honor of the Virgin of the Conception. There is an exposition and sale of local cheeses at the main plaza of the municipality on the first weekend of August. There {{is also a}}n annual festival dedicated to bread in which an enormous brick oven is constructed on the main plaza and local bread makers demonstrate traditional techniques. Over 150 types of bread are exhibited and sold during the event.|$|E
