40|$|Seeds {{of broad}} bean (Vicia faba L.) contain a hydro{{peroxide}}-dependent fatty acid epoxygenase. Hydrogen peroxide {{served as an}} effective oxygen donor in the epoxygenase reaction. Fifteen unsaturated fatty acids were incubated with V. faba epoxygenase {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide and the epoxy fatty acids produced were identified. Examination of the substrate specificity of the epoxygenase using a series of monounsaturated fatty acids demonstrated that (Z) -fatty acids were rapidly epoxidized into the corresponding cis-epoxy acids, whereas (E) -fatty acids were converted into their trans-epoxides at a very slow rate. In the series of (Z) -monoenoic acids, the double bond position as well as the chain length influenced the rate of epoxidation. The best substrates were found to be palmitoleic, oleic, and <b>myristoleic</b> <b>acids.</b> Steric analysis showed that most of the epoxy acids produced from monounsaturated fatty acids as well as from linoleic and α-linolenic acids had mainly the (R),(S) configuration. Exceptions were C 18 acids having the epoxide group located at C- 12 / 13, in which cases the (S),(R) enantiomers dominated. 13 (S) -Hydroxy- 9 (Z), 11 (E) -octadecadienoic acid incubated with epoxygenase afforded the epoxy alcohol 9 (S), 10 (R) -epoxy- 13 (S) -hydroxy- 11 (E) -octadecenoic acid as the major product. Smaller amounts of the diastereomeric epoxy alcohol 9 (R), 10 (S) -epoxy- 13 (S) -hydroxy- 11 (E) -octadecenoic acid as well as the α,β-epoxy alcohol 11 (R), 12 (R) -epoxy- 13 (S) -hydroxy- 9 (Z) -octadecenoic acid were also obtained.

These fatty acids were localized in the membrane-wall complex, which contained the respiratory pigments, the quinone, and the phospholipids. The fatty acids which could be extracted with organic solvents comprised 86 % of the total fatty acids of the cell. These fatty acids were distributed as 98 % in the phospholipids and 1. 9 % in the neutral lipids, of which 0. 5 % were free fatty acids. Palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic, and vaccenic acids comprised 72 % of the total fatty acids and were found almost exclusively in the phospholipids. The phospholipids also contained the cyclopropane fatty acids. The neutral lipids contained significant proportions of the odd-numbered branched and straight-chain fatty acids. The principal free fatty acids were n-dodecanoic and pentadecenoic acids. The nonextractable wall complex contained 14 % of the total fatty acids.

Data from forty lactating Murrah-crossbred buffaloes were collected on five commercial farms located at Sarapui and Pilar do Sul, Sao Paulo-Brazil. A field survey was done from April to November 2002. In four farms, buffaloes were fed with wet brewers grains (primary concentrate). Only one farm (Farm 4) offered pasture and corn silage. Monthly milk samples were collected and stored at - 20 ºC until analyzed for fatty acid composition. The Δ 9 -desaturase activity was measured using an indirect method (<b>myristoleic</b> and myristic <b>acids</b> ration - C 14 : 1 c 9 /C 14 : 0). The higher C 14 : 1 c 9 /C 14 : 0 rate was verified on Farm 4 (0. 092). The C 14 : 1 c 9 /C 14 : 0 ratio were 0. 064 to Farm 1; 0. 065 to Farm 2; 0. 062 to Farm 3 and 0. 065 to Farm 5.

40|$|The novel {{cytochrome}} P 450 /redox partner fusion enzyme CYP 116 B 1 from Cupriavidus metallidurans {{was expressed}} in and purified from Escherichia coli. Isolated CYP 116 B 1 exhibited a characteristic Fe(II) CO complex with Soret maximum at 449 nm. EPR and resonance Raman analyses indicated low-spin, cysteinate-coordinated ferric haem iron at both 10 K and ambient temperature, respectively, for oxidized CYP 116 B 1. The EPR of reduced CYP 116 B 1 demonstrated stoichiometric binding of a 2 Fe- 2 S cluster in the reductase domain. FMN binding in the reductase domain {{was confirmed by}} flavin fluorescence studies. Steady-state reduction of cytochrome c and ferricyanide were supported by both NADPH/NADH, with NADPH used more efficiently (K(m[NADPH]) = 0. 9 ± 0. 5 μM and K(m[NADH]) = 399. 1 ± 52. 1 μM). Stopped-flow studies of NAD(P) H-dependent electron transfer to the reductase confirmed the preference for NADPH. The reduction potential of the P 450 haem iron was - 301 ± 7 mV, with retention of haem thiolate ligation in the ferrous enzyme. Redox potentials for the 2 Fe- 2 S and FMN cofactors were more positive {{than that of the}} haem iron. Multi-angle laser light scattering demonstrated CYP 116 B 1 to be monomeric.

This holistic approach requires systems biology to scrutinize {{the effects of}} diet on tissue biology. To decipher the adipose tissue (AT) response to diet induced weight changes we focused on key molecular (lipids and transcripts) AT species during a longitudinal dietary intervention. To obtain a systems model, a network approach was used to combine all sets of variables (bio-clinical, fatty acids and mRNA levels) and get an overview of their interactions. AT fatty acids and mRNA levels were quantified in 135 obese women at baseline, after an 8 -week low calorie diet (LCD) and after 6 months of ad libitum weight maintenance diet (WMD). After LCD, individuals were stratified a posteriori according to weight change during WMD. A 3 steps approach was used to infer a global model involving the 3 sets of variables. It consisted in inferring intra-omic networks with sparse partial correlations and inter-omic networks with regularized canonical correlation analysis and finally combining the obtained omic-specific network in a single global model. The resulting networks were analyzed using node clustering, systematic important node extraction and cluster comparisons. Overall, AT showed both constant and phase-specific biological signatures in response to dietary intervention. AT from women regaining weight displayed growth factors, angiogenesis and proliferation signaling signatures, suggesting unfavorable tissue hyperplasia. By contrast, after LCD a strong positive relationship between AT <b>myristoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (a fatty acid with low AT level) content and de novo lipogenesis mRNAs was found.

40|$|The “RNA world” and the “Lipid world” {{theories}} for {{the origin}} of cellular life are often considered incompatible due to {{the differences in the}} environmental conditions at which they can emerge. One obstacle resides in the conflicting requirements for divalent metal ions, in particular Mg 2 +, with respect to optimal ribozyme activity, fatty acid vesicle stability and protection against RNA strand cleavage. Here, we report on the activity of a short L 1 ligase ribozyme in the presence of <b>myristoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (MA) vesicles at varying concentrations of Mg 2 +. The ligation rate is significantly lower at low-Mg 2 + conditions. However, the loss of activity is overcompensated by the increased stability of RNA leading to a larger amount of intact ligated substrate after long reaction periods. Combining RNA ligation assays with fatty acid vesicles we found that MA vesicles made of 5 mM amphiphile are stable and do not impair ligase ribozyme activity in the presence of approximately 2 mM Mg 2 +.

40|$|Ophthalmia neonatorum, {{also called}} {{neonatal}} conjunctivitis, acquired during delivery {{can occur in}} the first 28  days of life. Commonly caused by the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae, infection can lead to corneal scarring, perforation of the eye, and blindness. One approach {{that can be taken}} to prevent the disease is the use of an ophthalmic prophylaxis, which kills the bacteria {{on the surface of the}} eye shortly after birth. Current prophylaxes are based on antibiotic ointments. However, N.  gonorrhoeae is resistant to many antibiotics and alternative treatments must be developed before the condition becomes untreatable.

Minor hydroxylation at ω and ω- 3 to ω- 5 positions was also observed. Further oxidized products were detected, including keto, dihydroxylated, ketohydroxy and dicarboxylic fatty acids. Fatty alcohols also yielded hydroxy or keto derivatives of the corresponding fatty acid. Finally, alkanes gave, in addition to alcohols at positions 2 or 3, dihydroxylated derivatives at {{both sides of the}} molecule; and sterols showed side-chain hydroxylation. No derivatives were found for fatty acids esterified with sterols or forming triglycerides, but methyl esters were ω- 1 or ω- 2 hydroxylated.

40|$|Abstract: The goal of {{this study}} is the {{selective}} oxy-functionalization of aliphatic compounds under mild and environmentally friendly conditions using a low-cost enzymatic biocatalyst. This could be possible taking advan-tage from a new peroxidase type that catalyzes monoox-ygenase reactions with H 2 O 2 as the only cosubstrate (peroxygenase). With this purpose, recombinant peroxyge-nase, from gene mining in the sequenced genome of Coprinopsis cinerea and heterologous expression using an industrial fungal host, is tested {{for the first time on}} aliphatic substrates. The reaction on free and esterified fatty acids and alcohols, and long-chain alkanes was followed by gas chromatography, and the different reaction products were identified bymass spectrometry. Regioselective hydroxylation of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids was observed at the v- 1 and v- 2 positions (only at the v- 2 position in <b>myristoleic</b> <b>acid).</b> Alkyl esters of fatty acids and monoglycerides were also v- 1 or v- 2 hydroxylated, but di- and tri-glycerides were not modified. Fatty alcohols yielded hydroxy derivatives at the v- 1 or v- 2 positions (diols) but also fatty acids and their hydroxy derivatives. Interestingly, the peroxygenase was able to oxyfunctionalize alkanes giving, in addition to alcohols at positions 2 or 3, dihydroxylated derivatives at both sides of the molecule. The predominance of mono- or di-hydroxyl-ated derivatives seems related to the higher or lower proportion of acetone, respectively, in the reaction medium. The recombinant C. cinerea peroxygenase appears as a promising biocatalyst for alkane activation and production of aliphatic oxygenated derivatives, with better properties than the previously reported peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita, and advantages related to its recombinant nature for enzyme engineering and industrial production...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Forty Nelore cattle {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the effects of supplementation with different antioxidants on carcass characteristics and meat quality of feedlot cattle. Animals were fed Brachiaria brizantha hay and subjected to five treatments (control and four antioxidants: zinc, selenium, vitamin E, and selenium + vitamin E). After a 105 -day feeding period, cattle were slaughtered. Tissue composition, as well as carcass proximate composition, color, tenderness, pH, and fatty acid profile were evaluated. Analysis of variance was carried out and means compared by Tukey test at 0. 05 probability. The group fed selenium showed the lowest muscle amount (66. 61 g/ 100 g) compared with the other antioxidants evaluated. There was no difference among treatments for bone, fat, and comestible portion percentages as well as muscle:bone, muscle:fat, and comestible portion:bone ratios, with mean values of 16. 85 g/ 100 g, 14. 70 g/ 100 g, 82. 99 g/ 100 g, 4. 06, 4. 85, and 4. 95, respectively. Neither brightness, red, or yellow contents of the meat nor carcass pH were affected by treatments. For tenderness and losses during thawing and cooking, there were no differences among treatments, with averages of 6. 43 kgf cm 2, 3. 22 g/ 100 g, and 21. 15 g/ 100 g, respectively. Supplementation of Nelore cattle fed Brachiaria brizantha hay with antioxidants do not influence carcass characteristics or meat quality. However, vitamin E supplementation reduces the levels of omega 3 fatty acid, whereas supplementation with selenium + vitamin E promotes an increase in linoleic and palmitoleic acids and a decrease in <b>myristoleic</b> <b>acid,</b> making the supplementation feasible due to the beneficial effects provided by these acids...|$|E
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae medium-chain acyl elongase (ELO 1) mutants have {{previously}} been isolated in screens for fatty acid synthetase (FAS) mutants {{that fail to}} grow on myristic acid (C 14 : 0) -supplemented media. Here we report that wild-type cells cultivated in <b>myristoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 14 : 1 D 9) -supplemented media synthesized a novel unsaturated fatty acid that was identified as C 16 : 1 D 11 fatty acid by gas chromatography-mass spec-troscopy. Synthesis of C 16 : 1 D 11 was dependent on a functional ELO 1 gene, indicating that Elo 1 p catalyzes carboxy-terminal elongation of unsaturated fatty acids (a-elongation). In wild-type cells, the C 16 : 1 D 11 elon-gation product accounted for approximately 12 % of the total fatty acids. This increased to 18 % in cells that lacked a functional acyl chain desaturase (ole 1 D mutants) and hence were fully dependent on uptake and elon-gation of C 14 : 1. The observation that ole 1 D mutant cells grew almost like wild type on medium supplemented with C 14 : 1 indicated that uptake and elongation of unsaturated fatty acids were efficient. Interestingly, wild-type cells supplemented with either C 14 : 1 or C 16 : 1 fatty acids displayed dramatic alterations in their phospho-lipid composition, suggesting that the availability of acyl chains is a dominant determinant of the phospholipid class composition of cellular membranes. In particular, the relative content {{of the two major}} phospholipid classes, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, was strongly dependent on the chain length of the supplemented fatty acid. Moreover, analysis of the acyl chain composition of individual phospholipid classe...|$|E
40|$|Acidic {{compounds}} from pokasa (Broussonetia papytifeera) bark methanol extractives containing fatty acids, triterpene {{acids and}} phenolics were separated and identified. Certain neutral substances were assumed {{to remain with}} the acidic fraction, as both fractions might have certain characteristics that make their separation difficult. Fatty acids separated included a series of n-fatty acids with carbon number ranging from 10 to 22. Among them, palmitic, stearic and myristic acids were the major components. Unsaturated fatty acids, <b>myristoleic</b> <b>acid,</b> palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic were also identified. Triterpene acid fraction {{is made up of}} a complex mixture, from which only betulinic acid and ursolic acids were identified. Among the phenolic acids, vanillic, syringic, ferulic, and sinapic acids were identified. Each fraction of fatty acid, triterpene acid, and phenolic acid with or without the addition of neutrals was submitted to the turbidity test to examine its interaction with calcium. In cases where neutrals were not added, triterpene acids showed the highest At values. But with addition of neutrals, the phenolic acid fraction displayed the highest synergistic effect. The AI values of the neutral fractions were also analyzed. The results show that Ar values decrease in the order of triterpene alcohol, triterpene acetate, steroid alcohol, fatty alcohol, and alkanes, regardless of the presense of total acids. However, aggregation of the neutral components with calcium was highly accelerated by a mixture of fatty acids, but only weakly by the pure acids. Unsaturated fatty acids, although minute in quantities, also showed great effects in turbidity changes. On the other hand, the AZ values due to pure and combined phenolic acids were not as high. When neutrals were added, however, they all showed equal enhancement. In conclusion, any combination of one or more neutrals with one or more acids demonstrated some synergistic effects. Among them, triterpene esters, phenolic acids and unsaturated fatty acids exhibited the greatest effects...|$|E

The key molecular mechanisms underlying cold adaptation in Arctic rhizobia remains totally unknown. Since the concentration and contents of metabolites {{are closely related to}} stress adaptation, we applied GC-MS and NMR to identify and quantify fatty acids and water soluble compounds possibly related to low temperature acclimation in strain N 33. Bacterial cells were grown at three different growing temperatures (40 C, 100 C and 210 C). Cells from 210 C were also cold-exposed to 40 C for different times (2, 4, 8, 60 and 240 minutes). We identified that poly-unsaturated linoleic acids 182 ̆ 2362 (9, 12) & 182 ̆ 2362 (6, 9) were more abundant in cells growing at 4 or 100 C, than in cells cultivated at 210 C. The mono-unsaturated phospho/neutral fatty acids <b>myristoleic</b> <b>acid</b> 142 ̆ 2361 (11) were the most significantly overexpressed (45 -fold) after 1 hour of exposure to 40 C. As reported in the literature, these fatty acids play important roles in cold adaptability by supplying cell membrane fluidity, and by providing energy to cells. Analysis of water-soluble compounds revealed that isobutyrate, sarcosine, threonine and valine were more accumulated during exposure to 40 C. These metabolites might play a role in conferring cold acclimation to strain N 2 ̆ 0832 ̆ 083 at 40 C, probably by acting as cryoprotectants. Isobutyrate was highly upregulated (19. 4 -fold) during growth at 40 C, thus suggesting that this compound is a precursor for the cold-regulated fatty acids modification to low temperature adaptation.

The methyl esters and alcohol analogues of these compounds, glycerols, phospholipids, saturated fatty acids, retinoids and carotenes were inactive even at 0. 2 mM. The results of the binding assay and the enzymic assay correlated well except for elaidic acid and linolelaidic acid, the trans isomers of oleic acid and linoleic acid respectively, which were much less active than their cis isomers in the binding assay but were as potent in the enzymic assay. gamma-Linolenic acid {{had no effect on}} the activities of two other rat liver microsomal enzymes: NADH:menadione reductase and glucuronosyl transferase. gamma-Linolenic acid, the most potent inhibitor tested, decreased the Vmax. and increased Km values of substrates, NADPH and testosterone, and promoted dissociation of [3 H] 4 -MA from the microsomal reductase. gamma-Linolenic acid, but not the corresponding saturated fatty acid (stearic acid), inhibited the 5 alpha-reductase activity, but not the 17 beta-dehydrogenase activity, of human prostate cancer cells in culture.
