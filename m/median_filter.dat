5|$|An {{approximation}} to {{the curve}}-shortening flow can be computed numerically, by approximating the curve as a polygon {{and using the}} finite difference method to calculate the motion of each polygon vertex. Alternative methods include computing a convolution of polygon vertices and then resampling vertices on the resulting curve, or repeatedly applying a <b>median</b> <b>filter</b> to a digital image whose black and white pixels represent the {{inside and outside of}} the curve.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a <b>median</b> <b>filter</b> with Gaussian weights to each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image, a version of this method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem with}} the {{derivative}} term is that it amplifies higher frequency measurement or process noise that can cause large amounts {{of change in the}} output. It is often helpful to filter the measurements with a low-pass filter in order to remove higher-frequency noise components. As low-pass filtering and derivative control can cancel each other out, the amount of filtering is limited. So low noise instrumentation can be important. A nonlinear <b>median</b> <b>filter</b> may be used, which improves the filtering efficiency and practical performance. In some cases, the differential band can be turned off with little loss of control. This is equivalent to using the PID controller as a PI controller.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Median {{filtering}} detection {{has recently}} drawn much attention in image editing and image anti-forensic techniques. Current image <b>median</b> <b>filtering</b> forensics algorithms mainly extract features manually. To {{deal with the}} challenge of detecting <b>median</b> <b>filtering</b> from small-size and compressed image blocks, by taking into account of the properties of <b>median</b> <b>filtering,</b> we propose a <b>median</b> <b>filtering</b> detection method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can automatically learn and obtain features directly from the image. To our best knowledge, this is the first work of applying CNNs in <b>median</b> <b>filtering</b> image forensics. Unlike conventional CNN models, the first layer of our CNN framework is a filter layer that accepts an image as the input and outputs its <b>median</b> <b>filtering</b> residual (MFR). Then, via alternating convolutional layers and pooling layers to learn hierarchical representations, we obtain multiple features for further classification. We test the proposed method on several experiments. The results show that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvements, especially in the cut-and-paste forgery detection.

50|$|The <b>median</b> <b>filter</b> is a {{nonlinear}} digital filtering technique, {{often used}} to remove noise from an image or signal. Such noise reduction is a typical pre-processing step to improve the results of later processing (for example, edge detection on an image).
