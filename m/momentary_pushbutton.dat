5000|$|The Soviet K145IK17 has {{built-in}} counter, {{making it}} possible to use <b>momentary</b> <b>pushbutton</b> instead of multi-position switch to select games. Handicap game is not hidden, it can be chosen among others using this button. Since pushbutton occupies only one pin, this IC has less pins.|$|E
50|$|The EF and Q {{lines were}} {{typically}} used for multiple interfaces on 1802-based hobbyist computers {{because of the}} lines' favorable and easy handling. It was typical for the Q line to drive a status LED, a cassette interface, an RS-232 interface, and the speaker. This meant that the user could actually hear RS-232 and cassette data being transmitted (unless a volume control was implemented). Traditionally, the EF4 line {{is attached to the}} INPUT <b>momentary</b> <b>pushbutton</b> on the COSMAC Elf. Other systems might use one of the other lines.|$|E
50|$|A one-bit {{output from}} the microprocessor, the Q line, could {{be driven by}} {{software}} to produce sounds through an attached speaker, to save programs in RAM to a cassette recorder, and for serial I/O output. Branch instructions in the 1802 instruction set could read {{the state of the}} EF1 through EF4 single bit value input lines, which were used to read the 'I' keypad (input) <b>momentary</b> <b>pushbutton</b> (typically EF4), programs from the cassette recorder through interface circuitry, serial I/O input, and input from peripherals such as a light pen. There are also seven 8-bit I/O ports available for decoding and interfacing.|$|E
50|$|Like its predecessor, the Pro Soloist, it {{features}} 30 presets and aftertouch. In fact, it looks {{almost identical to}} the Explorer and Pro Soloist. However, there are some notable differences. The Pro/DGX was housed in a new steel chassis, which was much sturdier {{than that of the}} Pro Soloist. Presets were now accessed via digitally latched <b>momentary</b> <b>pushbuttons</b> with LED indicators, as opposed to the more retro, flapper-style toggle switches used in the Pro Soloist.|$|R
5000|$|The routine also {{presumes that}} OUT 4 will display {{the value in}} the CPU system's 8-bit LED or 2-digit hex display, and IN 4 gets the value from the eight toggle {{switches}} (or possibly the hex keypad). The BN4 opcode (loop; * = 'this address'), [...] "branch if the single-bit input EF4 line is lo", is used to test if the <b>momentary</b> 'Input' <b>pushbutton</b> is pressed. The B4 opcode ('if hi') loop waits for the button to be released. SEQ and REQ turn the single Q line, which is usually attached to an LED, on and off.|$|R
5000|$|The fourth {{location}} (2008-2013 408 N.W. Couch St. [...] ) (pictured above) {{was conceived}} by Pierce {{to look like}} an artistic bank machine. She designed it and built it and wired it and programmed it for coin operation completely by herself. Unfortunately, by that time, newer programming possibilities like wifi interference had surpassed her minimal knowledge of electronics and it was next to impossible after a while to keep even simple <b>momentary</b> contact <b>pushbuttons</b> working. The environment seemed inhospitable (see comments on talk page and read the references carefully below), possibly due to (1) religious intolerance; (2) residual disdain by old school members of Portland's art community for Pierce's democratic insistence on access for all; (3) that old timey sexist misinterpretation often caused by those who first present themselves to the public with a youthful impression as a dilletante more prone to wearing heels than flats; or (4) all of the above. The storefront closed and was dismantled in March 2013 due to lack of funds for rent.|$|R

A Gnostic and alchemical symbol, Ouroboros expresses the unity of all things, material and spiritual, which never disappear but perpetually change form in an eternal cycle of destruction and [...] . Description A circle of 40 dominoes, approximately 13 ” in diameter, arranged atop a square base approximately 6 ” high. A single cord provides wall power (110 V AC). There is a single <b>momentary</b> <b>pushbutton</b> {{on the front of}} the base. Pressing the button causes an activation mechanism to topple the first domino, triggering the familiar chain reaction. When half the dominoes have fallen, the initial ones begin to right themselves, in order, creating a continuous wave of falling and rising dominoes. After five cycles all the dominoes are righted, ready to go again with the next press of the pushbutton. Principle of Operation Each domino has two holes drilled in its base. Into each hole are attached the ends of a loop of polyester thread. Each loop is threaded through a corresponding hole in the surface on which the dominoes stand. The two loops are attached to the plunger of a solenoid directly beneath each domino (one solenoid per domino). After waiting a few moments after starting the cascade, a circuit stored in an FPGA energizes the solenoid for the first domino, pulling on the loops, standin...|$|E
