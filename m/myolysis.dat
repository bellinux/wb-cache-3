Taipan snake venom does contain myotoxins that cause <b>myolysis</b> (rhabdomyolysis, muscle damage); the urine of a bite victim often turns reddish-brown as their muscles dissolve and are passed through the kidneys (Myoglobinuria). The kidneys are often badly damaged by filtering so much tissue debris out of the blood, and kidney failure is a common complication in serious cases where there is significant envenoming.|$|E

In case of severe envenomation, death can occur as early as 30 minutes after being bitten, but the average is around 2.5 hours. The time between a bite and death depends on {{various factors such as}} the nature of the bite and the constitution of the victim. Untreated bites have a mortality rate of 100% as the coastal taipan always delivers a fatal dose of venom (an average bite delivers 1000x the lethal dose of venom for a human adult male), and medical professionals recommend that victims seek immediate medical attention even for apparently minor bites.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) causes myocyte stress by inducing structural changes, predominantly <b>myolysis,</b> {{which is}} related to the progression of AF. As heat shock proteins (Hsp) protect against cellular stress, their efficacy in preventing <b>myolysis</b> was investigated in a tachy-paced cell model for AF and in patients with AF. HL- 1 atrial myocytes were subjected to tachy-pacing, which induced <b>myolysis.</b> Hsp overexpression was accomplished by a mild heat shock or by the drug geranylgeranylacetone (GGA). Hsp-gene-transfection studies were carried out to investigate roles of individual Hsp. In left and/or right atrial appendages from patients with paroxysmal (n = 14), persistent (n = 17) AF and controls (n = 13) in sinus rhythm (SR), Hsp levels (Westerns) and localization (confocal microscopy) were determined. Heat shock and GGA administered prior to tachy-pacing resulted in almost complete protection against tachy-pacing-induced <b>myolysis.</b> Overexpression of Hsp 27, but not of Hsp 70, also provided complete protection against pacing-induced <b>myolysis.</b> In patients with paroxysmal AF, Hsp 27 expression was significantly increased compared to SR and persistent AF. No changes in Hsp 40, Hsc 70, Hsp 70 and Hsp 90 expression levels were observed. Hsp 27 levels correlated inversely with the duration of paroxysmal and persistent AF and the extent of <b>myolysis.</b> Furthermore, Hsp 27 was localized on myofibrils in tachy-paced HL- 1 myocytes and in human cardiomyocytes. These data demonstrate that upregulation of Hsp, especially Hsp 27, protects tachy-paced atrial myocytes from <b>myolysis.</b> Therefore, the observed elevated Hsp 27 expression in patients with paroxysmal AF might serve to protect myocytes from <b>myolysis</b> and limit the progression to persistent AF. Pharmacological induction of Hsp, with drugs such as GGA, may represent a novel therapeutic approach in AF. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The self-perpetuation of atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{is associated with}} atrial remodeling, including the degradation of the myofibril structure (<b>myolysis).</b> <b>Myolysis</b> is related to AF-induced activation of cysteine proteases and underlies loss of contractile function. In this study, we investigated which proteases {{are involved in the}} degradation of myofibrillar proteins during AF and whether their inhibition leads to preservation of contractile function after AF. In tachypaced HL- 1 cardiomyocytes and atrial tissue from AF and control patients, degradation of myofibrillar proteins troponin (cTn) T, I, C, human cTnT and actin was investigated by Western blotting, and contractile function was analyzed by cell-shortening measurements. The role of major proteases was determined by applying specific inhibitors. Tachypacing of HL- 1 cardiomyocytes induced a gradual and significant degradation of cTns but not actin, and caused contractile dysfunction. Both were prevented by inhibition of calpain but not by inhibition of caspases or the proteasome. In patients with persistent AF, a significant degradation of cTnT, cTnl and cTnC was found compared to sinus rhythm or paroxysmal AF, which correlated significantly with both calpain activity and the amount of <b>myolysis.</b> Additionally, by utilizing tachypaced human cTnT-transfected HL- 1 cardiomyocytes, we directly showed that the degradation of human cTnT was mediated by calpain and not by caspases or proteasome. Our results suggest that calpain inhibition may therefore represent a key target in combating AF-related structural and functional remodeling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Atrial Fibrillation (AF), {{the most}} common {{sustained}} arrhythmia, is associated with substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. AF has the tendency to become more persistent over time. Recently, an increased awareness {{of the role of}} “atrial remodeling” has advanced our understanding of the persistency of AF. The concept “atrial remodeling” defines any changes in atrial function or structure that promote the development of atrial arrhythmia. It can be divided into two principal forms: electrical remodeling and structural remodeling. Both have their specific molecular basis and are also termed as molecular remodeling. With the onset of tachycardia, the rapid and irregular atrial firing substantially causes abnormal electrophysiological properties like Ca 2 + overload and subsequent reduction of Ca 2 + transients (electrical remodeling). If this progresses, <b>myolysis</b> will occur that hallmarks the initiation of structural remodeling. <b>Myolysis</b> is characterized by degradation of the myofibril structure and leads to contractile dysfunction. In this thesis, we first provide evidence for a major role of calpain in the degradation of troponins (a major group of myofibril proteins) and contractile dysfunction. Using a HL- 1 cell model and a newly developed in vivo Drosophila model for AF, we next show that a general upregulation of so-called Heat Shock Proteins (HSP) can effectively inhibit AF-related remodeling. We identified HSPB 1, a prominent member of the family of human small HSP, as required and sufficient for this protection and also find other family members (HSPB 6, 7, 8) to display similar protective roles. T his thesis therefore provides strong basis for targeting these HSPBs in human AF. ...|$|E
40|$|Background—Prolonged atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) results in electrical, structural, and gap-junctional remodeling. We examined the reversibility {{of the changes}} in (ultra) structure and gap junctions. Methods and Results—Four groups of goats were used: (1) sinus rhythm (SR), (2) 4 months ’ AF (4 mo AF), (3) 2 months’ SR after 4 mo AF (2 mo post-AF), and (4) 4 months ’ SR after 4 mo AF (4 mo post-AF). Atria were characterized electrophysiologically, (ultra) structure was studied by light and electron microscopy, and structural and gap-junctional protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. The atrial effective refractory period had completely returned to normal values 2 mo post-AF. Induced AF episodes still lasted for minutes at 2 and 4 mo post-AF, compared with seconds in the SR group. Structural abnormalities were still present at 2 and 4 mo post-AF, although to a lesser extent. The increased atrial myocyte diameter was back to normal at 4 mo post-AF. The number of myocytes with severe <b>myolysis</b> had almost normalized 4 mo post-AF, whereas myocytes with mild <b>myolysis</b> remained significantly increased. Extracellular matrix area fraction after 4 mo AF was similar to SR. However, the extracellular matrix fraction per myocyte had increased after 4 mo AF and remained higher post-AF.

However, hysterectomy continues to be financially costly with billions of dollars spent annually, as well as costly in more fundamental terms of morbidity and mortality when compared with the less invasive alternatives of myomectomy, ablation, and <b>myolysis</b> [11 – 13].

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common sustained clinical tachyarrhythmia. AF is a progressive condition as demonstrated by the finding that maintenance of normal rhythm and contractile function becomes more difficult the longer AF exists. AF causes cellular stress, which induces atrial. remodelling, involving reduction in the expression of L-type Ca 2 + channels and structural changes (<b>myolysis),</b> finally resulting in contractile dysfunction. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) comprise a family of proteins involved in the protection against different forms of cellular stress. Their classical function is the prevention of toxic protein aggregation by binding to (partially) unfolded proteins. Recent investigations reveal that HSPs prevent atrial. remodelling and attenuate the promotion of AF in both cellular and animal experimental models. Furthermore, studies in humans suggest a protective role for HSPs against progression from paroxysmal AF to chronic, persistent AF. Therefore, manipulation of the HSP system may offer novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention of atrial remodelling. Such approaches may contribute to the maintenance or restoration of tissue integrity and contractile function. Ultimately, this concept may offer an additional treatment strategy to delay progression towards chronic AF and/or improve the outcome of cardioversion...|$|E

The self-perpetuating nature of AF is divided into two major pathophysiological mechanisms: electrical and structural remodeling. Cardiomyocyte stress results in early remodeling, such as contractile dysfunction and changes in action potential duration and later on in down-regulation of L-type calcium channels and structural remodeling, most importantly <b>myolysis,</b> which contribute to contractile dysfunction. The reversal of electrical remodeling is a very fast process, during 3 - 4 days, in contrast to the reversal of structural remodeling which takes at least several months. Since AF-recurrences also occur one week after cardioversion, the persisting high susceptibility must be a result of the process of structural remodeling. To manage AF, therapies should therefore focus on the reversibility of structural remodeling. Treatment possibilities nowadays focus on rhythm and rate control, which control only electrical properties. To manage AF by improving the arrhythmogenic substrate, future research should focus on drugs that reverse structural remodeling. These potential drugs are angiotensin II type- 1 receptor blockers, statins, multi-channel blockers and miRNAs. The action mechanism of these drugs have to be investigated because of their reversible actions on structural remodeling in myocytes. ...|$|E
40|$|Background—Dysfunctional and {{normally}} perfused remote regions show equal <b>myolysis</b> and glycogen accumulation in pig hibernating myocardium. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} these arose secondary to elevations in preload rather than ischemia. Methods and Results—Expression of structural protein (desmin, desmoplakin, titin, cardiotin, -smooth muscle actin, lamin-A/C, and lamin-B 2) in viable dysfunctional myocardium was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We performed blinded analysis of paired dysfunctional left anterior descending coronary artery and normal remote subendocardial samples from stunned (24 hours; n 6), and hibernating (2 weeks; n 6) myocardium versus sham controls pigs (n 7). Within 24 hours, cardiac myocytes globally reexpressed -smooth muscle actin. In stunned myocardium, cardiotin was globally reduced, whereas reductions in desmin were restricted to the dysfunctional region. Alterations progressed with the transition to hibernating myocardium, in which desmin, cardiotin, and titin were globally reduced. A qualitatively similar reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins occurred 3 hours after transient elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure to 333 mm Hg. Conclusions—Qualitative cardiomyocyte remodeling {{similar to that in}} humans with chronic hibernation occurs rapidly after a critical coronary stenosis is applied, as well as after transient elevations in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in the absence of ischemia. Thus, reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins in patients with viable dysfunctiona...|$|E
40|$|Heme oxygenase (HO) is {{the rate}} {{limiting}} enzyme in the degradation of heme, and its isozyme, HO- 1, may protect against tissue injury. One posited mechanism is the degradation of heme released from destabilized heme proteins. We demonstrate that HO- 1 is a critical protectant against acute heme protein-induced toxicity in vivo. In the glycerol model of heme protein toxicity—one characterized by <b>myolysis,</b> hemolysis, and kidney damage—HO- 1 is rapidly induced in the kidney of HO- 1 +/+ mice as the latter sustain mild, reversible renal insufficiency without mortality. In stark contrast, after this insult, HO- 1 −/− mice exhibit fulminant, irreversible renal failure and 100 % mortality; HO- 1 −/− mice do not express HO- 1, and evince an eightfold increment in kidney heme content as compared to HO- 1 +/+ mice. We also demonstrate directly the critical dependency on HO- 1 in protecting against a specific heme protein, namely, hemoglobin: doses of hemoglobin which exert no nephrotoxicity or mortality in HO- 1 +/+ mice, however, precipitate rapidly developing, acute renal failure and marked mortality in HO- 1 −/− mice. We conclude that the induction of HO- 1 is an indispensable response in protecting against acute heme protein toxicity in vivo...|$|E
