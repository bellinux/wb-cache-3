5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} of the universe. If the mass density of the universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E
5|$|Furry {{conventions}} {{started in}} mid-1986 with parties at popular science fiction conventions, such as Westercon and BayCon in the San Francisco Bay Area. Over time, these parties split off into conventions of their own, starting with ConFurence 0 in 1989. Attendance at furry conventions has been growing, {{with the number}} of conventions, total attendance of all conventions and <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> of a single convention all doubling over the period 2000–2006.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{debris and}} ice were {{probably}} {{present at the}} lake, with fan deltas at Tunupa overlapping the Lake Tauca shore. At Tunupa and Cerro Azanaques, glaciers reached their <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> shortly before the lake level peaked and probably contributed to water levels when their retreat began. Two minor glacial advances, over 12,000 BP and about 11,000 BP, appear to coincide with Lake Tauca.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. Contemporary depictions show a large crop, which was {{probably}} used to add space for food storage and to produce crop milk.

5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits it has that modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting has a {{very similar}} profile to {{other members of the}} genus Sillago, with a {{slightly}} compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first made of feeble spines and the second of soft rays headed by a single feeble spine, while the ventral profile is straight. The species is known to grow to a <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> of 51cm and around 1.25kg weight.|$|E

5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their <b>maximum</b> <b>size.</b> The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|During December 1965, more {{submarine}} activity occurred 0.9km (0.56mi) {{southwest of}} Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, {{and over the}} following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> of 70m (230ft) in height, covering an area of , during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.|$|E

5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain <b>maximum</b> <b>size.</b> In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} story, Delphi has {{transformed}} {{herself into a}} Kabuto-like creature to challenge the original. The player wanders around the islands as the Delphi-Kabuto character, searching for prey to increase her size. After Delphi-Kabuto achieves her <b>maximum</b> <b>size,</b> she proceeds to a boss fight with the original Kabuto. Despite her victory, Kabuto revives in a triggered cut scene and restores her Reaper form; whereupon the player takes the role of Baz against the revived monster. After defeating Kabuto, Baz {{is shown in the}} final cut scene, flying off to Planet Majorca with Delphi, Borjoyzee, and his fellow Meccaryns.|$|E
5|$|On {{her second}} voyage in early 1969, Manchester Challenge {{lived up to}} her name by {{entering}} the heavily iced Montreal harbour, discharging, reloading and departing only two days late. Another thirty-seven conventional vessels were stuck at the port for a month. The quartet's ice-breaking capability often resulted them in leading a convoy of other vessels into Montreal during the winter months.

50|$|When using HDLC, {{rather than}} each byte having a start, {{optional}} parity, {{and one or}} two stop bits, the bytes are gathered together into a frame. The start and end of the frame are signalled by the 'flag', and error detection is carried out by the frame check sequence. If the frame has a <b>maximum</b> <b>sized</b> address of 32 bits, a <b>maximum</b> <b>sized</b> control part of 16 bits and a <b>maximum</b> <b>sized</b> frame check sequence of 16 bits, the overhead per frame could be as high as 64 bits. If each frame carried but a single byte, the data throughput efficiency would be extremely low. However, the bytes are normally gathered together, so that even with a maximal overhead of 64 bits, frames carrying more than 24 bytes are more efficient than asynchronous serial connections. As frames can vary in size because they can have different numbers of bytes being carried as data, this means the overhead of an HDLC connection is not fixed.|$|R

5|$|The Vinson-Trammell Act of 1934 set up {{a regular}} program of ship {{building}} and modernization to bring the Navy to the <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> allowed by treaty. The Navy's preparation was helped along by another Navy assistant secretary turned president, Franklin D. Roosevelt. The naval limitation treaties also applied to bases, but Congress only approved building seaplane bases on Wake Island, Midway Island and Dutch Harbor and rejected any additional funds for bases on Guam and the Philippines. Navy ships were designed with greater endurance and range which allowed them to operate further from bases and between refits.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 {{histological}} {{study of}} growth lines {{found that the}} Portuguese Baryonyx specimen had died between the age of 23 and 25 years old, and was close to its <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> and skeletal maturity. This contradicted a younger age indicated by the neurocentral sutures not being fused, {{and the presence of}} both mature and sub-adult traits may be due to paedomorphosis (where juvenile traits are retained into adulthood). Paedomorphic traits may be related to swimming locomotion, as they have been suggested in other extinct animals thought to have been aquatic (such as plesiosaurs and temnospondyls). The study also found that the animal had reached sexual maturity at the age of 13 to 15 years, due to a decrease in growth rate at this point.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} {{a brief period}} of rapid intensification from 18:00UTC on October29 – 06:00UTC on October30, the hurricane reached its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115mph (185km/h) and a minimum pressure of 962mbar (hPa; 28.42inHg). The storm also began to turn towards the south-southwest as it reached its peak intensity and its <b>maximum</b> <b>size,</b> with tropical storm-force winds extending out 60mi (95km) from the center. However, as it neared the coast, cloud tops around the eye began to warm, signifying weakening. Around 12:00UTC on October30, Beta made landfall in central Nicaragua near La Barra del Rio Grande with winds of 105mph (165km/h). After making landfall, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 65mph (100km/h), as the structure of the storm began to deteriorate. Early on October31, Beta weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated a few hours later over the mountains of central Nicaragua.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E
5|$|Leguat {{stated that}} the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} fed on dates, whereas Tafforet mentioned seeds and leaves. No other accounts mention diet. It has been suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises. It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. The risings on the crop of the female may have covered glands that produced the crop milk. If the theory is correct, the birds may have practiced a division of labour, where the female stayed and fed the young crop milk, while the male collected food in the crop and delivered it to the female. It {{has been suggested that}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>size</b> attained by the solitaire and the dodo was limited by the amount of crop milk they were able to produce for their young during early growth.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{experienced}} {{its second}} major peak in occupation during the Late Classic period, between AD 600 and AD 830. Most {{of the major}} architecture at the site was built during this surge in activity and the city reached its <b>maximum</b> <b>size.</b> Motul de San José {{became one of the}} three most important cities around Lake Petén Itzá and was approximately the same size as Tayasal, while it was slightly smaller than Nixtun Ch'ich'. There was renewed growth in the city's satellite sites, Chakokot reached its peak population and most of its residential complexes were built in the Late Classic. Buena Vista experienced only light occupation at this time. Major construction work took place at Akte including the building of the principal platform and its causeway. It also appears that the rulers of Akte erected several stelae. La Trinidad de Nosotros took on its final form and most of its major architecture was built at this time including the Mesoamerican ballcourt, the major residential complexes, four plazas and the port facilities.|$|E
