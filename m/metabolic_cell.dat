30|$|Further, we {{have also}} {{demonstrated}} that the slope of decoloration of methylene blue {{can be used to}} monitor fermentations online. Since the slope obtained from MBRT is indicative of the total <b>metabolic</b> active <b>cell,</b> a standard profile for normal operation can be established. During operation deviations from the normal profile may indicate contamination or abnormal behavior. Since the <b>metabolic</b> active <b>cell</b> count increased in case of contamination, the MBRT slope would be higher than the MBRT slope for normal operation. If the MBRT slope obtained during monitoring is less than that of the normal profile, abnormalities such as failure in temperature or pH control, oxygen limitation or inhibitors in the medium, may be the cause for decrease in <b>metabolic</b> active <b>cell.</b> Thus, MBRT can be used for fault diagnosis through online measurement of slope of MB decoloration.|$|R

Recently, potential similarities between IL- 1 beta and ceramide on {{their effects on}} islet beta cell have been reported, including reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and loss in <b>metabolic</b> <b>cell</b> viability. Objective Herein, we investigated whether IL- 1 beta-induced nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) expression, nitric oxide (NO) release and loss in <b>metabolic</b> <b>cell</b> viability require ceramide biosynthesis either via the activation of sphingomyelinase or ceramide synthase.

Results We found that two structurally-distinct inhibitors of sphingomyelinase activation (e. g., 3 -O-methylsphingomyelin or desipramine) or ceramide biosynthesis inhib-itor (e. g., fumonisin) failed to exert clear effects on IL- 1 beta-induced iNOS expression, NO release and loss in cell viability. Conclusions Taken together, our findings indicate that neither the sphingomyelinase nor the ceramide synthase activation is required for IL- 1 beta-induced metabolic abnormalities in insulin-secreting INS 832 / 13 cells...|$|E

40|$|The human gut {{contains}} {{trillions of}} commensal bacteria, and similar to pathogenic bacteria, the gut microbes and their products can {{be recognized by}} toll-like receptors (TLRs). It is well acknowledged that the interaction between gut microbiota and the local TLRs help to maintain the homeostasis of intestinal immunity. High-fat intake or obesity can weaken gut integrity leading to the penetration of gut microbiota or their bacterial products into the circulation, leading to the activation of TLRs on immune cells and subsequently low-grade systemic inflammation in host. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>cells</b> including hepatocytes and adipocytes also express TLRs. Although {{they are able to}} produce and secrete inflammatory molecules, the effectiveness remains low compared with the immune cells embedded in liver and adipose tissue. The interaction of TLRs in these <b>metabolic</b> <b>cells</b> or organs with gut microbiota remains unclear, but a few studies have suggested that the functions of these TLRs are related to metabolism. Alteration of the gut microbiota is associated with body weight change and adiposity in human, and the interaction between the commensal gut microbiota and TLRs may possibly involve both metabolic and immunological regulation.

40|$|Background/Aims: Lamins are {{intermediate}} filament {{proteins that}} constitute {{the main components of}} the lamina underlying the inner-nuclear membrane and serve to organize chromatin. Lamins (e. g., lamin B) undergo posttranslational modifications (e. g., isoprenylation) at their C-terminal cysteine residues. Such modifications are thought to render optimal association of lamins with the nuclear envelop. Using human islets, rodent islets, and INS- 1 832 / 13 cells, we recently reported significant metabolic defects under glucotoxic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions, including caspase 3 activation and lamin B degradation. The current study is aimed at further understanding the regulatory roles of protein prenylation in the induction of the aforestated metabolic defects. Methods: Subcellular phase partitioning assay was done using Triton X- 114. Cell morphology and <b>metabolic</b> <b>cell</b> viability assays were carried out using standard methodologies. Results: We report that exposure of pancreatic β-cells to Simvastatin, an inhibitor of mevalonic acid (MVA) biosynthesis, and its downstream isoprenoid derivatives, or FTI- 277, an inhibitor of farnesyltransferase that mediates farnesylation of lamins, leads to activation of caspase 3 and lamin B degradation. Furthermore, Simvastatin-treatment increased activation of p 38 MAPK (a stress kinase) and inhibited ERK 1 / 2 (regulator of cell proliferation). Inhibition of farnesylation also resulted in the release of degraded lamin B into the cytosolic fraction and promoted loss in <b>metabolic</b> <b>cell</b> viability. Conclusion: Based on these findings we conclude that protein prenylation plays key roles in islet β-cell function. These findings affirm further support to the hypothesis that defects in prenylation pathway induce caspase- 3 activation and nuclear lamin degradation in pancreatic β-cells under the duress of metabolic stress (e. g., glucotoxicity) ...|$|E

30|$|Thus, {{there is}} a need for fast and {{accurate}} method to enumerate <b>metabolic</b> active <b>cell</b> count of organisms present in a mixed culture. <b>Metabolic</b> active <b>cell</b> of pure culture is typically quantified using plate count assay such as streak and spread plate methods. However, these methods are time consuming although they are cheap and easy to perform. Enzyme activity specific to an organism has also been used to quantify <b>metabolic</b> active <b>cell</b> (Walley and Germida [1995], Callaway et al. [2006]). Imaging is another common technique that is used to evaluate <b>metabolic</b> active <b>cell.</b> This is achieved by staining the cells using acridine orange, propidium iodide or rhodamine (Wright et al. [1993], Miller et al. [1993]). Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) is a microscopic technique to determine <b>metabolic</b> active <b>cell</b> and is an accurate method (Schmidt et al. [2007]). However, the method is expensive and requires operation and availability of the confocal microscope. For metabolic active count of cells in liquid medium, epifluorescence microscopy has been used in the past (Vaija et al. [1993]). Flow cytometry is also a technique that yields accurate cell counts (Davey and Kell [1996], Deere et al. [1998]). The above methods are instrument dependent and expensive. The methods involving dyes are error prone as it is difficult to differentiate live from dead cells (Schmidt et al. [2007]). Recently, our group has developed a protocol for fast estimation of cell count using the Methylene Blue Dye Reduction Test (MBRT) (Bapat et al. [2006]). Methylene blue, a dye, is reduced by transmembrane reductases present on the cell membrane, which reduces methylene blue (MB) and thus the blue color disappears. The rate of disappearance of the color is correlated to the cell count of any aerobic organisms. This method can be used to obtain colony forming units in about 3  minutes (Bapat et al. [2006]).|$|R

METHODS: Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilization (DIS) utilizes a dynamic screw system to keep ACL remnants in place and promote biological healing, supplemented by collagen patches. How these scaffolds interact with cells and what type of benefit they provide {{has not yet been}} investigated in detail. Primary ACL-derived TCs and human bone marrow derived MSCs were seeded onto two different types of 3 D collagen scaffolds, Chondro-Gide® (CG) and Novocart® (NC). Cells were seeded onto the scaffolds and cultured for 7 days either as a pure populations or as “premix” containing a 1 : 1 ratio of TCs to MSCs. Additionally, as controls, cells were seeded in monolayers and in co-cultures on both sides of porous high-density membrane inserts (0. 4 µm). We analyzed the patches by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), glycosaminoglycan (GAG), DNA and hydroxy-proline (HYP) content, was determined. To determine cell spreading and adherence in the scaffolds microscopic imaging techniques, i. e. confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were applied. RESULTS: CLSM and SEM imaging analysis confirmed cell adherence onto scaffolds. The <b>metabolic</b> <b>cell</b> activity revealed that patches promote adherence and proliferation of cells. The most dramatic increase in absolute <b>metabolic</b> <b>cell</b> activity was measured for CG samples seeded with tenocytes or a 1 : 1 cell premix. Analysis of DNA content and cLSM imaging also indicated MSCs were not proliferating as nicely as tenocytes on CG. The HYP to GAG ratio significantly changed for the premix group, resulting from a slightly lower GAG content, demonstrating that the cells are modifying the underlying matrix. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction data indicated that MSCs showed a trend of differentiation towards a more tenogenic-like phenotype after 7 days. CONCLUSION: CG and NC are both cyto-compatible with primary MSCs and TCs; TCs seemed to perform better on these collagen patches than MSCs...|$|E

In spite of the pro-inflammatory nature of TLR 5, deficiency of TLR 5 exacerbated metabolic dysfunction in diet-induced obese mouse model (Gewirtz et al. Science, 328 : 228 - 231, 2010). In this study, we found that TLR 5 was expressed in both preadipocytes and adipocytes, and tried to characterize the functions of TLR 5 in these <b>metabolic</b> <b>cells</b> Six week old wild type (WT) and TLR 5 -knockout (T 5 KO) mice were fed a high fat diet for five weeks, andthey both showed a similar body weight gain and daily food intake, but NMR spectroscopy revealed a decreased whole-body fat mass in T 5 KO mice. Particularly, gonadal adipose tissues in T 5 KO mice were significantly smaller compared with those in WT, whereas the adipose inflammatory status was unaltered. The in vitro experiments showed that TLR 5 -deficient stromal vascular cells isolated from visceral fat depots had reduced adipogenic capacity. In addition, elevated triglyceride accumulation was observed in livers from T 5 KO mice. iIt is possible that TLR 5 pathway participates in adipogenesis to mediate adipose tissue expansion and prevents ectopic storage of lipids in liver after high fat diet feeding.

In vitro {{study to}} develop an {{intervertebral}} disc degeneration (IDD) organ culture model, using coccygeal bovine intervertebral discs (IVDs) and injection of proteolytic enzymes MMP- 3, ADAMTS- 4 and HTRA 1. Objective. This study aimed {{to develop an}} in-vitro model of enzyme-mediated IDD to mimic the clinical outcome in humans for investigation of therapeutic treatment options. Summary of Background Data. Bovine IVDs are comparable to human IVDs in terms of cell composition and biomechanical behavior. Researchers injected papain and trypsin into them to create an IDD model with a degenerated nucleus pulposus (NP) area. They achieved macroscopic cavities {{as well as a}} loss of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). However, none of these enzymes are clinically relevant. Methods. Bovine IVDs were harvested maintaining the endplates. Active forms of MMP- 3, ADAMTS- 4 and HTRA 1 were injected at a dose of 10 μg/ml each. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was injected as a control. Discs were cultured for 8 days and loaded diurnally (day 1 to day 4 with 0. 4 MPa for 16 h) and left under free swelling condition from day 4 to day 8 to avoid expected artifacts due to dehydration of the NP. Outcome parameters included disc height, <b>metabolic</b> <b>cell</b> activity, DNA content, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, total collagen content, relative gene expression and histological investigation. Results. The mean <b>metabolic</b> <b>cell</b> activity was significantly lower in the NP area of discs injected with ADAMTS- 4 compared to the day 0 control discs. Disc height was decreased following injection with HTRA 1, and was significantly correlated with changes in GAG/DNA of the NP tissue. Total collagen content tended to be lower in groups injected with ADAMTS 4 and MMP- 3. Conclusion. MMP- 3, ADAMTS- 4 and HTRA 1 neither provoked visible matrix degradation nor major shifts in gene expression. However, cell activity was significantly reduced and HTRA 1 induced loss of disc height which positively correlated with changes in GAG/DNA content.
