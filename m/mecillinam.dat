40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{activity}} of <b>mecillinam</b> against two groups of Escherichia coli: (i) a selection of international isolates with mechanisms of resistance caused {{by the presence of}} defined b-lactamases; and (ii) isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins referred from across Wales. Methods: Antibiotic susceptibility testing with <b>mecillinam,</b> meropenem, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefotaxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim and gentamicin was performed using the BSAC agar dilution method against 30 international strains of E. coli with known b-lactamase presence. Antibiotic susceptibility testing with <b>mecillinam</b> using the same method was performed against 325 regional isolates of E. coli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. Results: The susceptibility results showed that the only antibiotics to which the 30 international isolates were consistently susceptible were <b>mecillinam</b> (100 %) and meropenem (100 %), irrespective of the pres-ence of b-lactamases. Of the local isolates, 93. 5 % (304 / 325) were susceptible to <b>mecillinam,</b> having MICs< 8 mg/L. Conclusions: Our results show that <b>mecillinam</b> has excellent in vitro activity against a range of E. coli exhibiting b-lactamase activity, some with the production of multiple b-lactamases.

40|$|<b>Mecillinam,</b> a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic which specifically inactivates penicillin binding protein 2 (PBP 2) in Escherichia coli, prevents lateral {{cell wall}} elongation, inducing spherical morphology and cell death. Two <b>mecillinam</b> resistant mutants, lov- 1 and lovB, both able to dispense entirely with PBP 2, are shown {{here to be}} affected in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes argS and alaS, respectively. Although the argS and alaS mutants grow slowly, we {{show that there is}} no correlation between <b>mecillinam</b> resistance and either growth rate or translation speed. A role of the ribosomes in <b>mecillinam</b> sensitivity, suggested by our earlier report that the lov- 1 mutation is suppressed by certain rpsL(StrR) alleles affecting ribosomal protein S 12, is supported by the present observation that a pseudo-streptomycin dependent mutant is <b>mecillinam</b> resistant in the presence of streptomycin. The argS and alaS mutants have high pools of the nucleotide ppGpp (effector of the stringent response) and the <b>mecillinam</b> resistance of both mutations is suppressed by a relA mutation, inactivating the ribosome-associated ppGpp synthetase and preventing ppGpp synthesis in response to aminoacyl-tRNA starvation. Furthermore, a ptacrelA' multicopy plasmid makes a wild type strain <b>mecillinam</b> resistant. The effect of ppGpp is probably mediated by RNA polymerase, since sublethal doses of the polymerase inhibitor rifampicin suppress <b>mecillinam</b> resistance in argS, alaS and ptacrelA'-bearing strains. We conclude that ppGpp regulates the transcription of a gene whose product is involved in <b>mecillinam</b> sensitivity, possibly as part of a chain of interacting elements which coordinate ribosomal activity with that of the PBPs...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mecillinam</b> (amdinocillin) is a β-lactam {{antibiotic}} used {{to treat}} uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). We have previously shown that inactivation of the Escherichia coli cysB gene is the major cause of <b>mecillinam</b> resistance (Mec(R)) in clinical isolates. In this study, we used different E. coli strains (laboratory and clinical isolates) that were Mec(R) due to cysB mutations to determine how <b>mecillinam</b> susceptibility was affected during growth in urine compared to growth in the commonly used growth medium Mueller Hinton (MHB). We also examined <b>mecillinam</b> susceptibility when bacteria were grown in urine obtained from 48 different healthy volunteers. Metabolome analysis was done on the urine samples and the association between the <b>mecillinam</b> susceptibility patterns of the bacteria and urine metabolite levels was studied. Two major findings with clinical significance are reported. First, Mec(R) E. coli cysB mutant strains (both laboratory and clinical isolates) were always more susceptible to <b>mecillinam</b> when grown in urine as compared to laboratory medium, with many strains showing complete phenotypic susceptibility in urine. Second, the degree of reversion to susceptibility varied between urine samples obtained from different individuals. This difference was correlated with osmolality such that in urine with low osmolality the Mec(R) mutants were more susceptible to <b>mecillinam</b> than in urine with high osmolality. This is the first example describing conditional resistance where a genetically stable antibiotic resistance can be phenotypically reverted to susceptibility by metabolites present in urine. These findings have several important clinical implications {{regarding the use of}} <b>mecillinam</b> to treat UTIs. First, they suggest that <b>mecillinam</b> can be {{used to treat}} also those clinical strains that are identified as Mec(R) in standard laboratory tests. Second, the results suggest that testing of <b>mecillinam</b> susceptibility in the laboratory ought to be performed in media that mimics urine to obtain clinically relevant susceptibility testing results. Third, these findings imply that changes in patient behavior, such as increased water intake or use of diuretics to reduce urine osmolality and increased intake of cysteine, might induce antibiotic susceptibility in an infecting Mec(R) E. coli strain and thereby increase treatment efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Out of 15 {{selected}} enterobacterial strains {{resistant to}} ampicillin, 12 {{were able to}} transfer resistance to <b>mecillinam</b> to Escherichia coli K- 12.

40|$|<b>Mecillinam,</b> a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic {{specific to}} penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP 2) in Escherichia coli, blocks cell wall elongation and, indirectly, cell division, but its lethality {{can be overcome}} by increased levels of ppGpp, the nucleotide effector of the stringent response. We have subjected an E. coli K- 12 strain to random insertional mutagenesis with a mini-Tn 10 element. One insertion, which was found to confer resistance to <b>mecillinam</b> in relA+ and relA strains, was mapped at 75. 5 min on the E. coli map and was located between the promoters and the coding sequence of the aroK gene, which codes for shikimate kinase 1, one of two E. coli shikimate kinases, {{both of which are}} involved in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The <b>mecillinam</b> resistance conferred by the insertion was abolished in a delta relA delta spoT strain completely lacking ppGpp, and it thus depends on the presence of ppGpp. Furthermore, the insertion increased the ppGpp pool approximately twofold in a relA+ strain. However, this increase was not observed in relA strains, although the insertion still conferred <b>mecillinam</b> resistance in these backgrounds, showing that <b>mecillinam</b> resistance is not due to an increased ppGpp pool. The resistance was also abolished in an ftsZ 84 (Ts) strain under semipermissive conditions, and the aroK::mini-Tn 10 allele partially suppressed ftsZ 84 (Ts); however, it did not increase the concentration of the FtsZ cell division protein. The insertion greatly decreased or abolished the shikimate kinase activity of AroK in vivo and in vitro. The two shikimate kinases of E. coli are not equivalent; the loss of AroK confers <b>mecillinam</b> resistance, whereas the loss of Arol, does not. Furthermore, the ability of the aroK mutation to confer <b>mecillinam</b> resistance is shown to be independent of polar effects on operon expression and of effects on the availability of aromatic amino acids or shikimic acid.

Agreement between methods was reached for 175 of 179 strains when disregarding the results of the nitrocefin tests, 88 isolates being found susceptible and 87 being found to be β-lactamase producers. All 88 susceptible isolates had <b>mecillinam</b> zones of > 22 mm, with the great majority being > 25 mm; double zones did, however, occur. The 87 β-lactamase producers had zones < 14 mm or no zones. Four isolates presenting problems in had <b>mecillinam</b> zones of ≤ 20 mm and were without tapering growth at the penicillin inhibition zone edge. In conclusion, the size of the <b>mecillinam</b> inhibition zone is found to be a useful supplementary test in the clinically important distinction between β-lactamase-producing and non-producing isolates of S. aureus...|$|E
