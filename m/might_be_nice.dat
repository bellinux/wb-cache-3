500|$|Of his {{approach}} to directing the film, Lane explains, [...] "Thunderbirds Are Go was done like an episode but on a bigger scale. Whereas we would think that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> to do a particular shot on the series but couldn't afford to, with Thunderbirds Are Go we just did it because we had the money." [...] For the Swinging Star hall sequence, all the visual elements except Alan and Lady Penelope are displayed in black and white, with background characters appearing {{in the form of}} enlarged still photographs. On the surrealism of the Swinging Star scenes, aspects of which include pink space clouds made of dry ice and a giant guitar on which Cliff Richard and The Shadows perform part of [...] "Shooting Star", Anderson explains that the production team [...] "recreated a Busby Berkeley sequence", and that the appearance of puppet versions of real-life celebrities boosted the publicity value of the film.|$|E
500|$|... "Questions for the Angels" [...] {{includes}} {{a reference to}} American rapper Jay-Z, which {{was inspired by a}} billboard featuring him that was present over the Brooklyn Bridge for a time. Simon mentioned that he would pass it {{on his way to the}} Brooklyn Academy of Music when they were holding a month-long celebration of his music in April 2008. Simon included the line to create a sharp transition from angels in Heaven to a downtown Brooklyn street. [...] "So Beautiful or So What" [...] contains what Simon once admitted is [...] "one of [...] favorite Bo Diddley rhythms," [...] and the song’s title references Miles Davis's [...] "So What". The title is a question Simon envisioned when facing the enormity of the infinite. The song almost became a collaboration with Bob Dylan; Simon felt two verses <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> for him and sent him a message through their mutual manager. Although Dylan said that he liked the song, Simon did not hear back in sufficient time, as the album was on a deadline.|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in my memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie." ...|$|E

On the Lie algebra side of affairs, things are simpler since the qualifying criteria for the prefix Lie in Lie algebra are purely algebraic. For example, an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra {{may or may not}} have a corresponding Lie group. That is, there may be a group corresponding to the Lie algebra, but it <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> enough to <b>be</b> called a Lie group, or the connection between the group and the Lie algebra <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> enough (for example, failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity).

500|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{a largely}} positive reception from critics. Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "Powerfully depicts both Mulder's gnawing sense of defeat and his bond with Scully, strangely growing stronger with separation" [...] before concluding that the episode was [...] "fairly standard." [...] The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo, Where Are You? writing that, [...] "I {{used to be a}} huge [...] "Scooby Doo" [...] fan. [...] Of course, none of [...] were really monsters. [...] The X-Files exploited a simple truth: we all want to believe. We might be afraid of what's lurking in the dark, but isn't there always a bit of wishing inside that fear? A hope that what we think we know isn't everything there is to know. That just once it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales." [...] Handlen ultimately called the episode [...] "Essential." [...] Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that [...] "The X-Files is off to a stonking good start with this season 2 opening." [...] Bob Curtright, writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, called the episode [...] "an engrossing chiller about potential contact from outer space." [...] He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was [...] "both scary and wondrous" [...] and [...] "offer no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, writing that the episode was not [...] "what the fans were expecting, and its reputation isn't great. But I think this clever and claustrophobic little take, which does so much not only to refresh the show but to analyze what it's actually about, is one of the very best." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{stood out}} against those two men {{for about a}} half an hour, and then I began to give in a little, and think that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> to roll along on my own little wheels over their {{beautiful}} smooth roads, and stop and smell the hedges and pick flowers whenever I felt like it; and so it ended in my agreeing to do the Exmoor country on a tricycle while Mr. Poplington and Jone went on bicycles. As to getting the machines, Mr. Poplington said he would attend to that. There was people in London who hired them to excursionists, and {{all he had to}} do was to send an order and they would be on hand in a day or two; and so that matter was settled and he wrote to London. I thought Mr. Poplington was a little old for that sort of exercise, but I found he had been used to doing a great deal of cycling in the part of the country where he lives; and besides, he isn't as old as I thought he was, being not much over fifty. The kind of air that keeps a country always green is wonderful in bringing out early red and white in a person.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were many}} {{candidates}} for Glenbogie on this occasion. Among others there was Mr. Frank Houston, whose candidature was not pressed by himself,--as could not {{well have been}} done,--but was enforced by Gertrude on his behalf. It was now July. Gertrude and Mr. Houston had seen something {{of each other in}} Rome, as may be remembered, and since then had seen a good deal of each other in town. Gertrude was perfectly well aware that Mr. Houston was impecunious; but Augusta had been allowed to have an impecunious lover, and Tom to throw himself at the feet of an impecunious love. Gertrude felt herself to be entitled to her £120,000; did not for a moment doubt but that she would get it. Why shouldn't she give it to any young man she liked as long as he belonged to decent people? Mr. Houston wasn't a Member of Parliament,--but then he was young and good-looking. Mr. Houston wasn't son to a lord, but he was brother to a county squire, and came of a family much older than that of those stupid Boardotrade and Traffick people. And then Frank Houston was very presentable, was not at all bald, and was just the man for a girl to like as a husband. It was dinned into her ears that Houston had no income at all,--just a few hundreds a year on which he never could keep himself out of debt. But he was a generous man, who would be more than contented with the income coming from £120,000. He would not spunge upon the house at Queen's Gate. He would not make use of Merle Park and Glenbogie. He would have a house of his own for his old boots. Four-per-cent. would give them nearly £5,000 a year. Gertrude knew all about it already. They could have a nice house near Queen's Gate;--say somewhere about Onslow Gardens. There would be quite enough for a carriage for three months upon a mountain in Switzerland, and three more among the art treasures of Italy. It was astonishing how completely Gertrude had it all at her finger's ends when she discussed the matter with her mother. Mr. Houston was a man of no expensive tastes. He didn't want to hunt. He did shoot, no doubt, and perhaps a little shooting at Glenbogie <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> before they went to Switzerland. In that case two months {{on the top of the}} mountain would suffice. But if he was not asked he would never condescend to demand an entry at Glenbogie as a part of his wife's dower. Lady Tringle was thus talked over, though she did think that at least one of her daughters' husbands ought to have an income of his own. There was another point which Gertrude put forward very frankly, and which no doubt had weight with her mother. [...] "Mamma, I mean to have him," [...] she said, when Lady Tringle expressed a doubt.|$|E

40|$|I shall try to {{convince}} the audience not to be shy with functional equation approaches in enumerative combinatorics. They not only solve (some) problems, but they often teach us a lot too. The proofs they provide for a specific problem <b>might</b> <b>be</b> less <b>nice</b> than more combinatorial proofs. But functional equation approaches sometimes give a unified description of apparently distinct problems, and the efforts we make to solve one specific functional equation often teach {{us what to do}} in a more generic case.

60|$|Time went by. The prince {{ruled the}} country and never even thought of marrying.
