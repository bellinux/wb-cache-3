40|$|Recent {{academic}} and commercial efforts in digital libraries {{have demonstrated the}} significant potential for largescale, on-line search and retrieval of cataloged multimedia content. By improving access to scientific, educational, and historical documents and information, digital libraries create powerful opportunities for revamping education, accelerating scientific discovery and technical advancement, and improving knowledge. Furthermore, digital <b>multimedia</b> <b>libraries</b> go well beyond traditional libraries in storing and indexing diverse and complex types of material consisting of images, video, graphics, audio and multimedia. In this paper, we examine several challenges addressed by MPEG- 7 for enabling network-based digital <b>multimedia</b> <b>libraries</b> to interoperate with diverse networked multimedia systems and allow universal access to widely distributed multimedia content. MPEG- 7 provides a framework for self-describing digital multimedia that uses a common vocabulary to describe the features, semantics, structure and models of audio-visual content. We describe how MPEG- 7 {{can be used to}} enable interoperable content-based searching, indexing, filtering and browsing of <b>multimedia</b> in digital <b>libraries.</b> We also examine the MPEG- 7 application of Universal Multimedia Access, which involves the scalable or adaptive delivery of multimedia content to patrons of digital libraries regardless of capabilities of terminal device, conditions of communication bandwidth, or client support for media formats and modalities.

40|$|Nowadays, an {{increasingly}} {{growing demand for}} the creation of digital <b>multimedia</b> <b>libraries</b> is arising, as huge amounts of digital visual content are becoming available. The content that resides in these libraries should be easily retrievable and classified in order to be fully accessible. The contribution of this paper is the introduction of a hybrid multimedia retrieval model accompanied by the presentation of a search engine that is capable of retrieving visual content cultural heritage <b>multimedia</b> <b>libraries</b> as in three modes: (i) based on their semantic annotation {{with the help of an}} ontology; (ii) based on the visual features with a view to finding similar content; and (iii) based on the combination of these two strategies. To achieve this, the retrieval model is composed of two different parts, a low-level visual feature analysis and retrieval and a high-level ontology infrastructure. The main novelty is the way in which these two co-operate transparently during the evaluation of a single query in a hybrid fashion, making recommendations to the user and retrieving content that is both visually and semantically similar. 1...|$|R
