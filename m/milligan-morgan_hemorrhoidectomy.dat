40|$|Introduction: Surgery is {{the only}} {{curative}} method of hemorrhoidal disease. Currently the <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> is still considered the “gold standard”, {{since it is the}} best performing technique. However, postoperative pain remains a major problem. We analize the postoperative analgesic requirements for this procedure in 117 patients. Presentation of cases: Between 2012 and 2013, 117 consecutive patients undergoing Milligan-Morgan hemorroidectomy, with an analysis of sex, age, total vascular anal cushions removed, hospital stay, complications, and relation with postoperative analgesic requirements. Patients with documented allergy to NSAIDs or pyrazolones were excluded. Additionally 23 patients undergoing <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> associated to internal lateral sphincterotomy were also analyzed. Results: The mean age of patients was 51. 7 years. The 50. 8 % were women and 49. 2 % men. In 33. 3 % of cases, one vascular anal cushion was removed, 2 in 39. 3 %, and 3 in 27. 4 %. The average stay for the 3 groups was 2. 0  days. An analgesic dose average of 4. 1 by day was given, with opioid requirements in 22. 2 % of cases. It was statistically significant that as more anal cushions were eliminated was higher the opioids need. No significant difference of opioids use was found regarding patients undergoing sphincterotomy as additional procedure. Discussion: Postoperative pain after a <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> currently remains a problem for colorectal surgery teams. This involves the use of opioids comparable to other major surgeries, finally causing not negligible days of admission charge. A protocolized analgesic treatment, as we actually do in our center, should be implemented after a <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> for improving the postoperative period pain management...|$|E
40|$|<b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> (MMH) {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} as the main surgi-cal treatment of hemorrhoids for a long history, but it is notorious for the level of post operative pain the patient must endure, coupled with a long recupera-tion period. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy was pre-sented as a procedure for prolapsed hemorrhoids (PPH) in 1998 by Longo. 1 From the view points of lesser post operative pain and short recuperation pe-riod after PPH, it was later adapted for grade III and grade IV hemorrhoids gradually. However, PPH had several drawbacks and long-term sequelae after it remained unknown. 2, 3 Therefore, the <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> (MMH) {{is still the most}} popular method for hemorrhoids. 4 This study com-pared the short- and long-term outcomes of PPH and MMH.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} randomized {{study is}} to describe the effects of laxative plantago ovata after open <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> (<b>Milligan-Morgan).</b> Sixty patients divided into 2 equal groups were included in this study. The first group was treated postoperatively with 2 sachets of bulk agent Laxomucil (3, 26 g plantago ovata), twice daily, {{for a period of}} twenty days, while the control group was treated with glycerin oil. The p. ovata group patients had a statistically significant shorter postoperative length of hospital stay (2, 9 v. s. 4, 1 days). Pain after stool was statistically significant more tolerable in the p. ovata group. In conclusion, the application of bulk agent plantago ovata after hemorrhoidectomy shortens the mean postoperative hospital stay, expedites digestive function recovery and lessens the pain after stool...|$|R
40|$|Hemorrhoids are {{a common}} anal {{disorder}} which affects {{both men and women}} of all ages. One out of ten patients with hemorrhoidal disease, requires surgical treatment. Unfortunately though, hemorrhoidectomy is closely related to complications that can be present early or late postoperatively. In the present manuscript, the safe surgical technique which emphasizes to the identification of the key anatomical structure of the ligament of Parks (Trietz's muscle) is adequately described. A total of 200 patients with grades III and IV hemorrhoids, underwent <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> or Ferguson's <b>hemorrhoidectomy.</b> The mucosal ligament of Parks was identified to all patients and was used as a key anatomical structure through the excision of the hemorrhoids. Its identification guides surgeons during the operation and reduces the major problem of postoperative complications. Finally, since the mucosal ligament of Parks represents a constantly identifiable landmark, it allows simple and reliable identification of the internal sphincter muscle and minimizes the probability of postoperative complications...|$|R
40|$|Hemorrhoidectomy is the {{treatment}} of choice for patients with third or fourth-degree hemorrhoids. Although the majority of surgeons believe that surgical hemorrhoidectomy {{is the most effective}} approach with excellent results in the management of hemorrhoid disease, but hemorrhoidectomy is not a simple procedure. One of the complications of this surgery is an injury to anal sphincters that can lead to incontinency in some patients. In this study, we aimed to reveal the percentage of external and internal anal sphincter injuries in surgical hemorrhoidectomy. We prospectively enrolled 128 patients from April 2006 to February 2007. They underwent hemorrhoidectomy in three general hospitals in Tehran. All patients were in grade III or IV and underwent open <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> (<b>Milligan-Morgan).</b> After surgery, all resected material was histopathologically examined by two expert pathologists and the results confirmed by other one if there is any discrepancy. From all specimens which sent to the pathology department 15. 8 % (21 Pts.) had muscle fibers that Smooth muscle fibers were seen in 80. 5 % (17 Pts.) of them and striated muscle fibers were found in 19. 5 % (4 Pts.). Although hemorrhoidectomy is a safe and effective method for treatment of hemorrhoid, but the inadvertent removal of smooth and striated muscle during open hemorrhoidectomy had raised concerns about its effects on postoperative anorectal function...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, several new {{surgical}} tools have revived {{the hope for}} an improved technique to treat radically hemorrhoids with less postoperative pain. Among these radiofrequency (RF), excisional surgery seems to be safe, fast, and accompanied by less postoperative pain. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate and compare RF (ligasure TM) to conventional diathermy <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> (MMH) ...|$|E
40|$|Background. Postoperative pain {{has always}} been the main adverse effect of {{surgical}} treatment for hemorrhoids. Therefore, surgical techniques evolved mainly to solve this problem and, secondly, postoperative bleeding, recurrences and stenosis. Methods. Two homogeneous groups of 20 patients each were investigated. Both of them were affected by fourth grade hemorrhoidal prolapse and were homogeneous for age, sex and presentation symptoms. Patients previously treated for other proctologic diseases were excluded. A group was treated with standard <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> and the other with radiofrequency scissors. Every patient underwent a follow-up protocol based on outpatient visits at 15, 30, 45 postoperative days and 3, 6 and 12 months. Results. The results show a substantial similarity between these techniques. However, radiofrequency scissors further improved the simplicity of the technique and the postoperative adverse effects. In particular, the procedure lasted 7 minutes less with radiofrequency scissors. Patients treated with the radiofrequency technique had their first postoperative evacuation 24 hours before the standard technique and reduced the mean postoperative hospital stay at 2. 5 days (4. 5 days in the standard group). The incidence of postoperative pain was reduced in patients treated with radiofrequency scalpel and the follow-up controls in both groups didn't show any complication as stenosis or incontinence. Conclusions. The radiofrequency-performed <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> is a valuable technique that improves the classical difficulties in execution, reducing the length of hospital stay and the incidence of postoperative pain or other complications...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Data on maximum resting {{pressure}} (MRP) {{and maximum}} squeeze pressure (MSP) changes after hemorrhoidectomy are not univocal and follow-up of patients undergoing surgery is mostly short-lived. The {{aim of this}} study was to prospectively examine during 1 -year follow-up the long-term manometric results of MRP, MSP, and ultra slow wave activity (USWA) within a set of patients undergoing <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> as compared to healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with hemorrhoids of third and fourth degree were enrolled and anorectal manometry was performed preoperatively, on the 5 th day, and after 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: On the 5 th and 30 th day after hemorrhoidectomy, USWA was slightly increased as compared to preoperative status. Six and 12 months after surgery, patients with USWA were significantly less in comparison to preoperative assessment without differences with healthy subjects. After surgery, MSP values were not significantly different to baseline values. On the 5 th postoperative day after hemorrhoidectomy, MRP was significantly greater than baseline preoperative values. Thirty days after surgery, MRP values were similar to those detected preoperatively, but still significantly increased as compared to healthy subjects. After 6 and 12 months, MRP values were significantly lower than those detected during preoperative phase and comparable to healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> induces a complete resolution of typical manometric alterations of disease and that the excision of anal cushions is responsible only for mild and transient alteration of anal continence...|$|E
40|$|Recently the {{surgical}} treatment of hemorrhoids using a circular stapler device has gained increasing approval. The Longo's procedure reduces the rectal mucosal and hemorrhoid prolapse using a circular stapler to resect transversally a mucosal-submucosal rectal ring {{in order to}} restore the correct anatomical relationships of the anal canal structures. The recent availability of a dedicated instrument kit (PPH 01 Ethicon Endo-Surgery) allowed an easy diffusion of this technique. From March 1999 to September 2001, 198 patients with III-IV degree hemorrhoids were treated by a single expert surgeon using the dedicated kit instrumentation (PPH 01) according to the Longo's technique, adopting some variations from the original procedure: 1) The anal dilator is not fixed to the perianal skin with forceps or stitches but is kept by the assistant. 2) In performing the purse-string suture particular care {{must be given to}} the apposition of the stitches at the same level also in the posterolateral side where there is a natural trend to apply the stitches at a lower level; furthermore the last stitch of the purse-string suture must be overlapped to the first one in order to allow a better hemostasis when the knot is tightened. 3) After having performed the purse-string and having resected the mucosa and submucosa, an accurate hemostasis with U-shaped 3 / 0 vicryl stitches firmly reduces the postoperative bleeding. We recorded pain scores, short- and long-term complications (included moderate-severe pain, persistent pain), recurrences and postoperative hospital stay. The data of the last 40 consecutive patients who underwent stapled hemorrhoidectomy were compared with the data obtained by 40 consecutive patients who underwent <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> diathermic <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> for III-IV degree non-circumferential hemorrhoids by the same surgeon. In the 198 stapled hemorrhoidectomy cases the rate of postoperative moderate-severe pain and persistent pain were 6 % and 2. 5 % respectively, the rate of short-term and long-term bleeding were 4. 5 % and 3. 5 %, the recurrence rate was 2. 5 %. The mean postoperative stay was 1. 6 days. The stapled group had significantly lower postoperative moderate-severe pain, bleeding and soiling than the Milligan-Morgan group...|$|R

Analysis of a questionnaire with 52 questions about hemorrhoidal disease (HD) answered by 77 Brazilian specialists allowed the following conclusions: EPIDEMIOLOGY: The meantime of medical practice was 18. 6 years; the 77 specialists attended ± 1, 097. 860 patients, HD being diagnosed in ± 393, 763 (35. 86 %), and ± 102, 400 patients (± 26 %) undergoing surgical treatment. The approximate incidence by gender of HD was 42 % {{in men and}} 58 % in women, and the incidence of surgery 43 % in males and 57 % in females. The incidences of HD according to age were: 7 % under 20 years, 40 % between 21 and 40 years, 40 % between 41 and 60 years and 13 % above 60 years of age. CLINICAL AND NON SURGICAL TREATMENT: clinical approach for HD {{was carried out in}} ± 291. 363 patients. The non surgical treatment of choice was rubber band ligation (94, 0 % of the specialists), mainly for second grade internal hemorrhoids (85. 2 %), being the most common procedure the approach of a single ligation by each session (74. 1 %), without plicomectomy (67. 1 %). Satisfaction grade reached 91. 0 % (good and optimal). Rubber band ligation was used in ± 48, 273 patients (12. 50 %), no complication being reported by most of the specialists (42 specialists, 53. 95 %), being hemorrhage the most common complication (69 cases, 0. 142 % of 48, 273 ligations). HEMORRHOIDECTOMY: 102, 400 hemorrhoidectomies were performed by the 77 specialists, being the intensity of anal symptoms the main indication for surgery despite of the grade of the HD (64. 47 %). Open <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> (<b>Milligan-Morgan)</b> was the most used technique (65. 79 %) followed by closed hemorrhoidectomy (Ferguson) (21. 05 %). The most used anesthesia were spinal blocks, being 52. 63 % of raquianesthesia and 26. 32 % of peridural anesthesia. Knife position was the number one in preference (44. 73 %), followed by forced gynecologic position (22. 37 %) and regular gynecological position (21. 05 %). Most of the specialists preferred to perform hemorrhoidectomy in hospitalized patients (78. 94 %), being 55. 26 % as full day patients (55. 26 %) and 23. 68 % as day-patient. Antibiotic therapy was admitted by 77. 0 % of the specialists, being 47. 0 % in selected cases and 30. 0 % as routine; second generation cefalosporin was the most used antibiotic (13. 0 %) followed by the association of metronidazol and aminoglycoside (7. 5 %). POST OPERATORY: Among the analgesics used anti-inflammatory occupied the first place (29. 0 %), following paracetamol (21. 5 %), morphine (15. 3 %) and sodium diclophenate (13. 0 %). Routine rectal touch was carried out by 44 specialists (57. 0 %), being 34. 5 % with the aim of detection a possible anal stenosis and 25. 5 % to forbid the progress of an eventual stenosis. Among several post operatory complications called the attention the hemorrhage (admitted by 52. 0 % of the specialists) and anal stricture (9. 0 % of the specialists). 58 specialists (75. 0 %) ordered routine histopathology examination of the resected specimens. 55. 52 % of the specialists do not perform associated surgeries with HD. 57. 89 % of the specialists use clinical approach as far as hemorrhoid thrombosis is concerned. PPH (Procedure for Prolapsed Hemorrhoids) : 35 specialists never tried PPH (45. 0 %) and 62 % of them have never tried and do not feel like trying the technique. 38 specialists stated they tried this procedure (49. 0 %); 17 (22. 0 %) did not continue with PPH while 21 continued to use the technique.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} anal cushions in hemorrhoidectomy {{and its effect on}} anal continence of the patients. METHODS: Seventy-six consecutive patients (33 men and 43 women) {{with a mean age of}} 44 years were included. They underwent <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> because of symptomatic third- and fourth-degree hemorrhoids and failure in conservative treatment for years. Wexner score was recorded and liquid continence test was performed for each patient before and two months after operation using the techniques described in our previous work. The speed-constant rectal lavage apparatus was prepared in our laboratory. The device could output a pulsed and speed-constant saline stream with a high pressure, which is capable of overcoming any rectal resistance change. The patients were divided into three groups, group A ( 1200 mL) according to the results of the preoperative liquid continence test. RESULTS: All the patients completed the study. The average number of hemorrhoidal masses excised was 2. 4. Most patients presented with hemorrhoidal symptoms for more than one year, including a mean duration of incontinence of 5. 2 years. The most common symptoms before surgery were anal bleeding (n = 55), prolapsed lesion (n = 34), anal pain (n = 12) and constipation (n = 17). There were grade III hemorrhoids in 39 (51. 3 %) patients, and grade IV in 37 (48. 7 %) patients according to Goligher classification. Five patients had experienced hemorrhoid surgery at least once. Compared with postoperative results, the retained volume in the preoperative liquid continence test was higher in 40 patients, lower in 27 patients, and similar in the other 9 patients. The overall preoperative retained volume in the liquid continence test was 1130. 61 1; 78. 35 mL, and postoperative volume was slightly decreased (991. 27 1; 42. 77 mL), but there was no significant difference (P = 0. 057). Difference was significant in the test value before and after hemorrhoidectomy in group A (858. 24 1; 32. 01 mL vs 574. 18 1; 60. 28 mL, P = 0. 011), but no obvious difference was noted in group B or group C. There was no significant difference in Wexner score before and after operation (1. 68 1; 0. 13 vs 2. 10 1; 0. 17, P = 0. 064). By further stratified analysis, there was significant difference before and 2 months after operation in group A (2. 71 1; 0. 30 vs 3. 58 1; 0. 40, P = 0. 003). In contrast, there were no significant differences in group B or group C (1. 89 1; 0. 15 vs 2. 11 1; 0. 19, P = 0. 179; 0. 98 1; 0. 11 vs 1. 34 1; 0. 19, P = 0. 123). CONCLUSION: There is no difference in the continence status of patients before and after <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy.</b> However, patients with preoperative compromised continence may have further deterioration of their continence, hence <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> should be avoided in such patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study {{was to assess the}} results of treatment for hemorrhoids by <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> and by stapled mucoprolapsectomy in terms of operative time, postoperative pain, lenght of hospital stay, incidence of early and late complications, time to return to work and to normal social activities and patient satisfaction. Between January 2002 and December 2003, a total of 65 patients with hemorrhoids (35 men and 30 women {{with a mean age of}} 46. 9 years) underwent surgical treatment: 41 patients underwent conventional hemorrhoidectomy and 24 patients stapled mucoprolapsectomy. All patients were contacted by phone or were reviewed in the outpatient clinic with a mean follow-up of 2 months (range 8 - 31). The Authors emphasize that it is difficult to make an objective comparison between hemorrhoidectomy and stapled mucoprolapsectomy because the two procedures are completely different in terms of rationale and technique; however, stapled circumferential mucosectomy in their experience causes less postoperative pain and bleeding and can be considered a valid therapeutic option for third- and fourth-degree disease. ...|$|E

The aim of this study is to analyze randomized controlled trials using all the major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) about hemorrhoidopexy and conventional excisional surgery, and randomized controlled trials about the Ligasure versus the conventional hemorrhoidectomy, and some reports about the use of a new device (Doppler transducer) in an outpatient setting. ResultsWe found 17 studies from 2004 up to 2008, 1276 patients, 409 in the stapled group, 389 in the conventional group, 268 in hemorrhoidal artery ligation procedure and 210 in Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy group. This study confirms that SH is associated with less postoperative pain and shorter postoperative symptoms, compared with MMH. SH may be a viable alternative to the conventional surgical therapy for hemorrhoids with some advantages and some disadvantages in postoperative complications and costs. An other suitable alternative to conventional procedures is the use of Ligasure, although long-term evaluation of outcomes and morbidity is still needed. Hemorrhoidal artery ligation procedure is safe and easy to learn and to perform, even with a recurrence rate of 12, but randomized trials are mandatory...|$|E
40|$|<b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> using {{radiofrequency}} dissection (Ligasure) {{has been}} proposed instead of conventional diathermy in view of its potential benefits in terms of postoperative anal pain and better hemostatic control, but the medical literature is still controversial. This multicenter, randomized, controlled trial was designed to compare the outcomes between Ligasure and conventional diathermy hemorrhoidectomy in the Milligan-Morgan procedures in {{a sufficient number of}} patients. METHODS: Patients with Grades III and IV hemorrhoids were randomized to two groups: Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy and conventional diathermy. Postoperative anal pain was measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the analgesia required. Postoperative complications, wound healing, and return to working activities also were evaluated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 273 patients, well matched for age, gender, working activity and grade of hemorrhoids, were randomized to two groups: Ligasure 146, and diathermy 127. The severity of postoperative anal pain was significantly less in the Ligasure group when measured at least 12 hours after defecation (P < 0. 01), whereas it was similar at the time of defecation. The Ligasure group had significantly lower requirements for painkiller pills. There {{were no significant differences in}} early and late complications.

40|$|Abstract Introduction:  Stapled hemorrhoidopexy {{has gained}} wide {{acceptance}} due to less postoperative pain although postoperative bleeding and prolapse recurrence {{are among the}} major drawbacks of this technique compared with the standard <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy.</b> A new stapler device {{has been designed to}} overcome these side effects. Patients and Methods:  135 patients (71 males, mean age 42) with III degree haemorrhoids were randomly allotted to stapled haemorrhoidopexy with PPH(®) 01 / 03 stapler (Ethicon EndoSurgery) (63 patients) or with EEA(®) stapler (Covidien) (72 patients) in 4 referral colorectal centers. The number of haemostatic overstitches apposed on the stapled suture, the area of the resected mucosa (in cm(2)), and any postoperative bleeding within 30 -days were recorded. Results:  The mean area of the resected mucosa was significantly wider in EEA than PPH patients (35, 75 ± 17, 51 vs 28, 05 ± 10, 23 cm(2), p= 0. 002). The median number of haemostatic stitches apposed in the EEA group was significantly lower than in the PPH groups (median values 1, interquantile range 0 - 2, vs 3, interquantile range 2 - 5, p< 0. 0001). Intraoperative haemostasis was better in the EEA group compared both to PPH 01 and PPH 03 groups. Postoperative bleeding occurred only in 2 PPH patients. Discussion:  Data suggest that the EEA stapler has better haemostatic properties in comparison with PPH and allows resection of larger area of mucosal prolapsed with potential benefits over the recurrence rate of haemorrhoid prolapse...|$|E
40|$|Abstract AIM: <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> (MM) {{is still}} the most common {{treatment}} for grades III and IV hemorrhoids despite prolonged post-operative anal pain and wound healing. This multicenter, double blind, randomized, controlled trial was designed to assess the safety and the efficacy of anal wound cleansing with Triclosan (Proctocid®) in the control of symptoms and healing time after MM. METHODS: A total of 113 patients with grades III and IV hemorrhoids, undergoing open hemorroidectomy by diathermy or Ligasure vessel sealing device, were randomly assigned to Triclosan or sodium hypochlorite solution. All patients received analgesics and a fiber-rich diet after hemorrhoidectomy. Postoperative anal pain, bleeding and/or secretion and itch were assessed 7, 14 and 21 days after hemorrhoidectomy by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the day of complete re-epithelialization of anal wounds was recorded. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were randomized for Triclosan treatment and 58 for the control drug. The two groups were comparable for demographics, severity of hemorrhoids and technique used for the hemorrhoidectomy. The comparison of days to get complete anal wound healing shows a trend of significance (P= 0. 05) for the Triclosan group. Bleeding and/or secretion, anal pain and itch were significantly better (P= 0. 003; P< 0. 0001 and P= 0. 01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Triclosan solution for the treatment of post-hemorrhoidectomy wounds is safe and improves the control of post-operative symptoms and wound healing time compared to sodium hypochlorit...|$|E
40|$|Background:  Manual hemorrhoidopexy {{is a new}} {{technique}} of treating second degree hemorrhoids. In contrast to the conventional resectional techniques (Milligan-Morgan), manual hemorrhoidopexy is a novel technique as described by T Carlo. It does not involve excision but plication with fixation of the prolapsing hemorrhoid. Objective:  To study the outcome of manual hemorrhoidopexy and to compare manual hemorrhoidopexy with the traditional hemorrhoidectomy. Methods:  This is a prospective study conducted over 16 months (January 2012 to April 2013) in the College of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital (COMS-TH), Bharatpur, Chitwan, Department of Surgery. The patients who presented with third degree internal-hemorrhoids on a random basis, and underwent either conventional hemorrhoidectomy (Group A) or Manual hemorrhoidopexy (Group B) by senior consultant surgeons were included. The patients who had external hemorrhoids in addition to internal were excluded. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics were evaluated. Results:  Twenty five patients with median age group 42. 5 years underwent conventional (<b>Milligan-Morgan)</b> <b>hemorrhoidectomy</b> (Group A) and 25 patients with mean age of 40. 1 years underwent manual hemorrhoidopexy (Group B). Male patients were predominant in both groups. The patients in group A had more postoperative pain as compared to group B (as assessed by the visual analogue scale and requirement of post-operative analgesic) and this was statistically significant (p< 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference}} among the other post-operative urinary retention. Twelve percent (n= 3) patients in group A had post-operative bleeding and only 4 % (n= 1) in group B which was statistically significant (p< 0. 001). Mean duration of hospital stay in group A was 2. 5 days as compared to 1. 5 day in group B. Median follow up in both the study group was 3 (2 - 4) months. Conclusion:  Manual hemorrhoidopexy has comparable outcomes in term of postoperative analgesic requirement, and post operative complications.

40|$|Background: In {{this article}} we {{reported}} results obtained {{in our previous studies}} concerning application of Radiofrequency (RF) in proctology and in particular for hemorrhoids treatment. Methods: We compared Radiofrequency Submucosal Hemorrhoidectomy (RSH) and Conventional Parks' Hemorrhoidectomy (CPH) (group 1), Radiofrequency Open Hemorroidectomy (ROH) and <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>Hemorrhoidectomy</b> (MMH) (group 2), Radiofrequency Closed Hemorrhoidectomy (RCH) and Ferguson Hemorrhoidectomy (FH) (group 3), Combined Hemorrhoidal Radiocoagulation (CHR) and Rubber Band Ligation (RBL) (group 4). In this work primary endpoints were determined as evaluation of the grade of pain felt immediately after the procedure and at the first evacuation, bleeding, operation time, readmission to work, incidence of failures and patient's satisfaction. Results: Group 1 - In comparison to Parks' technique, use of radiofrequency scalpel reduced mean operation time (61. 2 min, range 50 - 75, vs. 37. 4 min, range 30 - 51; p < 0. 05), first postoperative day pain score (5. 9, range 3 - 10, vs. 4. 0, range 1 - 10; p < 0. 05), pain score at first evacuation (5. 7, range 2 - 10, vs 4. 2, range 1 - 8; p < 0. 05) and pain score on postoperative days (3. 6, range 1 - 9, vs. 2. 8, range 1 - 8; p < 0. 05). Group 2 - Results show a substantial similarity between these techniques, however the procedure lasted 7 minutes less with RF scalpel (18. 6 min, range 16 - 21, vs. 25. 55 min, range 20 - 30; p < 0. 05). Group 3 - Patients treated with RF showed significant reduction in surgical time (23 min, range 21 - 31, vs. 33 min, range 24 - 35; p < 0. 01), in pain at 1 st post-operative day (VAS score 3. 4 +/- 1. 3 vs. 4. 8 +/- 1. 0; p < 0. 05) and at the first evacuation (3. 4 +/- 1. 0 vs. 5. 0 +/- 0. 8; p < 0. 05). Group 4 - The study confirmed validity of both the used techniques, however CHR seems to allow a reduction in incidence of failures. Conclusions: Results obtained from radiofrequency surgery compared with those achieved with classic surgery for hemorrhoidal disease show in the majority of cases that radiosurgery facilitates, accelerates and improves surgical procedures...|$|E
