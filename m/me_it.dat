5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To <b>me</b> <b>it</b> felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E

25|$|You may be {{too young}} to remember, but in 1971, during a Test match, I {{collided}} with England fast bowler John Snow and lost my bat. Snow {{picked it up and}} handed it to me. But at the time, many papers wrote that Snow had flung the bat at <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> all depends on your point of view, or what you are trying to portray...|$|E
25|$|Love is the {{substance}} of happiness.

25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> was a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with him, and I went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head.

25|$|Post this intimation, I was {{informed}} {{for the first}} time yesterday by the BCCI that the Captain had reservations with my 'style' and about my continuing as the Head Coach. I was surprised since I have always respected the role boundaries between Captain and Coach. Though the BCCI attempted to resolve the misunderstandings between the Captain and <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> was apparent that the partnership was untenable, and I therefore believe it is best for me to move on.|$|E
25|$|While {{a student}} in college he wrote his first {{collection}} of poems entitled The Brunette Told <b>Me.</b> <b>It</b> was a collection of romantic verses that made several startling references to a woman's body, sending shock waves throughout the conservative society in Damascus. To make it more acceptable, Qabbani showed it to Munir al-Ajlani, the minister of education {{who was also a}} friend of his father and a leading nationalist leader in Syria. Ajlani liked the poems and endorsed them by writing the preface for Nizar's first book.|$|E

25|$|The Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS) is a self-assessed {{personality}} questionnaire {{designed to}} help people better understand themselves and others. It was first introduced in the book Please Understand <b>Me.</b> <b>It</b> {{is one of the}} most widely used personality assessments in the world, and its user base consists of major employers including Bank of America, Allstate, the U.S. Air Force, IBM, 7-Eleven, Safeco, AT, and Coca-Cola. The KTS is closely associated with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI); however, there are significant practical and theoretical differences between the two personality questionnaires and their associated different descriptions.|$|E
25|$|On the 1stofMay {{the city}} of New York has the {{appearance}} of sending off a population flying from the plague, or of a town which had surrendered on condition of carrying away all their goods and chattels. Rich furniture and ragged furniture, carts, wagons, and drays, ropes, canvas, and straw, packers, porters, and draymen, white, yellow, and black, occupy the streets from east to west, from north to south, on this day. Every one I spoke to on the subject complained of this custom as most annoying, but all assured <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was unavoidable, if you inhabit a rented house. More than one of my New York friends have built or bought houses solely to avoid this annual inconvenience.|$|E
25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> was clear that Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly {{then he would have}} cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E
