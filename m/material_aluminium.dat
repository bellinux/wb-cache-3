25|$|Metals {{and other}} solid {{materials}} expand upon heating and contract upon cooling. This is an undesirable occurrence in electrical systems. Copper {{has a low}} {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} for an electrical conducting <b>material.</b> <b>Aluminium,</b> an alternate common conductor, expands nearly one third more than copper under increasing temperatures. This higher degree of expansion, along with aluminium’s lower ductility, can cause electrical problems when bolted connections are improperly installed. By using proper hardware, such as spring pressure connections and cupped or split washers at the joint, {{it may be possible to}} create aluminium joints that compare in quality to copper joints.|$|E

By this stage, the recycled aluminium is indistinguishable from virgin aluminium and further processing is identical for both. This process does not produce any change in the metal, so aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.|$|R

50|$|Bluing {{only works}} on steel, cast iron, or {{stainless}} steel parts for protecting against corrosion.

However, the chemicals from the blueing process can accomplish uneven staining on aluminium and polymer parts. Hot bluing should never be attempted on aluminium, as it will react violently with the bath of caustic salts, potentially causing severe chemical burns.|$|E
