25|$|The ship {{borrowed}} {{many aspects}} of her design (as well as her name) from the Bloodhound, a Dundee-built whaling ship taken into Royal Navy service as HMS Discovery in 1874 for the British Arctic Expedition to the North Pole. By 1900 few yards in the United Kingdom had the capability to build wooden ships of the size needed - only two shipbuilders submitted bids for the contract - but it was deemed essential that the ship be made from wood, both for strength and ease of repair and to reduce the <b>magnetic</b> <b>interference</b> from a steel hull {{that would allow the}} most accurate navigation and surveying. The main compass was mounted perfectly amidships and there were to be no steel or iron fittings within 30feet (9.1 metres) of this point. For the same reason the boiler and engines were mounted towards the stern of the ship, a feature which also provided maximum space for equipment and provisions.|$|E

FitzRoy spared no expense in her fitting out, which included 22 chronometers, and five examples of the Sympiesometer, a kind of mercury-free barometer patented by Alexander Adie which was favoured by FitzRoy as giving the accurate readings required by the Admiralty. To reduce <b>magnetic</b> <b>interference</b> with the navigational instruments, FitzRoy proposed replacing the iron guns with brass guns, but the Admiralty turned this request down. (When the ship reached Rio de Janeiro in April 1832, he used his own funds for replacements: the ship now had a [...] "six-pound boat-carronade" [...] on a turntable on the forecastle, two brass six-pound guns before the main-mast, and aft of it another four brass guns; two of these were nine-pound, and the other two six-pound.) ...|$|E

2500|$|A compass {{should be}} laid {{down on a}} level surface so that the needle only rests or hangs on the bearing fused to the compass casing – if used at a tilt, the needle might touch the casing on the compass and not move freely, hence not {{pointing}} to the magnetic north accurately, giving a faulty reading. To see if the needle is well leveled, {{look closely at the}} needle, and tilt it slightly to see if the needle is swaying side to side freely and the needle is not contacting the casing of the compass. If the needle tilts to one direction, tilt the compass slightly and gently to the opposing direction until the compass needle is horizontal, lengthwise. Items to avoid around compasses are magnets of any kind and any electronics. Magnetic fields from electronics can easily disrupt the needle, preventing it from aligning with the Earth's magnetic fields, causing inaccurate readings. The Earth's natural magnetic forces are considerably weak, measuring at 0.5 Gauss and magnetic fields from household electronics can easily exceed it, overpowering the compass needle. Exposure to strong magnets, or <b>magnetic</b> <b>interference</b> can sometimes cause the magnetic poles of the compass needle to differ or even reverse. Avoid iron rich deposits when using a compass, for example, certain rocks which contain magnetic minerals, like Magnetite. This is often indicated by a rock with a surface which is dark and has a metallic luster, not all magnetic mineral bearing rocks have this indication. [...] To see if a rock or an area is causing interference on a compass, get out of the area, and see if the needle on the compass moves. If it does, it means that the area or rock the compass was previously at is causing interference and should be avoided.|$|E

30|$|ADCs using {{synchronous}} modulators, {{sample the}} input with minimum Nyquist rate {{decided by the}} maximum signal variation. As a result, most of the power is wasted; in signal processing terms, the signal is non-stationary and therefore the optimal sampling rate should be adapted based on the signal characteristics [3]. As many real-world signals vary irregularly, and asynchronous circuit processes only these relevant brief periods. It reduces the circuit activity and thus the dynamic power consumption. Also, the asynchronous modulator implementation is clockless and eliminates clock jitter as well the high-frequency injection problems. Since the restrictions imposed by a regular clock are not present in Asynchronous Sigma-Delta Modulator (ASDM), the requirements on the settling (bandwidth) and slew rate of the op-amps are significantly reduced [4]. Compared to synchronous modulators, it has other advantages like low susceptibility to Electro <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Interferences</b> (EMI), immunity to metastability, low power dissipation and recursive signal reconstruction etc. [5 – 7].

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} testing of a portable magnetic system combined with miniature inertial sensors for ambulatory {{6 degrees of freedom}} (DOF) human motion tracking. The magnetic system consists of three orthogonal coils, the source, fixed to the body and 3 -D magnetic sensors, fixed to remote body segments, which measure the fields generated by the source. Based on the measured signals, a processor calculates the relative positions and orientations between source and sensor. Magnetic actuation requires a substantial amount of energy which limits the update rate with a set of batteries. Moreover, the magnetic field can easily be disturbed by ferromagnetic materials or other sources. Inertial sensors can be sampled at high rates, require only little energy and do not suffer from <b>magnetic</b> <b>interferences.</b> However, accelerometers and gyroscopes can only measure changes in position and orientation and suffer from integration drift. By combing measurements from both systems in a complementary Kalman filter structure, an optimal solution for position and orientation estimates is obtained. The magnetic system provides 6 DOF measurements at a relatively low update rate while the inertial sensors track the changes position and orientation in between the magnetic updates. The implemented system is tested against a lab-bound camera tracking system for several functional body movements. The accuracy was about 5 mm for position and 3 degrees for orientation measurements. Errors were higher during movements with high velocities due to relative movement between source and sensor within one cycle of magnetic actuatio...|$|R
