40|$|What remains {{from the}} fin-de-siecle Mozart revival is, of course, its {{aesthetic}} influence on twentieth-century neoclassicism and modernism, particularly within {{the tradition of}} the Second Viennese School. Despite the fantastic commercial popularity that Mozart's music now enjoys, from the historian's perpective the turn to Mozart {{in the early twentieth century}} constituted an effort to revive the claims among many musicians on behalf of a model of purely musical hearing and listening. A premium on form and procedures of musical development within works of music-on structural devices overtly detached from the sort of extramusical illustration associated with Wagner-became a hallmark <b>of</b> <b>much</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> concert music. The turn away from the associative musical strategies of late Romanticism helped make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> music less accessible and therefore less popular. Wagnerism held the key to the mass audience. Therefore, from the vantage point of the late twentieth century, the rediscovery of Mozart during the early 1900 s helped lead, on the one hand, to the most extreme deification and dissemination of Mozart and his music within the museum of music, and, on the other (albeit indirectly, through the medium of modernist advocates of theories of absolute music) to the relative marginalization of contemporary music and musical modernism in our own time...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation of three concerts {{is designed to}} present wind instruments in unique combinations by bringing them together with other performance mediums. Programming for wind ensembles that moves beyond the traditional configuration of a full band to include other performers (voices, narrators, strings, organ) adds flexibility and appeal {{to the performance of}} music for winds. As the title implies, all the works chosen for inclusion on these programs involve a distinctive interweaving of wind instruments, with a variety of voices-whether human (both spoken and sung), the "voicing" of the pipe organ, choral music, or vocally based music-as the foundation of original classical works for winds. The additional works for larger wind-chamber ensembles provide another distinctive type of "voice" that can substantially enhance variety in programming and audience reception. Wind bands/ensembles may be combined with other voices to create variety in programming that attracts and hold the attention of discerning listeners. These concerts utilize the Annapolis Wind Symphony and the Chancel Choir of First Presbyterian Church of Annapolis. All concerts are professionally recorded on DVD with high­ quality digital sound. This project creates programs of variety and interest, while presenting music of true quality. The emphasis on voices and vocal music as an underlying theme harkens back not only to the roots <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writing</b> for winds but also to our over-all musical heritage that began with vocal music...|$|R

The author presents a detailed account of the French Gendarmeries from the old regime up to the First World War, and looks at the reasons for how and why this model came to be exported across continental Europe {{in the wake of the}} Revolutionary and Napoleonic armies. In particular their role is examined within the differing national contexts of Italy, Germany and the Habsburg Empire. The gendarmeries, it is argued, played a significant role in establishing the state, particularly in rural areas. As the physical manifestation of the state, gendarmes carried the state's law and a promise of protection, whilst at the same time ensuring in turn that the state received its annual levies of conscripts and taxes This account fully explores how the organisation and style of nineteenth-century soldier-policing in France developed in such a way that it brought the idea of the state and the state's law to <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> continental Europe...|$|R

The thought of C. S. Peirce is proposed as a fruitful way of renewing the analytic tradition and obviating these criticisms. While this paper is largely a reflection on Hilary Putnam’s study of {{the historical development of}} analytic philosophy, not only can some of its main roots be traced back to Peirce, but also the recent resurgence of pragmatism can be regarded as a pragmatist renovation of the analytic tradition. Further, Peirce’s thought offers suggestions for tackling some of the most stubborn problems in contemporary philosophy, thereby enabling us to shoulder once more the philosophical responsibility which has been abdicated by <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> philosophy.

40|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> {{continental}} {{philosophy has}} defined its task as "witnessing the inhuman. " With this is meant, first of all, a critical diagnostic aiming {{to uncover the}} nihilism that brought the modern world into the abyss. The philosophical side of this critique is famously the deconstruction of metaphysics. But witnessing the inhuman also has a positive meaning: the imperative {{to move beyond the}} separation of the human and the inhuman forces philosophy to correctly identify the inhuman {{at the heart of the}} human. This essay engages two attempts at solving the double task of witnessing the inhuman. In the first part, Giorgio Agamben's ethics of testimony is situated in his general project of a deconstruction of what he sees as the inherently dangerous metaphysics of Western logos, conducive to the destructive biopolitics that found in Auschwitz its fateful realization. Rather than a critique at a conceptual level, Agamben's overall project is questioned here on the basis of its practical consequences. Against the disempowering of praxis, Maurice Merleau-Ponty's alternative mode of constructing the witnessing of the inhuman is upheld. Merleau-Ponty's critique of humanism is the most fruitful one, I claim, because it is the one that opens the most promising horizon for truly effective models of ethical, political, and aesthetic praxis. 22 page(s...|$|R

The demographer Richard Easterlin, in his book Birth and Fortune, advanced the proposition that large birth cohorts necessarily follow small ones, and small cohorts follow large. The unexpectedly high living standards that small generations enjoy give rise to relatively large families, and the large generations' disappointment with their living standards leads to reluctance to have many children.

40|$|Jules Henri Poincaré may rightly be {{considered}} the father of modern topology (Leonhard Euler and the Königsberg bridges notwithstanding). It is fitting, therefore, {{that many of the}} questions explored in this thesis originated with Poincaré. Poincaré’s famous conjecture – which has driven so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> topology – arose, in fact, as the successor of an earlier conjecture. Poincaré originally conjectured that any 3 -manifold with the homology of S 3 is homeomorphic to S 3. But he soon found a counterexample, known today as the Poincaré homology sphere (obtained from S 3 by surgery along the right trefoil with framing 1). As a result, Poincaré re-formulated his conjecture into the now-famous statement that any compact, connected, oriented 3 -manifold with trivial fundamental group is homeomorphic to S 3. Although yet unresolved in dimension three, there is a natural generalization of Poincaré’s conjecture stating that any compact, oriented n-manifold with the homotopy type of S n, n ≥ 4, is homeomorphic to S n. Stephen Smale resolved the Generalized Poincaré Conjecture affirmatively for n ≥ 5 in 1961. Finally, in 1982, Michael Freedman provided a proof in dimension four. Smale approached the Generalized Poincaré Conjecture by investigating the properties of manifolds equivalent up to cobordism.

This paper explores the ideological motivations and political activities of senior figures within Britain’s dominant native aluminium producer for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the <b>twentieth-century,</b> the British Aluminium Company Ltd. (BACo), drawing on work by the author (Perchard 2007, 2010). As a company self-styled as ‘the Service’, support within BACo for imperial priorities and patrician values was sustained both by commercial imperatives as well as the social and cultural background of many of the directors (until the 1960 s), amongst them hereditary landowners, retired senior military officers and latterly senior civil servants. This paper will examine the political activities of directors collectively and individually through their engagement with power elites (Mills 1956). In particular, it will focus upon the areas of imperial defence, and regional development in the Scottish Highlands (where BACo’s main smelters were based), to illustrate how their involvement in political activities and social networks was both self-serving and governed by instinctive values. In so doing it will also comment upon the ‘revolving door’ between public and private spheres. While calling into question the general application of the notion of a ‘gentlemanly capitalist’ order, this paper accords with Larry Butler’s view of imperial mining concerns and the British metropolitan government’s priorities during decolonization that: ‘it may, rather, be more accurate to speak of temporary convergences of interest’ (Butler 2007 : 477; Cain and Hopkins 1987) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{introduction}} to Economic Anthropology’s special issue on “Energy and Economy” argues {{that we might}} find inspiration for a much more engaged and public anthropology in an unlikely place— 19 th century evolutionist thought. In addition to studying the particularities of energy transitions, which anthropology does so well, a more engaged anthropology might also broaden its temporal horizons to consider {{the nature of the}} future “stage” into which humanity is hurtling in an era of resource depletion and climate change. Net energy (EROEI), or the energy “surplus” on which we build and maintain our complex societal arrangements, is a key tool for anthropologists as we bring our trademark cross-cultural, ethnographically grounded knowledge and perspectives to bear in examining the complex interplay of material infrastructures, energy flows, social organization, and culture. We are now mindful of the always already cultural nature of such circuitry and interactions—in ways obviously unavailable to our nineteenth-century forebears. And yet even as our energy futures are neither predetermined nor inevitable, neither are they as unfettered by material constraints as many have come to think. A robust anthropology of energy informed by awareness of the energetic basis of the historically specific moment in which we find ourselves seems poised to help us get beyond the developmentalist ideas of Morgan and Tylor and to overcome a seeming inability to think comprehensively about the human predicament in simultaneously general and particular terms. We have a chance in the space now opening to get beyond the antinomies—materialist—mentalist, infrastructure—superstructure, agency—structure, objective—subjective, and so on—that dominated <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> anthropology...|$|R
40|$|This study {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> art, literature, and philosophy exhibits a concern with nothing itself. Both Martin Heidegger and Jean Paul Sartre, for example, perceive that nothing is part-and-parcel of (man’s) being. The present study adopts a similar position concerning nothing and its essential relationship to being, but adds a third element: that of writing narrative. This relationship between nothing and narrative is, I argue, established {{in the writings of}} Friedrich Nietzsche, Mikhail Bakhtin, Jacques Derrida, and Julia Kristeva. As Heidegger and Sartre position nothing as essential to the creation of being, so Nietzsche, Bakhtin, Derrida, and Kristeva figure nothing as essential to the production of narrative. The parallels between their theories regarding nothing and being, and nothing and narrative, are particularly telling, especially as the twentieth century deconstructs our notions of reality and fiction, rendering these increasingly indistinguishable from one another. This thesis regarding nothing’s relationship to narrative is further developed through analysis of the literary works of Nikolai Gogol, Herman Melville, Vladimir Nabokov, Samuel Beckett, and Victor Pelevin. These authors compose literature that not only gives narrative form to nothing itself (narratives about nothing), but that also envisions nothing as a generator of narrative (narratives of nothing). My phrase narratives of nothing indicates the symbiotic relationship between nothing and writing, wherein nothing resides at the forever-deferring center of a semiotic system that produces writing, narrative fiction, and thus “reality” as we know it. In each of the texts I have selected, there is a clear relationship established between (1) the act of writing, producing narrative and/or meaning, and (2) nothing or one of its many signifiers (e. g. void, cipher, zero, etc.). My analysis ultimately refigures the transcendental signified as nothing itself. Nothing as the transcendental signified is therefore the ever-deferring generator of a system of signifiers that perpetually recreate their own original transcendental signified. Because of this, nothing as the transcendental signified is an infinite nothing that constantly transforms depending on its own signifiers’ significations...|$|R

This new work writing defined itself, in part, against socialist realism and the tendency in the ?proletarian literature? of the 1930 s to privilege politics above descriptions of the actual experience of work.

This dissertation shows how twentieth-century advances in media technology {{have contributed to}} a surge of formal experimentation in postwar American literature and film. Scholars have identified a pervasive influence of mass media on avant-garde art in the postwar era, as can be readily witnessed in the celebrity-obsession of Frank OO'Hara's poems or Andy Warhol's films. But more than providing mere subject matter, the technological instruments of popular culture presented artists with new ways to work, challenging the traditional relationship between the artist and the work <b>of</b> art. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> literary and critical theory has argued that human perception is endlessly mediated, revealing the concepts of "reality," "the self," and "the author" � to be constructs. I demonstrate that this postmodern conception {{of what it means}} to be an author [...] -and even, to be human is a direct result of the ways that electronic media such as radio and television have reframed perception. I consider how postwar American writers and filmmakers contemplated the aesthetic possibilities of newer media by adopting those technologies for their own use, constructing "literary machines" [...] -technological assemblages that subsume the author's body into the creative process. My project defines "technology"� in Marshall McLuhan's sense of "extenions of man"� in order to show how postwar, pre-digital American literature and film implicated the human body in their understandings of the literary, the cinematic, and the technological. For example, I treat narcotics as a media technology in their own right, provoking users with new ways to see, hear, and experience time. I trace the various roles that drugs have played in <b>twentieth-century</b> theories <b>of</b> literature, media, and human embodiment as well as American literary and film history. Because drugs are a technology literally consumed by the human body, the texts and films that Henry Miller, Terry Southern, John Cassavetes, and William S. Burroughs produced about and under the influence of drugs suggest that the aesthetic and conceptual problems posed by new media technologies are in fact inherent to human experience...|$|R

40|$|The modern {{translation}} of poetry into the Scots language was of central {{importance to the}} movement {{now known as the}} Modern Scottish Renaissance, presenting writers with vital opportunities to redefine canons and realise their internationalising intentions. This thesis addresses the Scots-language translation work of the neglected second generation Renaissance poets who came to prominence after World War Two. It aims to situate this corpus of translated poetry in the context <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> Scottish <b>writing</b> as a whole, considering it in terms of its potential for the redress of tradition and canonicity. Tom Scott (1918 - 1995), William J. Tait (1918 - 1992), Robert Garioch (1909 - 1981), Sydney Goodsir Smith (1915 - 1975), Douglas Young (1913 - 1973) and George Campbell Hay (1915 - 1984) are the primary poet-translators with whom this thesis is concerned. Hugh MacDiarmid (1892 - 1978) was clearly of enormous importance as a formative influence on all the writers named above. He will therefore be referred to in terms of his interactions with his younger contemporaries and the impact of this on their Scots-language translation work. The Gaelic poet Sorley MacLean (1911 - 1996) becomes particularly relevant due to the large number of his poems translated by Garioch, Goodsir Smith and Young. Why was translation into Scots so important to these writers? What opportunities did it present them with and what drives the decision to translate a particular text into a particular dialect or synthetic form of Scots? What impact do these decisions have on their nature as cultural and political artefacts? What, finally, has been the legacy of these poets’ Scots translations and why are they important today? These are the core questions this thesis aims to address in terms of these texts’ wider global and historical context, drawing upon post-colonial criticism and translation theory to achieve its perspective...|$|R
40|$|August Weismann {{is famous}} for having argued against the {{inheritance}} of acquired characters.
