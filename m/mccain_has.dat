500|$|DeConcini later {{charged that}} <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> {{leaked to the}} press {{sensitive}} information about the investigation that came {{from some of the}} closed proceedings of the Ethics Committee. McCain denied doing so under oath, although several press reports concluded that <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> been one of the main leakers during that time. The GAO investigator later said, [...] "There is absolutely {{no doubt in my mind}} that McCain made those leaks." [...] Vice chair Rudman stated in his 1996 autobiography that McCain and his staff were responsible for some of the leaks, but later repudiated the assertion.|$|R
5000|$|By 1990, Easley, {{with new}} partner Davis <b>McCain,</b> <b>had</b> found a larger midtown Memphis {{facility}} for {{the studio and}} moved into it by the next year. <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> been the sound man at a 1980s local alternative music nightspot called The Antenna Club. The new Easley studio site was originally built in 1967 as [...] "the Onyx" [...] for Don Crews, {{who had been a}} business partner at American Sound Studios with producer Chips Moman. Crews parted from Moman at that time to start his own studio at the Onyx location.|$|R
5000|$|These {{developments}} {{and some other}} negotiations showed that <b>McCain</b> now <b>had</b> improved relations with the Obama administration, including the president himself, {{as well as with}} Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and veteran Democratic Senator Charles Schumer. [...] Indeed, <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> become the leader of a power center in the Senate for cutting deals in an otherwise bitterly partisan environment. They also led some observers to conclude that the [...] "maverick" [...] <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> returned. [...] When, in November 2013, Reid went ahead and imposed the [...] "nuclear option" [...] for most presidential nominations anyway, McCain intoned against the action with many words, saying it was a [...] "black chapter {{in the history of the}} Senate," [...] but still remained on a friendly basis with Reid.|$|R

50|$|Senator John <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> asked Bush speechwriter Matthew Scully {{to write}} the {{acceptance}} speech for his vice presidential nominee, whom <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> not yet chosen. Scully wrote the speech {{two weeks before the}} convention. He wrote the speech for a man to deliver, not a woman. Four days before the convention, Scully was surprised when he was informed that Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was to be McCain's running mate. Scully then worked all night to tailor the speech to Palin and also to incorporate new campaign strategy shifts that were being rapidly formed in intensive discussions by McCain campaign staff.|$|R
5000|$|Lillie <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> in {{the past}} e-mailed Senator McCain to inform him about the black McCains after she heard him say on Meet the Press that his {{ancestors}} owned no slaves. [...] John <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> not known about the slaveholding past until it was discovered by reporters during his 2000 presidential campaign. [...] The McCain plantation in Teoc, which was formally named Waverly, consisted of 2000 acre and existed from 1848 until 1952. [...] The plantation had slaves before the American Civil War and sharecroppers afterward; influential blues guitarist Mississippi John Hurt was born on the plantation {{to one of the}} latter.|$|R

25|$|Mike Tyson, Harry Reid and John <b>McCain</b> <b>have</b> all lent {{their support}} to the campaign, {{starting}} a Change.org petition asking President Obama to posthumously pardon the world’s first African-American boxing champion of his racially motivated 1913 felony conviction.|$|R

25|$|<b>McCain</b> <b>has</b> {{repeatedly}} cited France as a {{role model}} because it gets nearly 80% of its electricity from nuclear power, which helps the country to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions, and has made it one of the world's leading net exporters of energy.|$|E
25|$|From 2001–2002, National Right to Life, which opposes abortion, gave McCain a {{score of}} 33%. That was among his lowest from the organization. In 2015, and in most years since 2002, <b>McCain</b> <b>has</b> {{received}} a 100% rating from National Right to Life.|$|E
50|$|Unlike on the Democratic side, little campaigning {{took place}} as John <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> already {{clinched}} the nomination. Ron Paul made {{only a few}} stops in the state, including Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne a day before the primary.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential election, McCain {{was once}} again {{frequently}} mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time {{as part of the}} Democratic ticket underneath nominee John Kerry. Kerry and <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> been close since their work on the early 1990s Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, and the pairing was seen as having great allure to independent voters, with polls seeming to confirm the notion. <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> seemed open such a possibility in a March 2004 interview, only to have his staff reject it hours later. [...] In June 2004, it was reported that Kerry had informally offered the slot to McCain several times, but <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> declined, either on grounds that it would be infeasible and weaken the presidency or that the vice-presidency held no appeal for him or that he thought Bush was a better president than Kerry would be. McCain's office formally denied that any vice-presidential offer had taken place. [...] At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain enthusiastically supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, McCain defended Kerry by labeling the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against Kerry's Vietnam war record as [...] "dishonest and dishonorable" [...] and urging the Bush campaign to condemn it. [...] By August 2004, <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55 percent to 19 percent) of any national politician. [...] In the fall general election, McCain worked very hard for Bush; Bush campaign political director Terry Nelson later said, [...] "McCain was our most important surrogate." ...|$|R
2500|$|Parsley {{personally}} {{endorsed the}} presidential campaign of Republican nominee John McCain, who called Parsley a [...] "spiritual guide". <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> actively sought Parsley's endorsement during his Republican primary battle with Mike Huckabee, who was drawing substantial support from the religious right.|$|R
