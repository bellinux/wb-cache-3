[...] The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it.

Some speculate that adding context to engineering help to motivate engineering students’ studies and thus improve retention and diversity in engineering schools.

2500|$|Mayer (2004) {{argues that}} not all {{teaching}} techniques based on constructivism are efficient or effective for all learners, suggesting <b>many</b> <b>educators</b> misapply constructivism to use teaching techniques that require learners to be behaviorally active. He describes this inappropriate use of constructivism as the [...] "constructivist teaching fallacy". [...] "I refer to this interpretation as the constructivist teaching fallacy because it equates active learning with active teaching." [...] (Mayer, 2004, p.15). Instead Mayer proposes learners should be [...] "cognitively active" [...] during learning and that instructors use [...] "guided practice." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{a school}} to be fully {{committed}} to implementing PLCs, the school's leadership must help establish and maintain PLCs. Successful PLCs will require {{a shift in the}} traditional leadership structure from leader-centered (top-down) to shared leadership. Sue C. Thompson and her colleagues pointed out how <b>many</b> <b>educators</b> often feel that [...] "new ideas that came from someone else without teacher input" [...] are {{a waste of time and}} do not qualify as true leadership or support. In a PLC, the view of the principal as the instructional leader changes to a view that reflects the principal as a member of a community of learners and leaders.|$|E
