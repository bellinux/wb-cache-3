50|$|The {{system uses}} a hammer-type striker and a trigger {{assembly}} {{equipped with a}} manual fire control selector (the fire selector lever {{is located at the}} left side of the receiver, just above the pistol grip), that enables semi-automatic fire (selector switch in the “1” setting), continuous fire (“30”) and three-round burst mode (“3”). The fire selector lever also operates the external safety <b>mechanism</b> (<b>lever</b> in the “0” position - weapon is safe). The rifle features an internal safety.|$|E

The nickel plated blade on the right side is attached to the honing bar that slides on the red leather strop. The grey honing stone is part of the closing lid. The leather strop and the hone lids are not interchangeable as the blade needs to push against the hone but pull against the strop. The blade has a safety guard with pivot action that allows it to vary the shaving angle while providing safe operation. The head of the blade handle locks perpendicular to the blade using a slide type of action with the spring-loaded bearing providing additional stability ...|$|E

50|$|Through DNA sequencing, Salvia {{was shown}} to not be {{monophyletic}} but to consist of three separate clades (Salvia clades I-III) each with different sister groups. They {{also found that the}} staminal <b>lever</b> <b>mechanism</b> evolved at least two separate times, through convergent evolution. Walker and Sytsma (2007) clarified this parallel evolution in a later paper combining molecular and morphological data to prove three independent lineages of the Salvia <b>lever</b> <b>mechanism,</b> each corresponding to a clade within the genus. It is surprising to see how similar the staminal <b>lever</b> <b>mechanism</b> structures are between the three lineages, so Salvia proves to be an interesting but excellent example of convergent evolution.|$|R

50|$|The modern {{water closet}} or toilet utilises a cistern to reserve {{and hold the}} correct amount of water {{required}} to flush the toilet bowl. In earlier toilets, the cistern was located high above the toilet bowl and connected to it by a long pipe. It was necessary to pull a hanging chain connected to a release valve located inside the cistern in order to flush the toilet. Modern toilets may be close coupled, with the cistern mounted directly on the toilet bowl and no intermediate pipe. In this arrangement, the flush <b>mechanism</b> (<b>lever</b> or push button) is usually mounted on the cistern. Concealed cistern toilets, where the cistern {{is built into the}} wall behind the toilet, are also available. A flushing trough is a type of cistern used to serve more than one WC pan at one time. These cisterns are becoming less common however. The cistern was the genesis of the modern bidet.|$|E

40|$|By {{introducing}} <b>lever</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{into the}} conventional vibration isolation system, new vibration isolation {{systems such as}} lever-damper isolator (LDI), lever-spring isolator (LSI) and lever-spring-mass isolator (LSMI) can be developed. The transmissibility of LDI, transmissibility of LSI and that of LSMI are obtained analytically. With numerical simulation, the vibration isolation performance of these systems {{and the effect of}} parameters on the performance are investigated.

50|$|The M1905/M1906 Vest Pocket pistol {{incorporated}} a grip safety mechanism that constituted the entire rear {{section of the}} grip. This particular safety mechanism required {{a significant amount of}} hand palm pressure to disengage and allow the trigger to release the striker to fire the pistol. Colt produced a nearly identical pocket pistol, the Colt Model 1908 Vest Pocket, which {{incorporated a}} small safety lever {{on the left side of}} the receiver which locked the trigger. In addition, this safety <b>lever</b> <b>mechanism</b> locked the slide about a half inch back from the front of the pistol to enable easy disassembly. FN also added this safety <b>lever</b> <b>mechanism</b> to its pistol, but did not add the magazine safety mechanism that Colt introduced in 1916.|$|R

5000|$|The Jennings Magazine Rifle In 1849 Walter Hunt {{patented}} a repeating rifle {{he called}} [...] "the Volitional Repeater".

Using state-wide survey data from 1993 and 2003, this study examines how the work of school superintendents has been affected over a ten-year period by these reform initiatives, especially increased demands for accountability. The general message from our data is that superintendents are interested in curriculum and instruction and believe these are important tasks, but the daily realities of their work often subvert even the most committed professional. Further, the data indicate that superintendents {{may be able to}} use external accountability <b>mechanisms</b> as <b>levers</b> to move the internal accountability systems to support improved teaching and learning...|$|R
50|$|It is a {{mechanism}} that usually {{consist of a}} rigid beam/rod fixed about a pivot. Levers are balanced {{when there is a}} balance of moment or torque about the pivot.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the forward kinematics of a five-bar compliant micro-manipulator, where <b>lever</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{are used to}} enlarge the working range in Cartesian space. Based on {{the configuration of the}} proposed flexure-based micro-manipulator, the entire system has been divided into a five-bar mechanism and two four-bar amplification mechanisms. The amplification factor of the <b>lever</b> <b>mechanism</b> is derived based on the analytical solution of the four-bar linkage. For the five-bar mechanism, the closed-form forward kinematics is obtained according to the established geometric relationship. The velocity of the end-effector is also obtained by differentiating the forward position kinematic equation. Based on the simplified methodologies such as linearising the trigonometric functions and constant Jacobian matrix, numerical simulations have been carried out to investigate the performance of the five-bar compliant manipulator. The comparisons between the exact solution and the simplified methodologies are carried out. It is noted that the linearising trigonometric simplification has a higher accuracy and is more suitable for the kinematic calculation of the micro-manipulator, but the constant Jacobian matrix method can efficiently calculate the forward kinematics of the micro-manipulator with the acceptable accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the forward kinematics of a five-bar compliant micro-manipulator. To overcome the limited displacement {{of such a}} flexure-based mechanism driven by piezoelectric actuators, <b>lever</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are utilized to enlarge the working range. The mechanical design of the micro-manipulator is firstly described. Mathematical formulations for the five-bar mechanism are described and the solutions are developed to decide the end-effector position in Cartesian space. The amplification factor of the <b>lever</b> <b>mechanism</b> is also derived based on the analytical solution of the four-bar linkages. The velocity of the end-effector is obtained by differentiating the forward position kinematic equation, and the local mobility index of the five-bar compliant mechanism is determined and analysed. Based on linearization of trigonometric functions and constant Jacobian matrix, numerical simulations are carried out to investigate {{the performance of the}} five-bar compliant manipulator and to determine the optimal geometric parameters for the configuration. The comparisons between the exact solution and simplified methodologies are conducted. Experiments are carried out to validate the established model and the performance of the developed micro-manipulator...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary: This Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA), {{based on}} 57 studies {{carried out in}} {{policing}} and other professions, aimed to identify interventions, <b>mechanisms</b> and <b>levers</b> that might encourage ethical behaviour and prevent wrongdoing in organisations. Taken together, the evidence raises a number of possibilities for organisations for action, though no readymade single solution was identified. The importance of strong and effective leadership – such as leaders being open, acting as role models, and also being ‘firm’ in terms of setting and enforcing standards – was highlighted as encouraging ethical behaviour, {{as well as being}} an essential ingredient for the successful implementation of interventions. Promising interventions tended to be broadly preventive or remedial in their approach, rather than focused on apprehending and disciplining those responsible for wrongdoing...|$|R
