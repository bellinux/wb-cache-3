Fuel-metering approaches, from the least to the most modern, include carburettor, throttle body injection (TBI), <b>manifold</b> <b>port</b> injection (MPI or sometime called PFI, port fuel injection), and gasoline direct injection (GDI). Based on the mixture formation process, GDI engines can be categorised into air-guided, wall-guided, and spray-guided methods while based on the ignition modes they can be homogeneous spark ignition - (HCI), stratified spark ignition (SPI) and homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines. The comparative study shows significant variations in cylinder to cylinder mixture distribution for both liquid and gaseous LPG phases. The experimental data confirms the power and efficiency advantages of liquid phase injection over gaseous phase injection. Analysis shows the charge state {{at the end of}} compression is the major contributor to the performance difference. Secondary differences such as the mixture homogeneity also have an important impact. The lower temperature combustion with liquid phase LPG also delivers substantial NOx emission reduction. Suggestions are made for overcoming the deficiency of gaseous phase injection which may be preferred as its application avoids the high cost of the high pressure in-tank LPG pump needed for liquid phase injection...|$|E

50|$|The Ion was {{the trend}} starter {{for a new}} {{marketing}} idea in the paintball industry, whereby relatively high-performance parts would be sold after the absolute lowest price markup, thus allowing the product (Ion) to be sold for an extremely reasonable price. The Ion uses similar principals in design to the higher-performance Shocker marker, however several key factors to the Ion design were altered to allow it a drastic reduction in production cost (allowing the low MSRP price tag for the end-user). In particular, the Ion was cheaper to produce due to its modular body/exoskeleton design, newly designed inexpensive solenoid, and use of internal air tubing instead of machined <b>manifold</b> <b>ports</b> like high-end markers. These, combined with a reasonably low markup in price for retailers, allowed the Ion to debut with an MSRP of $275. The MSRP was later reduced to $200 for about a year-long period, but was increased back up to $225 at a later time. It was again reduced back down to $200.|$|R

Proposed Units 3 and 4 of 800 Mw {{capacity}} each were scheduled for commercial operation in the early 1980 's. Proposed design improvements in the circulating cooling water systems. for Units 3 and 4 involved complex hydraulic flows. To assure performance, hydraulic model studies were undertaken. This report details the studies of a 1 : 12 model which were made at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. In normal operations, heated water from the condensers is elevated {{to the top of}} forced draft cooling towers where it is released to spray downward for cooling. Start-up during sub freezing weather could lead to damaging freeze-up in the cooling tower. An added 84 inch diameter temporary cold weather by-pass drops the 168, 000 gpm flow a distance of over 40 feet and requires a dispersed <b>manifold</b> <b>port</b> system assuring good energy dissipation and a stable, well-distributed flow into the tower basin. Based on initial model studies, several small changes were made in the original design to achieve the desired flow quality. Flow in the coaling system is maintained by two 5, 000 HP pumps drawing from a pump basin supplied by two cooling towers. The basin serves to route flow from either or both towers to either or both pumps. There was a concern that flow asymmetries or vortices detrimental to pump performance might be generated in the pump basin. Extensive tests at the model pump suction using pitots and vortex sensors establish that good flow conditions existed for all routings and no modification of the basin design was needed.

The nonlinear elastic-plastic behaviour of the material has been considered. The component locations susceptible to stress could be determined.

The subject {{of this study is to}} evaluate the distribution of trapped exhaust gas in the diesel intake system using commercial Star-CD software (version 4. 22. 018). Numeric simulations of the intake flow of fresh air and recycled exhaust in the diesel intake system were initialized following previous experiments that were conducted on a reformed six-cylinder diesel engine by supplying CO 2 instead of EGR to the tangential intake port alone to establish CO 2 stratification in the first cylinder. The distributions of the intake CO 2 in the intake <b>manifold</b> and intake <b>ports</b> under the conditions of 1330 r/min and 50 % load with different mass flow rates of CO 2 are discussed.

To ensure equally distributed inflow over the whole length of the pipe the energy head has to be calculated with high accuracy. The total losses are led back to friction losses due to continuous flow between the ports and additional losses created by the disturbance of the velocity profile due to the lateral inflow. The flow model assumed to describe the boundary conditions of the set-up {{plays an important role in}} the evaluation of the experimental data. As essential results of the investigation it was found that the inflow rates are unequally distributed for a pipe of constant diameter and that the discharge coefficients show only small variations. Local loss coefficients have their maximum value behind the first port and decrease with increasing number of ports. Based on a thorough analysis of the losses a uniform distribution of inflow rates can be achieved by varying the pipe diameters and the port areas even for higher flow velocities in the pipe. (orig.)

From the results it was observed that in manifold injection technique the optimized condition was start of injection at gas exchange top dead centre (GTDC) with injection duration of 30 o crank angle (CA) with hydrogen flow rate of 7. 5 litres/min. In port injection technique, the optimized condition was start of injection at 5 o before gas exchange top dead centre (5 o BGTDC) with injection duration of 30 o CA with hydrogen flow rate of 7. 5 litres/min.

The fuel is injected to the intake <b>port</b> <b>manifolds</b> to generate uniform fuel/air mixture in the cylinder. Two different piston shapes, one with a flat disc and one with a square bowl, were employed to generate different in-cylinder turbulence and temperature field prior to autoignition. The {{aim of this study}} was to scrutinize the effect of in-cylinder turbulence on the temperature field and on the combustion process. The fuel tracer, acetone, is measured using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to characterize the reaction fronts, and chemiluminescence images were recorded using a high-speed camera, with a 0. 25 crank angle degree resolution, to further illustrate the combustion process. Pressure in the cylinder is recorded in the experiments. Spatial and temporal resolved LES was used to gain information on the turbulence mixing, heat transfer and combustion process. It was shown that gas temperature in the piston bowl is generally higher than that in the squish, leading to an earlier ignition in the bowl. Compared to the disc engine, the square bowl engine has a higher temperature inhomogeneity owing to the turbulence wall heat transfer. The experimentally observed higher combustion duration and slower pressure rise rate in the square bowl engine as compared to the disc engine can be explained by the higher temperature inhomogeneity in the square bowl engine...|$|R

The turbo setup changed from parallel twin turbo (CT12A x2) to a single turbo (CT15B). The single turbo is in part made more efficient {{by the use of}} smaller exhaust ports in the head, this allows the escaping exhaust gasses to have more velocity as they exit the head, which in turn, spools the turbo faster and at lower RPM.The adoption of VVT-i and the improved cylinder cooling allowed the compression ratio to be increased from 8.5:1 to 9.0:1.

40|$|High- and infinite-dimensional {{nonlinear}} dynamical systems often exhibit complicated flow (spatiotemporal chaos or turbulence) {{in their}} state space (phase space). Sets invariant under time evolution, such as equilibria, periodic orbits, invariant tori and unstable manifolds, {{play a key role}} in shaping the geometry of such system’s longtime dynamics. These invariant solutions form the backbone of the global attractor, and their linear stability controls the nearby dynamics. In this thesis we study the geometrical structure of inertial manifolds of nonlinear dissipative systems. As an exponentially attracting subset of the state space, inertial manifold serves as a tool to reduce the study of an infinite-dimensional system to the study of a finite set of determining modes. We determine the dimension of the inertial manifold for the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation using the information about the linear stability of system’s unstable periodic orbits. In order to attain the numerical precision required to study the exponentially unstable periodic orbits, we formulate and implement “periodic eigendecomposition”, a new algorithm that enables us to calculate all Floquet multipliers and vectors of a given periodic orbit, for a given discretization of system’s partial differential equations (PDEs). It turns out that the O(2) symmetry of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation significantly complicates the geometrical structure of the global attractor, so a symmetry reduction is required in order that the geometry of the flow can be clearly visualized. We reduce the continuous symmetry using so-called slicing technique. The main result of the thesis is that for one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation defined on a periodic domain of size L = 22, the dimension of the inertial manifold is 8, a number considerably smaller that the number of Fourier modes, 62, used in our simulations. Based on our results, we believe that inertial manifolds can, in general, be approximately constructed by using sufficiently dense sets of periodic orbits and their linearized neighborhoods. With the advances in numerical algorithms for finding periodic orbits in chaotic/turbulent flows, we hope that methods developed in this thesis for a one-dimensional nonlinear PDE, i. e., using periodic orbits to determine the dimension of an inertial <b>manifold,</b> can be <b>ported</b> to higher-dimensional physical nonlinear dissipative systems, such as Navier-Stokes equations.

The injection of air into the exhaust system therefore could be {{an effective way to}} utilize additional thermal and chemical energy available in the exhaust gas. This study was initiated to investigate the thermal and chemical processes associated with secondary air injection (SAI) inside the exhaust system in order to maximize the simultaneous benefit of reducing converter-in emissions and improving catalyst lightoff performance during cold start. An experimental study was performed to develop a more fundamental understanding of the effects of SAI on exhaust gas emissions and catalyst light-off characteristics during cold start of a modem SI engine. The effects of several design and operating parameters such as spark retardation, fuel enrichment, secondary air flow rate and air injection location were investigated to understand the mixing, heat loss, and thermal and catalytic oxidation processes associated with SAL. Time-resolved HC, CO and CO 2 concentrations were tracked from the cylinder exit to the catalytic converter outlet and converted to mass flow rates by applying an instantaneous exhaust mass flow rate model. A phenomenological model of exhaust heat transfer combined with the gas composition analysis was also developed to define the thermal and chemical energy state of the exhaust gas with SAT. The study found that significant emissions reduction can be achieved with SAI by the thermal oxidation process prior to the catalyst, which results in enhancing the chemical process inside the catalyst by faster catalyst light-off. The engine operation, with a relative air/fuel ratio 20 % rich of stoichiometric and 100 % secondary air, yielded the fastest catalyst light-off (4. 2 sec). The SAI system reduced HC emissions by 46 % to 88 % and CO emissions by 37 % to 93 % compared with the normal operating conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe Mixed-cell Raceway (MCR) is {{a design}} that intends to combine the best {{characteristics}} of circular tanks and linear raceways in a single production system. The conceptual idea is to convert traditional linear raceways {{into a series of}} hydraulically separated cells, each of which behaves as an individual circular tank. The MCR {{can take advantage of the}} solids removal ability of circular tanks and can be managed as either a partial reuse or intensive recirculation system. This study investigated the hydrodynamics of a large-scale (90 m 3) MCR composed of three in-series 5. 5 m× 5. 5 m mixed-cells (∼ 1 m water depth). Water velocity measurements of the entire tank were used to generate velocity-magnitude contours and vector plots, investigate the distribution of water velocities, and evaluate the self-cleaning characteristics and related management issues of an MCR. The grand mean of the water velocities of the three MCR in-series cells was 16. 5 cm/s (16. 1, 15. 5, and 17. 8 cm/s for cell 1, cell 2, and cell 3, respectively). Results showed that water velocities decreased somewhat in a linear manner from the tank bottom to the top, i. e., 18. 9, 15. 8 and 14. 7 cm/s, and in the same way from the periphery (21. 9 cm/s) to the center of the cells (3. 7 cm/s). Analyses indicated that these water velocities were in the optimum range to promote fish health and condition as well as to achieve tank self-cleaning. For a water exchange rate of 1. 7 volumes per hour and an operating head of 1. 36 m in the jet <b>port</b> <b>manifolds,</b> the power requirements of the MCR reached 8. 9 W/m 3. Contour and vector velocity plots showed that the mixed-cells develop a well-defined rotational pattern around the center drain. Also, strategically located water jets directed across the width of the MCR were able to limit the rotational flow to each cell and create the required counter-rotational pattern between adjacent cells. Velocity vectors showed a relatively low turbulence in the corners of the cells, even in the middle cell (cell 2) that had solid-walls on only two sides. Velocity vectors and contour plots also suggested an absence of dead volumes or short-circuiting within the cells, indicating that adequate mixing was being attained in the MCR...|$|R

The stainless steel base material had a low thermal conductivity (15. 1 W / mK) which magnified the conjugative effects {{in order to better}} understand the heat transfer. Rectangular microchannels with a height and width of 0. 64 mm x 0. 41 mm for Test Section 1, 0. 5 mm x 0. 5 mm for Test Section 2 and 0. 43 mm x 0. 58 mm for Test Section 3 were considered. The overall width of the solid substrate was 1. 5 mm and the length was 50 mm for all of the test sections. The aspect ratio of the channel and the solid substrate was kept equal. A constant heat flux of 10 W / cm 2 was applied to the bottom outer wall of the test section. A sudden contraction inlet and a sudden expansion outlet <b>manifold</b> contained pressure <b>ports,</b> to measure the pressure drop across the test sections, and thermocouples measured the mean inlet and outlet fluid temperatures. Thermocouples were used to measure the outer top and side wall temperatures at four equally spaced positions along the axial direction. The amount of axial heat conduction was below 0. 6 % for all of the test sections and therefore warranted the use of a two-dimensional conduction model to determine the heat transfer parameters at the fluid to solid interface based on the outer measured wall temperatures. The local Nusselt number decreased, along the axial direction but increased towards the exit for all of the test sections. The average Nusselt number increased with the flow rate and the critical Reynolds number for fully turbulent flow Test Section 1 was 1950, for Test Section 2 was 2250 and for Test Section 3 was 1650. The average Nusselt number was directly related to the perimeter of the microchannels two side walls and the bottom wall (not the top wall), and thus decreased as the aspect ratio of the channel increased. The experimentally determined Nusselt numbers were larger for all three test sections when compared to common acceptable correlations. The friction factor decreased with the flow rate and was smaller in magnitude when compared to conventional theories. The diabatic friction factor magnitudes were smaller than the adiabatic friction factors. The friction factor decreased as the aspect ratio decreased, where the aspect ratio was calculated by taking the maximum of the microchannels width or height, divided by the minimum of the two. The possibility of a relationship could exist between the Colburn j-factor and the friction factor when considering the results for Test Section 1 and Test Section 2 but the results for Test Section 3 were significantly different.

In addition, the negative impacts of the emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil-hydrocarbons on environment and human health are causes for concern. These noxious emissions may be curtailed by adopting different approaches of fuel modification, modification of combustion chamber design and by after-treatment of the exhaust gas. This piece of research focused on the fuel modification approach to emissions reduction. In order to address the food-fuel-fiber conflicts, the alternative fuel has to have its source preferably from non-food crops; a second generation bio-fuel in other words. Therefore, non-food-crop-based blends of biomass-derived biodiesel (BD), derived from Jatropha curcus, is considered a good choice. Trade-off is inevitable, however this bio-diesel has a high viscosity and thereby problems associated with its spray characteristics. In order to tide over these challenges, it is blended with low-viscosity fuels such as ethanol or Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthetic diesel. This research studied the feasibility and usage of bio-fuels in IC engines to address the aforesaid concerns, understand what the fundamentally, acceptable emission levels are and also determine the optimal blending limits of bio-fuels. In this context, the experimental works are carried out as two cases. First, the experimental investigations on blends of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthetic diesel and Jatropha methyl ester (JME), as fuel in a diesel engine, are carried out. For this purpose, the JME was produced by the trans-esterification process and the blends are tested against EN 14214, or in some cases, ASTM standards. The volumetric blending percentages of BD to FT fuel are 0 : 100, 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25 and 100 : 0 respectively. Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy {{results indicate that the}} BD and FT fuels are mainly aliphatic and ester compounds. The gas chromatography (GC) result shows that the neat BD (B 100) contains more than 97 % ester. The experiment was conducted with a four-stroke, six-cylinder, turbo-charged, direct injection (DI) diesel engine with an optimum engine speed of 1450 rpm and a dynamic fuel injection timing of 20 crank angle degrees (CAD) before the top dead centre (TDC). The experimental results showed that the exhaust emissions including carbon monoxide (CO), total unburnt hydrocarbon (THC), smoke, total particulate matter (TPM) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) were reduced with FT fuel, vis-à-vis neat diesel fuel (DF). The CO, THC, smoke and TPM emissions were reduced significantly, while NOx emissions were somewhat higher with BD blended fuels compared to neat FT fuel. From this study, the reductions in CO, THC, smoke and TPM emissions with BD blends were mainly due to the oxygen content in the BD blended fuel, while the increases in NOx emissions with BD fuels were due to advances in injection timing, higher percentages of fatty acids with double bonds in the carbon chain and higher heat release in the pre-mixed combustion. As regards engine performance and emissions, non-edible renewable BD blends can be excellent competitors as alternate fuels for diesel engines. Secondly, a four-stroke, single-cylinder, naturally-aspirated (NA), direct-injection (DI) diesel engine with 8 BHP at 1500 rpm coupled with water-cooled, eddy current dynamometer was used for the experiments. Ethanol (5 % by volume) was injected into the intake <b>manifold</b> by the <b>port</b> injection method with the assistance of a mechanical fuel injection pump. Therefore, the volumetric blending percentages of ethanol, BD and diesel fuels (E:D:JME) are (0 : 100 : 0), (5 : 95 : 0), (5 : 75 : 20), (5 : 55 : 40), (5 : 35 : 60), (5 : 15 : 80) (5 : 0 : 95) and (0 : 0 : 100) respectively. Ethanol pre-mixed with intake air, assisted in improving combustion in both diesel and the JME blends. The addition of ethanol to high-viscosity Jatropha methyl ester (JME) through port injection is investigated in order to determine its effect on the fuel’s viscosity and thereby on the diesel engine performance. In addition to viscosity alteration, the impact of ethanol addition on combustion characteristics such as combustion duration, ignition delay and emissions levels from diesel engines fuelled with blends of ethanol, diesel and JME was studied in particular. It was found that blending of oxygenated fuels with diesel modifies the chemical structure and physical properties which in turn, alter the engine’s operating conditions, combustion parameters and emissions levels. However, the injection of only 5 % ethanol through port injection allows for up to 25 % blending of diesel with biofuels, while retaining the fuel characteristics. Furthermore, a two-zone combustion model was used to perform numerical analysis. Both the experimental and numerical results showed that 5 % ethanol addition in JME-blended diesel results in a slight increase in fuel consumption and improved the engine performance about 3 - 5 %. Also, the combustion characteristics were improved which includes the maximum in-cylinder pressure, cumulative heat release (CHR) rate of heat release (ROHR), in-cylinder peak temperature and combustion duration. Regarding emission characteristics, the experimental results showed a significant reduction in emissions like carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbon (THC), by 51 %, 40 % and 43 % respectively. However, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions were found to increase at high loads although the common trade-off between smoke and NOx is found to be more prominent for the oxygenated fuels; presumably owing to the presence of oxygen atoms in the fuel’s molecular structure. Finally, the results showed that the optimum blending limits are FT:BD (25 : 75) and E:D:JME (5 : 75 : 20). The thesis presents the conclusions along with recommendations for further research.
