40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a {{customer-oriented}} conceptual model of segmentation variables for mail-order repeat buying behavior. We investigate (1) from a theoretical perspective what customer-related variables {{should be included}} in response models for modeling repeat purchasing, and (2) empirically validate how these variables perform for predictive purposes. We use binary logit modeling. Our results confirm that all three traditionally-used R(ecency), F(requency) and M(onetary value) variables are very important in predicting who is going to purchase during the next <b>mailing</b> <b>period,</b> with frequency being the most important one. In total, they account for 50 % of the ‘room for improvement’ in terms of AUC performance. However, next to the RFM variables, our findings suggest that at least three other variables significantly increase the predictive performance of the models: (1) credit usage, (2) length of relationship, and (3) general mail-order buying behavior. Depending on the context of the specific company use of these additional variables may translate into millions Euro of additional profit. Furthermore, we conclude that buying additional data from external sources is not economically justified when predicting repeat purchasing behavior. ...|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 1320 firms meeting the four {{criteria}} {{were selected from}} the Dun and Bradstreet database as the study’s initial sample frame. After excluding firms {{for a variety of}} reasons (e.g., a no-survey policy, not reachable), the adjusted sample was 1139. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to top management (e.g., CEO, vice president). Following Dillman et al. (2009) survey technique, the following steps were taken: a pre-notification postcard, an initial questionnaire, a reminder postcard, a second questionnaire, and final phone and email contacts. As the first survey package resulted in a low response rate, phone calls and emails were made during the second <b>mailing</b> <b>period</b> to encourage the participation of firms who had misplaced, lost, not received, or not responded to the first mailing. By the end of the data collection, the final useable questionnaires totaled 76, representing a response rate of 6.67  %. A series of t tests was performed to measure the non-response bias by comparing questionnaires received after the first mailing and after the second mailing. No statistical evidence of non-response bias, such as annual sales volume and number of domestic retail stores, was identified in the firms’ demographic characteristics.|$|E

40|$|From 1919 to 1920 the United States {{carried out}} a massive {{campaign}} against radicals, arresting and deporting thousands of radical immigrants {{in a matter of}} months, raiding and shutting down anarchist printing shops, and preventing anarchists from sending both periodicals and personal communications through the <b>mail.</b> This <b>period</b> is widely known as the First Red Scare, and is framed as a reaction to recent anarchist terrorism, syndicalist unionizing, and the Bolshevik Revolution. Though the 1919 - 20 First Red Scare was certainly unprecedented in its scope, it was made possible through a longer campaign against radicals, throughout which the US government constructed legal, ideological, and institutional apparatuses to combat radicalism and terrorism. This project explores the longer conflict between the US government and anarchists, focusing on the period between 1900 and 1920. It argues that the government sought to suppress radicalism not just due to anarchist terrorism or class antagonism, but also due to a broader ideology of antiradicalism that framed anarchist counterculture and connected ideas like free love and internationalism {{as a threat to the}} nation-state and to traditional American values. In trying to suppress radical counterculture years before the First Red Scare, the US government built its capacity for federal policing. And, by tying the battle against anarchist terrorism to a broader project of suppressing any idea considered to be radical or nontraditional, the US government controlled the kinds of ideas and people allowed within American borders through force, demarcating political limits to American nationality and citizenship...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{trade-offs}} between operational flexibility and operational complex-ity in periodic distribution problems. We consider the gains from operational flexibility {{in terms of}} vehicle routing costs and customer service benefits, {{and the costs of}} operational complexity in terms of implementation difficulty. Periodic distribution problems arise in a number of in-dustries, including food distribution, waste management and <b>mail</b> services. The <b>period</b> vehicle routing problem (PVRP) is a variation of the classic vehicle routing problem in which driver routes are constructed for a period of time; the PVRP with service choice (PVRP-SC) extends the PVRP to allow service (visit) frequency to become a decision of the model. While intro-ducing operational flexibility in periodic distribution systems can increase efficiency, it poses three challenges: the difficulty of modeling this flexibility accurately; the computational effort required to solve the problem as modeled with such flexibility; and the complexity of opera-tionally implementing the resulting solution. This paper considers these trade-offs between the system performance improvements due to operational flexibility and the resulting increases in operational and computational complexity as they relate to periodic vehicle routing problems...|$|R

The reasons were : they had the low possibility of transfer to a distant place, and they were able to get support from close relatives, since they had environments which facilitate work and a home life, we think. There appear to be three main factors : “hometown was the same as place of work”, “large percentage live with parents”, and “the spouse having also worked as a teacher”. 2) The teacher skill-training programs of those days inclined towards “training about professional expertise and skills”, the organization for being promoted to management was not prepared, and there was a promotion gap between men and women.

40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} this study is to examine how penal codification was received and interpreted by the media. The media sources to be used are English newspapers and professional legal English Journals. With respect to the legal journals three journals were selected (two from Ontario, one from Quebec where they already experienced codification). The period examined is from each journal's founding date until 1900. Therefore, the examination of the Legal News was from 1886 - 1900, the Canada Law Journal was from 1855 - 1900, and the Canadian Law Times was from 1881 - 1900. It should be noted that the Canada Law Journal was the successor of the Upper Canada Law Journal beginning in 1868. The three newspapers examined for this study representing either the conservative, liberal or radical label were: The Montreal Gazette (conservative), The Toronto Globe (liberal) and The Toronto <b>Mail</b> (radical). The <b>period</b> examined was 1886 - 1893 for the two former newspapers and 1890, 1891 and 1892 for the latter newspaper.

30|$|Although we call MMi {{the actual}} mail month {{indicator}} vector, {{it does not}} indicate the actual mail month for every observation, because a small share of Tickets were never mailed, and an even smaller share were mailed shortly after the rollout window (that is, after the last month represented in MMi). In coding MMi, we had to choose one of the rollout <b>period</b> <b>mail</b> months {{for each of these}} observations in order to keep them in the sample. For each case, we chose a virtual month that is assumed to be consistent with the individual’s actual behavior. For the bulk of such cases—those never mailed a Ticket because of benefit termination prior to their IMM—we used the actual IMM on the assumption that had SSA proceeded to mail their Ticket on their IMMs, their behavior would have been the same as their actual behavior. That seems very likely, because they would have received their Ticket after they could no longer use them, and a large majority were deceased. For the very small share of cases in which the Ticket was mailed {{a few months after the}} rollout ended (0.07 percent for Phase 2 and 0.19 percent for Phase 3, as shown in Table  2), we chose the last rollout month; that is, we coded these late mailing cases as if their Tickets were mailed a few months earlier than they were actually mailed.|$|R
40|$|The black {{economic}} empowerment (BEE) score consists of seven elements, namely ownership, management control, employment equity, skills development, preferential procurement, enterprise development and socio-economic development. The {{purpose of this}} study is to establish whether an association exists between an entity’s BEE elements and its share returns in the short term. Based on prior literature, it appears that the market reacts positively to an announcement of a BEE deal, although the literature also indicates that an entity’s BEE score, which includes all seven elements of the BEE score, bears a negative relationship to its share returns. Therefore the association between the various BEE elements and share returns needs to be investigated. The study uses a multivariate regression analysis that controls for factors influencing share returns. The study includes the BEE element data as obtained from the survey of the top empowerment companies carried out by Empowerdex/Financial <b>Mail</b> for the <b>period</b> 2005 to 2011. The results of this study indicate that a significant positive association exists between the management control element of the BEE score and the entity’s share returns. Furthermore, a significant negative association exists between the ownership and preferential procurement elements of an entity and its share returns. This study contributes to the literature on BEE in the accounting and finance field in South Africa as well as enhances the understanding and effect of BEE compliance through implementation of the generic scorecard as required by the 2007 codes of good practice.
