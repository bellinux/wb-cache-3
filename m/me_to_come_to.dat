25|$|Lynn Townsend was at {{odds with}} the Dodge Dealers and wanted to do {{something}} to please them. So in 1965 he asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his office - for the second time. He noted that one of the Dodge Dealer Council requests was for a Barracuda type vehicle. The overall dealer product recommendation theme was the same - we want what Plymouth has. The specific request for a Mustang type vehicle was not as controversial to Lynn. His direction to me was to give them a specialty car but he said 'for God's sake don't make it a derivative of the Barracuda': i.e. don't make it a Barracuda competitor.|$|E
500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E
500|$|By 2001, Arulpragasam {{designed}} the cover for Elastica's last single [...] "The Bitch Don't Work", {{and went on}} the road with the band to video document their tour. The tour's supporting act, electroclash artist Peaches, introduced Arulpragasam to the Roland MC-505 and encouraged her to make music, a medium in which Arulpragasam lacked confidence. While holidaying together in Bequia in the Caribbean, Arulpragasam began experimenting with Frischmann's MC-505. She adopted her stage name, [...] "M.I.A.", standing for [...] "Missing In Acton" [...] during this time. In her 2012 book Arulpragasam writes, [...] "M.I.A. came to be because of my missing cousin. I wanted to make a film about where he was since he was M.I.A. (Missing in Action) in Sri Lanka. We were the same age, went to the same schools growing up. I was also living in Acton at the time. So I was living in Acton looking for my cousin missing in action." [...] Of her time in Bequia, she told [...] "I started going out to this chicken shed with a sound system. You buy rum through a hatch and dance in the street. They convinced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> church where people sing so amazingly. But I couldn’t clap along to hallelujah. I was out of rhythm. Someone said, ‘What happened to Jesus? I saw you dancing last night and you were totally fine.’ They stopped the service and taught me to clap in time. It was embarrassing". Returning to West London, where she shared an apartment with Frischmann, she began working with a simple set-up (a second-hand 4-track tape machine, the MC-505, and a radio microphone), composing and recording a six-song demo tape that included [...] "Lady Killa", [...] "M.I.A.", and [...] "Galang".|$|E

60|$|The long, intense, soul-trying {{scrutiny}} this brutal wretch had subjected <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a very sudden end. Quick as lightning a long, broad knife flashed {{out from}} its concealment under his poncho, {{and with one}} cat-like bound he was before me, the point of his horrid weapon touching my poncho just over the pit of my stomach.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He has {{forgotten}} his cheroot-case,' said Kim, returning. 'I must {{bring it to}} him this evening. That is all my letter except, thrice over, <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> Now I will pay for a stamp {{and put it in}} the post. He rose to go, and as an afterthought asked: 'Who is that angry-faced Sahib who lost the cheroot-case?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Al Miller, Chairman of the Toledo Forum, asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his office. He {{greeted me}} pleasantly and then said, [...] "As you know, I am {{attorney}} for the Toledo Chamber of Commerce, on a permanent retainer. I am their legal spokesman; they are among my clients. They have directed me to introduce a resolution at the next meeting of the Toledo university trustees, ending your connection with the institution." [...] He waited a moment for this announcement to sink in.|$|E
2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his private office. [...] Wondering {{what he would}} want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I {{want you to tell}} you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
60|$|A week later, I {{think it}} was, Bat Masquerier telephoned to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the Trefoil.|$|E
6000|$|... “He’s {{intensely}} restless,” continued Mrs. Ruck. “That’s {{what made}} <b>me</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a pension. I thought he’d settle down more.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Excuse me if I {{cut this}} {{interview}} short,’ he went on. ‘It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> doomed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> nothing, {{and there is}} more attractive metal.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and that}} gave <b>me</b> courage <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you, {{even after the}} way in which we parted this morning. I knew you would not {{misunderstand}} me"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|MURRAY (trying {{to appear}} casual). Well--three rousing cheers! Stanton told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{his office at}} eleven. That means a final exam--and release! ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Señorito,’ said she, {{and there}} was a rich thrill in her voice, like an organ note, ‘Señorito, you are in difficulties. Suffer <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> your assistance.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do not be alarmed, my prince,' said Peronnik, 'I am just {{on my way}} to Kerglas, as {{the noble}} Rogear has begged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him on business.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me if I {{cut this}} {{interview}} short," [...] he went on. [...] "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> doomed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> nothing, {{and there is}} more attractive metal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--I've come at last. It {{would not}} have done for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up <b>to</b> you when you were in bed. Those women down-stairs would have talked about it everywhere." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{hired by}} Oklahoma State Young {{stated that he}} was torn between having to choose between Miami and OSU. He also {{went on to say}} [...] "It means a lot <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> OSU because I am a graduate, I played there and now we are back as part of the Cowboy family. My wife and I are very excited to get back to Stillwater and Oklahoma State." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{must have}} been very unmerciful to {{despatch}} him so soon. I thought you must want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> your rescue, but those romantic children wouldn't let me.' ...|$|E
60|$|And, by George, I was {{perfectly}} right, don't you know. In {{a day or}} two along came the usual telegram from Florence, telling <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Madison Avenue.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. My uncle, Foster Portney, {{has sent}} for Randy and <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> San Francisco, {{and the three}} {{of us are going to}} some new gold fields." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Bean got <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> see to things. Else I {{was out in}} New Romney, {{where my}} Uncle and Aunt live. But it's a Lark coming back. In a way...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "Didn't {{you send}} me a note a few minutes ago, asking <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out <b>to</b> lunch at a quarter to one and meet you at Lyons'?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{happened}} to meet Bobbie in Piccadilly, {{and he asked}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> dinner at the flat. And, like a fool, instead of bolting and putting myself under police protection, I went.|$|R
6000|$|Next morning I told Umslopogaas of {{the visit}} I had {{received}} from the Induna of the King who wished <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the royal kraal. He nodded and said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, good heavens, {{you talk}} as if I made {{a habit of}} {{blacking}} up! You talk as if you expected <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the altar smothered in burnt cork." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! What's this?" [...] exclaimed Julius, who {{had been}} opening the post- bag. [...] "Here's a note from the Bishop, {{desiring}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the palace to-day, if possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{was within}} {{a mile or so}} of Midbranch," [...] {{continued}} Croft, [...] "I met Mr Brandon, who requested <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his house, and, in fact, to cease my visits altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allie," [...] {{burst out}} Neale, [...] "they {{never told me}} a word about you--never gave me a hint. They sent for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> my job. I could have come a day sooner--the day Campbell found me.... Oh!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grandpapa {{does not}} like moving," [...] said Caroline, as she {{got up to leave}} the room after dinner; [...] "so perhaps, Sir Henry, you will allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down <b>to</b> tea here? We always sit here of an evening." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} twenty minutes later, {{and we were}} {{standing}} together {{at the edge of}} the woods. She wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the house to take breakfast with them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not, my dear. The {{girls can}} go,--if they like it. But {{it will be}} more fitting for papa and <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the church on the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Señorito," [...] said she, {{and there}} was a rich thrill in her voice, like an organ note, [...] "Señorito, you are in difficulties. Suffer <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> your assistance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are lying," [...] {{she said}} quite quietly. [...] "You don't want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down <b>to</b> see a window. It is {{something}} else. I warn you we are Evangelicals. We don't believe in prayers for the dead. 'As the tree falls--'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can scarce persuade {{myself that}} I am not dreaming," [...] Caretto said. [...] "Sometimes, when lying at night, wet {{through with the}} damp air, I have {{wondered}} to myself whether I could ever have lived thus, and whether I should ever exchange my hard bread and water for what seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> fabulous luxuries, though at the time one had taken them {{as a matter of}} course. You cannot tell how strange it feels <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> the old life again." ...|$|R
60|$|Alon. But give <b>me</b> leave <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the point, I beseech you, sir. I {{have lost}} a jewel, which I value infinitely, and I hear it is in your possession: But I accuse your wants, not you, for it.|$|R
