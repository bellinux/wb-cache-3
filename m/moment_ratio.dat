40|$|Ventilatory {{inhomogeneity}} indexes in {{critically ill}} mechanically ventilated patients {{could be of}} importance to optimize ventilator settings {{in order to reduce}} additional lung injury. The present study compared six inhomogeneity indexes calculated from the oxygen washout curves provided by the rapid oxygen sensor of the LUFU end-expiratory lung volume measurement system. Inhomogeneity was tested in a porcine model before and after induction of acute lung injury (ALI) at four different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP; 15, 10, 5 and 0 cm H 2 O). The following indexes were assessed: lung clearance index (LCI), mixing ratio, Becklake index, multiple breath alveolar mixing inefficiency, <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> and pulmonary clearance delay. LCI, mixing ratio, Becklake index and <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> were comparable with previous reported values and showed acceptable variation coefficients at baseline with and without ALI. <b>Moment</b> <b>ratio</b> had the highest precision, as calculated by the variation coefficients. LCI, Becklake index and <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> showed comparable increases in inhomogeneity during decremental PEEP steps before and after ALI. The advantage of the method we introduce is the combined measurement of end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and inhomogeneity of lung ventilation with the LUFU fast-response medical-grade oxygen sensor, without the need for external tracer gases. This can be combined with conventional breathing systems. The <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> and LCI index appeared to be the most favourable for integration with oxygen washout curves as judged by high precision and agreement with previous reported findings.

40|$|BACKGROUND The lung {{clearance}} index (LCI) measured by multiple-breath washout (MBW) {{has been proposed}} as an outcome for clinical trials; however, MBW is time consuming and LCI can be affected by breathing pattern. We aimed to evaluate <b>moment</b> <b>ratios</b> and abbreviated LCI in school-aged children with mild-to-moderate CF lung disease. METHODS Using existing data from three studies we assessed the sensitivity of <b>moment</b> <b>ratios</b> and abbreviated LCIs to (i) detect mild-to-moderate CF lung disease and (ii) detect treatment effects after 4 weeks of hypertonic saline or dornase alfa inhalation. MBW was measured by respiratory mass spectrometry using 4 % "sulphur hexafluoride as a tracer gas. RESULTS Compared to the traditional LCI, <b>moment</b> <b>ratios</b> and abbreviated LCIs were similarly sensitive to detect CF lung disease. <b>Moment</b> <b>ratios</b> consistently demonstrated treatment effects, whereas abbreviated LCIs were less sensitive. CONCLUSIONS Both <b>moment</b> <b>ratios</b> and abbreviated LCI are suitable to differentiate health from disease.

40|$|Abstract: Work-related {{musculoskeletal}} {{injuries are}} {{often associated with}} overexertion of the body at work. The manual materials handling activity of lifting is {{a major source of}} work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Biomechanical evaluation offers useful information about the physical stress imposed on the worker’s body joints; however, biomechanical analysis is usually tedious and complex. For evaluation purpose, the biomechanical method needs to be easy to apply in a field environment. Manual lifting occurs {{as one of the most}} common manual materials handling tasks in the workplace. A biomechanical evaluation method was developed based on the ratio of joint moment to joint capacity. The method was applied to evaluate the physical stress of manual lifting in truck loading jobs using a nine-link whole body joint model. Thirty eight industrial tasks were evaluated using the developed joint <b>moment</b> <b>ratio.</b> The <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> was compared with subjectively rated body discomfort, overall workload, and the NIOSH lifting index. The <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> was found to have a high correlation with the NIOSH lifting index.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} {{that if the}} spirogram is truncated for moment analysis, this {{should be done with}} respect to volume and not time. Errors are incurred when the moments of one spirogram are compared with those of another. These errors are maximal with no truncation and are reduced by truncation. A method is described for deriving sequential truncated moments of the forced expiratory spirogram. The repeatability and discriminatory power of the truncated moments were assessed over five consecutive days in 21 symptom-free subjects and were compared with conventional spirometric tests. The first and second moments about the origin of the spirogram (alpha 1 and alpha 2), the <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> (square root alpha 2 /alpha 1) and the forced expiratory time to truncation (FET) are progressively less repeatable within individuals the later the truncation point. The discriminatory power of alpha 1 and alpha 2 and FET declines with later truncation but the discriminatory power of the <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> is maximal with truncation at 85 % forced vital capacity (FVC) an diminishes sharply if truncation is beyond 95 % FVC. At 75 % FVC truncation alpha 1 is as good as FEV 1 % in discriminating between our subjects, whereas alpha 1 at 100 % FVC is only half as good as FEV 1 %. The <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> at 90 % FVC truncation is highly reproducible (mean within person coefficient of variation 2. 1 %), has important discriminatory power and is little influenced by events early in the spirogram (correlation with FEV 1 % r = - 0. 61, p less than 0. 001). The <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> at 90 % of FVC has attributes which may be useful in detecting early airway obstruction and its further study is warranted in order to establish its normal range and predictive value...|$|E

30|$|To {{identify}} a potential distribution {{to consider when}} modeling a dataset, sample standardized moments can be calculated and plotted as points in either (I) and/or (II) – thus, probability distributions that are “close” to the point estimates {{can be considered as}} candidates for probability models. A recent article by Vargo et al. (2010) revisited the <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> diagrams and presented comprehensive graphs of (I) and (II) above for over 30 commonly used univariate distributions. Limiting relationships between several well-known families (e.g., t and chi-square) were also considered. In addition, to identify potential distributions to model a dataset, the authors presented a novel application of bootstrapping. Therein, bootstrap samples are generated and the sample estimates of CV, skewness, and kurtosis (represented as γ̂_ 2, γ̂_ 3 and γ̂_ 4, respectively) are calculated in order to generate the “concentration ellipse” to graph on the <b>moment</b> <b>ratio</b> diagrams. In this way, distributions that are close to the concentration ellipse should be considered as candidates. Since point estimates of higher moments can be highly variable, this bootstrap approach includes the sampling error.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{was to examine the}} critical vortex-induced vibration (VIV) point for cylinders in a rotational system. For translational systems, the existence of a critical mass ratio for cylinders undergoing vortex-induced vibration has been well established.

The approach adopted in the present investigation involved measuring the VIV response of a positively buoyant pivoted cylinder being towed at very high reduced velocity. High reduced velocity was attained by establishing a very low system natural frequency. The key finding of this study is the presence of a critical point with a value {{similar to that of the}} critical mass ratio in translational systems.
