The size and shape of the dies in the extruder through which the pasta is pushed determine the shape that results. The pasta is then dried at a high temperature.|$|E

5000|$|Ivory's first slogan, [...] "It Floats!", was {{introduced}} in 1891. The product's other well-known slogan, [...] "% Pure" [...] (in use by 1895), {{was based on the}} results of an analysis by an independent laboratory the other founder's son, Harley Procter, hired to demonstrate that Ivory was purer than the castile soap then available.Ivory bar soap is whipped with air in its production and floats in water. According to an apocryphal story, later discounted by the company, a worker accidentally left the <b>mixing</b> <b>machine</b> on too long and the company chose to sell the [...] "ruined" [...] batch, because the added air did not change the basic ingredients of the soap. When appreciative letters about the new, floating soap inundated the company, P&G ordered the extended mix time as a standard procedure. However, company records indicate that the design of Ivory did not come about by accident. In 2004, over 100 years later, the P&G company archivist Ed Rider found documentation that revealed that chemist James N. Gamble, son of the founder, had discovered how to make the soap float and noted the result in his writings.|$|E

50|$|Excited by {{his newfound}} {{freedom and the}} {{commission}} from the Countess, Schani visits Resi at her father’s bakery to tell her his news. Resi initially berates Schani and informs him that, {{if he wants to}} marry her, he will have to give up music and take over the bakery. However, when she reads the Countess’s lyrics, she is drawn into the music, singing the opening of The Blue Danube waltz to Schani. Their moment of composition is interrupted when Resi’s father arrives to give Schani a tour of the bakery. As Schani and Ebezeder walk into the basement, a memorable and unusual scene of musical composition begins. While Schani looks around, the tune that Resi sang begins to evolve. Two men throwing bread back and forth inspire the second phrase of the melody; a man tossing croissants into a box creates the offbeat rhythm of the waltz. The rhythm of the dough <b>mixing</b> <b>machine</b> provides Schani with the second main theme of the first waltz. As he tells the begrudging Leopold to go faster, this second theme turns into the beginning of the second large section of piece, at which point Schani runs upstairs, exclaiming to Resi that he has finished the composition. He then rushes off to tell the Countess that he has composed the perfect waltz to accompany her verses.|$|E

This plaster mold looked like hollow cone (12.0  cm height, inner diameter 15.6  cm at top and 9.6  cm at bottom). The clay slurry was poured into the plaster mold until about half of its volume. The plaster mold of the clay slurry was set under the arm of jigger machine. As the clay slurry came into contact with the vertically rotating head piece, it was pressed and spread until it finally became the shape of plaster mold.|$|E
