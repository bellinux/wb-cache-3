5|$|Following their {{relocation}} to London in 1985, <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Bloody Valentine {{lost contact}} with each other while looking for accommodation and Tina Durkin, not confident in her abilities as a keyboard player, left the band. When the remaining four members regained contact with one another, the band decided to audition bassists, as they lacked a regular bassist since their formation. Shields acquired Debbie Googe's telephone number from a contact in London, invited her to audition and subsequently recruited her as a bassist. Googe managed to attend rehearsals, which were centred around her day job. Rehearsal sessions were regularly held at Salem Studios, which was connected to the independent record label Fever Records. The label's management were impressed with the band and agreed to release an extended play, provided the band would finance the recording sessions themselves. Released in December 1985, Geek! failed to reach the band's expectations; however, soon after its release, My Bloody Valentine were performing on the London gig circuit, alongside bands such as Eight Living Lags, Kill Ugly Pop and The Stingrays.|$|E
25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
25|$|The Black Parade World Tour {{commenced}} on February 22, 2007, {{with the}} eventuating 133 shows featuring Rise Against, Thursday and Muse as support acts. Reggie and the Full Effect frontman James Dewees joined the band to play keyboards and synthesizer from there on. In April 2007, {{it was announced}} that Mikey Way would temporarily leave the tour to spend time with his new wife, Alicia Simmons-Way. Way's temporary replacement was Matt Cortez, a friend of the band. During the third leg of the tour, as a support act for Muse, <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Chemical Romance and their crew, along with members of Muse's crew, suffered food poisoning, and consequently had to cancel six shows. The band later featured on Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution tour in 2007, along with Placebo, Mindless Self Indulgence, Saosin, Taking Back Sunday and HIM.|$|E

500|$|Both Dozier and Yuricon {{president}} Erica Friedman {{wrote about}} the sexual nature of Honey, including the lesbian desire of the Jewel Princess (one of Honey's enemies) {{for her in the}} second episode. Friedman—who had looked for such [...] "implied yuri" [...] in Cutie Honey manga—called the Princess's appearance [...] "*just* what I was hoping for", and praised Honey's change to her S Queen form in response. Ross said about the series: [...] "It's seemingly exploitative, it's incredibly sexist, and the female <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> household - you'd expect them to be indignant, but, no, they were laughing their butts off because it was so blatant, and yet Honey was actually never objectified in the whole series." [...] He further writes, [...] "Honey Kisaragi is an extremely strong character who is no damsel in distress. If anyone needs help in this series, it's the guys!" [...] Toole said that Jessica Calvello [...] "gives the character a growling, tough-girl charm that was conspicuously absent from the original version", while Dozier said that Calvello captured [...] "the combination of innocence and bravado [...] that is both so confusing and yet so appropriate". Beveridge said the [...] "fight sequences are pretty well done and provide some fun moments watching Honey battle the various demonic forms", but concluded that Honey main goal is to showcase the lead heroine's changes: [...] "Oh, lets face it. it's all about the half to completely naked transformation sequences. They're grrreat!" ...|$|E

2500|$|During filming, {{fourteen}} different {{horses were}} used as the main horse character Joey, eight of them portraying him as an adult animal, four as a colt and two as foals; four horses played the other main equine character, Topthorn. Up to 280 horses were used in a single scene. A farrier was on set to replace horseshoes sucked off in the mud during filming, and the horses playing the main horse characters had a specialist equine make-up team, with their coats dyed and markings added to ensure continuity. Equine artist Ali Bannister {{was responsible for the}} 'hair and make-up' of the horses, as well as drawing the sketches of horses that are featured in the film. Extra filming involving a bay foal took place in California in March 2011. Working with horses on this scale was a new experience for Spielberg, who commented: [...] "The horses were an extraordinary experience for me, because several <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> family ride.

Darwin declined, writing that [...] "though I am a strong advocate for free thought on all subjects, yet it appears to me (whether rightly or wrongly) that direct arguments against Christianity & theism produce hardly any effect on the public; & freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follows from the advance of science.

2500|$|After {{spending}} {{the better part}} of 1972 touring with Teegarden & Van Winkle, Seger left the duo to put together a new backing band, referred to as both My Band and the Borneo Band, made up of musicians from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Jamie Oldaker, Dick Sims, and Marcy Levy were all <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Band before joining Eric Clapton's backing band. In 1973, Seger put out Back in '72, recorded partly with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, a renowned group of session musicians who had recorded with the likes of J. J. Cale and Aretha Franklin. [...] According to Seger, there was a financial misunderstanding with the musicians: they offered to record him [...] "for $1500 a side", which he took to mean $1500 per album side. [...] When he found out that they meant $1500 per song, he left after recording three songs but resolved to work with them in the future. [...] Back in '72 featured the studio version of Seger's later live classic [...] "Turn the Page"; [...] "Rosalie", a song Seger wrote about CKLW music director Rosalie Trombley (and which was later recorded by Thin Lizzy); and [...] "I've Been Working", a song originally by Van Morrison, a strong influence on Seger's musical development.

Over the tour, My Band would prove to be unreliable, which frustrated Seger. By the end of 1973, Seger had left My Band in search of a new backing band.
