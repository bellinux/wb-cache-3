SAS Rapid Predictive <b>Modeler</b> (RPM), which creates basic analytical models using Microsoft Excel, was introduced that same year. JMP 9 in 2010 added a new interface for using the R programming language from JMP and an add-in for Excel. The following year, a High Performance Computing appliance was made available in a partnership with Teradata and EMC Greenplum. In 2011, the company released Enterprise Miner 7.1. The company introduced 27 data management products from October 2013 to October 2014 and updates to 160 others.

GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as {{the best choice for}} writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go. Python is also used in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance. Python can also be implemented in APIs of online brokerages that run on other languages by using wrappers.|$|E
5|$|Under the synthesis, debates {{have become}} less ideological and more methodological. Business cycle modelers {{can be broken}} into two camps: those in favor of {{calibration}} and those in favor of estimation. When models are calibrated, the <b>modeler</b> selects parameter values based on other studies or casual empirical observation. Instead of using statistical diagnostics to evaluate models, the model's operating characteristics determine {{the quality of the}} model. Kydland and Prescott (1982) offered no formal evaluation of their model, but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements of the model did. When estimation methods are used, models are evaluated based on standard statistical goodness of fit criteria. Calibration is generally associated with real business cycle modelers of the new classical school, but methodological differences cut across ideology. While Lucas, Prescott, and Kydland are calibration advocates, another prominent new classical, Sargent, favors estimation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: System Dynamics needs a tool, {{which allows}} <b>modelers</b> to create Interactive Learning Environments that help <b>modelers</b> share the {{knowledge}} that they have learned by model building, with users who only use their models. To do this they need tools {{that allow them to}} better represent the relationships between model structure and model behavior. I have been creating a software tool called Open Dialect, which allows <b>modelers</b> to create ILEs for the web that incorporate new model structure visualization techniques. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce you to Open Dialect, and to show you that Open Dialect will allow <b>modelers</b> to create effective, intuitive, modern, aesthetically pleasing, online single user ILEs that will most importantly help the close the gap in knowledge gained through model building (the <b>modelers)</b> versus just model using (the users) ...|$|R
40|$|Ethics are {{involved}} in a model's purposes (for example, the purpose might be to increase a heroin dealer's profits). These purposes imply consideration of the various stakeholders (<b>modelers,</b> users, public) and their values. Ethics also concern professional standards of conduct for the <b>modelers.</b> These standards require that the <b>modelers</b> validate the model assumptions. Hence, <b>modelers</b> should provide model documentation. Validation, however, is virtually impossible when the model represents unique events, such as nuclear accidents; credibility is then the maximum attainable. Anyhow, <b>modelers</b> should try to develop `robust' models; that is, models that are not very sensitive to their assumptions. This article pays special attention to the use of models in crime, war, and nuclear applications, which might be controversial applications indeed. It also discusses freedom of science.

Minerals with a saturation index (log Q/K) equal to zero {{are said to be}} in equilibrium with the fluid. Those with positive saturation indices are termed supersaturated, indicating they are favored to precipitate from solution. A mineral is undersaturated if its saturation index is negative, indicating that it is favored to dissolve.|$|E

25|$|A {{principal}} {{benefit of}} modeling {{is the ability}} to explicitly compare models: Rather than simply returning a value for each component, the <b>modeler</b> can compute confidence intervals on parameters, but, crucially, can drop and add paths and test the effect via statistics such as the AIC. Thus, for instance to test for predicted effects of family or shared environment on behavior, an AE model can be objectively compared to a full ACE model. For example, we can ask of the figure above for height: Can C (shared environment) be dropped without significant loss of fit? Alternatively, confidence intervals can be calculated for each path.|$|E

25|$|During the Great Depression, Prestini was {{sometimes}} laid off by Washington Brick & Lime {{for several months}} at a time. For {{a couple of years}} he drifted and worked odd jobs in Chicago, San Francisco, Mexico, Hawaii, and various other places. Although he had long been sculpting original terra cotta art pieces, he didn't begin painting seriously until his return to Clayton in 1936. He was likely inspired in part by Charles Sater, a fellow terra cotta <b>modeler</b> who did religious-themed oil paintings. Prestini's early work was in the Regionalist style popular at the time, but had a strange, dark cast, reflecting his deep forebodings over the growth of mechanization and the rise of fascism in Europe. In 1940 a series of paintings he called the Pages of History was briefly displayed in the windows of a downtown Spokane stationery store before public complaints over their grim content led to their removal. These same works were better received when he took them to Los Angeles, earning a laudatory article in the Sunday Los Angeles Times.|$|E

500|$|Former flight {{instructor}} Peter James, {{who had worked}} on Flight Unlimited II, {{assumed the role of}} lead designer. He was largely responsible for Flight Unlimited IIIs lessons, planes and simulated flight instruments. James believed that other flight simulators had holes with regard to realism, and he hoped to create a more accurate experience. Photographs were captured of each plane's real-world counterpart, and construction of the 3D plane models was led by artist Duncan Hsu, a former car <b>modeler</b> at Papyrus Design Group. The flight physics were coded by Kevin Wasserman and involve real-time calculations of force vectors, such as those acting against a plane's yaw, pitch and roll. This system was more advanced than that of Flight Unlimited II, which was also based on force calculations. The physics code was informed by [...] "real aircraft data" [...] and the personal experience of pilots, and each of the planes was flown as research for the game. Because the plane cockpits of previous Flight Unlimited games had been criticized by pilots, the team tried to make Flight Unlimited IIIs cockpits extremely authentic.
