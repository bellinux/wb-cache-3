Investor sentiment is modeled using a generalized average operator, which has been proposed in the fuzzy literature as an index of optimism.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} some participants in mature and emerging capital <b>markets</b> engage in <b>feedback</b> trading. The analysis {{is based on the}} Shiller-Sentana-Wadhwani noise trader model. It has the attractive property that it yields testable implications about the presence of positive and negative feedback traders in stock markets. This theoretical framework, together with an asymmetric GARCH-type model, allows us to draw conclusions about whether differences exist between mature and emerging capital markets in terms of the degree of feedback trading. The empirical results show that positive and negative feedback trading strategies exist in both types of markets but are more pronounced in emerging stock markets than in their mature counterparts. Hence, non-fundamental trading strategies seems to play a more important role in emerging relative to mature stock <b>markets.</b> <b>feedback</b> trading; return autocorrelation; emerging capital markets in central and eastern european contries; asymmetric GARCH models...|$|R

Special attention {{is given to}} examination of Asian stock returns and the impact on them of the past information. By employing a class of asymmetric specification of conditional mean and conditional variance models, we find the autocorrelation coefficient to be negative for the Japanese market and positive {{for the rest of}} the Asian markets studied. Our findings suggest that the Asian markets respond sensitively to the US market, especially on the down side. The asymmetric effects are found to be present in both mean and variance equations.

50|$|Customer to Customer {{marketing}} {{has become}} very popular in the recent years. Customers can directly contact sellers and eliminate the middle man. Moreover, anyone can now sell and advertise a product in the convenience of one's home - enabling one to easily start a business. Therefore, {{a wide variety of}} products can often be found on auction sites such as eBay, including second-hand goods. Since majority of these sales occur over the internet, sellers can reach both national and international customers and greatly increase their <b>market.</b> <b>Feedback</b> on the purchased product is often requested to aid both the seller and potential customers. The actual buying and searching process is simplified and search costs, distribution costs, and inventory costs are all reduced. Moreover, the transactions occur at a swift rate with the use of online payment systems such as PayPal.|$|E
50|$|A recent, general {{example of}} a {{knowledge}} spillover could be the collective growth associated with {{the research and development}} of online social networking tools like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Such tools have not only created a positive feedback loop, and a host of originally unintended benefits for their users, but have also created an explosion of new software, programming platforms, and conceptual breakthroughs that have perpetuated the development of the industry as a whole. The advent of online marketplaces, the utilization of user profiles, the widespread democratization of information, and the interconnectivity between tools within the industry have all been products of each tool’s individual developments. These developments have since spread outside the industry into the mainstream media as news and entertainment firms have developed their own <b>market</b> <b>feedback</b> applications within the tools themselves, and their own versions of online networking tools (e.g. CNN’s iReport).|$|E

40|$|In {{e-commerce}} systems, customer reviews {{are important}} in-formation for understanding <b>market</b> <b>feedbacks</b> on certain commodities. However, accurate analyzing reviews is chal-lenging {{due to the}} complexity of natural language process-ing and informal descriptions in reviews. Existing methods mainly focus on studying efficient algorithms that cannot guarantee the accuracy for review analysis. Crowdsourcing can improve the accuracy of review analysis while it is sub-ject to extra costs and low response time. In this work, we combine machine learning and crowdsourcing together for better understanding customer reviews. First, we collectively use multiple machine learning algorithms to pre-process re-view classification. Second, we select the reviews on which all machine learning algorithms cannot agree and assign them to humans to process. Third, the results from machine learn-ing and crowdsourcing are aggregated to be the final analysis results. Finally, we perform real experiments with practical review data to confirm the effectiveness of our method...|$|R

Furthermore, the CSI 300 stock index futures <b>market</b> attracts positive <b>feedback</b> trading in itself and this may destabilize asset prices of the underlying spot index through the index arbitrage process...|$|R

5|$|The port was {{released}} on September 17, 2009. It was later re-released as part of Sony's budget series release on August 2, 2012. Speaking in January 2010, Namco Bandai announced {{that they had no}} plans to release the port overseas. Later that year, Yuri's English voice actor Troy Baker said that he had been recording new English dialogue for the PS3 port. A report from a Namco Bandai employee sparked speculation that the reason behind the lack of a localization was due to a deal with Microsoft to keep the game as an Xbox 360 exclusive in western territories. Later, she retracted this statement, apologizing for creating false impressions. Series producer Hideo Baba later said that the main factor in this decision was the strain put on the team with the simultaneous release of the original, meaning a Japan-exclusive release was chosen to lessen the burden. This also coincided with poor <b>marketing</b> <b>feedback</b> for the series in western territories.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} Monte Carlo implementation of non-linear FBSDEs {{as a system}} of interacting particles inspired by the ideas of branching diffusion method. It will be particularly useful to investigate large and complex systems, and hence {{it is a good}} complement of our previous work presenting an analytical perturbation procedure for generic non-linear FBSDEs. There appear multiple species of particles, where the first one follows the diffusion of the original underlying state, and the others the Malliavin derivatives with a grading structure. The number of branching points are capped by the order of perturbation, which is expected to make the scheme less numerically intensive. The proposed method can be applied to semi-linear problems, such as American and Bermudan options, Credit Value Adjustment (CVA), and even fully non-linear issues, such as the optimal portfolio problems in incomplete and/or constrained <b>markets,</b> <b>feedbacks</b> from large investors, and also the analysis of various risk measures.
