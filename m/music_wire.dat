50|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Chickering's company had built over 12,000 pianos and was {{producing}} about 1,500 a year worth $200,000, almost twice the sales of Timothy Gilbert, his largest competitor in Boston. His pianos at the London International Exhibition of 1851 earned a gold medal with special mention for the grand, which was noted for brilliancy and power as well as its great solidity. Chickering patented single piece iron frames combined with wrest plank bridges and damper guides in square pianos, and with massive wrest plank terminations in grands; Chickering & Mackays were assignees of an action patented by Alpheus Babcock, and licensed actions patented by Edwin Brown and George Howe. Chickering pioneered pronounced curved hammer strike lines in squares which permitted larger hammers, and is also credited encouraging Ichabod Washburn to develop the first <b>music</b> <b>wire</b> produced in the United States.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that treating <b>music</b> <b>wire</b> (high carbon steel wire) by cooling to cryogenic temperatures can enhance its mechanical properties with particular reference to those properties important for musical performance. We use such wire for suspending many of the optics in Advanced LIGO, the upgrade to LIGO - the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory. Two properties that particularly interest us are mechanical loss and breaking strength. A decrease in mechanical loss would directly reduce the thermal noise associated with the suspension, thus enhancing the noise performance of mirror suspensions within the detector. An increase in strength could allow thinner wire to be safely used, which would enhance the dilution factor of the suspension, again leading to lower suspension thermal noise. In this article we describe the results of an investigation into some of the mechanical properties of <b>music</b> <b>wire,</b> comparing untreated wire with the same wire which has been cryogenically treated. For the samples we studied we conclude that there is {{no significant difference in the}} properties of interest for application in gravitational wave detectors...|$|E

This report discusses {{two aspects of}} research on bulk metallic glasses. The first {{is an effort to}} increase their toughness by combining them with reinforcement to form a composite. The second is the first direct measurement of plane strain fracture toughness of bulk metallic glass. Particulate and continuous fiber reinforced composite materials were fabricated using bulk metallic glass as the matrix. The particulate composites combined W, WC, SiC and Ta reinforcements in a matrix with the composition Zr 57 Nb 5 Al 10 Cu 15. 4 Ni 12. 6. Continuous fiber composites were fabricated using W and 1080 carbon steel (<b>music)</b> <b>wire</b> reinforcement in a Zr 41. 25 Ti 13. 75 Cu 12. 5 Ni 10 Be 22. 5 matrix. In both cases the metallic glass remained amorphous during processing. Compressive strain to failure was greatly enhanced in both particulate and continuous fiber composites by the formation of multiple shear bands. Tungsten reinforcement provided the greatest improvement. The tungsten is wet well by the metallic glass, and forms a strong interface. Both particulate and fiber reinforced composite showed improved tensile properties. Energy (per unit volume) to break increased 52 % for 5 % Vf, 150 [ [...] . ] W reinforced Zr 57 Nb 5 Al 10 Cu 15. 4 Ni 12. 6 and 18 % for 60 % Vf <b>music</b> <b>wire</b> reinforced Zr 41. 25 Ti 13. 75 Cu 12. 5 Ni 10 Be 22. 5. Tightly bonded ductile particles and weakly bonded continuous fibers proved best for enhancing the tensile properties of bulk metallic glass. Fracture toughness of the unreinforced Zr 41. 25 Ti 13. 75 Cu 12. 5 Ni 10 Be 22. 5 bulk metallic glass was determined using 3 -point bend measurements and coherent gradient sensing (CGS). The measured fracture toughness is nominally 55 [ [...] . ]. Once initiated, cracks in the unreinforced metallic glass propagated in an unstable manner. Continuous fiber reinforcement was demonstrated to arrest crack propagation in 3 -point bend fracture tests of bulk metallic glass matrix composites...|$|E

40|$|A RANCOR drill was {{designed}} to fit a Mars Exploration Rover (MER) class vehicle. The low mass of 3 kg was achieved by using the same actuator for three functions: rotation, percussions, and core break-off. Initial testing of the drill exposed an unexpected behavior of an off-the-shelf sprag clutch used to couple and decouple rotary-percussive function from the core break off function. Failure of the sprag {{was due to the}} vibration induced during percussive drilling. The sprag clutch would back drive in conditions where it was expected to hold position. Although this did not affect the performance of the drill, it nevertheless reduced the quality of the cores produced. Ultimately, the sprag clutch was replaced with a custom ratchet system that allowed for some angular displacement without advancing in either direction. Replacing the sprag with the ratchet improved the collected core quality. Also, premature failure of a 300 -series stainless steel percussion spring was observed. The 300 -series percussion spring was ultimately replaced with a <b>music</b> <b>wire</b> spring based on performances of previously designed rotary-percussive drill systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{elaborate}} design optimization technique of coil spring sets with genetic algorithm. Attention is focused on reducing the weight and stresses keeping into considerations the various critical points. The spring is designed to operate with tension load, so the spring stretches as the load is applied to it. The aim of the present work is to design the extension spring for various material like steel, stainless steel, <b>music</b> <b>wire</b> (High carbon steel), oil Tempered (High carbon steel) for same loading condition, since each material has different compositions and properties. Optimization of spring helps in selecting most appropriate and cost effective material for spring. On applying the GA, the optimum parameter of spring have been obtained, which contribute towards achieving the minimum weight. A reduction of 7 % weight is achieved when stainless steel spring is replaced with other spring stated here, under identical condition of design parameters and optimization. Paper also discuss about the application and problem formulation using genetic algorithm {{which is one of}} nontraditional methods...|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Gravitational wave detectors capable of detecting broadband gravitational wave bursts with a strain amplitude sensitivity near [ [...] . ] at frequencies around 100 Hz are currently under construction by the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) and VIRGO groups. One challenge facing these groups {{is how to}} detect {{the motion of the}} center of an inertial mass to a precision of [ [...] . ] m when the mass consists of atoms each of which individually moves much more than that due to thermal energy. The uncertainty in the interferometer's measurement due to these thermal motions is called thermal noise. This thesis describes the thermal noise of the initial LIGO detectors. The thermal noise was analyzed by modelling the normal modes of the test mass suspension system as harmonic oscillators with dissipation and applying the fluctuation dissipation theorem. The dissipation of all modes which contribute significant thermal noise to the interferometer was measured and from these measurements the total thermal noise was estimated. The frequency dependence of the dissipation of the pendulum mode was characterized from measurements of the violin modes. A steel <b>music</b> <b>wire</b> suspension system was found to meet the goals of the initial LIGO detectors. A mathematical technique was developed which relates the energy in each vibrational mode to the motion of the mirror surface measured by the interferometer. Modes with acoustic wavelengths greater than the laser beam spot size can contribute significant thermal noise to the interferometer measurements. The dissipation of the test masses of LIGO's 40 -m interferometer at Caltech was investigated, and a technique for suspending and controlling the test masses which lowered the dissipation and met the thermal noise goals of the initial LIGO detector was developed. New test masses were installed in the 40 -m interferometer resulting in improved noise performance. The implications of thermal noise to detecting gravitational waves from inspiralling compact binaries was investigated. An optimal pendulum length for detecting these signals was found. It was shown that the narrow band thermally excited violin resonances could be efficiently filtered from the broadband gravitational wave signal...|$|E
