The Weibull analysis is restricted to infinitesimal volume elements in consequence of the differential calculus applied. It was found that infinitesimally small elements are {{in conflict with the}} basic statistical assumption and that the differential calculus is not needed in fact since nowadays most of the stress analyses are based on finite element calculations, and these are most suitable for a subsequent statistical analysis of strength. The size of a finite statistical cell has been introduced as the third material parameter. It should represent the minimum volume containing all statistical features of the material such as distribution of pores, flaws and grains.

5000|$|Two {{important}} effects {{necessary to}} understand the true stress are the effects of strain rate susceptibility and strain rate hardening upon the true stress. Time is often neglected in the initial stress-strain curve relations, but at higher strain rates, higher stresses will occur according to the relationship σT=kἕTm where m is the strain rate susceptibility. To account for the resistance to necking, the relationship σT=kεTn must also be considered, where n is the strain hardening coefficient and is typically between 0.02 and 0.50, depending upon the material. By combining these two relationships, a relationship of σT=kεTnἕTm can be found. However, as real stresses and strains do not occur uniaxially, considerations for <b>multiaxial</b> <b>stresses</b> must be added to this relationship to model real stresses.|$|R

40|$|International audienceMaterials and {{structures}} exhibiting coupled behaviors between mechanics and other physics (especially magnetics, electrics and thermics – phase transformation –) and submitted to <b>multiaxial</b> <b>stress</b> are considered. The most practical applications concern sensors and actuators. The <b>multiaxial</b> <b>stress</b> is usually inherited from forming process or appears in use. In {{the area of}} coupling between mechanics and magnetics, one can mention: inertial stresses in high rotating speed systems or new technologies of flywheel, stresses due to binding process (encapsulation), residual stress associated to plastic straining (forming) or cutting process. On the other hand, since the works of Mateucci and Villari, mechanical stress is known to change significantly the magnetic behavior of materials {{as well as their}} magnetostrictive behavior. The design of electromagnetic systems consequently requires coupled models taking account of <b>multiaxial</b> <b>stress.</b> One way is to use energy-based models written at an appropriate scale. Indeed the development of fully multiaxial magneto-elastic models following micromagnetics is a promising issue, but still leads to dissuasive computation times for engineering design applications. The few available and practically implemented models describing the effect of stress on the magnetic behavior are restricted to uniaxial (tensile or compressive) stress. Jiles–Atherton type models [8 – 9] and Preisach type models are the most popular. Indeed the relevant way seems to implement <b>multiaxial</b> <b>stress</b> directly in a uniaxial model. This way supposes to define and calculate a “fictive” uniaxial stress, the equivalent stress that would change the magnetic behavior in a similar manner than the multiaxial one. Such equivalent stress has been proposed recently. It is based on equivalence in magnetization and uses an analytical discretization of bulk in so-called magnetic domains. The free energy of each domain is written allowing calculate their volume fraction thanks to a stochastic approach (calculation thanks to Boltzmann function). Macroscopic magnetization is the average magnetization over the volume. Since an equilibrium of phases is involved, the approach proposed for magneto-elastic coupling can be extended to ferroelectric media, and other couplings where a form of phase transformation occurs. Application to the modeling of thermo-mechanical behavior of shape memory alloys is finally made. The talk will be illustrated by experimental results carried out on magnetic materials and shape memory alloys submitted to uniaxial and multiaxial stresses...|$|E
