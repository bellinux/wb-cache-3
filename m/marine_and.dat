5|$|Mysids have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution and {{are found in}} both <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> freshwater environments, the deep sea, estuaries, shallow coastal waters, lakes, rivers and underground waters. They are primarily <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> fewer than ten percent are found in freshwater.

These non-marine mysids occur in four distinct types of habitats; some are estuarine species; some were isolated in the Ponto-Caspian Basin where Paramysis has since radiated enormously (23 species); some are glacial relicts and some are subterranean Tethyan relicts.|$|E
