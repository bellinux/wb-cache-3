5000|$|Most Koreans tend {{to regard}} dating as a {{precursor}} to marriage. According to a survey conducted by Gyeonggi-do Family Women’s Researcher on people of age 26-44, 85.7% of respondents replied as ‘willing to get married’. There is no dating agency but the market for marriage agencies are growing continuously. DUO and Gayeon {{are one of the}} major marriage agencies in Korea. Also, [...] "Mat-sun", the blind date which is usually based on the premise of marriage, is held often among ages of late 20s to 30s. But the late trend is leaning towards the separation between dating and marriage unlike the conservative ways of the past. In the survey conducted by a <b>marriage</b> <b>agency,</b> of 300 single males and females who were asked of their opinions on marrying their lovers, about only 42% of the males and 39% of the females said yes.

50|$|Vietnamese {{migration}} to South Korea began later, but quickly grew {{to a much}} larger scale; their population consists mainly of migrant workers and women introduced to local husbands through <b>marriage</b> <b>agencies.</b> In 1994, 20,493 labour migrants went from Vietnam to South Korea on traineeship visas; by 1997, this had risen by about 10% to 22,325. Migrants were mostly male and unskilled; they were employed in {{small and medium-sized companies}} in labour-intensive industries such as fishing and manufacturing. Spousal migration has a somewhat longer history; during the Vietnam War, some of the more than 300,000 South Korean soldiers and civilian support staff stationed in Vietnam married Vietnamese women and brought them back to Korea; however, many of these marriages ended in divorce. Spousal migration would not become a large-scale phenomenon until the 1990s, when South Korean men, who outnumber South Korean women by about 8%, began to turn to <b>marriage</b> <b>agencies</b> to seek brides in overseas countries, including Vietnam. As of 2006, 5,000 Vietnamese brides immigrate to South Korea every year. Korean men married to Vietnamese women typically meet on marriage tours, which are sometimes subsidized by rural governments keen on increasing birthrates in the Korean countryside.|$|R

As of 2006, as many as 3,000 Vietnamese brides left with new South Korean husbands every year.|$|R

5000|$|An {{international}} <b>marriage</b> <b>agency</b> (also {{called an}} international introduction agency or international marriage broker) {{is a business}} that endeavors to introduce {{men and women of}} different countries for the purpose of marriage, dating, or correspondence. Many of these marriage agencies are based near women in developing countries (such as Ukraine, Russia, Colombia, Brazil, China, Thailand, and the Philippines). International marriage agencies encourage women to register for their services, and facilitate communication and meetings with men from developed regions of North America, Western Europe, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. This network of smaller international marriage agencies is often affiliated with web-based international dating sites that are able to market their services on a larger scale, in compliance with regulations such as the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act. Experian, a market research firm, reports that the top 10 international dating sites attracted 12 million visitors in March 2013, up 29% from March 2012. One of the biggest international dating sites, based on the market share, is AnastasiaDate. International dating sites provide a wide variety of online communication, including instant messaging, email letters, webchat, phone translation, virtual gifts, live games, and mobile-based chat. International marriage agencies are frequently referred to as [...] "mail-order bride" [...] agencies. However, many consider the term [...] "mail-order bride" [...] derogatory and feel it demeans foreign women by comparing them to commodities for sale and by falsely implying that (unlike local women), they exercise no judgment over the men they meet and would marry anyone from a relatively wealthy country.|$|E

Taking the information at face value, the article compares single women seeking partners to women featured in a 'Success Stories' section. The study finds that although most of the self-reported information is not significantly different across the two groups, women from major cities (which are the locations of 'romance tours') {{are twice as likely to}} be successful. Surprisingly, standard factors valued in marriage markets do not matter.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the {{factors associated with}} success in a special marriage market. This marriage market is generated by a <b>marriage</b> <b>agency</b> that arranges meetings between women from the former Soviet Union and men from the United States, Canada and Western Europe. It is the modern version of the mail order bride industry that has successfully migrated to the Internet. Russian women seek partners by providing profiles of themselves on a website. We define success to be finding a suitable match culminating in engagement or marriage. We analyze data on profiles of two groups of Russian women. One group consists of a sample of single women who seek partners, {{and the second is}} a sample of women who have successfully found a partner via this method. By comparing these profiles, we are able to identify the factors associated with success in this marriage market. We find that although most of the self-reported information is not significantly different across the two groups, women who report lower weight, speak good English and come from Moscow or St. Petersburg are more likely to find a partner than women who do not. The non-significant findings are interesting as well, as they reveal that age, previous marital status and the presence of children do not matter. ...|$|E
40|$|Japan is {{increasingly}} characterised by late {{age at marriage}} and rising rates of singlehood. Women’s growing educational attainment and labour market participation are often argued {{to be the key}} reasons behind these trends. In particular, it is frequently assumed that the dominant gender norms which prescribe that women must shoulder most of the burden of domestic work and childcare are a greater barrier to marriage for women with higher earning potential. A number of existing studies analyse the effects of education and earning power on women’s marriage probability. These give us insights into actual marriage trends, but tell us little about the beliefs and attitudes behind these outcomes. This paper will look at the matter from a different angle. I will analyse the ways women with different levels of earning power advertise themselves in the marriage market. Such an analysis will offer a view into women’s beliefs about the characteristics of a desirable wife and how and to which extent working women are willing to balance their employment responsibilities against the expectations of a good wife. To do this I will analyse personal messages female Japanese <b>marriage</b> <b>agency</b> customers use to advertise their most appealing characteristics to potential marriage partners. The messages come from a 2008 customer database of one of the largest Japanese marriage agencies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the replacement of}} the traditional laboratory premarital screening in Saudi Arabia and other countries that follow the Islamic laws "Healthy Marriage Program" with Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). CDSS uses the couple's electronic health records to determine if the match is harmonious. The traditional premarital screening consist of couples undergoing a screening process for Sexual Transmitted Infections (STI) and genetic blood disorders prior to becoming engaged or getting married. The traditional screening practice faces many challenges, such as being culturally unaccepted, time consuming, and unorganized. The CDSS would eliminate the challenges of the traditional process by giving <b>marriage</b> <b>agencies,</b> <b>marriage</b> licensors and traditional matchmakers access to insert the national identification number of new couples to see if their potential marriage would be healthy or not. Unhealthy marriages would be required to go through sex/genetic counseling sessions as an attempt {{to prevent the spread of}} the STI's and genetic blood disorders. Saudi Arabia is moving from paper health records to electronic health records (EHR). CDSS would be used as a tool to help health care providers deliver higher quality service by using patients' records stored in EHR.
