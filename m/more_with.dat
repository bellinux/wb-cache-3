Midway between the two locations in Seward, NY10 intersects NY165, a connector leading to Cooperstown via NY166 and Otsego County's County Route52 (CR52). In Sharon Springs, a village situated in northwest Schoharie County, NY10 intersects US20. Shortly after exiting the village, NY10 passes into Montgomery County.|$|E

50|$|Stereotype IATs measure {{associations}} between concepts that often reflect {{the strength to}} which a person holds a particular societal stereotype. For example, the Gender-Science IAT reveals that most people associate women <b>more</b> strongly <b>with</b> liberal arts and men <b>more</b> strongly <b>with</b> science. Similarly, the Gender-Career IAT indicates that most people associate women <b>more</b> strongly <b>with</b> family and men <b>more</b> strongly <b>with</b> careers. The Asian IAT shows that many people more strongly associate Asian Americans with foreign landmarks and European Americans <b>more</b> strongly <b>with</b> American landmarks. Some other stereotype IATs include the Weapons IAT and the Native IAT.|$|R

5|$|A Love Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning songs about different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness. It veers between danceable, upbeat songs about cultivating a new romance and bluesy, meditative songs about how romances dissolve. In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals <b>more</b> <b>with</b> feelings of lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|E
5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated <b>more</b> <b>with</b> the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{expected}} {{to accommodate the}} needs of the entire workforce, by late 1944 expansion of both the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion plants led to forecasts of a population of 62,000. This prompted another round of construction that saw an additional 1,300 family units and 20 dormitories built. More shopping and recreational facilities were added, the schools were expanded to accommodate 9,000 students, and a 50-bed annex was added to the hospital. The number of school children reached 8,223 in 1945. Few issues resonated <b>more</b> <b>with</b> the scientists and highly skilled workers than the quality of the education system. Although school staff were nominally employees of the Anderson County Education Board, the school system was run autonomously, with federal funding under the supervision of administrators appointed by the Army. Teachers enjoyed salaries that were considerably higher than those of Anderson County. The population of Oak Ridge peaked at 75,000 in May 1945, by which time 82,000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works, and 10,000 by Roane-Anderson.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify <b>more</b> <b>with</b> their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and <b>more</b> <b>with</b> arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were nearly}} {{eliminated}} from the competition in the following round when they played Port Vale. After eight minutes, Tom Parker scored an own goal, putting Port Vale ahead.

Arsenal chased a further equaliser, which came four minutes from time by Brain.|$|E
