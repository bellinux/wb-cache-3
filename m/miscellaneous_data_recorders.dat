40|$|Abstract — Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> (Black Boxes) {{generate}} {{data that}} is collected on an embedded memory device. A well-known difficulty with these devices {{is that the}} embedded memory device runs out of space. The worry of getting into this problematical situation compels the software of the flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> to operate in a watchful mode- it constantly makes efforts to minimize the use of memory space; otherwise a larger flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> will be needed; however a larger flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> can be very problematic because flight <b>data</b> <b>recorders</b> have very rigorous requirements; therefore an enlargement is very expensive and costly. In this paper it is suggested to send the data to a remote cloud, so the flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> memory device will be in actual fact unbounded...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Extensive {{enlargement}} {{and safety}} of Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorder</b> memory. Design/methodology/approach – Moving the memory of Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> from an internal embedded device to a cloud. Findings – Our implementation has made the embedded memory device of Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorder</b> effectively unlimited and hence much more information can be stored. Research limitations/implications – The possibility of a flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> to be damaged or lost in a crash is not so high, but our implementation can be very helpful in cases such as aerial disappearances. Practical implications – Larger and protected memory for Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders.</b> Social implications – Faster finding of reasons for crashes and enabling to take immediate actions so as to remedy the failures. Originality/value – The use of Internet and cellphones in airplanes is nothing special in our time. It is suggested to take this technology for Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> as well...|$|R
40|$|Event <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> are {{receiving}} more attention as owners of automobiles {{have begun to}} realize that their driving histories are recorded. Event <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> are the “black boxes” in automobiles that are installed {{in the vast majority}} of vehicles currently on the road. In the majority of states, the restrictions on what information can be retrieved from Event <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> and used by police officers, advertising firms, and insurance companies remains a gray area. State laws governing Event <b>Data</b> <b>Recorder</b> technology greatly fluctuates by jurisdiction. If Event <b>Data</b> <b>Recorder</b> information falls into the wrong hands, the possession of the data raises serious privacy concerns. This note argues that as the use of Event <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> becomes more widespread, enactment of uniform federal laws are needed to standardize the data that can be recorded by these devices and to restrict the use and dissemination of the retrieved information...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{application}} and introduction possibilities of <b>data</b> <b>recorders</b> in personal vehicles in the Netherlands. <b>Data</b> <b>recorders</b> include the accident <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> (ADR) and the journey <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> (JDR). The report {{is divided into two}} parts. Part I, 'Problem analysis and exploration', {{deals with the}} subject in an analytical way together with the available literature and practical experiences in the field of <b>data</b> <b>recorders.</b> Part II, 'The opinions of organisations involved', reports the interviews of fifteen individuals from various sectors. Both parts produced the conclusion that, at this moment in time, there is no legitimacy for an obliged introduction of <b>data</b> <b>recorders,</b> whatever its form: partial, staged, or complete. Without a large-scale introduction, their usefulness for accident registration is poor. However, most of the organisations involved were interested in some form of consultation and cooperation, in order to achieve a certain amount of safety-aimed guidance of this market. The principle is one of encouraging voluntary use...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Black box {{refers to}} {{collection}} of several different recording devices used in transportation: the flight <b>recorders</b> (flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> and cockpit voice recorder) in aircraft, the event recorder in railway diesel locomotives, the event <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> in automobiles and the voyage <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> in ships. Car black box is an Event <b>Data</b> <b>Recorder.</b> When two cars collide, the sensor detects {{an accident and}} stores information regarding the car's speed, whether the seatbelts are fastened, the status of indicators and headlights and whether the driver hit the brakes before a collision. The number plate of the nearby vehicle is extracted from the captured images when accident was detected and the data is stored...|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} bi-directional {{data link}} for an electroencephalogram (EEG) recording system {{is presented in}} this paper. The system is mainly composed of a prototype model of an implant and a <b>data</b> <b>recorder.</b> Both the implant and the <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> use STM 32 microcontrollers with an inbuilt radio frequency (RF) transceiver to establish a wireless link between them. The main component of the implant is a mixed-signal EEG acquisition ASIC with 8 channels. The STM 32 and the ASIC of the implant module communicate via two SPI interfaces. Optimized software codes for the STM 32 microcontrollers have been written to ensure a reliable wireless communication between the implant and the <b>data</b> <b>recorder.</b> A PC {{is connected to the}} <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> which enables the communication by sending the configuration data to the implant. The data received by the <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> is stored in a PC. The amount of input referred noise of the ASIC present in the output is estimated with the help of MATLAB...|$|R
50|$|On April 18, 2016, {{a second}} {{search for the}} ship's voyage <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> was {{launched}} by the NTSB utilizing the RV Atlantis, a Navy-owned vessel operated by mariners of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. On April 26, the NTSB stated the voyage <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> was found about 41 mi northeast of Acklins and Crooked Islands, Bahamas. The NTSB was unable to retrieve the recorder at that time because of its proximity to the mast and other obstructions. On August 5, 2016, USNS Apache {{went back to the}} site. On August 9, 2016, the voyage <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> was finally recovered from the wreckage by USNS Apache, ten months after the sinking. The voyage <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> was then delivered to the NTSB in Mayport, FL to continue the investigation.|$|R
