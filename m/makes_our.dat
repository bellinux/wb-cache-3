25|$|The Revolution did {{revolutionize}} social relations. It did {{displace the}} deference, the patronage, the social divisions that had determined {{the way people}} viewed one another for centuries and still view one another {{in much of the}} world. It did give to ordinary people a pride and power, not to say an arrogance, that have continued to shock visitors from less favored lands. It may have left standing a host of inequalities that have troubled us ever since. But it generated the egalitarian view of human society that makes them troubling and <b>makes</b> <b>our</b> world so different from the own in which the revolutionists had grown up.|$|E
25|$|Both {{regular and}} {{irregular}} involvement in sports leisure {{can result in}} heightened SWB. Serious, or systematic involvement in certain leisure activities, such as taekwondo, correlates with personal growth {{and a sense of}} happiness. Additionally, more irregular (e.g. seasonal) sports activities, such as skiing, are also correlated with high SWB. Furthermore, the relationship between pleasure and skiing is thought to be caused in part by a sense of flow and involvement with the activity. Leisure activities, such as meeting with friends, participating in sports, and going on vacation trips, positively correlate with life satisfaction. It may also be true that going on a vacation <b>makes</b> <b>our</b> lives seem better, but does not necessarily make us happier in the long term. Research regarding vacationing or taking a holiday trip is mixed. Although the reported effects are mostly small, some evidence points to higher levels of SWB, or happiness, after taking a holiday.|$|E
25|$|Stimuli {{that are}} {{directly}} attended to are projected onto the fovea, the central {{point of the}} retina that corresponds to the focal point in visual space. To the immediate left and right of the focal point is the portion of visual space attributed to binocular vision. The far left and right of one's visual space is attributed to the monocular vision of {{the left and right}} eyes. In sum, one's visual space covers roughly 200° from the periphery of the left eye to the periphery of the right eye. This large visual space in human beings is a result of a fully developed and functioning anatomical visual system. In the context of Plato's Problem, our visual system is an innate capacity that enables us to be aware of a considerable portion of our immediate environment which enhances our conscious experience by supplementing it with an extensive environmental awareness and predisposing us to extract meaningful perceptual information. In other words, it is our biologically produced visual system that <b>makes</b> <b>our</b> perceptual experiences meaningful.|$|E

500|$|Music was a {{major part}} of {{everyday}} life. [...] The word itself derives from Greek μουσική (mousike), [...] "(art) of the Muses". Many private and public events were accompanied by music, ranging from nightly dining to military parades and manoeuvres. In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what <b>makes</b> <b>our</b> modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use may not have been familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier.|$|E

[...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ...

500|$|At {{the time}} of the points deduction, Arsenal were placed second in the league, eight points behind leaders Liverpool and one in front of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. O'Leary {{expressed}} his disappointment at the docked points: [...] "The champagne will be out at Liverpool tonight because this <b>makes</b> <b>our</b> task very much harder." [...] His teammate Limpar was more optimistic: [...] "It seems very harsh. It makes it a little bit harder to catch Liverpool, but it is not impossible." [...] Indeed, Arsenal went on to lose just one game all season and won the First Division title, seven points ahead of runners-up Liverpool. They became England's first representatives in the European Cup since the ban imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster was lifted. Manchester United finished sixth, but did not end the season empty-handed, winning the 1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup in the first season English clubs were allowed back into UEFA competitions.|$|E

In December 2016, Tracer became the first Overwatch hero to be canonically revealed as LGBT in Reflections, an issue of the Overwatch digital comic; she specifically identifies as a lesbian. In the comic, she is seen in a romantic relationship with Emily, a woman who {{is not part of the}} Overwatch team. Of this reveal, Blizzard stated, [...] "as in real life, having variety in our characters and their identities and backgrounds helps create a richer and deeper overall fictional universe". About Tracer's development specifically, Blizzard stated, [...] "as with any aspect of our characters' backgrounds, their sexuality is just one part of what <b>makes</b> <b>our</b> heroes who they are. From the very beginning of our work on Tracer's story, it just felt right to make this an aspect of her character." ...|$|E
