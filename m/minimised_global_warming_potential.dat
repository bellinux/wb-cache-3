40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this review is to collate the results of {{research}} into energy use and emissions in organic farming, and to provide advisors with {{an analysis of the}} results, access to the data used and a review of the benchmarking methodologies available. The review will inform those working in the development of benchmarking tools and advising farmers on practices to improve their performance. Specifically it will: •Identify organic management practices to reduce energy inputs and <b>minimise</b> the <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> of the system •Identify appropriate auditing methodologies •Facilitate access to input data (energy use and emissions figures for agricultural activities) which can be used in the development of an auditing tool •Summarise the energy and emissions levels found in organic farming systems and comparable conventional systems...|$|R
30|$|From {{the current}} field experiment, it is {{observed}} that magnesium sulphate blended with NPK can serve as an alternative to sole NPK amendment to decrease methane emission significantly in the flooded rice paddy soil at 0.5  t/ha application level. The present study demonstrates that the application of leaves of neem-mixed NPK, tea leaves mixed with NPK and karanj-mixed NPK in rainfed rice fields is the key in promoting physical attributes of soil quality as well as yield in agricultural systems in comparison with the exclusive application of inorganic fertiliser NPK. It is suggested that the rice productivity can be improved with significant increase in soil organic matter without intensifying methane emission when fresh leaves of karanj at 1  t/ha blended with NPK are applied on the rainfed rice fields in an acidic soil before transplantation. Long-term studies might be needed to ensure blending of fresh karanj with inorganic fertiliser NPK to be established as an alternative to inorganic fertilisation which can sustainably improve rice productivity in paddy rice fields, consequently reducing the emission of methane and <b>minimising</b> its <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> in the environment.|$|R
40|$|Dairy {{production}} systems {{are an important}} global contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions including methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). Due to the role GHG play in climate change, {{it is important to}} investigate ways to <b>minimise</b> their <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> (GWP) and to maximise the efficiency of dairy {{production systems}}. Finding a balance between improving productivity and suppressing the range and quantity of GHG produced in dairy production is crucial in order to maintain sustainability in the future. The Langhill herd is part of a long term genetic x feeding systems study, representative of a range of dairy production systems which may be found in the UK. Two feeding regimes (low forage (LF) and high forage (HF)) were applied to each of two genetic lines (control (C) and select (S) genetic merit for milk fat plus protein) giving four contrasting dairy production systems (LFC, LFS, HFC, HFS). Biological efficiency (production and energetic) and environmental efficiency (GWP) were assessed by way of life cycle analysis (LCA), accounting for dairy system inputs and outputs from off-farm production of imported feeds and fertilisers to raw milk leaving the farm gate over a period of seven years. Calculations were conducted using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methods, with system specific data implemented where possible. Select genetic line under low forage regime (LFS) had the highest gross production and energetic efficiencies (p< 0. 001). In LFS, milk yields were 56...|$|R
50|$|As an {{additional}} environmental concern, R-22 {{is a powerful}} greenhouse gas with a <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> equal to 1810 (which indicates 1810 times as powerful as carbon dioxide).4 Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are often substituted for R-22 because of their lower Ozone Depleting Potential, but these refrigerants also have high <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential.</b> R-410A, for example, is often substituted, but has a <b>Global</b> <b>Warming</b> <b>Potential</b> of 1725. Another substitute is R404A with a <b>Global</b> <b>Warming</b> <b>Potential</b> of 3900. Other substitute refrigerants are available with low <b>Global</b> <b>Warming</b> <b>Potential.</b> Ammonia (R717), for example, has a <b>Global</b> <b>Warming</b> <b>Potential</b> of <1 and is a popular substitute on fishing vessels. Propane (R-290), is another example, and has a <b>Global</b> <b>Warming</b> <b>Potential</b> of 3, although it is rarely used in refrigeration systems because of its flammability and potential for explosion.|$|R
50|$|The inert {{nature of}} many halons, {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFC), and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), particularly CFC-11 and CFC-12, made them preferred choices among refrigerants {{for many years}} because of their nonflammability and nontoxicity. However, their stability in the atmosphere and their corresponding <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> and ozone depletion potential raised concerns about their usage. This led to their replacement with HFCs and PFCs, especially HFC-134a, which are not-ozone depleting, and have lesser <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potentials.</b> However, these refrigerants still have <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potentials</b> thousands of times greater than CO2. Therefore, they are now being replaced in markets where leaks are likely, by using a third generation of refrigerants, most prominently HFO-1234yf, which have <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potentials</b> much closer to that of CO2.|$|R
40|$|Calculations towards {{determining}} the greenhouse gas mitigation {{capacity of a}} small-scale biogas plant (3. 2 m 3 plant) using cow dung in Bangladesh are presented. A general life cycle assessment was used, evaluating key parameters (biogas, methane, construction materials and feedstock demands) to determine the net environmental impact. The <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> saving {{through the use of}} biogas as a cooking fuel is reduced from 0. 40 kg CO 2 equivalent to 0. 064 kg CO 2 equivalent per kilogram of dung. Biomethane used for cooking can contribute towards mitigation of <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b> Prior to utilisation of the <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> of methane (from 3. 2 m 3 biogas plant), the <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> is 13 t of carbon dioxide equivalent. This reduced to 2 t as a result of complete combustion of methane. The <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> saving of a bioenergy plant across a 20 -year life cycle is 217 t of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is 11 t per year.

The indicators <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> and cumulative energy demand were selected to reflect this. The <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> (GWP) or greenhouse effect is quantified using <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potentials</b> (GWP) for substances having the same effect as CO 2 in that they reflect heat radiation (e.g., methane, nitrous oxide…). GWP for greenhouse gases are expressed as CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 -eq.), i.e., the effects are expressed relatively to the effect of CO 2. The calculation method used for this indicator is the ReCiPe methodology which complies with IPCC specifications [38]. The indicator cumulative fossil energy demand (CED fossil) measures the primary energy demand required within the life cycle and is measured in MJ [39]. The methodology used is the ecoinvent methodology.|$|R
