5000|$|Prior to the 1960s, African-American {{students}} and staff experienced serious discrimination in United States higher education. During that era, these schools attracted the best African-American {{students and}} faculty. However, since the 1960s, these institutions have had great difficulty in competing with Ivy League and other historically white colleges for top students and faculty The North Star News notes, [...] "As Blacks enrolled in predominantly white colleges and southern states did not invest in Black colleges, HBCU’s were put at a distinct disadvantage. Today, many of these institutions are struggling {{to keep pace with}} white institutions in terms of course offerings, facilities, athletics, and student services." [...] Yet, Black Ivy League schools enroll more black National Merit Scholars than elite traditional schools, such as Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, perhaps because these students have financial aid independent of the school they attend. As reported by the Washington Post, [...] "Top-tier schools - including Howard, Hampton University, and Spelman and <b>Morehouse</b> <b>colleges</b> - vie with Harvard and Princeton for top black students and faculty." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{cases of}} {{particularly}} egregious misconduct, the NCAA {{has the power}} to ban a school from participating in a particular sport, a penalty is known as the [...] "Death Penalty". Since 1985, any school that commits major violations during the probationary period can be banned from the sport involved for up to two years. However, when the NCAA opts not to issue a death penalty for a repeat violation, it must explain why it did not do so. This penalty has only been imposed three times in its modern form, most notably when Southern Methodist University's football team had its 1987 season canceled due to massive rules violations dating back more than a decade. SMU opted not to field a team in 1988 as well due to the aftershocks from the sanctions, and the program has never recovered; it has only four winning seasons and four bowl appearance since then (mostly under June Jones, the team's head coach from 2008 until his resignation during the 2014 season). The devastating effect the death penalty had on SMU has reportedly made the NCAA skittish about issuing another one. Since the SMU case, there are only three instances where the NCAA has seriously considered imposing it against a Division I school; it imposed it against Division II <b>Morehouse</b> <b>College's</b> men's soccer team in 2003 and Division III MacMurray College's men's tennis team in 2005. In addition to these cases, the most recent division I school to be considered was Penn State. This because of the Jerry Sandusky Incident that consequently almost landed Penn State on the hook for the Death Penalty. They received a 60 million dollars fine, in addition to forfeited seasons and other sanctions as well.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} basic writing programs at selected Historically Black Colleges. The objectives of many writing programs include, {{but are not limited}} to, the following: identifying students whose English, and/or reading comprehension skills are below acceptable levels; determining appropriate course placement for each individual student; providing advisement and learning enhancement courses for provisional students; and providing a writing/tutoring center for students who need supplemental assistance with writing assignments. This study was {{based on the premise that}} not all students entering their first year of college have strong writing skills; therefore, basic writing programs are necessary for students who have deficiencies in writing. Basic writing programs exist at Historically Black Colleges just as they exist at many other American colleges. For that reason, it seems impractical for many colleges to assume that these students who need basic writing skills can be simply ignored. A case study analysis approach was used to analyze data gathered at selected Historically Black Colleges. The selected colleges which constitute this sample are as follows: Spelman <b>College,</b> <b>Morehouse</b> College; Tougaloo College; Bethune-Cookman College; Oakwood College; and Morris Brown College. These colleges include those that are utilizing basic writing programs and those that are not utilizing such programs. Among this selected sample of six Historically Black Colleges, the colleges that are utilizing basic writing programs are Bethune-Cookman, Oakwood, and Morris Brown, whereas Spelman, Morehouse, and Tougaloo have no such programs. The researcher found that the selected colleges not using basic writing programs have on their campuses remedial level writing students who could have benefited from a basic writing program, but due to political or financial reasons, these institutions choose to ignore the basic writing student. In contrast, however, those colleges that utilize some level of remedial writing instruction actually find improvement in the writing of students who have actively participated in their basic writing programs. The study 2 ̆ 7 s findings reveal that basic writing programs should be established and preserved at Historically Black Colleges because the basic writing student still exists. In other words, the longevity of the basic writing program should be contingent upon whether or not the basic writing student is still alive and well on college campuses. Therefore, in order for Historically Black Colleges to fulfill their mission of producing young men and women who are truly educated, the colleges must find the means and the commitment to provide basic writing assistance to students who need this assistance...|$|R
