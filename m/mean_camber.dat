A plate finite element mesh is generated on the resulting <b>mean</b> <b>camber</b> surface. The finite element model is used as input for specialized analysis software for cold-shape correction which provides displacements due to unloading the blade.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is,firstly, to show how the concept of excess {{secondary}} vorticity arises naturallyfrom attempts to recover three-dimensional flow details lost in passage-averaging the equations governing the $ow through gas turbines. An equation for the growth of excess streamwise vorticity is then derived. This equation, which allows for streamwise entropy gradients through a presc-ribed loss term, could be integrated numerically through a blade-row to provide the excess vorticity at the exit to a blade-row. The second part of the paper concentrates on the approximate methods of Smith (1) and Came and Marsh (2) for estimating this quantity and demonstrates their relationship {{to each other and to}} the concept of excess streamwise vorticity. Finally the relevance of the results to the design uf blading for gas turbines,from the point of view of secondaryflow, is discussed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an aero load correction strategy {{applicable to the}} static aeroelastic optimization of composite wings. The optimization framework consists of a successive convex subproblem iteration procedure, in which a gradient based optimizer consecutively solves a local approximation problem. Responses are approximated as a linear and/or reciprocal function of the laminate membrane and bending stiffness matrices A and D. Together with the laminate thicknesses h, they constitute the design variables in the optimization process. Internally, the design space is transformed from stiffness matrices to lamination parameters, resulting in a continuous and convex optimization problem. Structural responses considered in the stiffness optimization are strength, local buckling and mass; aileron effectiveness, divergence, and twist constitute the aeroelastic responses. Steady aeroelastic loads are calculated with a doublet lattice method (DLM) embedded in the applied finite element solver, allowing for the generation of response sensitivities that incorporate the effects of displacement-dependent, aeroelastic loads. To incorporate flow phenomena that cannot be reproduced with DLM, a higher order aerodynamic method is considered. The developed correction methods and their application are presented in this paper. The correction is twofold, firstly aiming at a correction of DLM by <b>means</b> of <b>camber</b> and twist modifications applied directly to the doublet lattice mesh and secondly, by employing the capabilities {{of a higher order}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver, like the DLR-based TAU code. To this end, DLM loads transferred to the structure are rectified by means of the supposedly superior CFD results. The aero load correction method is applied in the stiffness optimization of a forward swept wing. First, a trim application without structural optimization is discussed, to demonstrate the convergence behavior of the correction forces. The results of a wing skin mass minimization with balanced and unbalanced laminates are presented. In particular, the differences between optimizations with and without aero correction are highlighted.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} study of an adaptive {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) wing actuated by shape memory alloy (SMA) devices is presented. The wing consists of a sandwich box substructure, flexible ribs, and a flexible laminated skin. The adaptation capability to the changing flight conditions is obtained via airfoil shape adjustments. Torsion SMA tubes are employed for wing camber control, while levers powered by SMA wires are employed for local shape control. A new architecture is proposed: the downward or upward actuation torque is provided by counterrotating concentric tubes connected through a clutch and a positioning piezoelectric motor to the flexible ribs. These actuator tubes are heated {{one at a time}} while the other is made free by the clutch in order to obtain any wanted shape without waiting for cooling. The capability of the wing to bear the aerodynamic loads, the power required by the actuators, and their force and torque are assessed by finite-element simulations. An improved version of a recently developed element is employed that accurately and efficiently captures stresses and deformations in the composite structure.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was directed at}} understanding two major issues in turbomachine unsteady aerodynamics: (1) two-dimensional modeling of the unsteady aerodynamic excitation to a blade row within the constraints of linearized theory, and (2) the resulting unsteady aerodynamic loading of a blade row utilizing linearized theory analysis. These objectives were pursued {{by means of a}} series of experiments in the Purdue Annular Cascade Research Facility. This facility experimentally reproduces the fundamental unsteady flow phenomena inherent in axial flow turbomachines. The unsteady periodic flow field generated by rotating rows of perforated plates and airfoil cascades was measured with a two-component hot-wire anemometer and an unsteady total pressure probe and characterized in terms of the two-dimensional unsteady velocity and unsteady static pressure perturbations. The resulting unsteady periodic chordwise surface pressure distributions on a downstream stator row were measured with miniature high-frequency response pressure transducers mounted within the stator airfoils. Thus the unsteady aerodynamic excitation and resulting unsteady aerodynamic response were quantitatively ascertained. ^ The periodic unsteady flow perturbations were analyzed as superpositions of harmonic vortical and potential flow perturbations, with each of these fundamental perturbations modeled as a spatial flow nonuniformity which is temporally steady in an appropriately rotating reference frame. The unsteady velocity associated with an harmonic vortical perturbation was shown to be parallel to the mean velocity vector in the rotating relative reference frame. The unsteady potential perturbations were shown to either propagate or decay axially depending upon flow conditions, with the propagation or decay determined by the mean relative Mach number in the rotating reference frame. ^ Unsteady flow fields generated by rotating rows of perforated plates were found to be almost purely vortical perturbations and to conform closely with the linearized theory vortical gust model. Unsteady flow fields generated by rotating airfoil cascades were shown to be combined vortical/potential perturbations, with the vortical component propagating unattenuated and the potential component decaying at the rate predicted by the linearized theory. The stator response to both the perforated plate and airfoil excitations was accurately predicted by utilizing the linearized theory to calculate the response to harmonic vortical and potential excitations of unit magnitude, scaling these unit responses by the vortical and potential excitations extracted from the unsteady flow measurements, and summing the results. ^ A classical flat plate cascade analysis was extended to account for <b>camber,</b> <b>mean</b> incidence, and the streamwise component of the incident unsteady flow. For cambered airfoils, this thin airfoil cascade analysis yielded better results than the flat plate analysis when the incident unsteady flow perturbation was dominated by the chordwise component. ...|$|R

With this program, multiple surfaces can be designed together to yield a trimmed configuration with minimum induced drag at some specified lift coefficient. The method uses a vortex-lattice and overcomes previous difficulties with chord loading specification. A Trefftz plane analysis is {{used to determine the}} optimum span loading for minimum drag. The program then solves for the <b>mean</b> <b>camber</b> surface of the wing associated with this loading. Pitching-moment or root-bending-moment constraints can be employed at the design lift coefficient. Sensitivity studies of vortex-lattice arrangements have been made with this program and comparisons with other theories show generally good agreement. The program is very versatile and has been applied to isolated wings, wing-canard configurations, a tandem wing, and a wing-winglet configuration. The design problem solved with this code is essentially an optimization one. A subsonic vortex-lattice is used to determine the span load distribution(s) on bent lifting line(s) in the Trefftz plane. A Lagrange multiplier technique determines the required loading which is used to calculate the <b>mean</b> <b>camber</b> slopes, which are then integrated to yield the local elevation surface. The problem of determining the necessary circulation matrix is simplified by having the chordwise shape of the bound circulation remain unchanged across each span, though the chordwise shape may vary from one planform to another. The circulation matrix is obtained by calculating the spanwise scaling of the chordwise shapes. A chordwise summation of the lift and pitching-moment is utilized in the Trefftz plane solution {{on the assumption that the}} trailing wake does not roll up and that the general configuration has specifiable chord loading shapes.

Leading edge loading and semi-vaneless space diffusion showed trends similar to those reported earlier from shroud surface experiments that did improve compressor flow range. Opposite trends are seen for hub injection cases where compressor flow range decreased. The hub injection data further explain the range improvement provided by shroud-side injection and suggest that different hub-side techniques may produce range improvement in centrifugal compressors...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{experimental}} {{investigation of a}} single-stage supersonic turbine are presented herein. The turbine was designed for a rotor entering relative Mach number of 2. The maximum equivalent specific work output of the turbine at design speed and approximately design over-all pressure ratio was 32. 9 BTU per pound at a static efficiency of 0. 414. This static efficiency gave good verification to an independent reference that indicated theoretical static efficiencies for similar single-stage turbines within the range 0. 40 to 0. 45. An experimental ratio of effective rotor blade momentum thickness to <b>mean</b> <b>camber</b> length {{was determined to be}} 0. 0014, which compares favorably with the results obtained from several transonic and subsonic turbines. The design procedure for this turbine would have been improved by allowing for more rotor losses by assuming a value of this momentum parameter comparable with those obtained from transonic turbines. Removing {{a large portion of the}} rotor suction surface enabled a lower static pressure to be felt at the stator exit, at the expense of higher rotor losses. The net result was an improvement in turbine work output of about 3 percent at design setting conditions. No problems associated with supersonic starting were encountered even under the worst conditions of turbine operation with respect to this problem...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This studyevaluated theadaptationofnatural laminar flowairfoils forGrandTouring (GT) {{sports car}} racing and the {{influence}} of wing geometry and flow control devices on rear-wing aerodynamics. The <b>mean</b> <b>camber</b> lines for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 651 - 412 and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) LS(1) - 0413 airfoils were calculated. Numerical analysis was conducted using thin-airfoil theory and finite-wing theory. Airfoil variables included zero-lift angle of attack and centre-of-pressure location. Wing variables encompassed induced and effective angles of attack, lift and drag coefficients, and lift-to-drag ratio. Modelling consisted of variations in wing aspect ratio and the integration of end plates and a Gurney flap. A tapered rectangular planform is quasi-elliptical and attains near-unity Oswald efficiency. The NASA LS(1) - 0413 airfoil is stall resistant and produces high downforce at the expense of extra drag because of factors related to camber, profile thickness, leading edge radius, and concave pressure recovery. The wing should be set at an incidence above that for best lift-to-drag ratio. The NACA 651 - 412 airfoil is aerodynamicallymore efficient but produces less downforce and may be used as a stabilizer. Augmented aspect ratio, end plates, and a Gurney flap enhance wing aerodynamics via flow control andmodified downwash configuration. Theanalysis suggests thata taperedLS(1) - 0413 wingof 5. 56 aspect ratio fittedwith end plates and a Gurney flap, set at high incidence, is an appealing single-element arrangement for applications in Grand Touring sports car engineering...|$|E
