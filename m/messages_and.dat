40|$|Abstract. <b>Messaging,</b> <b>and</b> {{distributed}} transactions, describe {{two important}} models for building enterprise software systems. Distributed object middleware aims to support both models by providing <b>messaging</b> <b>and</b> transaction services. But while {{the concept of}} distributed object transactions is well-understood, support for messaging in distributed object environments {{is still in its}} early stages, and not nearly as readily perceived. Integrating messaging into distributed object environments, and in particular with distributed object transactions, describes a novel and complex software design problem. This paper details this problem, presenting first results fromour project of developing a <b>messaging</b> <b>and</b> transaction integration facility. The first contribution of this paper is a comprehensive messaging classification framework, which defines <b>messaging</b> concepts <b>and</b> terminology, and enables us to compare different messaging architectures. Second, we analyze sample messaging middleware using this framework, and identify the architectural messaging styles that they induce. Third, we derive four different strategies for integrating <b>messaging</b> <b>and</b> distributed object transactions. We discuss each of these integration strategies, and outline the open research issues that need to be solved. Overall, this paper advances our understanding of the motivation for, the problems of, the current state-of-the-art in, and future models for integrating <b>messaging</b> <b>and</b> distributed object transactions. ...|$|R

In addition, the Navy intercept station in the islands, known as Station CAST, had an ultra secret Purple cipher machine, which decrypted Japanese diplomatic <b>messages,</b> <b>and</b> partial codebooks for the latest JN-25 naval code.

5|$|Carey's {{actions were}} given mixed reception, with critics and {{executives}} commending her bold actions regarding a song she felt {{needed to be}} heard, while others criticized her for publicizing the dispute further.

Fearing to lose their label's highest seller and the best-selling artist of the decade, Sony chose to release the song. Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon {{found out that the}} song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which meant the song failed to chart on the official US chart, and made international charting extremely difficult and unlikely.|$|E

Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature.
