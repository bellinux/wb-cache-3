30|$|It is {{possible}} to fabricate highly sensitive NTCR (negative {{temperature coefficient of resistance}}) thermistor using nano crystalline CaTiO 3 synthesized by high energy ball <b>milling.</b> <b>Disc</b> shaped green pellets were prepared and effects of sintering on the disc pellets were studied as thermistor by sintering the samples at 1000 °C, 1100 °C and 1200 °C. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), impedance analysis and electrical measurement. The resistivity of the prepared samples varies predictably with temperature: this makes them promising material for temperature sensor. The experimental results prove that nano crystalline CaTiO 3 ceramic is one kind of thermistor with exponential negative temperature coefficient of resistance in the temperature range of 300 – 500 °C. The samples have the advantages of rapid response, high sensitivity and capability to withstand thermal surges over the temperature range of 300 – 500 °C. Resistance-temperature characteristics are described by thermistor equation with thermistor constant around 4003 K to 10795 K and thermal coefficient of resistance α around ∼ 1 %/°C to ∼ 13 %/°C. The activation energy is in the range of 0.34 – 0.93 eV. The observed thermistor parameters are found to be comparable with many of the known thermistor materials. This suggests that the electrical properties can be adjusted to desirable values by controlling the temperature parameter. The influence of fabrication process of disc thermistor and electrical properties are discussed. The study shows the potential of nano crystalline CaTiO 3 to act as an NTCR material for thermistor applications.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{conventional}} recycling method, {{metal chips}} are cast after pressing and melting in electric arc furnace. Material loss occurs during the recycling from liquid metal {{due to the}} several reasons. Direct recycling method which produces the aluminium powder from aluminium chips using mechanical mill can be an alternative to conventional recycling method. Thus material and energy losses, and labour cost will be reduced by direct recycling method without melting. In this study, the particle morphology of powder direct recycled from AA 6013 aluminium alloy chips with cryogenic, disc and ball type grinders is investigated. Mechanical milling resulted flaky and irregular shaped AA 6013 particles. It was ascertained that the chips did not break sufficiently in despite of the long duration milling mechanisms by ball mill. Cryogenic mill provides the energy required for milling mechanisms to act. <b>Disc</b> <b>mill</b> has the highest impact energy was determined.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of milling methods on tensile properties of polypropylene (PP) / oil palm mesocarp fibre (OPMF) biocomposites. Two types of mills were used; Wiley <b>mill</b> (WM) and <b>disc</b> <b>mill</b> (DM). Ground OPMF from each milling process was examined for its particle size distribution and aspect ratio by sieve and microscopic analyses, respectively. Results showed that DM-OPMF had smaller diameter fibre with uniform particle size compared to the WM-OPMF. Surface morphology study by SEM showed that DM-OPMF had rougher surface compared to WM-OPMF. Furthermore, it was found that PP/DM-OPMF biocomposite had higher tensile strength compared to PP/WM-OPMF, with almost two-fold. Thus, it is suggested that small diameter and uniform size fibre may improve stress transfer and surface contact between the fibre and polymer matrix and cause welldispersion of filler throughout the polymer resulted in better tensile strength of PP/DM-OPMF compared to PP/WM-OPMF biocomposite. Overall, it can be concluded that <b>disc</b> <b>milling</b> could serve as a simple and effective grinding method for improving the tensile properties of biocomposite...|$|R

Increase of energy in bead mills will decrease the milling time but increase the bead attrition. This interaction was investigated by comminution of an aqueous alumina suspension (d 90 = 4. 5 µm) in a laboratory attrition mill (AHM 90, Hosokawa Alpine AG) under different conditions. Based on preliminary tests with zirconia beads (0. 2 / 0. 5 / 1 mm) the technological parameter range for an experimental plan (DoE) was selected: - volume flux (0. 75 - 1. 5 l/min) - volume ratio of bead (60 - 80 vol%) - rotation speed of <b>milling</b> <b>discs</b> (1600 - 3000 rpm).

In {{the first set}} of experiments, it was attempted to confirm the information presented in the literature that magnesium hydride could be produced by heating at 350 oC for 24 hours under 10 atmospheres of pressure. The results obtained in this study indicated that even a higher temperature heating at 400 oC under 10 bar hydrogen pressure was insufficient for magnesium hydride formation. Heating and grinding time were selected as the most effective parameters by which a full-factorial experimental design methodology was implemented.

We also tested feed mixtures for poultry and pigs. Laboratory samples were ground on three milling devices – with the sieve of 1. 0 mm or 0. 5 mm, and a <b>disc</b> <b>mill</b> with minimum working aperture. The content of nutrients was analyzed {{with the help of the}} InfraXact spectrophotometer scanning within the range of 770 – 2, 500 nm. The analyses revealed that within the range applied the method is resistant to the diversified granulometric composition of the samples. However, excessive grinding of the research material should be avoided (a sieve of 0. 5 mm) during analyzing water, due to potential overheating of the sample which could lead to partial evaporation of the component...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} cutters is an {{important}} consideration for the manufacture of helicoidal surfaces such as extruder screw surfaces. These surfaces are produced mostly by milling processes using form cutters of end mill type, side <b>mill</b> type or <b>disc</b> type, such as side-and-face mill or grinding wheel. The methodology proposed in the paper addresses {{the problem of the}} design of cutters for the machining of helicoidal surfaces. Using the proposed methodology, the characteristic profile(s) of the cutter can be determined from the given cross-sectional profile and lead of a helicoidal surface. By sweeping this characteristic profile along an appropriate path or around an axis, the geometry of the specific form cutter can be obtained. Such a geometry could be a turning tool, an end mill, a side mill, a side-and-face mill or a grinding wheel, depending on the process adopted for manufacture. The proposed methodology {{can also be used to}} determine the geometry of the helicoidal surface that will be obtained by using a given cutter. In the paper, the procedure to obtain the geometry of the cutters for machining extruder screws is explained with illustrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{methods of}} the {{thermodynamic}} design of the rotor straight-teeth and screw compressors have been developed. The original diagram of the new compressor has been justified and offered. The dependences {{on the design of}} the gas forces and moments have been offered. The new teeth profiles have been recommended, the method of the <b>disc</b> <b>milling</b> cutters has been developed. The unified numbers of the rotor and screw compressors have been developed. The principally newrotor straight-teeth compressor has been offered. The compressors have been run in the series production by the number of the country plants, which had a great importance in technical re-equipment of many enterprises of the economy. The developed methods and constructions have been introduced. The developed rotor straight-teeth compressor has the efficiency by 13 - 17 % higher than its analog. The suggested profile of screws allows to increase the efficiency by 3 - 8 %.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find the {{proportion}} of the number of microLs and fermentation of raw materials and the proper time in the manufacture of animal feed and chicken to get protein and carbohydrate levels optimal, in the production of chicken feed The materials used include: 1). Waste of fish, obtained from fish processing factories in Sidoarjo, 2). Leucaena leaves, obtained in the courtyard around the campus and houses, 3). Bran, obtained in traditional markets, 4). Rice com, obtained in traditional markets, 5). Waste Ruminant, obtained from the slaughterhouse cattle. Tool - is a screening tool used, <b>Disc</b> <b>mill,</b> Beaker glass, mixer, Incubator, Oven Electric. The treatments are carried out Proportion of Raw Materials and Microbes: (I : 0, 3, 1 : 0, 4, 1 : 0, 5, I : 0, 6, 1 : 0, 7), Fermentation time (day) : (2, 4, 6, 8, 10). Conditions that remains is Operation Temperature: 300 C, pH: 6. 5 The results can be concluded that the acquisition of the best protein content on fermentation of animal feed is the protein content of 51. 16...|$|R
