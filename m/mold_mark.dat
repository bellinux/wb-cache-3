The use of electronic counterfeits can cause reduced performance of circuits, {{or failure of the}} whole system. New efficient approaches of counterfeit device detection are always required. Since the electromagnetic emission level of integrated devices depends on various circuit parameters like technology, manufacturing and aging, the electromagnetic emission measurement could be an approach to detect the counterfeit. In this article, the principles of the methodology are explained and two case studies are presented, where three ways of analysis of data are discussed. 1. Introduction An electronic counterfeit is a device whose material, performances, or characteristics are knowingly misrepresented by the vendor, supplier, distributor, or manufacturer [1]. In recent years, there are a growing number of reported incidents related to counterfeit {{integrated circuits}} (ICs) [2] with the huge increase of global semiconductor market. The use of electronic counterfeits can cause reduced performance of circuits, such as instability of clock frequency, operating life decrease, a lower storage memory space, or failure of the whole system. The Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit Abatement estimates that nearly 10 percent of technological products sold in the global market are counterfeit, which represents about 100 billion dollar loss for the electronics companies every year [3]. Three major techniques exist to produce counterfeit circuits: remarking components as a higher grade and more expensive chip, re-packaging old devices up to non-qualified components, and duplicating counterfeits through inferior parts or materials [4]. The struggle against this problem relies in a better management of the supply chain and the market [5], the development of advanced authentication methods (e. g. watermarking [6]) and serialization technologies (e. g. 2 -D bar code [4]). Besides, industry always looks for non-destructive, rapid and cheap method to detect the electric counterfeit. At present, a large number of detection techniques exist and are already used by industry and detection laboratories: visual inspection of the appearance of component (texture, <b>mold</b> <b>mark,</b> pitch form…) in order to detect raw counterfeit devices, decapsulation to verify the die layout, material analysis methods, like fluorescent X-ray or C-mode scanning acoustic microscope for package analysis, and different levels of electrical testing (V/I characteristics, ESD test, operation life test…) [7]...|$|E

To differentiate, male breasts are usually <b>molded</b> <b>marked</b> by a light curve topped with a nipple. On the other hand, several of the female breasts have no nipples distinguished by a shallow protrusion, and slightly sloping.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from red}} beads imitating coral, blue beads were also highly valued. Keta awuazi beads, {{originating}} from Nigeria or possibly Togo, {{were made in}} horizontal <b>molds</b> and <b>mold</b> <b>marks</b> are often evident along their sides. Keta awuazi beads are cylindrical in shape. Manufacture ceased during the 1940s. Krobo bead makers produced similar blue powder glass beads, using glass derived from cold cream jars to achieve the blue colouration.|$|R

50|$|Parts are {{produced}} by injection of liquid styrene plastic under very high pressure into complex steel molds. These molds are generally composed of two halves that sandwich the parts; however, 'slide molds' may consist of many steel components to allow greater levels of detail to be incorporated into a single sprue. Once the plastic cools, it {{is removed from the}} mold. In the 1960s and 1970s, typical vehicle kits might contain 50 to 200 individual parts. Today it is common for a single vehicle kit to contain from 300 to 1200 parts. Each part must be carefully cut from the 'sprue' (the plastic channels that allow the plastic to flow into the mold and which hold the parts in place), cleaned of any flaws or <b>mold</b> <b>marks,</b> and then assembled.|$|R
40|$|Treatment of cultured parsley (Petroselinum crispum) {{cells with}} fungal {{elicitor}} rapidly activates transcription of many genes encoding specific steps in pathogen defense-related pathways. We report evidence that three cDNAs corresponding to such genes represent two key enzymes of the activated methyl cycle. Two cDNAs {{are derived from}} distinct members of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase gene family, based on extensive similarity of the deduced polypeptides with authentic enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana, rat, yeast, and Escherichia coli. The third cDNA exhibits large similarity with a functionally related gene, encoding S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase, from rat and a slime <b>mold.</b> <b>Marked</b> differences in the mRNA levels occurred in different organs of parsley plants. Elicitor treatment strongly induced both mRNAs in cultured cells as well as intact leaves and led to marked increases in S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase enzyme activity. These results suggest a close metabolic link between pathogen defense and an increased turnover of activated methyl groups...|$|R
25|$|The {{formulation}} of glasses using lead, alumina, and thallium to increase RI and dispersion {{began in the}} late Baroque period. These glasses are fashioned into brilliants, and when freshly cut they can be surprisingly effective diamond simulants. Known as rhinestones, pastes, or strass, glass simulants are a common feature of antique jewelry; in such cases, rhinestones can be valuable historical artifacts in their own right. The great softness (below hardness 6) imparted by the lead means a rhinestone's facet edges and faces will quickly become rounded and scratched. Together with conchoidal fractures, and air bubbles or flow lines within the stone, these features make glass imitations easy to spot under only moderate magnification. In contemporary production it is more common for glass to be molded rather than cut into shape: in these stones the facets will be concave and facet edges rounded, and <b>mold</b> <b>marks</b> or seams may also be present. Glass has also been combined with other materials to produce composites.|$|R

Evidence also strongly suggests that CD numbers 145, 190/191, 288, and 298 were produced, although none have been found to date marked with the company name. It has been shown, by close inspection of insulators, that all <b>marked</b> <b>molds</b> used by W.F.G. Co. had been previously used by the Valverde Glass Company.|$|R
5000|$|One of his Broadway shows, his two-act Politically Incorrect (1994-95) {{which ran}} for 347 {{performances}} at Broadway's John Golden Theater. Critic John Simon of Time wrote: [...] "His method is hyperbole and reductio ad absurdum, but always informed by bitter reason. His irony is a spotlight illuminating our absurdities; his zingers are scalpels laying bare the sickness under the skin. There is a unifying thrust, a focus, a structure: {{an attack on}} both liberal hypocrisy and conservative apathy, and on the climate of political correctness that {{makes it impossible to}} attack anyone but WASPs.... Mason is a true satirist in the <b>mold</b> of ... <b>Mark</b> Twain ...." [...] It was performed during the same period that Bill Maher's late-night, half-hour political TV talk show Politically Incorrect was on the air. Maher brought a lawsuit against Mason's production, which was dismissed as frivolous. Mason was able to use this show title, and it is one of his most successful road productions. Between these shows, Mason played the lead in a short-lived television interfaith sitcom called Chicken Soup alongside Lynn Redgrave.|$|R
25|$|The {{first stage}} of the process is the {{scanning}} of the film negatives or prints into a digital picture and sound raw format. Depending on the film's condition, it may undergo a physical cleaning before the scanning could begin. The scanned materials will then undergo an automated and a painstaking frame by frame digital restoration process. The process involves the digital removal of dirt, scratches, fingerprints, discolorations, <b>molds,</b> tape <b>marks,</b> and other damages in the scanned materials. The process also involves the correction of color, brightness, and contrast into its original form often consulting the original cinematographers of each films whenever possible. Subtitles and watermarks, if present, are also remove in the process. The process also involves the restoration and remastering of sound. This involves the syncing of sound to the picture {{and the removal of}} unnecessary noises such as eradicate pops and whistles. Extreme measures were also done to remove copyrighted songs from some films. Dozens of technicians, engineers, and artists work hundreds of hours for each film with restoration cost ranging anywhere between twenty-five thousand pesos and ten million pesos per film.|$|R
30|$|Part of the {{prepared}} DRC samples were polymerized in open atmosphere {{at room temperature}} (20 [*]±[*] 1 [*]°C) by anterior light illumination from curing dental wireless source (LED.T 4, SEASKY, China) emitted light in 420 – 480  nm spectral range with ~ 900  mW/cm 2 output power density. To normalize light-curing protocol for all DRC specimens, the end of guide tip from light source was maintained just above sample surface at 7  mm distance, so light beam fully covers the surface. Under these conditions, the photo-exposure lasting 60  s was enough to ensure deeply polymerized state of DRC Dipol® (accordingly to the manufacturer instruction [22]). For detailed kinetics study, the whole photopolymerization was incremented on shorter time intervals (5 - 10 - 20 - 30 - 40 - 50 - 60  s), the polymerized DRC (5 pellets in A 3 shade of each type separated from disc-shaped plastic <b>molds)</b> being <b>marked</b> as Dn (where n means respective light-exposure duration). After photopolymerization, the DRC samples were stored for 1  week in ambient conditions before nanoindentation and PAL testing. So the post-irradiation polymerization input [8] was {{also included in the}} modeled kinetics. To exclude possible influence from gelation [2], the experimental data for non-polymerized D 0 samples were ignored, so that we started kinetics tracing from D 5 sample.|$|R
5000|$|Antique canning jars {{are often}} sold through antique stores and auction {{sites such as}} eBay. The value of a jar is related to its age, rarity, color, and condition. A jar's age and rarity can be {{determined}} by the color, shape, <b>mold</b> and production <b>marks</b> of the glass, and the jar's closure. Mason jars usually have a proprietary brand embossed on the jar. Early jars embossed with [...] "Mason's Patent November 28th 1858" [...] that date from the late 1850s to early 1860s closely match the illustrations of Mason's 1858 patents. Mouth-blown jars embossed with a version of [...] "Mason's Patent November 28th 1858" [...] were made about 1857 to 1908. By 1908 semi-automatic machines manufactured the majority of these jars. Machine-made Mason jars that originated around 1909 have a sealing surface on a bead ledge below the threads. This type of jar dominated the market by the mid to late 1910s. Manufacturers continued to make jars with the beaded seal after the mid-twentieth century.

30|$|Chopped E-glass fiber (5 to 10 mm long, 200 G.S.M. density) {{manufactured}} by Ciba Geigy and locally supplied by Northern Polymers Ltd., New Delhi, India, {{is used as}} a fiber reinforcement. Commercially available SiC powder also known as carborundum of particle size 25 to 60 μm (density 2.6 g/cm 3) obtained from Silcarb Recrystalized Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India, {{is used as a}} particulate filler. The matrix material consists of epoxy resin LY 556 and room-temperature curing hardener HY 951 supplied by Crystal Chemicals, Delhi, India. The composites were fabricated by blending epoxy resin, glass fiber, and SiC filler in a certain weight percentage reinforcement. Five different compositions of composites were prepared by varying the SiC filler reinforcement with fixed weight percentage (wt.%) of chopped glass fiber reinforcement. SiC filler in five different weight percentages (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt.%) are added with fixed 20 wt.% of chopped glass fiber and remaining epoxy so as to notice the effect of SiC reinforcement on physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of chopped glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composites. The composites were prepared by blending certain weight percentage of fiber/filler and epoxy resin in separate containers and then poured in a mold of desired dimensions. Labeling was done with the help of rollers, and suitable weights were applied on top of the mold. Similarly, five different compositions of fiber, filler, and epoxy resin are poured in separate molds by varying five percentages of SiC filler content with that of the epoxy resin keeping the chopped glass fiber weight percentage as constant. The composites are then left for solidification at room temperature for 24 h. After the solidification process, the composites are then removed from the <b>mold</b> and <b>marking</b> is done as per the test standards. Specimens were prepared as per American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) test standards for tensile, flexural, interlaminar shear strength, impact strength, and hardness tests.|$|R
40|$|Meal {{from the}} brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) Le Jol. is mainly {{used as an}} animal feed supplement. Since moist weed often {{develops}} a <b>marked</b> <b>mold</b> growth and since little was known about the microflora of seaweed meal, a cultural procedure was developed to enumerate the populations of bacteria, yeasts, and molds of seaweed meals manufactured by different drying processes. The microflora could be supported {{by a variety of}} media varying in levels of nutrition and in the source and concentration of salts. Fresh weed contained less than 103 bacteria and less than 102 yeasts and molds per g (dry weight). The type and extent of microbial populations in seaweed meal appeared to be dependent upon the method of seaweed drying. Rotary drum-drying at temperatures decreasing from 800 to 80 C maintained or reduced the microbial populations to 103 organisms per g (dry weight). Although meals with high nutritional quality can be obtained with warm air- or rock-dried weed, these conditions can also permit bacterial and mold development. Extended rock-drying in variable weather conditions and prolonged storage of moist weed, both of which decrease the nutritional quality, also lead to high bacterial numbers and to a marked development of the halophilic brown mold Sporendonema minutum which attained populations of 108 viable spores per g of dried weed. A poultry diet containing 5 % badly molded weed had no apparent toxic or growth-depressing effect when fed to chicks...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} program {{was successful in}} identifying the major factoirs that influence penetration. This was done first through {{a case study of}} penetration samples. The study revealed that both chemical and mechanical penetration were present in carbon and high manganese steels. It also found that only mechanical penetration is found in stainless steel samples. It should be noted that when mechanical penetration does occur, there is a greater risk of chemical reactions with the mold. Therefore, it is common to confuse mechanical penetration with chemical. Sessile drop experiments were run to discover the effect of steel chemistry on the contact angle for different substrates. These experiments revealed the best substrates for each type of metal. Bauxite, magnesite, and mullite were discovered to be the best materials for resisting mechanical penetration. It was also shown that high manganese steels cannot be poured into silica molds and that stainless steel should not be poured in chromite molds. The sessile drop data was used to develop a mechanical penetration model which correctly predicted penetration in sixteen of twenty castings poured at the University of Alabama. Mold/metal atmosphere tests were run to understand the effects of the atmosphere on chemical penetration. It was found that the chemistry affecting penetration has its greatest effect as the casting is just poured. Chemical penetration for low carbon steels cannot be completely eliminated by adding carbon (seacoal) to green sand <b>molds</b> although a <b>marked</b> decrease is obtained in its severity. Extremely high carbon concentrations might be able to totally eliminate the penetration but are not used because of their possible diffusion into the steel causing carburization. A chemical penetration model was produced and its results agree well with the experimental results...|$|R
