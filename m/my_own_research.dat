60|$|During the two years' {{residence}} in Sikkim which succeeded, I was laid under obligations of no ordinary nature to Brian H. Hodgson, Esq., B.C.S., {{for many years}} Resident at the Nepal Court; whose guest I became for several months. Mr. Hodgson's high position {{as a man of}} science requires no mention here; but the difficulties he overcame, and the sacrifices he made, in attaining that position, are known to few. He entered the wilds of Nepal when very young, and in indifferent health; and finding time to spare, cast about for the best method of employing it: he had no one to recommend or direct a pursuit, no example to follow, no rival to equal or surpass; he had never been acquainted with a scientific man, and knew nothing of science except the name. The natural history of men and animals, in its most comprehensive sense, attracted his attention; he sent to Europe for books, and commenced the study of ethnology and zoology. His labours have now extended over upwards of twenty-five years' {{residence in}} the Himalaya. During this period he has seldom had a staff of less than from ten to twenty persons (often many more), of various tongues and races, employed as translators and collectors, artists, shooters, and stuffers. By unceasing exertions and a princely liberality, Mr. Hodgson has unveiled the mysteries of the Boodhist religion, chronicled the affinities, languages, customs, and faiths of the Himalayan tribes; and completed a natural history of the animals and birds of these regions. His collections of specimens are immense, and are illustrated by drawings and descriptions taken from life, with remarks on the anatomy,* [In this department he availed himself of the services of Dr. Campbell, who was also attached to the Residency at Nepal, as surgeon and assistant political agent.] habits, and localities of the animals themselves. Twenty volumes of the Journals, and the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, teem with the proofs of his indefatigable zeal; and throughout the cabinets of the bird and quadruped departments of our national museum, Mr. Hodgson's name stands pre-eminent. A seat in the Institute of France, and the cross of the Legion of Honour, prove the estimation in which his Boodhist studies are held on the continent of Europe. To be welcomed to the Himalaya by such a person, and to be allowed the most unreserved intercourse, and the advantage of all his information and library, exercised a material influence on the progress I made in my studies, and on my travels. When I add that many of the subjects treated of in these volumes were discussed between us, it will be evident that it is impossible for me to divest much of the information thus insensibly obtained, of the appearance of being the fruits of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Scott, and all Swift's {{editors and}} biographers, state that [...] "The Presbyterians' Plea of Merit" [...] was first {{published}} in 1731. What authority they have for this statement, I {{have not been able to}} discover. <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>research</b> has, so far, failed to find a copy of it with the date, 1731, on the title-page. The edition upon which the present text is based, is that printed by Faulkner in 1733, of the title-page of which, a facsimile is here given. This, I believe to be the first edition. Scott, following Nichols, states that in the first edition of [...] "The Plea," [...] the [...] "Ode to Humphry French, Esq.," [...] appeared, and that in the second edition, this ode was omitted to make room for the [...] "Narrative of the Several Attempts made for the Repeal of the Test Act." [...] Now in the British Museum, there are two undated editions of [...] "The Plea," [...] which bear out this statement; but these, as the title-pages inform us, are London reprints of Dublin editions. Since, however, no one has recorded dated Dublin editions corresponding exactly to these London reprints, the evidence of the reprints counts for very little. Monck Mason, a very accurate authority, usually, says distinctly, [...] "The Plea" [...] was printed in 1731, and a second edition issued in 1733; but one gathers from his note that the only edition in his possession was that of 1733, and this has neither the [...] "Ode" [...] nor the [...] "Narrative"; the last page consisting of an advertisement of the collected editions of Swift's works, which Faulkner was then preparing. The first of the London reprints bears no indication of any particular edition; the second has the words [...] "second edition" [...] on the title-page. In his note to this reprint of the [...] "Narrative," [...] and in his [...] "Life of Swift," [...] Scott refers to a Dublin periodical called [...] "The Correspondent" [...] (in which the [...] "Narrative" [...] {{was first published}}) as being printed in 1731. The only edition of this periodical, of which I have either seen or heard, is the copy in the British Museum, and that copy distinctly states: [...] "Printed by James Hoey in Skinner-Row, 1733." [...] If, therefore, this be the first edition of [...] "The Correspondent," [...] the [...] "Narrative" [...] must be ascribed to the year 1733, and the second edition of [...] "The Plea" [...] to the end of the same, or the beginning of the following year. I conclude, therefore, first, that the first edition of [...] "The Plea" [...] is that dated [...] "Dublin, 1733;" [...] second, that the undated London reprint with the [...] "Ode" [...] is of the same year; and, lastly, that the undated second London reprint with the [...] "Narrative," [...] is probably of the year, 1734. Examining Scott's text of this tract, one is forced to the conclusion that he could not have seen the Dublin edition of 1733; whereas, its almost exact similarity to the London reprint suggests that he used that. For purposes of the present text all three editions have been collated with one another, and with those given by Faulkner, Hawkesworth and Scott.|$|E

After presenting this conceptual framework I apply it to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> doctoral <b>research</b> to show how the social-material affordances of an Institute of Education PhD thesis interacted with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> personal, professional and political interests to influence the form of my research output.

He taped it with his daughter and sent it; Noble commented [...] "And that was it, off that tape. This is so unusual. Off that tape, I was cast as Walter Bishop. Just unheard of." [...] "I think at my better moments, there is a lot of me in Walter -- I hope not including his mental illness -- but in the strange sense of humor and the general interest in things."

It misses the point, in a way, to think any other way about it.

Walter would have been subjected to electroshock therapy, so that was something I looked into, what the short- and long-term effects might be. I made all of that part of Walter."
