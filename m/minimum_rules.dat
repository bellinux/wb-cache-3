40|$|Part 6 : Decision AlgorithmsInternational audienceIn {{rough set}} theory, {{not too much}} work pays {{attention}} to the acquisition of decision rules and to the uses of the obtained rule set as classifier to predict data. In fact, rough set theory also {{can be applied to}} train data and create classifiers and then complete data prediction. This paper systematically studies the problem of acquisition of decision rules in decision systems. The main outcomes of this research are as follows: (1) the specific definition of <b>minimum</b> <b>rule</b> set is given, and such a <b>minimum</b> <b>rule</b> set {{can be used as a}} classifier to predict new data; (2) a new approach to finding out all <b>minimum</b> <b>rule</b> sets for a decision system, Algorithm 1, is proposed based on discrimination function, but with relatively low execution efficiency; (3) By improving Algorithm 1, a heuristic approach to computing a special <b>minimum</b> <b>rule</b> set, Algorithm 3, is proposed, which works far more efficiently than Algorithm 1. The outcomes can form the foundation for applying rough set theory to data classification and offer a new resolution to data classification...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an intelligent scissoring operator for meshes. Unlike common approaches that segment a mesh using clustering schemes, here we introduce {{a method that}} concentrates on the contours for cutting. Our approach {{is based on the}} <b>minima</b> <b>rule</b> and part salience theory from the cognitive theory. The <b>minima</b> <b>rule</b> states that human perception usually divides a surface into parts along the concave discontinuity of the tangent plane. The part salience theory provides factors which determine the salience of segments. Our method first extracts features to find candidate contours based on the <b>minima</b> <b>rule.</b> Subsequently, these open contours are prioritized to select the most salient one. Then, the selected open contour is automatically completed to form a loop around a specific part of the mesh. This loop is used as the initial position of a 3 D geometric snake. Before applying a snake, we measure the part salience of the segments obtained by the completed contour. If conditions for the salience are not met, the contour is rejected. Otherwise, the snake moves by relaxation until it settles to define the final scissoring position. In this paper, we focus on a fully automatic scissoring scheme; nevertheless, we also report on semi-automatic user interfaces for intelligent scissoring which are easy to use and intuitive. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>minimum</b> <b>rule</b> base Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Fuzzy backstepping Controller is {{presented}} in this research. The popularity of PID Fuzzy backstepping controller {{can be attributed to}} their robust performance {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions and partly to their functional simplicity. The process of setting of PID Fuzzy backstepping controller can be determined as an optimization task. Over the years, use of intelligent strategies for tuning of these controllers has been growing. PID methodology has three inputs and if any input is described with seven linguistic values, and any rule has three conditions we will need 7 × 7 × 7 = 343 rules. It is too much work to write 343 rules. In this research the PID-like fuzzy controller can be constructed as a parallel structure of a PD-like fuzzy controller and a PI-like controller to have the <b>minimum</b> <b>rule</b> base. However backstepping controller is work based on cancelling decoupling and nonlinear terms of dynamic parameters of each link, this controller is work based on manipulator dynamic model and this technique is highly sensitive to the knowledge of all parameters of nonlinear robot manipulator‟s dynamic equation. This research is used to reduce or eliminate the backstepping controller problem based on <b>minimum</b> <b>rule</b> base fuzzy logic theory to control of flexible robot manipulator system and testing of the quality of process control in the simulation environment of MATLAB/SIMULINK Simulator.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to extract concave and convex feature regions via segmenting surface mesh of a mechanical part whose surface geometry exhibits drastic variations and concave-convex features are equally important when modeling. Referring to the original approach based on the <b>minima</b> <b>rule</b> (MR) in cognitive science, we have created a revised <b>minima</b> <b>rule</b> (RMR) and presented an improved approach based on RMR in the paper. Using the logarithmic function in terms of the minimum curvatures that are normalized by the expectation and the standard deviation on the vertices of the mesh, we determined the solution formulas for the feature vertices according to RMR. Because only a small range of the threshold parameters was selected from in the determined formulas, an iterative process was implemented to realize the automatic selection of thresholds. Finally according to the obtained feature vertices, the feature edges and facets were obtained by growing neighbors. The improved approach overcomes the inherent inadequacies of the original approach for our objective in the paper, realizes full automation without setting parameters, and obtains better results compared with the latest conventional approaches. We demonstrated the feasibility and superiority of our approach by performing certain experimental comparisons...|$|R
