5|$|Some comets meet a <b>more</b> <b>spectacular</b> end – either {{falling into}} the Sun or smashing into a planet or other body. Collisions between comets and planets or moons were common in the early Solar System: {{some of the many}} craters on the Moon, for example, may have been caused by comets. A recent {{collision}} of a comet with a planet occurred in July 1994 when Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 broke up into pieces and collided with Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} <b>more</b> <b>spectacular</b> pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests {{continued}} to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E

5|$|By {{this point}} XXXVI Corps had reached total exhaustion. With the {{transfer}} of the SS Division Nord to the south, and a return of the Finnish 6th Division to III Corps, Feige deemed any further advance in this sector impossible. With the Soviets bringing more reinforcements to the front every day, Feige requested more men if he was to start a new attack. Plans were made by AOK Norwegen for a resumption of the offensive, but the German High Command was unable to reinforce the Arctic theatre with additional units and AOK Norwegen could not send anything meaningful itself to aid Feige. Consequently, all offensive plans were scrapped. Due to the <b>more</b> <b>spectacular</b> gains at the main front in Central Russia during Operation Barbarossa, the OKW deemed the current situation acceptable and an end was ordered to the offensive operations of XXXVI Corps. This, combined with heavy German casualties, led to the attack finally being called off at the end of September.|$|E
5|$|English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson cast strong doubts {{upon the}} {{authenticity}} of the Grolier Codex in his 1975 article The Grolier Codex, published in volume 27 of the Contributions of the University of California. Thompson argued that the codex was a modern forgery and that the unusual mix of styles in the document was not due to the mixing of cultures but rather due to the hand of a forger. Thompson queried the illustration of all four stations of Venus in the codex, noting that other Mesoamerican codices only illustrated the <b>more</b> <b>spectacular</b> appearance of Venus as morning star. This claim has been refuted more recently, with evidence presented from the Codex Telleriano-Remensis that the god of the morning star also presided over the evening star. The contents of the document have not been copied directly from any of the generally accepted Maya codices, although they do resemble pages 46 to 50 of the Dresden Codex.|$|E
5|$|Leopold {{wanted to}} begin the tour as soon as possiblethe younger the {{children}} were, the <b>more</b> <b>spectacular</b> would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, {{as well as the}} great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1930s Christiné {{contributed to}} the renewed fashion for <b>more</b> {{large-scale}} <b>spectacular</b> musicals, with pieces for the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, Au temps des Merveilleuses and Yana; for these he wrote the more vibrant numbers, while Richepin did the romantic songs. [...] "Le Bonheur, Mesdames" [...] and [...] "Le Flirt ambulant" [...] were rearrangements of his songs from the 1900s. He died in Nice, France.|$|R
5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended to be much <b>more</b> <b>spectacular.</b> Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by {{the owners of the}} salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the historians}} Oscar Brockett and Franklin Hildy, rituals {{typically}} include elements that entertain or give pleasure, such as costumes and masks {{as well as}} skilled performers.

As this occurred, the first steps towards theatre as an autonomous activity were being taken.|$|R

25|$|Marine fishkeeping is {{different}} from its freshwater counterpart because of the fundamental differences in the constitution of saltwater and the resulting differences in the adaptation of its inhabitants. A stable marine aquarium requires more equipment than freshwater systems, and generally requires more stringent water quality monitoring. The inhabitants of a marine aquarium are often difficult to acquire and are usually more expensive than freshwater aquarium inhabitants. However, the inhabitants of saltwater aquariums are usually much <b>more</b> <b>spectacular</b> than freshwater aquarium fish.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the early}} Tudor kings, {{magnificent}} royal palaces were constructed in north-eastern Surrey, conveniently close to London. At Richmond an existing royal residence was rebuilt {{on a grand}} scale under King Henry VII, who also founded a Franciscan friary nearby in 1499. The still <b>more</b> <b>spectacular</b> palace of Nonsuch was later built for Henry VIII near Ewell. The palace at Guildford Castle had fallen out of use long before, but a royal hunting lodge existed outside the town. All these have since been demolished.|$|E

25|$|Oleg Tinkoff has {{repeatedly}} criticized the bureaucratization of professional cycling and outdated sponsorship model.

Tinkoff also stands for Grand Tour schedule, which will enable the strongest riders to perform at each of them during the season.

25|$|In late March 1966 in Michigan, {{two days}} of mass UFO {{sightings}} were reported, and received significant publicity. After studying the reports, Hynek offered a provisional hypothesis {{for some of the}} sightings: a few of about 100 witnesses had mistaken swamp gas for something <b>more</b> <b>spectacular.</b> At the press conference where he made his announcement, Hynek repeatedly and strenuously stated that swamp gas was a plausible explanation for only a portion of the Michigan UFO reports, and certainly not for UFO reports in general. But much to his chagrin, Hynek's qualifications of his hypothesis were largely overlooked, and the term swamp gas was repeated ad infinitum in relation to UFO reports. The explanation was subject to national derision.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} to build {{was certainly a}} hasty one as a field of growing corn was cut down to lay the foundations. The family moved to temporary lodging at Colyton House in nearby Colyton where they remained for two years.

Clearly the old site was considered unsuitable, perhaps being too close to the village and parish church of Shute, and whilst the mediaeval house may have been sited with its defensibility as a prime criterion, the new site was <b>more</b> <b>spectacular</b> and had views to the sea.|$|E

25|$|Rhodes shot to fame after South Africa's fifth {{game of the}} World Cup, against Pakistan on the 8 March 1992 at the Brisbane Cricket Ground. South Africa batted first, scoring 211 off 50 overs. Pakistan's innings {{was reduced}} to 36 overs because of rain interruptions, with the target revised from 212 to 194 runs. Inzamam-ul-Haq and Pakistan captain Imran Khan resumed the innings when play was restarted. With the score at 135/2 Inzamam, {{who was at the}} time on 48, set off for a run but was turned back by Khan. The ball had rolled out towards Rhodes who ran in from {{backward}} point, gathered the ball and raced the retreating Inzamam to the wicket. Rhodes, with ball in hand, dived full length to break the stumps and effect the run out. The run out, the subject of a famous photograph, is still considered one of the <b>more</b> <b>spectacular</b> feats of that World Cup and the defining moment of Rhodes' career. Pakistan's innings faltered from then on, eventually finishing on 173/8 with South Africa winning by twenty runs.|$|E

Last evening we had high clouds, broken white and golden, flung disorderly, generously, over the western half of the sky, while in the east was painted a second sunset--a reflection, perhaps, of the first. At any rate, the eastern sky was a bank of pale clouds that shed soft, spread rays of blue and white upon a blue-grey sea.|$|R

The maximum duration of flight of the rocket pack was 21 seconds, with a range of only 120 m. A large contingent of service personnel needed to accompany the rocket pack. During flight 5 U.S. gallons (19 liters) of hydrogen peroxide was expended.
