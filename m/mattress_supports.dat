40|$|Every {{year over}} 1 million {{hospital}} patients develop bedsores due to poor <b>mattress</b> <b>support.</b> Bedsores {{can be avoided}} {{with the use of}} pressure relieving <b>mattress</b> <b>support.</b> This project investigated and characterized the material properties of five types of flexible foam and applied results to a computational evaluation of foam pressure profiles under given loading conditions to find the optimal foam. Characterizing the material properties of flexible foam, a hyperelastic material, was not a straightforward task. Initially, mechanical testing was performed on small samples of each foam to determine compression stress, strain, force, deflection and stress relaxation characteristics. Next, Neo-Hookean, Mooney Rivlin and Ogden Constitutive models were fit to the experimental data to quantify the hyperelastic behavior of each foam. The Neo-Hookean model fit the data for the first 25 % nominal strain, while the Ogden model fit the entire range of nominal strain. The Mooney Rivlin model did not correlate well with the experimental data. Then, a finite element model was developed to simulate a person lying on a mattress. While the sacral region is the most common location for pressure sores, a model of a human buttock was included to simulate the pressure profiles. The material properties and loads obtained from experimental testing and constitutive model curve fitting were applied to the simulated foam block. Finally, the finite element model was validated through a series of mechanical tests matching the simulation conditions. An anatomical buttocks form was provided to duplicate the simulation buttocks model. The results showed that the simulations accurately represent the loading conditions up to 25 % nominal strain. Additional test conditions were used to compare stress relaxation results with the small sample mechanical tests and demonstrate cyclic loading conditions. The only substantial difference in stress relaxation values was with the memory foam sample. The small sample testing setup may have inhibited the memory foam from giving the proper results. Cyclic loading revealed the relative degrees of nonlinearity for each foam. Overall, this project was successful in characterizing material behavior of five different types of flexible foam, applying constitutive behavior models and integrating into simulation tools for further analysis. A recommendation was made to use the memory foam for medical applications, as it possesses excellent durability, support and pressure relief characteristics. ...|$|R

40|$|Prolonged {{mechanical}} loading {{can lead to}} breakdown of skin and underlying tissues which can, in turn, develop into a pressure ulcer. The benefits of pressure relief and/or redistribution to minimise risk have been well documented and these strategies can be provided by employing <b>support</b> <b>mattresses</b> in which internal air pressures can be alternated to minimise the risk of pressure ulcers in patients during prolonged periods of bed-rest. The paper describes {{the performance of a}} prototype alternating pressure air mattress (APAM), in terms of its ability to maintain skin viability in a group of healthy volunteers lying in a supine position. In particular, the mattress includes a sacral section supported with alternating low pressure (ALP), with values adjusted to subject morphology, using an in-built pressure sensor. The <b>mattress</b> was <b>supported</b> at four different head of bed (HOB) angles ranging from 0 to 60 °. Internal mattress pressures and transcutaneous gas (TcPO 2 /TcPCO 2) tensions at the sacrum and a control site, the scapula, were monitored. Interface pressures were also measured. The sensor was found {{to be sensitive to the}} BMI values of the 12 healthy volunteers. In the majority of test conditions the internal support produced sacral TcPO 2 values, which either remained similar to those at the scapula or fluctuated at levels providing adequate viability. However in a few cases, associated with a raised HOB angle (? 45 °), there was compromise to the skin viability at the sacrum, as reflected in depressed TcPO 2 levels associated with an elevation of TcPCO 2 levels above the normal range. In all cases, interface pressures at the sacrum rarely exceeded 60 mmHg. Although such studies need to be extended to involve bed-bound individuals, the results offer the potential for the development of intelligent APAM systems, whose characteristics can be adjusted to an individual morphology. Such preventive strategies to maintain skin viability at loaded sites will be designed for subjects deemed to be at high risk of developing pressure ulcers...|$|R

40|$|Collisions with fixed {{obstacles}} during {{alpine ski}} competitions or recreational skiing seldom occur, {{but if they}} do the consequences can be severe, particularly in the case of competitions in which safety barriers are mandatory. Despite its importance, a standard method for evaluating the crashworthiness of such equipment has not yet been established. The aim of this work was to develop a full scale impact test method suitable for safety barriers commonly installed during Ski World Cup events. The construction and layout of different ski safety barriers, the type of rear support, and the impact speed varied throughout the tests. Peak decelerations and penetration values were measured during the impact of a dummy against a barrier. Tests were performed on B-nets with different poles and on air mattresses and foam mattresses placed on ground soil with properties similar to average snow. The <b>mattresses</b> were <b>supported</b> either by poles or by a rigid concrete wall. Tests on foam mattresses placed against the wall were conducted at increasing speeds in order to evaluate the relationship between peak deceleration and impact speed. A tower pendulum 30 m in length was used to accelerate a wooden dummy with a mass of 85 kg up to a maximum speed of about 65 km/h. The dummy was instrumented at the center of mass with a tri-axial accelerometer, equipped with a data acquisition system, and released just before impact. Impacts were fllmed using a high speed video camera. Fiberglass poles were the most effective in containing the dummy. Tests on foam mattresses against the concrete wall revealed a linear relationship between peak deceleration and speed. The method allowed analysis of the behavior of mattresses and B-nets, giving quantitative indications to manufacturers and to ski safety operators for the appropriate selection of safety barriers during competitions and in ski resorts...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1980s you couldn't {{drive through}} Houston without seeing a Gilley's bumper sticker on people's car. Fans would steal tiles from the {{acoustical}} ceiling {{because they were}} stamped with the club's logo. After The Urban Cowboy movie Gilley's added an indoor rodeo arena. Eventually, the night club increased in size to an incredible 48000 sq ft capable of holding 6,000 people.There was a Texas-size bar and huge Texas-size dance floors. Gilley's was so big {{that you could not}} see {{from one end of the}} club to the other. Everywhere you looked Gilley's had fun things happening on the property. Open seven nights a week 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. The club had dozens of pool tables, many pinball machines, video arcade and punching bag games. Strong-arm wrestling games. There were mechanical bulls, mechanical horses, mechanical calves. The <b>mattresses</b> that <b>supported</b> the fall from the bull were supplied by Cryer. He would ride around Pasadena with various tips for mattresses that were being thrown out. Gilley's had staged everything from Dolly Parton look-alike contests to tricycle races. The cowboys looked so funny trying to ride the tricycles but they would fall off and make everyone laugh. It was the mechanical bull that made the cowboys come in every night. Crystal Gale was a featured entertainer at the club with hundreds other country singers. Cryer and Gilley thought there would be a lot of lawsuits but there were none. With a sign bearing [...] "Ride At Your Own Risk" [...] they did just that. Men would come down and get on to impress their girls. But when it finally threw them they would get back on and yell,"Turn it up"!. The bull has since then been popularized because of Cryer.|$|R
50|$|There are {{variations}} in the traditional birthing positions. In one, a folded <b>mattress</b> would be <b>supporting</b> a woman’s back while her husband would provide support sitting behind her and letting her grab onto his thighs. There would be foot supports made out of bamboo that a woman can push on during contractions. In another position, a woman would be sitting, with Mo Tamaye supporting her from behind, and would pull on a rope that is {{hanging from the ceiling}} to alleviate some pain. The woman must {{take an active role in}} the process by breathing and pushing with contractions, with the help of Mo Tamaye. In a medical setting, a woman would most likely have limited options for positions and would be laid flat on the bed to deliver. Culturally, there is no need to keep silent during the birthing process, but pain management is available in most clinics. There are no data regarding the use of fetal monitoring; however, it is likely used in the westernized hospital settings, which would limit woman's mobility during labor. Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok is currently the only hospital in the country that offers natural and water birth.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveA need {{exists for}} a stable annuloplasty method for aortic valve repair. On {{the basis of}} a “hemispherical” model of aortic valve geometry, a {{prototype}} annuloplasty frame was constructed and initially tested. Specific goals were to develop a clinically applicable transaortic implant technique and to evaluate the system in isolated and intact animal preparations. MethodsEight isolated porcine aortic roots were perfused from a water reservoir at a constant pressure of 100  mm Hg, and valve leak was measured by timed collection in a beaker. Baseline leak was negligible, and the 2 commissures adjacent to the right coronary leaflet were incised vertically to create severe valve insufficiency. Through a transverse aortotomy, a “hemispherical” annuloplasty frame was sutured to the aortic valve annulus with horizontal mattress sutures. The 3 posts of the frame were sutured first to the 3 subcommissural regions to align the device horizontally and vertically. The 3 frame curvatures then were sutured into the leaflet annuli using horizontal <b>mattress</b> “looping” sutures, <b>supported</b> with supra-annular pledgets. Post-repair valve leak was measured, and significance of the change was assessed with a 2 -tailed paired t test. One survival implant was evaluated in an intact calf. ResultsSubcommissural incision disrupted annular geometry and created a valve leak of 1400 ± 847 mL/min (mean ± standard deviation). Suturing the 3 -dimensional annuloplasty frame into the aortic valve annulus reestablished appropriate geometry of leaflet coaptation and restored valve competence, with a reduction in valve leak to 102 ± 86 mL/min (P = . 004). After 6 weeks of chronic calf implantation, the frame was well healed and the native valve functioned normally. ConclusionsTransaortic insertion of a “hemispherical” annuloplasty frame into severely disrupted and insufficient porcine aortic valves routinely and effectively restored valve competence. These data support the continued development and testing of this device as a stable method of annuloplasty during aortic valve repair...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pressure sores {{affect people}} {{who are unable to}} change {{position}} regularly. Sustained pressure on those areas which support the body leads to reduced blood supply and eventually death of the skin and underlying muscles (a pressure sore). There are two main approaches to preventing these sores; (1) use of a conforming support surface to distribute the body weight over a large area; (2) use of an alternating support surface where inflatable cells alternately inflate and deflate. Treatment of pressure sores also requires reduction of pressures at the damaged area of skin. Special support surfaces, aimed at pressure redistribution, including beds, mattresses and cushions, are widely used and range. It is unclear to what extent these surfaces can prevent or treat pressure sores and whether any system is better than any other. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of pressure relieving beds, <b>mattresses</b> and cushions (<b>support</b> surfaces) in the prevention and treatment of pressure sores. Search strategy: Searches of 19 databases, hand searching of journals, conference proceedings, and bibliographies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials evaluating support surfaces for the prevention or treatment of pressure sores. There was no restriction on articles based on language or publication status. Data collection and analysis: Data extraction and assessment of study quality were undertaken by two reviewers independently. Trials with similar patients, comparisons, and outcomes were pooled. Where pooling was inappropriate, trials are discussed in a narrative review. Main results: Prevention: Twenty nine RCTs of support surfaces for pressure sore prevention were identified. Some high specification foam mattresses were more effective than 'standard' hospital foam mattresses in moderate-high risk patients. Pressure relieving mattresses in the operating theatre reduced the incidence of pressure sores post-operatively. The relative merits of alternating and constant low pressure, and of the different alternating pressure devices are unclear. Seat cushions and simple, constant low-pressure devices have not been adequately evaluated. Limited evidence suggests that low air loss beds reduce the incidence of pressure sores in intensive care. Treatment: Six RCTs of support surfaces for pressure sore treatment were identified. There is good evidence that air-fluidised and low air loss beds improve healing rates. Seat cushions have not been adequately evaluated. Two RCTs evaluated surfaces for both prevention and treatment in the same trial...|$|R
