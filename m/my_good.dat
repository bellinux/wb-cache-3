25|$|I had {{carefully}} learned to understand, about that experience which I could have upon things of rule, how fortune is failing or great, subject to such rule in common, so that otherwise I {{would have had}} scant reason to desire such a rule, had I not found myself obliged to it through God’s bidding and nature. Now it was of my acquaintance, that inasmuch as God had let me be born a prince, such as I then am born, then <b>my</b> <b>good</b> and my destruction were knotted into one with the common good; for every reason then, it was now my promise that I should take great pains about their well-being and good governance and management, and thereabout bear close concern.|$|E
25|$|Today, I, a faithless sinner, renew in {{your hands}} my Baptismal vows; I renounce Satan forever, his pomps and works; and I give myself entirely to Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Wisdom, and will carry my cross after Him all the days of my life, and will be more {{faithful}} to Him than I have ever been. With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my Mother. I deliver and consecrate myself to you, my body and soul, myself, both interior and exterior, and the worth of <b>my</b> <b>good</b> actions, past, present and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of me, and all that belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity.|$|E

500|$|Finally, in {{an essay}} called Origin of a Hero {{discussing}} his novel the Rector of Justin, author Louis Auchincloss says the main character was not based on a headmaster; certainly not as was often speculated Groton's famous Endicott Peabody. [...] "If you want to disguise a real life character," [...] Auchincloss advised fellow novelists, [...] "just change his profession." [...] His actual model for the Rector of Justin was [...] "the greatest man it has been <b>my</b> <b>good</b> luck to know" [...] Judge Learned Hand.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to Jefferson's sentiments George Washington, {{who had been}} calling for constitutional reform for many years, {{wrote in a letter}} to Henry Lee, [...] "You talk, <b>my</b> <b>good</b> sir, of employing influence to appease the present tumults in Massachusetts. I know not where that influence is to be found, or, if attainable, that it would be a proper remedy for the disorders. Influence is not government. Let us have a government by which our lives, liberties, and properties will be secured, or let us know the worst at once." ...|$|E
500|$|Some reports however {{indicate}} that the legend was not seriously accepted: Carlyle suggests one near-eyewitness French account amounted to [...] "not a recantation of an impudent amazing falsehood, but to some vague faint murmur or whimper of admission {{that it is probably}} false". Captain Diaz de Soria relates the story, probably apocryphal, that in 1840, the Prince of Joinville, while decorating the purported last survivor of Vengeur, would have told him [...] "we do this for the legend, <b>my</b> <b>good</b> man: nations, after all, live only of legends". In 1857, Guérin wrote [...] "one wonders how, after that, history could remain so credulous".|$|E
500|$|Of {{literary}} figures {{after the}} Lake Poets among those most {{closely associated with}} Keswick was the novelist Hugh Walpole. In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange {{at the opposite end}} of Derwentwater. Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, [...] "That I love Cumberland with all my heart and soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books. That I wasn't born a Cumbrian isn't my fault: that Cumbrians, in spite of my 'foreignness', have been so kind to me, is <b>my</b> <b>good</b> fortune." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the opening}} song, [...] "Rusty Cage", Thayil uses a wah pedal as an audio filter, {{producing}} an unusual guitar sound. In describing the song's guitar riff {{he said that}} it [...] "almost sounds backward". Soundgarden utilized alternative tunings and odd time signatures on several of the album's songs. On [...] "Rusty Cage", [...] "Holy Water", and [...] "Searching with <b>My</b> <b>Good</b> Eye Closed", the bottom E string is tuned down to B. On [...] "Mind Riot" [...] every string is tuned to one of several E's. Soundgarden's use of odd-meter time signatures was varied as well. Thayil said that he didn't [...] "push for weird time signatures", but rather [...] "push to get the quirkiness out of things".|$|E
500|$|From 1913 to 1921, Crothers {{served as}} a judge of the Superior Court in San Francisco, California. [...] One case which came before him {{involved}} a physician whose license had been revoked by the State Board of Medical Examiners for performing an abortion. [...] Judge Crothers refused to overturn the board's revocation on technical grounds, and his decision was upheld on appeal. [...] Even after Crothers' retirement from the bench and his return to private law practice, he was {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Judge" [...] throughout the rest of his life. [...] In a 1956 letter, former U.S. president (and Stanford classmate) Herbert Hoover wrote, [...] "Judge George E. Crothers was <b>my</b> <b>good</b> friend in bad times and in good times for over sixty years".|$|E
500|$|Although the {{fighting}} ceased {{and the two}} commands of troops had cleared the palace, the mob was still everywhere outside. The rank and file of both the Flanders Regiment and another regular unit present, the Montmorency Dragoons, now appeared unwilling to act against the people. Lafayette, who had earned the court's indebtedness, convinced the king to address the crowd. When the two men stepped out on a balcony an unexpected cry went up: [...] "Vive le Roi!" [...] The relieved king briefly conveyed his willingness to return to Paris, acceding [...] "to the love of <b>my</b> <b>good</b> and faithful subjects". As the crowd cheered, Lafayette stoked their joy by dramatically pinning a tricolor cockade to the hat of the king's nearest bodyguard.|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson heralded {{the return}} of the series, declaring [...] "Fringe comes {{crashing}} headlong back onto television. That's not just a metaphor. Before we even fade in we have two cars smashing into each other. What a way to return: an accident in which one driver is nowhere to be found and the other flees into a nearby apartment, smooches his face and then uses a strange device to rearrange his appearance. That's <b>my</b> <b>good</b> old Fringe." [...] The Futon Critic rated [...] "A New Day in the Old Town" [...] the sixteenth best television episode of 2010, while website blogger io9 listed it as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E

On 21 May 2007 Ellis-Bextor's third studio album Trip the Light Fantastic was released under Fascination Records. For the album, Ellis-Bextor worked with several writers and producers such as Greg Kurstin, Xenomania and Dimitri Tikovoi, which went towards an electro, pop and dance atmosphere.

500|$|The Heroes of the Lance are {{the protagonists}} of the Chronicles trilogy, the first series of Dragonlance books. They {{were created by}} Weis and Hickman, then fleshed out as player {{characters}} in gaming sessions of Dungeons & Dragons at Hickman's apartment.

According to Hickman in the foreword to The Soulforge, [...] " [...] were just settling in to the game when I turned to <b>my</b> <b>good</b> friend Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing. Terry spoke...and the world of Krynn was forever changed. His rasping voice, his sarcasm and bitterness all masking an arrogance and power that never needed to be stated suddenly were real. Everyone {{in the room was}} both transfixed and terrified. To this day Margaret [...] swears that Terry wore the black robes to the party that night." ...|$|E

500|$|St. Laurent and the Liberals {{suffered}} {{other problems}} during the campaign. According to Newman, St. Laurent sometimes seemed {{unaware of what}} was happening around him, and at one campaign stop, shook hands with the reporters who were following him, under the apparent impression they were local voters. On the evening of Diefenbaker's Vancouver speech, St. Laurent drew 400voters to a rally in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where he had once lived. C.D. Howe, under heavy pressure from the campaign of CCF candidate Doug Fisher in his Ontario riding, intimated that Fisher had communist links. At a rally in Manitoba, Howe offended a voter who told him the farmers were starving to death, poking the voter in the stomach and saying [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government." [...] At another rally, Howe dismissed a persistent Liberal questioner, saying [...] "Look here, <b>my</b> <b>good</b> man, when the election comes, why don't you just go away and vote for the party you support? In fact, why don't you just go away?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Kill the Lights" [...] is {{an urban}} and dance-pop song that alludes to Spears {{conflict}} with the paparazzi, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "Mr. Photographer / I think I'm ready for my close-up / Tonight / Make sure you catch me from <b>my</b> <b>good</b> side". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said the song features [...] "amid electronic blips and ominous artificial strings and horns", while Spears [...] "alternately invites photographers closer and fends them off. 'They all wanna see', she warns prospective stars. 'Is life {{going to get the}} best of you?'". [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] features a similar theme to Spears' [...] "Piece of Me" [...] (2007) and was considered its sequel, while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone said the song [...] "recalls the synth crush of 2007's Blackout." [...] Music critics criticized the fact that Spears is introduced by Danja as [...] "Our very own Pop princess / Now Queen of Pop", commenting that the honorific nickname [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] is attributed to American recording artist Madonna, while describing her vocals as heavily produced.|$|E
500|$|At the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Jenner {{achieved}} five personal bests on {{the first}} day of the men's decathlona [...] "home run"despite being in second place behind Guido Kratschmer of West Germany. Jenner was confident: [...] "The second day has all <b>my</b> <b>good</b> events. If everything works out all right, we should be ahead after it's all over." [...] Following a rainstorm on the second day, Jenner had a strong but cautious showing in the hurdles and discus, then personal bests in the pole vault, when Jenner took the lead, and javelin. By that point, victory was virtually assured, but it remained to be seen by how much Jenner would improve the record. In the final event—the 1500 meters, which was seen live on national television—Jenner looked content to finish the long competition. Jenner sprinted the last lap, making up a 50-meter deficit and nearly catching the event favorite, Soviet Leonid Litvinenko, who was already well out of contention for the gold medal, but whose personal best had been eight seconds better than Jenner's personal best before the race. Jenner set a new personal best time and won the gold medal with a world-record score of 8,616 points.|$|E
