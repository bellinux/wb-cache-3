25|$|For a given {{quantity}} of a consumer good, the {{point on the}} demand curve indicates the value, or marginal utility, to consumers for that unit.

The corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost, the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a perfectly competitive <b>market,</b> <b>supply</b> and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.|$|E

Furthermore, in the long run potential competitors can enter or exit the industry in response to market conditions.
