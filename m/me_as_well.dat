25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and I really wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E

The song's lyrics were {{inspired}} by the question [...] "Why does God look our way?", which the band's lead singer Bart Millard's pastor used to ask to his congregation.

500|$|King William, {{who was in}} the Netherlands, {{wrote to}} Marlborough, [...] "It is so great a loss to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as to all England, that it pierces my heart." [...] Anne was {{prostrate}} with grief, taking to her chamber. In the evenings, she was carried into the garden [...] "to divert her melancholy thoughts". Gloucester's body was moved from Windsor to Westminster on the night of 1 August, and he lay in state in the Palace of Westminster before being entombed in the Royal Vault of the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey on 9 August. As was usual for royalty in mourning, his parents did not attend the funeral service, instead remaining in seclusion at Windsor.|$|E
500|$|Harrison acted quite {{independently}} {{in selecting}} his cabinet, {{much to the}} dismay of the Republican bosses. He began by delaying the presumed nomination of James G. Blaine as Secretary of State so as to preclude Blaine's involvement {{in the formation of the}} administration, as had occurred in President Garfield's term. In fact, other than Blaine, the only Republican boss initially nominated was Redfield Proctor, as Secretary of War. Senator Shelby Cullom's comment symbolizes Harrison's steadfast aversion to use federal positions for patronage: [...] "I suppose Harrison treated <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as he did any other Senator; but whenever he did anything for me, it was done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather than please." [...] Harrison's selections shared particular alliances – such as their service in the Civil War, Indiana citizenship and membership in the Presbyterian Church. Nevertheless, Harrison with these choices had alienated pivotal Republican operatives from New York to Pennsylvania to Iowa and prematurely compromised his political power and future. Harrison's normal schedule provided for two full cabinet meetings per week, as well as separate weekly one-on-one meetings with each cabinet member.|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} progressed, th character's {{popularity}} soared and Ramirez garnered widespread recognition and critical acclaim for her {{portrayal of a}} complex character on television. Reviewing the performances of Ramirez and Jessica Capshaw an episode of the eleventh season, Maggie Fremont of Vulture called them, [...] "goddesses walking amongst mere mortals". Rhimes wrote of Ramirez's work on the show: [...] "Dr. Callie Torres came into our lives dancing it out in her underwear almost a decade ago, and I could not be happier or more proud of her journey. Sara Ramirez’s performance inspired <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as millions of fans each week." [...] Ramirez was nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Television Series at the Alma Awards, in 2007 and 2008. Also in 2007, at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the cast of Grey's Anatomy, were the recipients of the Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

500|$|In the Gold Medal {{match in}} London, the team faced the Australia women's {{national}} wheelchair basketball team, who had defeated them 48–46 in Sydney {{just a few}} months before, in front of a capacity crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena. The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. Adermann scored 19 points, more than any other player in the match, and was a key factor in Germany winning 58-44. [...] "Most of my shots weren’t even any crazy shots or any outside shots,” Adermann said. [...] "They were the same shots I took in the others games, but I played more in this game, and I had many more easy opportunities getting into the paint." [...] "I’m always one of the shooters, but I think Australia underestimated me and didn’t defend <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as some of the other girls. They left me open a lot and I got some big shots, so it went well for me. It just worked out that I scored the most points in the final, but it wasn’t deliberate." ...|$|E
500|$|On 12 September, Lord Dingwall {{had landed}} at Leith, {{reporting}} that [...] "he {{had come in}} company with the Queen's fleet three hundred miles, and was separated from them by a great storm: it was feared that the Queen was in danger upon the seas." [...] Alarmed, James called for national fasting and public prayers, kept watch on the Firth of Forth for Anne's arrival, wrote several songs, one comparing the situation {{to the plight of}} Hero and Leander, and sent a search party out for Anne, carrying a letter he had written to her in French: [...] "Only to one who knows <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as his own reflection in a glass could I express, my dearest love, the fears which I have experienced because of the contrary winds and violent storms since you embarked...". Informed in October that the Danes had abandoned the crossing for the winter, and in what Willson calls [...] "the one romantic episode of his life", James sailed from Leith with a three-hundred-strong retinue to fetch his wife personally, arriving in Oslo on 19 November after travelling by land from Flekkefjord via Tønsberg. According to a Scottish account, he presented himself to Anne, [...] "with boots and all", and, disarming her protests, gave her a kiss in the Scottish fashion.|$|E
500|$|Although {{it holds}} {{significant}} differences from Remember Me, the game addresses similar themes {{of memory and}} identity. Life Is Strange was specified as an analogue look at human identity in contrast to Remember Me, the digital view of the same theme. Running on an improved version of Unreal Engine 3, it makes use of the tools and special effects like lighting and depth of field engineered for Remember <b>Me</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as subsequent advances. Visual effects like post-processes, double exposure and overlapping screen space particles were used as an artistic approach to be displayed while the lead character rewinds time. The textures seen in the game were entirely hand painted, adapted to achieve what art director Michel Koch called [...] "impressionistic rendering". Elements were adjusted based on player feedback, with influences like The Walking Dead, Gone Home and Heavy Rain in mind. The Catcher in the Rye was an additional source of inspiration, whose protagonist Holden Caulfield shares a surname with Max, the game's lead. The characters were created using known archetypes, at first to establish an entry point for the player, and then to subvert them. For the sake of serving the realism, the supernatural elements were designed {{as a metaphor for}} the characters' inner conflict, and experts were consulted to tackle the subject of teen suicide. Twin Peaks also influenced the setting and characters, and is referenced within the game.|$|E

500|$|Despite this, {{the song}} {{has been used}} in many promotional tools and {{featured}} in several films and television series. In 2002, the song was featured in the comedy-drama film Igby Goes Down, and later appeared on the film's soundtrack album, released on 25 February 2003 by Spun Records. Also in 2003, the song was also featured on Coldplay's live album Live 2003. In 2004, it was on the romantic comedy film Garden State; director Zach Braff handpicked songs, including [...] "Don't Panic", for the film's Grammy Award-winning compilation album, Garden State: Music From The Motion Picture. The song was also featured on the debut episode of the FX television series Rescue <b>Me</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as the pilot episode of the short-lived show Odyssey 5. Additionally, the song was featured in episode nine of the first series on the British TV series Sugar Rush in 2005. On 19 July 2011, the song was played as a wake-up call to STS-135 Space Shuttle Atlantis Pilot Doug Hurley as a tribute from his wife and family, marking the last ever wake-up call for a crew visiting the International Space Station from the Space Shuttle fleet. It was also referenced in the 2016 movie The 5th Wave as a lullaby to the main character's little brother. In February 2016, a cover of the song by Clairity was used in the trailer for the 2016 film , as well as the film's TV spot for the Super Bowl 50. This same cover was used in the seventh season finale of The CW series The Vampire Diaries (Gods and Monsters).|$|E

Domingo de Santa Clara actually existed. There was an Abraham a Sancta Clara, he was some religious fanatic. I don't know where I got it from, but the name pleased me very much: Abraham a Sancta Clara. And since the name Domingo pleases <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> I called him Domingo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Swift {{explained}} to Billboard. [...] "I {{think the reason}} I said that was because I made the record {{exactly the same way}} I made the last three. I knew I hadn't jumped out of my comfort zone, which at the time was writing alone and working with Nathan. [...] the song was a real turning point for Red the album.
