5|$|August Edler von Meyszner (3 August 1886– 24 January 1947) was an Austrian {{gendarmerie}} officer, right-wing politician, {{and senior}} Ordnungspolizei (order police) officer {{who held the}} post of Higher SS and Police Leader in the German-occupied territory of Serbia from January 1942 to March 1944, during World War II. He {{has been described as}} one of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler's <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> subordinates.|$|E
5|$|While Speer had {{tremendous}} power, {{he was of}} course subordinate to Hitler. Nazi officials sometimes went around Speer by seeking direct orders from the dictator. When Speer ordered peacetime building work suspended, the Gauleiters (Nazi Party district leaders) obtained an exemption for their pet projects. When Speer sought the appointment of Hanke as a labor czar to optimize the use of German and slave labor, Hitler, {{under the influence of}} Martin Bormann, instead appointed Fritz Sauckel. Rather than increasing female labor and taking other steps to better organize German labor, as Speer favored, Sauckel advocated importing more slave labour from the occupied nations– and did so, obtaining workers for (among other things) Speer's armament factories, often using the <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> methods.|$|E

5|$|Slavery in Haiti {{started with}} the arrival of Christopher Columbus on the island in 1492. The {{practice}} was devastating to the native population. Following the indigenous Taino's near decimation from forced labour, disease and war, the Spanish, under advisement of the Catholic priest Bartolomeu de las Casas, and with the blessing of the Catholic church began engaging in earnest in the kidnapped and forced labour of enslaved Africans. During the French colonial period beginning in 1625, the economy of Haiti (then known as Saint-Domingue) was based on slavery, and the practice there was regarded as the <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> in the world. The Haitian Revolution of 1804, the only successful slave revolt in human history, precipitated the end of slavery not only in Saint-Domingue, but in all French colonies. However, several Haitian leaders following the revolution employed forced labor, believing a plantation-style economy was the only way for Haiti to succeed, and building fortifications to safeguard against attack by the French. During the U.S. occupation between 1915 and 1934, the U.S. military forced Haitians to work building roads for defense against Haitian resistance fighters.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{occupation}} of Poland {{was among the}} <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> of the war, resulting in death of more than 3 million ethnic Poles and about 3 million Polish Jews. The six million Jewish, Roman Catholic and Orthodox Poles represented nearly 17 percent of the country's population. Poles were one of Hitler's first extermination targets, as he outlined in an August 22, 1939 speech to Wehrmacht commanders before the invasion. Intelligentsia, socially prominent and influential people were primarily targeted, although ethnic Poles and other Slavic groups were also killed en masse. Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic and Orthodox Poles were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other concentration camps, and the intelligentsia were the first targets of the Einsatzgruppen death squads. The anti-Polish campaign culminated in the near-complete destruction of Warsaw, ordered by Hitler and Himmler in 1944. The original assumptions of Generalplan Ost were based on plans to exterminate around 85% (over 20 million) of ethnically Polish citizens of Poland, with the remaining 15% {{to be used as}} slaves.|$|E
5|$|In late 1863, while Quantrill's Raiders {{spent the}} winter in Texas, {{animosity}} developed between Anderson and Quantrill. Anderson, perhaps falsely, implicated Quantrill in a murder, leading to the latter's arrest by Confederate authorities. Anderson subsequently returned to Missouri {{as the leader of}} a group of raiders and became the most feared guerrilla in the state, killing and robbing dozens of Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers throughout central Missouri. Although Union supporters viewed him as incorrigibly evil, Confederate sympathizers in Missouri saw his actions as justified, possibly owing to their mistreatment by Union forces. In September 1864 he led a raid on Centralia, Missouri. Unexpectedly, they were able to capture a passenger train, the first time Confederate guerrillas had done so. In {{what became known as the}} Centralia Massacre--possibly the war's deadliest and <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> guerrilla action--his men killed 24 Union soldiers on the train and set an ambush later that day that killed more than 100 Union militiamen. A month later Anderson himself was killed in battle. Historians have made disparate appraisals of Anderson: some see him as a sadistic, psychopathic killer, but for others his actions cannot be separated from the general lawlessness of the time.|$|E
50|$|Born in Trujillo, Spain, Gonzalo Pizarro {{accompanied}} {{his eldest}} brother, Francisco Pizarro, {{in his third}} expedition for the conquest of Peru in 1530. Gonzalo was also the brother of Hernando Pizarro and Juan Pizarro.

50|$|Anna Vladlenovna Samokhina (Анна Владленовна Самохина; 14 January 1963 - 8 February 2010,) was a Russian actress. Samokhina {{started her}} film career in 1980s and quickly became {{popular due to}} high talent, beauty and charm. She {{is best known as}} the leading actress in Yuri Kara's Barons of Crime (rus. Воры в законе, {{literally}} Thieves within the Law) - the <b>most</b> outgiving, <b>brutal</b> and controversial Soviet film, about mafia and corruption in the late USSR.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Fahim {{was chosen}} by {{incumbent}} President Karzai as candidate for first Vice President in the 2009 presidential election. Fahim by then {{had a reputation as}} one of Afghanistan’s <b>most</b> powerful, <b>brutal</b> and corrupt warlords. Karzai’s decision to include him on his ticket therefore dismayed international observers. Many in Kabul alleged Marshal Fahim was at the time involved in criminal activities, including kidnapping for ransom. By choosing Fahim as his Vice-President, Karzai was said to have stained his own credibility even further.|$|R
5|$|On 13 December 1981, {{claiming}} {{that the country was}} on the verge of economic and civil breakdown, and alleging a danger of Soviet intervention, General Wojciech Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity. Martial law was declared, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained. Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms of harassment. Polish state militia (Milicja Obywatelska, the police) and paramilitary riot police ZOMO suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises to clamp down on the independent union movement. A series of violent attacks included the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine during which 9 people were killed. The martial law offensive was directed primarily against workers and their Union; they, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> treatment. The authorities succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken mass movement would not be able to recover. The Catholic Church strove to exert on Solidarity a moderating influence both before and after the martial law.|$|E

25|$|During the German {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in 1941, these tensions grew {{to become one}} of the <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> civil wars that occurred in World War II. The Royal Government soon capitulated, and the resistance was mainly made by the Četniks, who defended the restoration of the Monarchy, and the Partisans, who supported the creation of a communist Yugoslav state. The Serbs were divided into these two factions, that fought not only Nazi Germany and all the other neighbour Axis allied countries which also invaded different territories of Yugoslavia — the Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians — but also each other. Beside this, other Yugoslav non-Serb nationalists took advantage of the situation and allied themselves with the Axis countries, regarding this moment as their historical opportunity of fulfilling their own irredentist aspirations, the Independent State of Croatia being by far the <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> one.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking on the album, {{front man}} Sacha Dunable stated: [...] "I don't care how cliché {{it is to}} say; this is our best record yet!

[...] Commenting on the recording process Dunable also said “We decided that we don’t need to spend three weeks in a studio obsessing over every minute nuance…We ended up making our best sounding record in {{a third of the}} time.” ...|$|R

50|$|Appeals for clemency sent to then Communist Poland's {{president}} Bolesław Bierut remained unanswered, and {{the condemned}} men prepared themselves for death. Realizing that his tormentors would dispose of his body, Ciepliński decided to swallow a small {{portrait of the}} Virgin Mary, which he had worn on his neck. During this time, the condemned men shared the same large cell with other 80 anti-Communist fighters, among them Zygmunt Szendzielarz. According to the surviving witnesses, the WiN members supported and helped each other, tending particularly to Ciepliński and Błażej, both of whom suffered the <b>most</b> during <b>brutal</b> interrogations.|$|R

25|$|Samir Kuntar {{spent nearly}} three decades in prison before being {{released}} on July 16, 2008 {{as part of an}} Israel-Hezbollah prisoner swap. He denied killing Danny and Einat (the child and her father), but admitted to killing Eliyahu Shachar, the policeman. He never expressed remorse for the killings. In Israel, Kuntar was considered the perpetrator of one of the <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> terrorist attacks in the country's history, while in Lebanon he was widely regarded as a national hero. He was assassinated on December 19, 2015, in a suspected Israeli airstrike, though Israel did not confirm this and the Free Syrian Army would later take credit for killing Kuntar.|$|E
25|$|Titus Andronicus is by {{no means}} the <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> of Shakespeare's plays. More people die in Richard III. King Lear is a much more cruel play. In the whole Shakespearean {{repertory}} I can find no scene so revolting as Cordelia's death. In reading, the cruelties of Titus can seem ridiculous. But I have seen it on the stage and found it a moving experience. Why? In watching Titus Andronicus we come to understand – perhaps more than by looking at any other Shakespeare play – the nature of his genius: he gave an inner awareness to passions; cruelty ceased to be merely physical. Shakespeare discovered the moral hell. He discovered heaven as well. But he remained on earth.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 80s, the Auxiliary Forces were hated by the population. They {{represented}} the authority in its <b>most</b> abusive, more <b>brutal</b> form.

25|$|The {{atmosphere}} in Chengdu was more violent. On {{the morning of}} June 4, police forcibly broke up the student demonstration taking place in Chengdu's main square. The resulting violence killed eight people, and injured hundreds more. The <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> attacks occurred on June 5 and 6. Witnesses estimate that 30 to 100 bodies were thrown onto a truck after a crowd broke into the Jinjiang Hotel. According to Amnesty International, at least 300 {{people were killed in}} Chengdu on June 5. Troops in Chengdu used concussion grenades, truncheons, knives and electric cattle prods against civilians. Hospitals were ordered to not accept students and on the second night the ambulance service was stopped by police.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} of the project {{concerned}} the translation of historical documents related to the events that happened in Halabja, Iraq within Kurdistan on 16 March 1988, when Saddam Hussein’s regime bombed the entire district with chemical weapons in the closing days of the Iran–Iraq War, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 5,000 Kurds. The attack on Halabja has been well-documented as being the single <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> attack of Saddam Hussein’s reign, as well as the deadliest chemical weapons attack against a civilian population {{in the history of the}} world. Today, many of the living Kurdish civilians affected by the chemical attack still suffer from various illnesses both psychological and physical, in addition to the birth defects of their progeny.|$|E
25|$|Despite these popular {{stories and}} their fame, {{some of their}} <b>most</b> <b>brutal</b> interventions, such as the {{massacre}} of unarmed civilians, elderly men, {{women and children in}} Saltillo, ordered by Samuel H. Walker, remained unknown to the American public at large. Most of the Ranger force was disbanded during the years following the end of the Mexican–American War on February 2, 1848, since the protection of the frontiers was now an official duty of the U.S. Army. But as more settlers sought to establish homesteads in lands traditionally occupied by Indians, the skirmishes with the native peoples became a major political issue. During the 1850s, the Rangers were intermittently called on to deal with this problem, and with the election of Hardin Richard Runnels as governor in 1857, they once again regained their role as defenders of the Texas frontier.|$|E
