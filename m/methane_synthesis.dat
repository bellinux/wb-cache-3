For the first time, a small vesicle fraction isolated as in (a) was capable of synthesizing methane from CO 2 and H 2 without cytoplasm.

40|$|In Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, the protonmotive {{force for}} the H+-translocating ATPase {{consists}} mainly of a transmembrane electrical gradient (Deltapsi). These cells do not establish a significant transmembrane pH gradient (inside alkaline) and, in fact, if the suspending medium is of pH >/= 7. 0, the pH gradient may be reversed-i. e., inside acid {{with respect to the}} extracellular pH. These studies show by both 23 Na NMR and 22 Na+ distribution that Na+ extrusion with the generation of Deltapsi precedes methanogenesis in Mb. thermoautotrophicum. It is calculated that the newly established Na+ gradients increase Deltapsi by approximately 50 mV (inside negative). There is no detectable H+ extrusion during methane synthesis; instead there is a high rate of H+ consumption for <b>methane</b> <b>synthesis</b> and an increase in internal pH. This was supported by 31 P NMR experiments, which showed an internal pH shift from 6. 8 to 7. 6. With the cells maintained at an external pH of 7. 2, the initial transmembrane pH gradient of - 0. 4 (inside acid) at 60 degrees C is equivalent to Deltapsi of + 27 mV (inside positive); after 20 min of incubation, the transmembrane pH gradient is + 0. 4 (inside alkaline), which at 60 degrees C is equivalent to Deltapsi of - 27 mV (inside negative). Actively respiring cells generated a protonmotive force of - 198 mV. It is proposed that energy for CO 2 reduction to the level of formaldehyde (the first step in <b>methane</b> <b>synthesis)</b> in Mb. thermoautotrophicum is derived from the Deltapsi generated by electrogenic Na+ extrusion.

S. wolfei contained formate dehydrogenase activity (as does M. formicicum), which would allow interspecies formate transfer in that coculture. Thus, interspecies formate transfer may be the predominant mechanism of syntrophy. Our diffusion calculations also indicated that H 2 concentration at the cell surface of H 2 -consuming organisms was low but increased to approximately the bulk-fluid concentration at a distance of about 10 μm from the surface.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{catalytic}} selective oxidation of hydrocarbon molecules is {{the process}} where a selectively oxidized intermediate molecule is formed instead of the thermodynamically favoured total oxidation products, {{in the presence of}} a suitable catalyst. Examples are the selective oxidation of <b>methane</b> to <b>synthesis</b> gas at moderate temperatures, for which a catalyst is still needed and the selective oxidation of propene to acrolein over α-Bi 2 Mo 3 O 12. The selective oxidation of propene over α-Bi 2 Mo 3 O 12 occurs via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism where the bulk oxygen in the catalyst is inserted into the propene molecule and leaves as part of the product, while being replaced with gaseous oxygen. From an economic perspective there is a need to produce <b>synthesis</b> gas from <b>methane</b> at low temperatures.
