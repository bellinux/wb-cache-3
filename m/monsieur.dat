He opened his own museum in the Marais quarter of Paris on 11 December 1781, where he undertook experiments in physics, and provided demonstrations to nobles. He researched the new field of gases, and invented a respirator.|$|R
5|$|A {{sense of}} destiny {{is present in}} the novel through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals of destiny in a number of characters. Characters who are paired together tend to suffer the same destiny: Ti Noel and <b>Monsieur</b> Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age and slowly decline; both Pauline and Solimán indulge in their wealthy positions and then sink into madness. There is a clear pattern of succession from fortune to misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} {{in the years following}} the failure of <b>Monsieur</b> Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E

5|$|Henri L'Estrange {{was born}} about 1842 in Fitzroy, {{a suburb of}} Melbourne. Little is known of his early years, family or private life. He first came to public {{attention}} in 1873 {{as a member of}} a Melbourne performance group, the Royal Comet Variety Troupe, a gymnastic, dancing and comedic vocal combination with Miss Lulu L'Estrange and <b>Monsieur</b> Julian. As part of this troupe, L'Estrange performed in Melbourne and Tasmania throughout 1873 and 1874, with Henri and Lulu performing together on the tightrope. In 1876, L'Estrange performed solo for the first time in Melbourne, and quickly gained a reputation as a fearless performer.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{photography}} {{continued to}} develop, both in France and abroad, after the Nadar images were shot. In Europe, several further cases of intersexuality were documented, {{although there is}} no evidence that the photographers were aware of Nadar's work. In April 1870 a <b>Monsieur</b> Delacroix presented photographs of an intersex individual at the Société Médicale de Reims. In 1930 German physician Magnus Hirschfeld published a portrait of himself with an intersex individual in his five-volume Geschlechtskunde (Sexology), while Louis Ombrédanne published 25 images of cases he had handled in his 1939 book Les hermaphrodites et la chirurgie (Hermaphrodites and Surgery).|$|E

5|$|Of Messager's works {{performed}} by other artists, there are complete recordings {{of several of}} his operas, and extracts from others. There have been two complete sets of Véronique– a 1953 Decca mono recording conducted by Pierre Dervaux, and a 1969 stereo EMI recording conducted by Jean-Claude Hartemann. Other complete sets of Messager operas include L'amour masqué (1970; conductor, Raymond Legrand), La Basoche (1960; Tony Aubin), Coups de roulis (1963; Marcel Cariven), Fortunio (1987; John Eliot Gardiner), Isoline (1947; Louis Beydts), <b>Monsieur</b> Beaucaire (1958; Jules Gressier), and Passionnément (1964; Jean-Paul Kreder).|$|E
5|$|Portrait of <b>Monsieur</b> Bertin is an 1832 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It depicts Louis-François Bertin (1766–1841), the French writer, art collector {{and director of}} the pro-royalist Journal des débats. Ingres completed the portrait during his first period of success; having achieved acclaim as a history painter, he accepted portrait commissions with reluctance, regarding them as a distraction from more important work. Bertin was a friend and a politically active member of the French upper-middle class. Ingres presents him as a personification of the commercially minded leaders of the liberal reign of Louis Philippe I. He is physically imposing and self-assured, but his real-life personality shines through– warm, wry and engaging to those who had earned his trust.|$|E
5|$|Singers {{who have}} {{recorded}} individual numbers from Messager's operas include role creators such as Jean Périer (Véronique), Lucien Fugère (La basoche), Pierre Darmant and Yvonne Printemps (L'amour masqué), Koval (Passionnément), Marcelle Denya (Coups de roulis), and Maggie Teyte (<b>Monsieur</b> Beaucaire), {{as well as}} other contemporaries Aino Ackté, Emma Eames, and John McCormack whose recordings have been reissued on compact disc. Singers of the next generation who recorded Messager numbers included Georges Thill and Ninon Vallin. More recent singers who have recorded numbers from Messager's operas include Mady Mesplé, Susan Graham, Dame Felicity Lott and Anna Netrebko.|$|E

5|$|Social {{commentary}} was {{a feature}} of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed {{a keen interest in}} economics and felt obliged to publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, <b>Monsieur</b> Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.|$|E
5|$|The Natchez had {{prepared}} by seizing the galley of the West India Company anchored on the river, {{so that no}} Frenchmen could board it and attempt to escape. They had also stationed warriors {{on the other side}} of the river to intercept those who might flee in that direction. The commandant at the Yazoo trading post of Fort St. Pierre, <b>Monsieur</b> du Codère, was visiting Fort Rosalie with a Jesuit priest when they heard gunshots. They turned around to return to their ship, but warriors caught up with them, killing and scalping them.|$|E

As a reward Madame Bon-Bon shares the secret recipe of her world-famous fudge with the Potts, and the two families become good friends.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Vénus de Quinipily are uncertain, but it is {{believed}} to have been sculpted around 49 BC. It was originally erected at the site of a former Roman camp in Castennec in Bieuzy-les-Eaux, a commune in the Morbihan department in Brittany in northwestern France. Various {{origins of the}} statue have been proposed, including Greek, Roman or Egyptian; a Celtic deity, the Roman Mother goddess Cybele, or an Egyptian Isis statue. It has also been proposed that the statue did not survive its restoration in 1696 by Pierre de Lannion, the Lord of Blavet Quinipily, and that he secretly replaced it with a new one. According to the French archaeologist <b>Monsieur</b> de Penhouët, the statue was built by Moorish soldiers in the Roman army.|$|E
5|$|When {{the second}} {{version of the}} story was {{translated}} into English by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, they made a number of alterations to the text. For instance, <b>Monsieur</b> Tom Hawake, whose name was a pun on tomahawk, was renamed Mr. Maurice Oyle, and the Slift factory was renamed Grynd Corp. Other changes were made to render the story more culturally understandable to an Anglophone readership; whereas the factory originally sold its mix of dogs, cats, and rats as hare pâté—a food uncommon in Britain—the English translation rendered the mix as salami. In another instance, garlic, pepper, and salt were added to the mixture in the French version, but this was changed to mustard, pepper, and salt for the English version, again reflecting British culinary tastes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the mound of Cubzac was slashed all around to provide stone for Bordeaux's {{construction}} and the ballast of some river banks, creating deep excavations in the limestone. In 1898, André Cousteau, uncle of the researcher and ecologist Jacques Cousteau, started using the caves to make a sparkling wine based on traditional Champagne-making techniques. The wine, treated in a closed tank, bottled, and kept neck down many months at constant temperature, became bubbly and had its impurities accumulate near the cap. Once this deposit was removed, the bottles were resealed by force, and the corks muzzled. In 1920, the Cousteau property was sold to the Société Anonyme Gay-Mousse. In 1966, the caves where entrusted to <b>Monsieur</b> Lateyron who, one year later, created the Café de Paris.|$|E
