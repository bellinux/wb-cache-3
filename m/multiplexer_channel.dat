25|$|Channels {{differ in}} the number and type of {{concurrent}} I/O operations they support. In IBM terminology, a <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel</b> supports a number of concurrent interleaved slow-speed operations, each transferring one byte from a device at a time. A selector channel supports one high-speed operation, transferring a block of data at a time. A block multiplexer supportes a number of concurrent high-speed operations.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{for larger}} IBM System/360 computers, {{and even for}} early System/370 models, the {{selector}} channels and the multiplexor channels still were bulky and expensive separate processors, such as the IBM 2860 Selector channel (one to three selector channels in a single box), the IBM 2870 Byte multiplexor channel (one <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel,</b> and, optionally, one selector subchannel in a single box) and the IBM 2880 Block multiplexor channel (one or two block multiplexor channels in a single box).|$|E
5000|$|A byte <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel</b> {{is capable}} of {{executing}} multiple CCWs concurrently; it is normally used to attach slow device such as card readers and telecommunications lines. A byte <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel</b> could {{have a number of}} selector subchannels, each with only a single subchannel, which behave like low-speed selector channels.|$|E
50|$|Block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channels</b> {{could operate}} as a {{selector}} channel to allow compatible attachment of legacy subsystems.|$|R
50|$|The 2835 storage Control {{connects to}} one or two block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channels</b> and {{attaches}} one or two 2305 Fixed Head storage Modules.|$|R
50|$|The Model 44 {{could support}} {{up to one}} {{standard}} and two high-speed System/360 <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channels</b> in addition to integrated adapters for the single disk storage and the console 1052 printer/keyboard.|$|R
5000|$|... {{support for}} the block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel</b> {{introduced}} in the System/360 Model 85.|$|E
5000|$|A block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel</b> {{is capable}} of {{concurrently}} running multiple channel programs, but only {{one at a time}} can be active. The control unit can request suspension {{at the end of a}} channel command and can later request resumption. This is intended for devices in which there is a mechanical delay after completion of data transfer, e.g., for seeks on moving-head DASD. The block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel</b> was a late addition to the System/360 architecture; early machines had only byte multiplexer channels and selector channels. The block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel</b> was an optional feature only on the models 85 and 195. The block multiplexor channel was also available on the later System/370 computers.|$|E
50|$|An IBM 1052 printer/keyboard {{for use as}} an operator's console is optional. The I/O {{options include}} one channel-to-channel adapter (CTCA) and up to three {{selector}} channels. A <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel</b> for attachment of slow-speed devices is standard on all models. The F50 has 64 subchannels, so it can attach up to 64 slow-speed devices on its <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel.</b> The other models have 128 subchannels. This can optionally increase to 256 subchannels on the H50 and I50.|$|E
50|$|The 3830-2 {{connects to}} one, two or four block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channels</b> and can attach any {{combination}} of up to four A-units, i.e., {{any combination of}} 3333s, 3340-A2s, or 3350-A2/A2Fs up {{to a maximum of}} 32 physical drives (up to 6 additional drives attached to each A-unit).|$|R
5000|$|Simultaneous {{input and}} output was {{accomplished}} {{by the use of}} intelligent communication channels. Like the IBM 360, two types of channel were available (on all but the 70/15): selector channels which could address up to 256 devices (one at a time), and <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channels</b> (not on the 70/15) which could simultaneously address up to 256 channels by time-sharing the channel.|$|R
50|$|Digital {{transmission}} groups usually are categorized by their maximum capacity, {{not by a}} specific number of channels. However, the maximum digital transmission group capacity must be {{equal to or greater}} than the sum of the individual <b>multiplexer</b> input <b>channel</b> capacities.|$|R
5000|$|The block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel,</b> {{previously}} {{available only}} on the 360/85 and 360/195, was a standard part of the architecture. For compatibility it could operate as a selector channel.|$|E
50|$|These components, {{together}} with the 2365 Processor Storage Model 2, 2860 Selector Channel, 2870 <b>Multiplexer</b> <b>Channel,</b> and other System/360 control units and devices were available for use with the S/360-67.|$|E
5000|$|A {{selector}} channel {{has only a}} single subchannel, and hence is only capable of executing one channel command at a time. It is normally used to attach fast devices that are not capable of exploiting a block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel</b> to suspend the connection, such as magnetic tape drives.|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} interrogation and {{signal processing}} technique which facilitates high-speed simultaneous static and dynamic strain demodulation of multiplexed ﬁber Bragg grating sensors is described. The scheme integrates passive, interferometric wavelength-demodulation and fast optical switching between wavelength division <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channels</b> with signal extraction via a software lock-in ampliﬁer and fast Fourier transform. Static and dynamic strain measurements with noise ﬂoors of 1 nanostrain and 10 nanostrain/sqrt(Hz), between 5 mHz and 2 kHz were obtained. An inverse analysis {{applied to a}} cantilever beam set up was used to characterise and verify strain measurements using ﬁnite element modeling. By providing distributed measurements of both ultahigh-resolution static and dynamic strain, the proposed scheme will facilitate advanced structural health monitoring...|$|R
50|$|This was {{followed}} by its second product, the Optical <b>Channel</b> <b>Multiplexer</b> and its third generation of products, the Fiber Service Platform I and FSP II.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) based on lithographically-fabricated slab-waveguide-contained planar {{holographic}} Bragg reflectors (HBRs). Partial HBR diffractive contour writing and contour displacement are successfully demonstrated to enable precise bandpass engineering of multiplexer transfer functions and make possible compact-footprint devices based on hologram overlay. Four and eight <b>channel</b> <b>multiplexers</b> with <b>channel</b> spacings of ~ 50 and ~ 100 GHz, improved sidelobe suppression and flat-top passbands are demonstrated. When a second-order apodization effect, comprising effective waveguide refractive index variation with written contour fraction, {{and the impact}} of hologram overlap on the hologram reflective amplitude are included in the simulation, excellent agreement between predicted and observed spectral passband profiles is obtained. With demonstrated simulation capability, the ability to fabricate general desired passband profiles becomes tractable...|$|R

50|$|IBM {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} I/O channel on the Model 85 and Model 195: the 2880 block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel.</b> The channel allowed a device to suspend a channel program, pending the completion of an I/O operation and thus to free the channel for use by another device. These channels could support either standard 1.5 MB/second connections or, with the 2-byte interface feature, 3 MB/second; the later used one tag cable and two bus cables.|$|E
50|$|The RCA Model 70/25 was a small-to-medium scale {{computer}} system that supported {{a wider variety}} of applications, including use as a free standing system. In large installations, the 70/25 might also be used as a subsystem in a multi-processor complex. High throughput was facilitated by the use of fast memory and multiple simultaneous input/output streams. Equipped with selector channels and a <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel,</b> the 70/25 could concurrently operate eight low-speed devices in addition to eight high-speed devices.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to its relay analogues MPB is capable to transmit block signals {{not only through}} physical connection lines but also through data transmission systems such as voice-frequency <b>channel</b> <b>multiplexers,</b> fiber-optical lines and radio channels.

50|$|All {{systems have}} at least 1 IOP. On the 4080, this first IOP was called the Basic <b>Multiplexer</b> <b>Channel,</b> or BMC, and the 4080 front panel {{provides}} for controlling both the CPU and the BMC. The entry level 415x and 4x6x systems have their first IOP (Integral <b>Multiplexer</b> <b>Channel,</b> or IMC) integrated into the Nucleus firmware, and thus I/O operations on the IMC did have some impact on CPU performance, although the 4x6x systems could have additional external IOPs added too. The 4000 series Nucleus i/o instructions and system tables allow for up to 8 IOPs, {{although most of the}} models in the 4000 series range had some type of hardware limitation which reduced this. The 408x systems had 4-ported store, with the CPU and first IOP sharing one of these, and up to 3 additional IOPs connected to the remaining store ports. (Early documentation shows these additional store ports were also designed to connect additional CPUs, although this was not a configuration which was ever sold using 4080 processors.) Later models had more varied number of store ports, depending on how many store port boards could be fitted into the system. The 4190 could support the full complement of 8 IOPs, and the 4190D supported 8 IOPs with 2 CPUs.|$|E

50|$|Symmetrix arrays, EMC's {{flagship}} product at that time, began shipping in 1990 as a storage array connected to an IBM mainframe via the block <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel.</b> Newer generations of Symmetrix brought additional host connection protocols which include ESCON, SCSI, Fibre Channel-based storage area networks (SANs), FICON and iSCSI. The Symmetrix product was initially popular within {{the airline industry}} and with companies that were willing to deviate {{from the safety of}} IBM's 3390 disk subsystem and take a risk with the unproven Symmetrix array. This product is the main reason for the rapid growth of EMC in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} to a multi-billion company. Moshe Yanai managed the Symmetrix development from the product's inception in 1987 until shortly before leaving EMC in 2001, and his Symmetrix development team grew from several people to thousands.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work was the {{instrumentation}} and validation of a laboratory equipped with a control system for air temperature (tair), relative air humidity (RH) and air velocity (V) to study the environment for small animals. An experimental was equipped with two air conditioners to manage basic tair and RH in order to work. Four wind tunnels, with partial recirculation of air were installed in the room. Each tunnel features two electric heaters and two humidifiers divided into two operation stages. The air velocity is manually controlled by potentiometers connected to exhaust fans. A system to acquire data and control climatic variables was installed in the laboratory and it consisted of a datalogger, a <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channel,</b> a relay controller, tair and RH sensors, sensors for measuring water temperature and digital helix anemometer to measure air velocity.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) {{has recently}} {{emerged as a}} valuable technique in biomedical research and medical diagnostics. OCT based instruments allow acquisi- tion of high-resolution information about the internal structure of translucent organs and tissues without damaging the object. However, unaccounted object movements reduce the quality of acquired data, particularly in functional imaging and in OCT modalities that rely on continuous monitoring. Therefore {{there is a need}} for methods that allow mitigating the negative effects of the object movements on the data quality. In this thesis we present several methods and devices that allow improving the ac- curacy of collected data. First we introduce a novel frequency multiplexing method for OCT, which enables simultaneous measurements using several frequency-encoded channels. By doing so, several parameters are measured in the same time, reducing the time to acquire the data and making the technology less sensitive to object movements. We employed the method to extend the functionality of several OCT modalities. We have applied the multiplexer to enable simultaneous en face time domain OCT imag- ing at different depths. We have demonstrated a polarisation sensitive OCT set-up where different <b>multiplexer</b> <b>channels</b> are employed to perform polarisation sensitive measurements. Furthermore, we have demonstrated how the multiplexer can be applied to extend the sensitivity range in swept source based OCT systems. The experiments presented in this thesis illustrate the flexibility of our new multiplexing method, which has proven useful not only for increasing the accuracy of collected data, but as well for increasing the efficiency in using the light from the object. Alternatively, we have investigated tracking as a way to improve the quality of the OCT data acquired from the moving targets. We have demonstrated a closed-loop tracking based set-up that uses low coherence interferometry to continuously monitor the cardiac dynamics of a Drosophila melanogaster embryo...|$|R
