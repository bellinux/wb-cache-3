40|$|We {{classify}} (1 + 3) -dimensional Pauli equations for a spin- 1 / 2 particle {{interacting with}} the <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> that are solvable by the method of separation of variables. As a result, we obtain the eleven classes of vector-potentials of the <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>field</b> A(t,x) providing separability of the corresponding Pauli equations. It is established, in particular, that the necessary condition for the Pauli equation to be separable into second-order matrix ordinary differential equations is its equivalence to the system of two uncoupled Schroedinger equations. In addition, the magnetic field has to be independent of spatial variables. We prove that coordinate systems and the vector-potentials of the <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>field</b> providing the separability of the corresponding Pauli equations coincide with those for the Schroedinger equations. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm for constructing all coordinate systems providing the separability of Pauli equation with a fixed vector-potential of the <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is developed. Finally, we describe all vector-potentials A(t,x) that (a) provide the separability of Pauli equation, (b) satisfy vacuum Maxwell equations without currents, and (c) describe non-zero magnetic field.
