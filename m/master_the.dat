50|$|In contrast, the illuminations {{reflect the}} work of at least six {{different}} hands. The art historian Walter Oakeshott first identified and named these artists in 1945, referring to them as <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Leaping Figures, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Apocrypha Drawings, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Genesis Initial, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Amalekite, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Morgan Leaf, and <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Gothic Majesty.

50|$|The {{roots of}} <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Aachen Altar in Cologne {{painting}} is beyond question. His proximity to <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Holy Clan, which is clear both in stylistic matters {{and in the}} adoption of subjects and motifs, leads to the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Aachen Altar was educated in the workshop of <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Holy Clan. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> of St Severin also had an important influence on <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Aachen Altar, as similarities in their figures and painting methods indicate. A partnership as journeymen in this workshop is possible. The mature works of <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Aachen Altar, such as the Mary panels, show clear influence from <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece. Further afield, the painter has taken important hints from the Netherlandish painters, such as the art of Hugo van der Goes.|$|R

500|$|Each {{dictator}} {{appointed a}} <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse (magister equitum or <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Knights), {{to serve as}} his most senior lieutenant. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse had constitutional command authority (imperium) equivalent to a praetor, and often, when they authorized {{the appointment of a}} dictator, the senate specified who was to be <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse. In many respects, he functioned more as a parallel magistrate (like an inferior co-consul) than he did as a direct subordinate. Whenever a dictator's term ended, the term of his <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse ended as well. Often, the dictator functioned principally as <b>the</b> <b>master</b> of <b>the</b> infantry (and thus the legions), while <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse (as the name implies) functioned as <b>the</b> <b>master</b> of <b>the</b> cavalry. The dictator, while not elected by the people, was technically a magistrate since he was nominated by an elected consul. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse was also technically a magistrate, since he was nominated by the dictator. Thus, both of these magistrates were referred to as [...] "Extraordinary Magistrates".|$|R

5|$|Florence at {{the time}} of Leonardo's youth was the centre of Christian Humanist thought and culture. Leonardo {{commenced}} his apprenticeship with Verrocchio in 1466, the year that Verrocchio's <b>master,</b> <b>the</b> great sculptor Donatello, died. The painter Uccello, whose early experiments with perspective were to influence the development of landscape painting, was a very old man. The painters Piero della Francesca and Filippo Lippi, sculptor Luca della Robbia, and architect and writer Leon Battista Alberti were in their sixties. The successful artists of the next generation were Leonardo's teacher Verrocchio, Antonio del Pollaiuolo and the portrait sculptor Mino da Fiesole, whose lifelike busts give the most reliable likenesses of Lorenzo Medici's father Piero and uncle Giovanni.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Beirut law school's {{curriculum}} before the 5th century. The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide glimpses of the school's teaching method, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to <b>master</b> <b>the</b> law basics before engaging in case studies.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the European Portuguese {{version of a}} test of prosodic abilities originally developed for English: the Profiling Elements of Prosody in Speech-Communication (Peppé & McCann, 2003). Using this test, we examined the development of several components of European Portuguese prosody between 5 and 20 years of age (N = 131). Results showed prosodic performance improving with age: 5 -year-olds reach adultlike performance in the affective prosodic tasks; 7 -year-olds <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> ability to discriminate and produce short prosodic items, {{as well as the}} ability to understand question versus declarative intonation; 8 -year-olds <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> ability to discriminate long prosodic items; 9 -year-olds <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> ability to produce question versus declarative intonation, as well as the ability to identify focus; 10 - to 11 -year-olds <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> ability to produce long prosodic items; 14 - to 15 -year-olds <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> ability to comprehend and produce syntactically ambiguous utterances disambiguated by prosody; and 18 - to 20 -year-olds <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> ability to produce focus. Cross-linguistic comparisons showed that linguistic form–meaning relations do not necessarily develop at the same pace across languages. Some prosodic contrasts are hard to achieve for younger Portuguese-speaking children, namely, the production of chunking and focus. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
