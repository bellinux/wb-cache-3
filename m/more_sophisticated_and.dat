5|$|Copeland was a {{standout}} among her peers. In her {{first season as}} a soloist at New York City Center, in which avant-garde ballets works were performed, she received good notices in The New York Times for a Balanchine Ballo della Regina role. Also in 2007, she created {{a leading role in}} C. to C. (Close to Chuck), choreographed by Jorma Elo to A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close, Études 2, 9 & 10, by Philip Glass. Her performances of Tharp's works in the same season were recognized, and she was described as <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> contemporary as a soloist than she had been as a corps dancer. Her summer 2008 Metropolitan Opera House (the Met) season performances in Don Quixote and Sleeping Beauty were also well received.|$|E
25|$|The {{arms and}} armour of the Byzantine {{forces in the}} late 11th and 12th centuries were {{generally}} <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> varied than those found in contemporary Western Europe. Byzantium was open to military influences from the Muslim world and the Eurasian steppe, the latter being especially productive of military equipment innovation.|$|E

25|$|These four discoveries {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the {{development}} of civilization throughout the world. However, some modern Chinese scholars have opined that other Chinese inventions were perhaps <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> had a greater impact on Chinese civilization – the Four Great Inventions serve merely to highlight the technological interaction between East and West.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{scholars}} {{have questioned the}} importance placed on the inventions of paper, printing, gunpowder, and the compass. Chinese scholars in particular question if too much emphasis is given to these inventions, over other significant Chinese inventions.

25|$|The <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> organized, less clandestine {{part of the}} Nazi {{machinery}} of destruction tended to murder Jews not fit for intense manual labour immediately; later in the destruction process, more and more Jews initially labelled productive were also murdered. Eventually, Nazi compulsion for the eradication of the Jews became total and absolute, with any potentially available Jews being actively sought solely {{for the purpose of}} destruction.|$|E

25|$|Computational {{capacity}} {{has increased}} dramatically {{over the last decade}} making possible the use of <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> computationally intensive methods in computer-assisted drug design. However, dealing with receptor flexibility in docking methodologies is still a thorny issue. The main reason behind this difficulty is the large number of degrees of freedom that have to be considered in this kind of calculations. Neglecting it, however, leads to poor docking results in terms of binding pose prediction.|$|E
25|$|The California Sound is {{a popular}} music {{aesthetic}} that originates with American pop and rock recording artists from Southern California in the 1960s. It was first related to the California Myth, an idyllic narrative inspired by the state's beach culture that commonly appeared in the lyrics of commercial pop songs. Later, the Sound was expanded outside its initial geography and subject matter and was developed to be <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> bred studio experimentation.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{invention}} of the Urdu typewriter in 1911, Urdu newspapers continued to publish prints of handwritten scripts by calligraphers known as katibs or khush-navees until the late 1980s. The Pakistani national newspaper Daily Jang was the first Urdu newspaper to use Nastaʿlīq computer-based composition. There are efforts under way to develop <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> user-friendly Urdu support on computers and the internet. Nowadays, nearly all Urdu newspapers, magazines, journals, and periodicals are composed on computers with Urdu software programs.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, anti-authoritarian socialists in the United Kingdom and New Zealand criticised {{the rigid}} and determinist view {{of popular culture}} {{deployed}} within the Frankfurt School theories of capitalist culture, which seemed to preclude any prefigurative role for social critique within such work. They argued that EC Comics often did contain such cultural critiques. Recent criticism of the Frankfurt School by the libertarian Cato Institute focused on the claim that culture has grown <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> diverse {{as a consequence of}} free markets and the availability of niche cultural text for niche audiences.|$|E
25|$|The Long Ships, or Red Orm (original title: Röde Orm), {{a best-selling}} Swedish novel written by Frans G. Bengtsson, {{contains}} a vivid description of Gotland in the Viking Age. A {{section of the}} book is devoted to a Viking ship setting out to Russia, stopping on its way at Gotland and engaging a pilot from the island who plays an important part in their voyage. Gotlanders of the Viking era are depicted as city people, <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> cosmopolitan than other Scandinavians of their time, and proud of their knowledge and skills.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scanning}} electron microscopes {{are provided}} with software which uses a vendor-specific and usually closed-source algorithm to determine the 3D profile of the sample from the four-quadrant BSE detector. The supplied algorithms can be very simple line-by-line approaches, that only compare pixels next to each other. Due to the sample and conditions changing, this produces reasonable results only along the scan direction and is only practical for 1D line cuts along the scanning axis. Other approaches use <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> (<b>and</b> sometimes GPU-intensive) methods like the optimal estimation algorithm and offer much better results {{at the cost of}} high demands on computing power.|$|E

25|$|Soul music {{dominated}} the U.S. R chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed {{over into the}} pop charts in the U.S., Britain and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated,</b> <b>and</b> in some cases more politically conscious varieties. By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres, leading to psychedelic soul. The United States saw the development of neo soul around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the problem}} in this debate {{revolved}} around the high level of abstraction and idealization that occurs in economic model-building on topics such as capital and economic growth. The original neoclassical models of aggregate growth presented by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan were straightforward, with simple results and uncomplicated conclusions which implied predictions about the real, empirical, world. The followers of Robinson and Sraffa argued that <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> complicated mathematical models implied that for the Solow-Swan model to say anything about the world, crucial unrealistic assumptions (that Solow and Swan had ignored) must be true.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1969 when Biba {{moved to}} its first upscale store {{on the north side}} of Kensington High Street, across from where they would later open up their {{department}} store, there was a radical change in that the clothes became more expensive and the Biba styles then appeared to be designed for <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> richer young women in their 20s. The Kensington High Street store also lost the cozy boudoir look of its predecessor, which had been so appealing to its teenage customers, and took on the more sophisticated look of the upscale Kensington/Knightsbridge designer stores.|$|E

25|$|Mexican cartels control large {{swaths of}} Mexican {{territory}} {{and dozens of}} municipalities, and they exercise increasing influence in Mexican electoral politics. The cartels are waging violent turf battles over control of key smuggling corridors from Matamoros to San Diego. Mexican cartels employ hitmen and groups of enforcers, known as sicarios. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration reports that the Mexican drug cartels operating today along the border are far <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> dangerous than any other organized criminal group in U.S. law enforcement history. The cartels use grenade launchers, automatic weapons, body armor, Kevlar helmets, and sometimes unmanned aerial vehicles. Some groups have also been known to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs).|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, {{diesel engine}} were adapted {{for use in}} shrimp boats. Power winches were {{connected}} to the engines, and only small crews were needed to rapidly lift heavy nets on board and empty them. Shrimp boats became larger, faster, and more capable. New fishing grounds could be explored, trawls could be deployed in deeper offshore waters, and shrimp could be tracked and caught round the year, instead of seasonally as in earlier times. Larger boats trawled offshore and smaller boats worked bays and estuaries. By the 1960s, steel and fibreglass hulls further strengthened shrimp boats, so they could trawl heavier nets, and steady advances in electronics, radar, sonar, and GPS resulted in <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> <b>and</b> capable shrimp fleets.|$|E
25|$|It is more {{difficult}} to establish the origin of language; it is unclear whether Homo erectus could speak or if that capability had not begun until Homo sapiens. As brain size increased, babies were born earlier, before their heads grew too large to pass through the pelvis. As a result, they exhibited more plasticity, and thus possessed an increased capacity to learn and required a longer period of dependence. Social skills became more complex, language became <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated,</b> <b>and</b> tools became more elaborate. This contributed to further cooperation and intellectual development. Modern humans (Homo sapiens) are believed to have originated around 200,000years ago or earlier in Africa; the oldest fossils date back to around 160,000years ago.|$|E
