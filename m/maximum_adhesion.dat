40|$|When the {{adhesive}} toe pads of geckos become wet, {{they become}} ineffective in enabling geckos {{to stick to}} substrates. This result is puzzling given that many species of gecko are endemic to tropical environments where water covered surfaces are ubiquitous. We hypothesized that geckos can recover adhesive capabilities following exposure of their toe pads to water by walking on a dry surface, similar to the active self-cleaning of dirt particles. We measured {{the time it took}} to recover <b>maximum</b> shear <b>adhesion</b> after toe pads had become wet in two groups, those that were allowed to actively walk and those that were not. Keeping in mind the importance of substrate wettability to adhesion on wet surfaces, we also tested geckos on hydrophilic glass and an intermediately wetting substrate (polymethylmethacrylate; PMMA). We found that time to <b>maximum</b> shear <b>adhesion</b> recovery did not differ in the walking groups based on substrate wettability (22. 7 ± 5. 1 min on glass and 15. 4 ± 0. 3 min on PMMA) but did have a significant effect in the non-walking groups (54. 3 ± 3. 9 min on glass and 27. 8 ± 2. 5 min on PMMA). Overall, we found that by actively walking, geckos were able to self-dry their wet toe pads and regain <b>maximum</b> shear <b>adhesion</b> significantly faster than those that did not walk. Our results highlight a unexpected property of the gecko adhesive system, the ability to actively self-dry and recover adhesive performance after being rendered dysfunctional by water...|$|R

5000|$|A {{thermoset}} {{polymer matrix}} material, or engineering grade thermoplastic polymer matrix material, must meet certain requirements {{in order to}} first be suitable for FRPs and ensure a successful reinforcement of itself. The matrix {{must be able to}} properly saturate, and preferably bond chemically with the fibre reinforcement for <b>maximum</b> <b>adhesion</b> within a suitable curing period. The matrix must also completely envelop the fibres to protect them from cuts and notches that would reduce their strength, and to transfer forces to the fibres. The fibres must also be kept separate from each other so that if failure occurs it is localized as much as possible, and if failure occurs the matrix must also debond from the fibre for similar reasons. Finally the matrix should be of a plastic that remains chemically and physically stable during and after the reinforcement and moulding processes. To be suitable as reinforcement material, fibre additives must increase the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the matrix and meet the following conditions; fibres must exceed critical fibre content; the strength and rigidity of fibres itself must exceed the strength and rigidity of the matrix alone; and there must be optimum bonding between fibres and matrix ...|$|E

40|$|We {{establish}} and quantify correlations among the molecular structures, interaction forces, and physical processes associated with light-responsive self-assembled surfactant monolayers or bilayers at interfaces. Using the surface forces apparatus (SFA), the interaction forces between adsorbed monolayers and bilayers of an azobenzene-functionalized surfactant can be drastically and controllably altered by light-induced conversion of trans and cis molecular conformations. These reversible conformation changes affect significantly {{the shape of}} the molecules, especially in the hydrophobic region, which induces dramatic transformations of molecular packing in self-assembled structures, causing corresponding modulation of electrostatic double layer, steric hydration, and hydrophobic interactions. For bilayers, the isomerization from trans to cis exposes more hydrophobic groups, making the cis bilayers more hydrophobic, which lowers the activation energy barrier for (hemi) fusion. A quantitative and general model is derived for the interaction potential of charged bilayers that includes the electrostatic double-layer force of the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory, attractive hydrophobic interactions, and repulsive steric-hydration forces. The model quantitatively accounts for the elastic strains, deformations, long-range forces, energy <b>maxima,</b> <b>adhesion</b> minima, as well as the instability (when it exists) as two bilayers breakthrough and (hemi) fuse. These results have several important implications, including quantitative and qualitative understanding of the hydrophobic interaction, which is furthermore shown to be a nonadditive interaction...|$|R

With this method, the wheel-rail (roller) creepage, creep force and friction coefficient can be indirectly detected and estimated by measuring the voltage, current and speed of the AC traction motor and using an extended Kalman filter. The re-adhesion controller is designed to regulate the motor torque command according to the <b>maximum</b> available <b>adhesion</b> based on the estimated results.

Then we simulate the motion of a single DPPC molecule in solvent and it elucidates that the maximum drag force is almost linear with respect to the pull rate. We use Stokes ’ relation to describe the motion of a single DPPC molecule and deduce the effective length of a DPPC molecule.

Contact resistances of MWNT-MWNT and MWNT-gold interfaces were also measured as pressure forces around several mN were applied at the interface. The resulting minimum contact resistances are on the same order but with considerable variation from sample to sample. For MWNT-MWNT contacts, a minimum contact resistance of approx. 1 Omega is observed for a contact area of 2 mm by 1 mm. The relatively high contact resistances, considering the area density of the nanotubes, might be explained by the high cross-tube resistances at the contact interfaces...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} model to infer from live cell images of actin {{filament}} (F-actin) flow intracellular force variations during protrusion-retraction cycles of epithelial cells in a wound healing response. To establish mechanistic relations between force development and cytoskeleton dynamics, force fluctuations were correlated with fluctuations in F-actin turnover, flow, and F-actin-vinculin coupling. Our analyses suggest that force transmission at focal adhesions (FA) requires binding of vinculin to F-actin and integrin (indirectly), which is modulated at the vinculin-integrin but not the vinculin-F-actin interface. Force transmission at FAs is co-localized in space and synchronized in time with transient increases of the boundary force at the cell edge. Surprisingly, the <b>maxima</b> in <b>adhesion</b> and boundary forces lag maximal edge advancement by ∼ 40 s. Maximal F-actin assembly is observed ∼ 20 s after maximal edge advancement. Based on these findings, we propose that protrusion events are limited by membrane tension and that the characteristic duration of a protrusion cycle {{is determined by the}} efficiency in reinforcing F-actin assembly and adhesion formation as tension increases...|$|R

The investigations have been focused on the question of <b>maximum</b> hardness, <b>adhesion</b> and tribological performance of the coatings deposited at 400 degrees C {{as a function of the}} nitrogen content in the films. All CrN/NbN superlattice coatings produced exhibit a single-phase face-centred cubic structure and { 200 } preferred orientation. The superlattice period of the coatings varies in the range Delta = 3. 4 - 7. 4 nm depending on the N- 2 flow rate. Under the sputtering conditions used, it was possible for stoichiometric CrN/NbN coatings to be deposited only in a narrow N- 2 flow rate range of around 160 seem. Both stoichiometric and sub-stoichiometric coatings showed maximum hardness values of Hk = 3580 and Hk = 3600, respectively. CrN/NbN superlattice coatings outperformed electroplated chromium by factor of 13 in dry sliding conditions. However, both coatings show similar abrasive wear in the range of 0. 63 mu m N- 1.
