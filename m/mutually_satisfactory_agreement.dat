5000|$|By January 1984, The Bank of New York {{had stopped}} funding the project {{because of poor}} sales, thus delaying {{construction}} of the first 32-story tower. That month, Armour was in negotiations with an investment firm that would help finance the project and act as project manager, allowing the first tower {{to be completed in}} approximately four months. The deal would also allow construction of the delayed second tower to begin in two months. In April 1984, after Armour spent several months devising a financial solution, The Bank of New York provided an $81 million loan to the project. Construction began again on April 30, 1984, with F. Benson & Co. Inc. as the new general contractor; Armour stated that, [...] "Perini and we were unable to work out a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>agreement</b> on terms." [...] The first tower was expected to be completed in approximately six months, while the second tower would be completed by fall 1985.|$|E
5000|$|Dost Mohammad unsuccessfully {{attacked}} the British and their Afghan protégé Shuja, and subsequently surrendered and was exiled to India in late 1840. In 1839-40, the entire {{rationale for the}} occupation of Afghanistan was changed by the Oriental Crisis when Mohammad Ali the Great, the vali (governor) of Egypt who was a close French ally, rebelled against the Sublime Porte; during the subsequent crisis, Russia and Britain co-operated against France, and with the improvement in Anglo-Russian relations, {{the need for a}} buffer state in Central Asia decreased. The Oriental Crisis of 1840 almost caused an Anglo-French war, which given the long-standing Franco-Russian rivalry caused by Nicholas's detestation of Louis-Philippe as a traitor to the conservative cause, inevitably improved relations between London and St. Petersburg, which ultimately led to the Emperor Nicholas making an imperial visit to London in 1844 to meet Queen Victoria and the Prime Minister Lord Peel. As early as 1838, Count Karl Nesselrode the Russian Foreign Minister had suggested to the British Ambassador in St. Petersburg Lord Clanricarde that Britain and Russia sign a treaty delimiting spheres of influence in Asia to end the [...] "Great Game" [...] once and for all. By 1840 Clanricarde was reporting to London that he was quite certain a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>agreement</b> could be negotiated, and all he needed was the necessary permission from the Foreign Office to begin talks. From Calcutta, Lord Auckland pressed for acceptance of the Russian offer, writing [...] "I would look forward to a tripartite Treaty of the West under which a limit shall be placed to the advance of England, Russia and Persia and under which all shall continue to repress slave dealing and plunder". Through Britain rejected the Russian offer, after 1840 there was a marked decline in Anglo-Russian rivalry and a [...] "fair working relationship in Asia" [...] had developed. The British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston rejected the Russian offer to end the [...] "Great Game" [...] as he believed that as long the [...] "Great Game" [...] continued, Britain could inconvenience Russia in Asia to better achieve her foreign policy goals in Europe much more than Russia could inconvenience Britain in Asia to achieve her foreign policy goals in Europe. Palmerston noted that because the British had more money to bribe local rulers in Central Asia, this gave them the advantage in this [...] "game", and it was thus better to keep the [...] "Great Game" [...] going. Palmerston believed it was Britain that held the advantage in the [...] "Great Game", that the Russian offer to definitely mark out spheres of influence in Asia was a sign of weakness and he preferred no such treaty be signed. From Palmerston's viewpoint accepting the Russian offer would be unwelcome {{as the end of the}} [...] "Great Game" [...] in Asia would mean the redeployment of Russian power to Europe, the place that really counted for him, and it was better to keep the [...] "Great Game" [...] going, albeit at a reduced rate given the tensions with France. At the same time, the lowering of Anglo-Russian tension in the 1840s made holding Afghanistan more of an expensive luxury from the British viewpoint as it not longer seemed quite as essential to have a friendly government in Kabul anymore.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{integrative}} approach to conflicts. Integration is an active search for information about facts and interests - motivated by a willingness to find <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>agreements</b> - and is usually necessary for creating high quality settlements in conflicts. Thus, in order to understand how to avoid win-lose outcomes, or impasses, we need knowledge about factors that relate to, and promote, integration. We here use five data-sets to explore factors relating to individuals’ inclination to integrate. Our results show that (a) degree of integration varies, that (b) the variation can be explained by individual differences, by situational differences, and to some degree by group differences, and that (c) integration predicts high quality outcomes in conflicts...|$|R

40|$|Negotiation {{between two}} trading agents is a {{two-stage}} process. First, the agents exchange offers whilst acquiring and exchanging information. Second, {{they attempt to}} reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>agreement</b> {{in the light of}} that information. This process aims to reach informed decisions in eMarket bargaining by integrating the exchange of offers and the acquisition and exchange of information drawn from the environment. Negotiation proceeds by a loose alternating offers protocol that is intended to converge when the agents believe that they are fully informed. The eNegotiation framework is a prototype for developing agents that exploit an information-rich environment in one-toone negotiation.

40|$|Mediation {{is a type}} {{of dispute}} {{resolution}} in which a third party intervenes to help disputing parties reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>agreement.</b> In recent years, individuals and organizations have begun advertising Islamic mediation services. The development of this field has important implications for Muslims living in Western countries, as Muslim minority communities have long sought ways to resolve disputes according to their personal religious beliefs. Avenues for family dispute resolution—including the civil courts, informal Islamic courts, family counseling, and informal mediation by an imam—each have distinct drawbacks. Professional Islamic mediation could fill a significant gap in services. Although some work has been done on theoretical models of Islamic conflict resolution, little information exists on the current practice of professional Islamic mediation in Muslim minority communities. This study addresses this gap in knowledge through case studies of practicing Islamic mediators. Results indicate wide iv variation in the field in terms of how practitioners themselves define Islamic mediation. There were also distinct differences in the role the mediators played in relation to th...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Integration is {{an active}} search for {{information}} about facts and interests – motivated by a willingness to find <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>agreements</b> – and is usually necessary for creating high quality settlements in conflicts. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the integrative approach to conflicts. Design/methodology/approach – Surveys, scenario studies, and experiments were used to explore factors relating to an integrative approach. First, how integration affected various outcome qualities (Study 1 and Study 2) was examined. Then Studies 3, 4 and 5, respectively, examined how integration was influenced by demographic (gender and education), individual (achievement motivation, creativity, and cognitive style), and relational (quality of the relationship) factors. Findings – Results demonstrated that an integrative approach is beneficial for various outcome‐dimensions (quality, satisfaction, fairness, and trust). Regarding predictors of an integrative approach, being male business students are negatively related to integration, while having high achievement motivation and a good relationship are positively related. Research limitations/implications – The correlational design in some of the studies make conclusions about causality questionable, and future research should examine the dynamic conflict process in more detail. Practical implications – It is helpful to know that taking an integrative approach favours all types of outcomes in conflict management processes, and that high achievement motivation and a good relationship stimulate an integrative approach.

40|$|Abstract: Negotiation is {{a process}} of human communication, {{involving}} two parties, where each with his preconceived belief and objectives, trying to reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> result after exchanging and reconciling over matters. Negotiation can be computationally modeled using CBR techniques. The negotiators represent their negotiated terms as cases, either as a flat case or multi-dimensional case. We built the negotiation engine which performs negotiation on multi-dimensional case. This engine is built on Re-maker, a system which searches suitable partner by negotiating the differences in values specified by both negotiators. Episode strategy is the negotiation technique we adopt in our negotiation engine. The generic multidimensional CBR computation model for iterative matching in with negotiation is produced. 1. 0 Introduction to Negotiation 1. 1 The Definition and the type of Negotiation Negotiation {{is a process}} of human communication, involving two parties trying to reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> result after exchanging an...|$|R
