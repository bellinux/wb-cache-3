5|$|Capelyn {{sold the}} <b>manor</b> to William Conway in 1600, who {{sold it to}} Edmund Clerke in 1612; Clerke's son {{inherited}} the <b>manor</b> in 1634 but only survived for a further two years, {{at which point the}} <b>manor</b> passed to Edmund Clerke's 8½-year-old grandson, another Edmund. This Edmund Clerke was the Sheriff of Hampshire and clerk to the Signet in 1671. Clerke the younger married the daughter of Giles Frampton, who took control of the <b>manor</b> after Clerke's death and sold it to Edmund Dummer, a former Surveyor of the Navy, in 1705.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066, Ernulf de Hesdin {{was given the}} <b>manor</b> of Ruislip, which {{included}} the woods, in recognition of his service to William the Conqueror. In 1087, Ernulf de Hesdin passed the <b>manor</b> to the Bec Abbey. During the Abbey's ownership, timber from the woods {{was used in the}} construction of the Tower of London in 1339, Windsor Castle in 1344, the Palace of Westminster in 1346 and the <b>manor</b> of the Black Prince in Kennington. Locally, the Great Barn on the <b>Manor</b> Farm site was constructed of oak from the woods. King's College, Cambridge became lords of the <b>manor</b> in 1451.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} part of the 12th century, the <b>manor</b> passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale. According to Dean, Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after the <b>manor,</b> and he may have been related to or a {{follower}} of the de Masseys. He may have also held the <b>manor</b> at some point. The de Bromales held the <b>manor</b> until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and the family name was changed.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne {{is a town}} in South Derbyshire {{close to}} the River Trent, which may have {{originated}} as buildings associated with the royal <b>manor</b> {{to the south of}} the nearby settlement at Kings Newton. Melbourne Castle was constructed on the site of an earlier <b>manor</b> house of unknown date; there is an old tradition that the <b>manor</b> was originally established in about the year 900, during the reign of Alfred the Great, but there is no evidence for this. As recorded in the Domesday Book, the <b>manor</b> of Melbourne and its lands were the property of King Edward the Confessor prior to the Norman Conquest. The property then passed into the hands of William I of England. After creating the Diocese of Carlisle in 1133, Henry I gave the <b>manor</b> for life to Æthelwold, the first bishop. Some time later, the diocese built a palace nearby on the site of what is now Melbourne Hall. When Bishop Æthelwold died in about 1156, the <b>manor</b> reverted to the crown.|$|E

50|$|From 1904 until 1967 {{the lines}} through the station were electrified, with the third-rail (North Tyneside Loop) {{and a short}} {{overhead}} electrification from Trafalgar South yard (Newcastle Quayside branch). The East Coast Main Line was re-electrified in 1990. There were three signal boxes that controlled the approaches to the <b>Manors</b> area - Argyle Street (187? - 1964), <b>Manors</b> North (1909 - 1964), <b>Manors</b> Junction (1909 - 1964). A major re-signalling of the Newcastle district in 1964 resulted in the closure of these boxes. The original <b>Manors</b> Junction signal box was burnt out in 1943, and its replacement was at {{the western end of}} <b>Manors</b> East, between platforms 7 and 8.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Manor</b> is now {{within the}} civil parish of Chippenham Without; {{unbroken}} occupation since 1282 makes Sheldon <b>Manor</b> Wiltshire's longest continuously inhabited <b>manor</b> house. It was granted Grade I listed building status by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The castle's {{positioning}} {{may have}} been to allow its garrison to guard the Tame Valley; both castle and valley were in the medieval <b>manor</b> of Tintwistle. A <b>manor</b> was a division of land and administered by a Lord of the <b>Manor</b> or his representative; {{in the case of}} Tintwistle, {{it was part of the}} larger lordship of Longdendale.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the farming}} houses, {{there are some}} <b>manors</b> in these hamlets. The most {{noteworthy}} of these <b>manors</b> is the Hattenberg castle, which was built in 1679.|$|R
50|$|Arches also inherited, or {{possibly}} purchased at reduced cost, five Oxfordshire <b>manors</b> from his childless uncle Sir Richard II Adderbury (died 1416), of Donnington Castle, Berkshire, twice MP for Oxfordshire. These <b>manors</b> were Souldern, Steeple Aston, Sibford, Ludwell, and Glympton.

5000|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century the area now known as Wilton <b>Manors</b> was known as Colohatchee. A train stop along the Florida East Coast Railroad near the current NE 24th Street shared that name. The name Wilton <b>Manors</b> was coined in 1925 by Ned Willingham, a Georgia {{transplant}} and land developer. Wilton <b>Manors</b> was incorporated in 1947.|$|R
5|$|The {{heritage}} of the region includes numerous landmarks, especially <b>manor</b> houses built by the nobility in largely in the 18th and the 19th centuries. Those include Prandau-Normann and Prandau-Mailath <b>manor</b> houses in Valpovo and Donji Miholjac respectively, <b>manor</b> houses in Baranja—in Bilje, at a former Esterházy estate in Darda, in Tikveš, and in Kneževo. Pejačevićs built several residences, the most representative ones among them being <b>manor</b> house in Virovitica and the Pejačević <b>manor</b> house in Našice. Further east, along the Danube, there are Odescalchi <b>manor</b> house in Ilok, and Eltz <b>manor</b> house in Vukovar—the latter sustained extensive damage during the Battle of Vukovar in 1991, but it was reconstructed by 2011. In the southeast of the region, the most prominent are Kutjevo Jesuit <b>manor</b> house, and Cernik <b>manor</b> house, located in Kutjevo and Cernik respectively. The period also saw construction of Tvrđa and Brod fortifications in Osijek and Slavonski Brod. Older, medieval fortifications are preserved only as ruins—the largest among those being Ružica Castle near Orahovica. Another landmark dating to the 19th century is the Đakovo Cathedral—hailed by the Pope John XXIII as the most beautiful church situated between Venice and Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|The <b>manor</b> {{house of}} Westleigh was at Higher Hall and existed in Richard I's time (1189–1199). In 1292 Sigreda, the heiress of the <b>manor,</b> married Richard de Urmston, and the <b>manor</b> {{passed to the}} Urmston family and {{remained}} there until {{the last of the}} male Urmstons died in 1659. It was later abandoned because of mining subsidence and Westleigh Old Hall became the <b>manor</b> by repute. The Ranicars and the Marsh families lived here. Westleigh Old Hall was another Leigh hall that had a moat.|$|E
5|$|The moot {{mound of}} Secklow Hundred has been found, {{excavated}} and reconstructed – {{it is on}} the highest point in the central area and is just behind the Library in modern Central Milton Keynes. Only one medieval <b>manor</b> house survives: the 15th century <b>Manor</b> Farmhouse in Loughton. There are sites of other <b>manor</b> houses in Great Woolstone, Milton Keynes village and Woughton on the Green. The oldest surviving domestic building is Number22, Milton Keynes (village), the house of the bailiff of the <b>manor</b> of Bradwell.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages Penmayne (a sub-manor of Helston-in-Trigg) {{was one of}} the Antiqua maneria (ancient <b>manors),</b> the {{original}} 17 <b>manors</b> belonging to the Earldom of Cornwall.|$|R

50|$|The {{proportion}} of the cultivated area in demesne tended to be greater in smaller <b>manors,</b> while the share of villein land was greater in large <b>manors,</b> providing {{the lord of the}} latter with a larger supply of obligatory labour for demesne work. The {{proportion of}} free tenements was generally less variable, but tended to be somewhat greater on the smaller <b>manors.</b>|$|R
5|$|The tenants of the <b>manor</b> {{apparently}} {{took their}} name from it; a Gregory de South Stoneham (or Gegory de Stoneham) is recorded there in 1236 and 1249, and in 1315 the <b>manor</b> {{was held by}} Nicholas de South Stoneham (son of Guy de South Stoneham). In 1348 Thomas de Stoneham and his wife Alice were lord and lady of the <b>manor,</b> and five heiresses of theirs– possibly daughters– held the <b>manor</b> in 1367. However, that year they quitclaimed it to Adam le Chaundle.|$|E
5|$|William Mauditt left {{a son and}} heir, Warin, a minor, whose custody was {{assigned}} by Henry III to his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall. During this time, Richard temporarily held the <b>manor</b> of Shalden from Henry until his death 1272. Consequently, Warin Mauditt held the <b>manor</b> {{until his death in}} either 1299 or 1300. Interest in the <b>manor</b> passed down to his son Thomas, in which he granted a sum of land at Shalden to a Knight named Walter Stoner and his freeman, in gratitude for his homage and services. At that time Sir Nicholas de Boys held the <b>manor</b> of Shalden as a tenant for life. In 1297 the Earl of Cornwall, in consideration of the services of Sir Nicholas, granted the <b>manor</b> to him and his heirs indefinitely. Sir Nicholas paid nothing for the <b>manor,</b> though his heirs were to pay £12 a year.|$|E
5|$|A charter for {{a weekly}} market was granted to Bartholomew de Badlesmere in 1315–16; this {{increased}} {{his status as}} Lord of the <b>Manor</b> and improved local industry. During the Middle Ages the town was visited by King HenryI and in 1324 by EdwardII. Evidence of Eastbourne's medieval past can seen in the 12th century Church of St Mary, and the <b>manor</b> house called Bourne Place.|$|E
50|$|As {{well as his}} {{custodianship}} of the Forest, William {{also held}} a number of <b>manors</b> that formed part of what was recorded in the Domesday Survey as the Honour of Peverel. His son, also William, was granted a number of further <b>manors,</b> such that the Peverels could regard it as their demesne, apart from the <b>manors</b> of Muchedeswell and Tickhill which belonged to Henry de Ferrers.|$|R
50|$|Nor were <b>manors</b> held {{necessarily}} by {{lay lords}} rendering military service (or again, cash in lieu) to their superior: a substantial share (estimated by value at 17% in England in 1086) belonged {{directly to the}} king, and a greater proportion (rather more than a quarter) were held by bishoprics and monasteries. Ecclesiastical <b>manors</b> tended to be larger, with a significantly greater villein area than neighbouring lay <b>manors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stork {{then moved}} to Wilton <b>Manors,</b> Florida; where he opened Stork's Cafe and Bakery. The {{restaurant}} became popular after its opening in 1997, and Stork became a popular figure in the city's large gay community. He was elected mayor of Wilton <b>Manors</b> in 2002, succeeding John Fiore. Wilton <b>Manors</b> thus became the first city in the United States to elect two consecutive openly gay mayors.|$|R
