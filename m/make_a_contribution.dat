5|$|Australia's {{changing}} security {{environment will}} lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from another country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security.

There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E
5|$|Life with PlayStation was a Folding@home {{application}} {{available for}} PlayStation 3 which connected to Stanford University’s Folding@home distributed computer network {{and allowed the}} user to donate their console's spare processing cycles to the project. Folding@home is supported by Stanford University and volunteers <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to society by donating computing power to this project. Research made by the project may eventually contribute {{to the creation of}} vital cures. The Folding@home client was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment in collaboration with Stanford University. Life with PlayStation also consisted of a 3D virtual view of the Earth and contained current weather and news information of various cities and countries from around the world, as well as a World Heritage channel which offered information about historical sites, and the United Village channel which is a project designed to share information about communities and cultures worldwide. As of PlayStation 3 system software update version 4.30 on October 24, 2012, the Life With PlayStation project has ended.|$|E

As a result, Muhammad went to the Nadir, asking them to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> towards the blood money of two men killed.

25|$|Velocity learnt in the {{boardroom}} that Calendar Club only bought their calendars simply to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to Great Ormond Street, and wouldn't have done so {{if it had been}} purely a commercial task. In addition, the team were criticised for selecting a cats theme that had no relevance to Great Ormond Street, but they could do little else about the choice as out of the 6 themes that both teams could use, the only child-related one was taken by Invicta. Velocity's calendar was not helped further by the failure to incorporate any of Great Ormond Steet's branding in its design.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, HECS places {{became known}} as Commonwealth {{supported}} places (CSP).

25|$|Panesar, {{along with}} Swann, was {{selected}} for the first Test of the 2009 Ashes series, held at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, as England opted to utilise two spinners. On a pitch which was expected to turn, his bowling appeared unthreatening, only taking one wicket in 35 overs. He did <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> with the bat as he and James Anderson blocked out the final 11½ overs of the match, denying Australia their final wicket and salvaging a draw for England. In view of his lack of penetration, Panesar was dropped {{for the remainder of}} the series, not appearing again in the Test team until 25 January 2012.|$|E
25|$|While Commodore Jones and Captain Landais were {{fighting}} their unexpectedly separate battles, Captains Cottineau of the Pallas and Ricot of Vengeance were left {{wondering what to}} do. In a well-organised formation, {{they might have been}} able to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contribution,</b> but to intervene in a ship-to-ship duel would be very dangerous. In theory, they could have taken advantage of the confusion to sail off after the stragglers of the convoy, but night had now fallen, and until the moon rose, they would not be able to see their prey. Also, it quickly became clear that Bonhomme Richard would need help. Therefore, they waited until they could be useful. About this time, the little schooner caught up with them, but there was no way to transfer the potentially very useful boarding team to Bonhomme Richard or Alliance.|$|E
25|$|After the Civil War, General Robert E. Lee {{turned down}} several financially tantalizing offers of {{employment}} that would merely have traded on his name, and instead accepted the post of college president for three reasons. First, he had been superintendent of the United States Military Academy on the Hudson River at West Point, New York, so supervising higher education was in his background. Second, and more important, he {{believed that it was}} a position in which he could actually <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to the reconciliation of the nation. Third, the Washington family were his in-laws: his wife was the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington, and Lee had long looked on George Washington as a hero and role model, so {{it is hardly surprising that}} he welcomed the challenge of leading a college endowed by and named after the first president.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{kept his}} place in the ODI side for the tour of India. He made four in the first match of the series as England lost by 158 runs. He made a {{patience}} 38 in the next game but England again lost, this time by 54 runs. Prior moved down the order for the final three games of series, but failed to make an impact. He scored five in the third match as England went 3–0 down. In the fourth match he had no time to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> in the back end of the innings and in the final game he again did not bat as England lost the series 5–0. Prior was recalled for the Test series between the two sides and batted well in the first match, making an unbeaten 53 in the first innings and hitting 33 in England's second innings. However, India chased down a big target for the loss of only four wickets, leaving England 1–0 down in the series. He had little impact in the next match, scoring two in England's first innings and was not needed to bat in the second as the match ended in a draw.|$|E
25|$|Both hemispheres of {{the brain}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to the McGurk effect. They work {{together}} to integrate speech information that is received through the auditory and visual senses. A McGurk response {{is more likely to}} occur in right-handed individuals for whom the face has privileged access to the right hemisphere and words to the left hemisphere. In people that have had callosotomies done, the McGurk effect is still present but significantly slower. In people with lesions to the left hemisphere {{of the brain}}, visual features often {{play a critical role in}} speech and language therapy. People with lesions in the left hemisphere of the brain show a greater McGurk effect than normal controls. Visual information strongly influences speech perception in these people. There is a lack of susceptibility to the McGurk illusion if left hemisphere damage resulted in a deficit to visual segmental speech perception. In people with right hemisphere damage, impairment on both visual-only and audio-visual integration tasks is exhibited, although they are still able to integrate the information to produce a McGurk effect. Integration only appears if visual stimuli is used to improve performance when the auditory signal is impoverished but audible. Therefore, there is a McGurk effect exhibited in people with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain but the effect is not as strong as a normal group.|$|E
