5|$|SSSIs are {{designated}} by Natural England, previously English Nature, which uses the 1974–1996 county system. This <b>means</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no grouping of SSSIs by Stockton-on-Tees unitary authority, or County Durham {{which is the}} relevant ceremonial county. As such Whitton Bridge Pasture is one of 18 SSSIs in the Cleveland area of search.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive <b>means.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E
5|$|Since 1977, Elizabeth II {{has been}} a patron of the Society, and during the Society's centenary year of 1984 she acted as its president. The British Cleveland Bay Horse Society also {{maintains}} a separate registry for part-bred horses. In the late 20th century, the breed again gained {{the attention of the}} United States public, and in 1985 the US association was reactivated, renamed the Cleveland Bay Society of North America. The US American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers their status to be critical, which <b>means</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an estimated global population of less than 2,000, and fewer than 200annual registrations in the United States. The UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust also considers their status to be critical, with less than 300breeding females registered worldwide. The Equus Survival Trust also considers the breed population to be at critical levels, meaning there are between 100 and 300breeding females left in the world. Currently, there are about 135purebred horses in the US and Canada recorded with the North American registry. There are also small populations in Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. In 2006, an estimated 550Cleveland Bay horses existed worldwide, of which about 220 were mares; the 2005 foal crop produced fewer than 50horses.|$|E

5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{is a highly}} admired falconry bird, and {{has been used in}} falconry for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia. Its advantages in falconry include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt, but an equitable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train. The {{peregrine falcon}} has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer ("waiting on") for game to be flushed, and then performing an effective and exciting high speed diving stoop to take the quarry. The speed and energy of the stoop allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds, and to deliver a knock out blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself. Additionally the versatility of the species, with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves, combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies, <b>means</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird. This size range, evolved to fit various environments and prey species, is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies, approximately five to one (approximately 1500g to 300g). The males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies, and the females of the smaller subspecies, excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks. The females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species, pheasant, and grouse.|$|E
25|$|Contrast {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in radiographic density between adjacent portions of the image. The range between black and white on the final radiograph. High contrast, or short-scale contrast, <b>means</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little gray on the radiograph, and there are fewer gray shades between black and white. Low contrast, or long-scale contrast, <b>means</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> much gray on the radiograph, and there are many gray shades between black and white.|$|E

25|$|Territorial {{behaviour}} {{is generally}} necessary for guarders, and the embryos {{are almost always}} guarded by males (apart from cichlids).

25|$|A lever is a beam {{connected}} to ground by a hinge, or pivot, called a fulcrum. The ideal lever does not dissipate or store energy, which <b>means</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no friction in the hinge or bending in the beam.

This is known as the law of the lever.|$|E
25|$|However, as {{patients}} with tumors containing mixtures of histological subtypes are usually excluded from clinical trials, {{the properties of}} multiphasic tumors like c-SCLC are much less well understood than those of monophasic tumors. C-SCLC contains both SCLC and NSCLC by definition, and since patients with SCLC and NSCLC are usually treated differently, the lack of good data on c-SCLC <b>means</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little evidence available with which to form consensus about whether c-SCLC should be treated like SCLC, NSCLC, or uniquely.|$|E
25|$|The Philadelphia {{chromosome}} is designated Ph (or Ph') chromosome and designates the shortened chromosome 22. It {{arises from}} the translocation, which is termed t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2).

Hence the chromosome breakpoints are written as (9q34.1) and (22q11.2), respectively, using ISCN standards. Notation omitting the sub-bands is also commonly seen: t(9;22)(q34;q11).|$|E
