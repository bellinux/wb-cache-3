40|$|It is well {{established}} that syncytium formation involves the fusion of mononucleated trophoblasts into a <b>multinucleated</b> <b>structure</b> and the secretion of hormonal factors, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). These morphological and bio-chemical changes are regulated by a plethora of ligands, which upon binding to specific receptors trigger the activation of many signaling pathways, such as janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (MAPK 3 / 1). We used the forskolin-induced syncytialization of trophoblastlike BeWo cells to characterize at the cellular level the effect mediated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on trophoblast differentiation and to describe its action at the molecular level. Forskolin induces both hCG secretion an...|$|E
40|$|Anther {{culture is}} one of the most widely used methods to induce gametic embryogenesis. The aim of this {{investigation}} was to induce microspore embryogenesis in almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.), through this technique. Anthers were cultured at the vacuolated developmental stage, and seven cultivars, two culture media and two temperature treatments were assessed. Although evidence of the microspore induction was observed in all the genotypes and treatments tested (symmetrical nucleus division and <b>multinucleated</b> <b>structures),</b> calli were produced merely by anthers cultured in the medium P and the regeneration of embryos was detected only in anthers of the cultivars Filippo Ceo, Lauranne and Genco, placed on medium P and subjected to the Control treatment (direct culture at 25 ± 1 °C, without the hot thermal shock at 35 ± 1 °C for 7 days). Characterization by SSR marker analysis of the embryo genotypes revealed that the regenerants had a single allele for each locus whereas the parent cultivar was heterozygous, indicating their development from haploid microspores. This study reports the evidence of gametic embryogenesis and, particularly, of microspore embryogenesis through in vitro anther culture, in almond, and, for the first time to our knowledge, the production of homozygous embryos...|$|R
40|$|Inhibition of {{encystment}} can {{be conceived}} as a potentially useful mechanism to block the transmission of Entamoeba histolytica under natural conditions. Unfortunately, amoeba encystment has not been achieved in vitro and drugs inhibiting the formation of cysts are not available. Luminal conditions inducing encystment in vivo are also unknown, but cellular stress such as exposure to reactive oxygen species from immune cells or intestinal microbiota could be involved. A role for certain divalent cations as cofactors of enzymes involved in excystment has also been described. In this study, we show that trophozoite cultures, treated with hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence of}} trace amounts of several cations, transform into small-sized spherical and refringent structures that exhibit resistance to different detergents. Ultrastructural analysis under scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed <b>multinucleated</b> <b>structures</b> (some with four nuclei) with smooth, thick membranes and multiple vacuoles. Staining with calcofluor white, as well as an ELISA binding assay using wheat germ agglutinin, demonstrated the presence of polymers of N-acetylglucosamine (chitin), which is the primary component of the natural cyst walls. Over-expression of glucosamine 6 -phosphate isomerase, likely to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the chitin synthesis pathway, was also confirmed by RT-PCR. These results suggest that E. histolytica trophozoites activate...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{cultures}} and clonal derivatives {{have been established}} from rat rhabdomyosarcomas induced by Moloney-Murine Sarcoma Virus (MSV) or by nickel sulfide; differentiation ability has been studied as expression of desmin, embryonic and adult myosin isoforms, alpha-actin isoforms and cellular fusion. The two rhabdomyosarcoma models showed different levels of myogenic differentiation. <b>Multinucleated</b> myotube-like <b>structures</b> were frequently observed in cultures derived from nickel-induced tumours. Desmin was present in 50 - 80 % of cells and embryonic myosin in up to 10 %. In MSV-tumour-derived {{cultures and}} in their metastases or clonal derivatives two cell types are present in different ratios: spindle-shaped cells, adherent to plastic surfaces, and rounded cells, loosely attached or floating free in the medium. These cultures showed features of myogenic differentiation (10 - 80 % desmin-positive cells), but embryonic myosin expression and production of <b>multinucleated</b> myotube-like <b>structures</b> were very rare events. Cultures from autochthonous lymph node and lung metastatic cells showed similar patterns of differentiation. Retinoic acid increased differentiated features (myotube formation and embryonic myosin expression) only in nickel-induced rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The two models described here mimic the heterogeneity in differentiation pattern found among human rhabdomyosarcomas. Myogenic differentiation ability was retained at a good level by nickel-induced tumours, whereas it was strongly impaired in MSV-induced tumours...|$|R
40|$|Renal tubulointerstitial lesions (RTL) were {{observed}} with high frequency in CBA/J mice more than 2 months old. RTL {{were characterized by}} interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages in the corticomedullary zone. <b>Multinucleated</b> <b>structures</b> sometimes resembling giant cells were present, and there was destruction of tubules and tubular basement membranes in areas of infiltration. Glomeruli appeared normal. RTL were first seen in 12 to 22 CBA/J mice 2. 5 to 3 months old. By the age of 7 to 9 months, 35 to 45 mice were affected, and all 24 mice 12 months old or older had RTL. CBA/J mice had these unique renal lesions whether they were purchased and examined immediately, were obtained as weanlings andreared in our quarters or those of another institution, or were fourth generation descendants of purchased breeders. The propensity to develop RTL has been present in this strain for at least 2 years. RTL were not observed in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice housed for 14 months with affected animals or {{in a survey of}} CBA/HUmc, C 57 BL/ 6 J, A/J, BALB/cJ, or C 3 H/HeJ mice. Immunofluorescent examination of CBA/J kidneys appears to rule out antitubular basement membrane autoantibodies or immune complexes in the pathogenesis of RTL...|$|R
40|$|The RMZ {{cell line}} was {{established}} from {{a bone marrow}} metastasis of a human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Since {{the beginning of the}} in vitro culture, RMZ cells showed differentiation-related morphological heterogeneity: actively proliferating polygonal or spindle-shaped cells were observed along with a few <b>multinucleated</b> myotube-like <b>structures</b> and giant cells, frequently multinucleated. All these cell types were still present after over 40 passages. A set of clonal derivatives has been obtained from the second in vitro subculture. All the clones showed the same morphological heterogeneity of the parental cells, but differed from one another in the degree of differentiation. <b>Multinucleated</b> myotube-like <b>structures</b> were strongly stained by anti-desmin antibody; most mononuclear cells were weakly stained. About 80 % of RMZ and cloned cells were scored as desmin-positive in cytocentrifuged preparations. The expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain, specifically recognized by the monoclonal antibody BF-G 6, was found in RMZ cell line and was localised in the myotube-like structures. Only a few giant cells and rare mononucleated polygonal cells were stained. The average proportion of BF-G 6 positive cells in cytocentrifuged preparations was of about 6 % of the total RMZ cells. In the two RMZ clones studied, the expression of embryonic myosin was correlated to the proportion of myotube-like structures: a BF-G 6 positivity of 35 % was found in the most differentiated one...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoid}} treatment in humans induce bone loss {{and increase the}} risk of fracture in the skeleton. The pathogenic mechanisms of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) are still unclear. The GIOP and its effects have been reproduced in several animal models including Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryo. The treatment of adult fish with prednisolone (PN) has shown a dose-dependent decrease of mineralized matrix in the scales. Large resorption lacunae are characterized by single TRAP-positive cells which migrate to the margin of the scale merging into a <b>multinucleated</b> <b>structures.</b> The treatment with PN of cultured scales did not increase TRAP activity suggesting that the massive presence of osteoclasts in the resorption sites could be likely the result of a systemic recruitment of monocyte-macrophage precursors. We observed that treatment with PN induced a significant decrease of the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in scale scleroblasts if compared with untreated controls. Then, we investigated the total mineral balance under prednisolone treatment using a time-dependent double live staining. The untreated fish fully repaired the resorption lacuna induced by prednisolone, whereas treated fish failed. The presence of osteoclast resorption fingerprints on new matrix suggested that the osteoclast activity counterbalances the osteodepositive activity exerted by scleroblasts. The treatment with PN in association with alendronate (AL) has surprisingly resulted in a significant decrease of TRAP activity and increase of ALP compared to PN-treated fish in biochemical and histological assays confirming the action of alendronate against GIOP in fish as well in human...|$|R

Methods: The case is compared with previous reports of similar entities, with emphasis on this patient’s characteristics and clinical presentation, investigations, and management. Results: Diagnosis of primary RMS of the pineal gland {{was based on the}} presence of strap cells and <b>multinucleated</b> myotube-like <b>structures,</b> as well as tumor cell expression of skeletal muscle markers consistent with myogenic differentiation.

40|$|International audienceSyncytins are {{envelope}} {{genes from}} endogenous retroviruses, " captured " {{for a role}} in pla-centation. They mediate cell-cell fusion, resulting {{in the formation of}} a syncytium (the syncy-tiotrophoblast) at the fetomaternal interface. These genes have been found in all placental mammals in which they have been searched for. Cell-cell fusion is also pivotal for muscle fiber formation and repair, where the myotubes are formed from the fusion of mononucle-ated myoblasts into large <b>multinucleated</b> <b>structures.</b> Here we show, taking advantage of mice knocked out for syncytins, that these captured genes contribute to myoblast fusion, with a > 20 % reduction in muscle mass, mean muscle fiber area and number of nuclei per fiber in knocked out mice for one of the two murine syncytin genes. Remarkably, this reduction is only observed in males, which subsequently show muscle quantitative traits more similar to those of females. In addition, we show that syncytins also contribute to muscle repair after cardiotoxin-induced injury, with again a male-specific effect on the rate and extent of regeneration. Finally, ex vivo experiments carried out on murine myoblasts demonstrate the direct involvement of syncytins in fusion, with a > 40 % reduction in fusion index upon addition of siRNA against both syncytins. Importantly, similar effects are observed with primary myoblasts from sheep, dog and human, with a 20 – 40 % reduction upon addition of siRNA against the corresponding syncytins. Altogether, these results show a direct contribution of the fusogenic syncytins to myogenesis, with a demonstrated male-dependence of the effect in mice, suggesting that these captured genes could be responsible for the muscle sexual dimorphism observed in placental mammals...|$|R
40|$|Skeletal muscle is, {{in terms}} of volume, the most {{abundant}} tissue in the vertebrate body. It exerts {{a key role in}} controlling several physiological functions such as driving locomotion, maintaining body temperature, and hosting {{a significant portion of the}} metabolic activity. Myofibers are the primary unit of all skeletal muscles, and they are specialized <b>multinucleated</b> syncytial <b>structures</b> that express a specific array of proteins necessary for muscle contraction. Myofibers are formed during development as consequence of the proliferative growth and fusion of myogenic progenitors, or myoblasts. Similarly to the hematopoietic system, skeletal muscle is formed in subsequent phases of myogenesis involving different stages of myogenic progenitors [1]. Nevertheless, not all myogenic progenitors terminally differentiate during development; a fraction of cells with myogenic potential is maintained in a primitive state in the adult organism to serve as muscle stem cells [2]. These cells can be activated in response to tissue damage or further growth demands to execute the myogenic program and contribute to muscle growth and regeneration. Assembled in this special issue on “Muscle Stem Cells ” in the Journal of Stem Cell Research and Therapy you will fin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{report a}} biphasic {{malignant}} mesothelioma in an aged female F 344 /DuCrlCrlj rat. Macroscopically, multiple pale brown nodules {{were observed in}} the abdominal cavity with retention of bloody ascites. Histopathologically, the tumor cells spread over the peritoneum and formed masses {{on the surface and}} underlying adipose tissues. The tumor cells dominantly proliferated in a solid, nodu-lar or nest-like pattern with modest amount of fibrillar connective tissues, which contained hyaluronan. The tumor consisted of ovoid, polygonal or spindle-shaped cells that possessed eosinophilic cytoplasms including glycogen; some tumor cells showed a signet-ring-like <b>structure.</b> <b>Multinucleated</b> cells and mitosis were found frequently, and direct invasion to intra-abdominal organs and intravascular metastasis to the liver were observed. Immunohistochemically, keratin and mesothelin were strongly positive in most of tumor cells, while vimentin was mainly positive in spindle-shaped cells. Podoplanin was also positive, particularly in the cell membrane of tumor cells. Electron microscopically, tumor cells showed an intercellular desmosome-like structure, basement membrane and microvillus. We diagnosed the case as a malignant peritoneal mesothelioma with a sarcomatoid growth pattern and signet-ring-like structure.

40|$|In plant breeding, {{microspore}} embryogenesis via isolated microspore {{culture is}} increasing {{as a method}} to obtain in a single-step doubled haploids and homozygosity. In this study, isolated microspore culture of eleven cultivars of loquat (Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl.) has been carried out. An analysis of anthers from different flower bud sizes, has been carried out, to identify and to select the flower bud size with anthers containing the highest quantity of vacuolated microspores. After a pre-treatment of the panicles at 4 °C in dark for 4 days, flower buds were sterilized and microspores were isolated and cultured in two different media (P and MB). Moreover, only the isolated microspores cultured in P Medium were subjected to two additional thermal shocks: cold shock (1 h at- 20 °C) and heat shock (7 days at 33 °C). All the cultures were placed in a growth cabinet at 26 ± 1 °C {{in the dark for}} 30 days and later placed in the light. Samples from cultures were processed for microscopy analysis at specific times. Observations on microspore development were carried out by fluorescence and light microscopy. The sporophytic development of isolated microspores in culture has been confirmed by the presence in the cultures of binucleated with two equal-size vegetative-type nuclei that had just started their sporophytic pathway, <b>multinucleated,</b> pollen-derived multicellular <b>structures,</b> and calli.
