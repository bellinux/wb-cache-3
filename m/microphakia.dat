40|$|Purpose. To {{direct the}} {{expression}} of 7 IFN to the eyes of transgenic mice {{as a means of}} investigating the possible role of this lyinphokine in ocular paihogenesis. Methods. Transgenic mouse strains were generated by injection of a DNA fragment containing the murine aA-crystallin promoter fused to the coding sequence of murine 7 IFN gene. PCR and RT-PCR were used to screen for the presence of the transgene and 111 RNA analyses, respectively. Methacrylate-embedded eye sections were analyzed for morphology and cryosections for immunoperoxidase antibody staining. Results. The most notable effects of 7 IFN in these transgenic mice include cataract, microphthalmia, blepharophimosis, <b>microphakia,</b> impairment of lens fiber formation, arrest of retinal differentiation, serous retinal detachment with presence of macrophages in the subretinal space, persistent, hyperplastic primary vitreous, and corneal vascularization. MHC class II niRNA levels were significantly increased in the transgenic eyes and MHC class II proteins were expressed in their cornea, iris, ciliary body, choroid, lens and RPF [...] . Conclusions. Fxiopic expression of 7 IFN in the lens a dec ted the growth of the whole eye, resulting in microphthalmia and <b>microphakia.</b> The authors ' data suggest that cvACry- 7 lF...|$|E
40|$|Chondrodysplasia calcificans punctata (CDP) {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} syndrome {{characterized by}} calcific stippling of the hyaline cartilage. CDP is classified into 4 types: the autosomal dominant Conradi-Hunermann type, the autosomal recessive rhizomelic type, the X-linked dominant form and the X-linked recessive form. We present a child affected with a rhizomelic CDP born from consanguinous parents. The ocular phenotype consisted of <b>microphakia</b> associated with a progressive bilateral "cataracta cortico-zonularis suturata". At 11 years of age, a phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation was performed in the left eye...|$|E
40|$|THE term microcornea {{should be}} {{reserved}} for the condition wherein an abnormally small cornea (diameter less than 11 mm.) occurs in an otherwise relatively normal eye (Mann, 1957). Friede (1922) suggested the term "anterior microphthalmos", because {{the whole of the}} anterior segment of the eye seems to be small. The rectus muscles are inserted abnormally far forwards, and the corneal curvature tends to be increased so that the corneal refraction is relatively great and the eye tends to be myopic. The total refraction may be almost emmetropic (Mann, 1957). Vision is usually unaffected, but the condition may occur coincidentally with buphthalmos (Fransois and Neetens, 1955); or buphthalmos may be present in the other eye (Srivastava, 1961). In some cases it is difficult to distinguish between anterior microcornea and microphthalmos. Associated ocular anomalies include colobo-mata, persistent pupillary membrane, mesoblastic tissue in the angle of the anterior chamber, <b>microphakia,</b> congenital cataract, microblepharon, and smallness of the orbit and extra-ocular muscles. Friedman and Wright (1952) reported a pedigree with eight cases among 3...|$|E

To determine if the plane of division of mitotic figures is abnormal {{in the eyes of}} these animals, trisomic embryos (9. 5 through 12 gestational days) were produced from mice doubly heterozygous for Robertsonian translocation chromosomes [Rb(1. 3) /Rb(1. 10) ]. To accommodate for the known delay in trisomic embryo development, animals were grouped according to stages of eye development rather than to gestational age. Serial sections were evaluated without knowledge of karyotype for orientation of mitotic figures (parallel, perpendicular, oblique) in lens, optic cup, and diencephalon. Location of mitotic figures was scored as apical (nearest the lumen), middle, and basal. Numerous anomalies were noted in trisomic eye development. No difference was found between orientation of mitotic figures in the lens and optic cup of trisomy 1 and normal embryos. Location of mitotic figures in trisomy 1 lens was significantly different from that of normal littermates. The data confirm earlier studies that trisomy 1 affects the eye, and they tend to corroborate evidence that this trisomy affects the lens more than it affects the optic cup. peer reviewe...|$|E

Trisomic animals {{produced}} from mice doubly heterozygous for Robertsonian translocation chromosomes [Rb(1. 3) /Rb(1. 10) ]consistently show eye defects (e. g., aphakia, <b>microphakia,</b> and retention of lens stalk). To determine if changes in distribution or composition of extracellular matrix material may {{be a factor in}} development of these defects, eye structures of trisomy (ts) 1 embryos and normal littermates were studied histochemically using the following methods: Alcian blue 8 GX, pH 2. 5; periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Alcian blue/PAS combined; high-iron diamine (HID), and HID/Alcian blue combined. Eye development was divided into stages to account for the known delay in ts 1 mouse development. Differences were found in staining patterns as early as stage 1. In later stages, the most consistent difference was an increased period of contact between lens and optic cup due to retardation of interface matrix dissolution between these rudiments in ts 1 embryos. Eyes in which this occurred had abnormally shaped lenses. Overall, the ts 1 optic cup appeared to have fewer staining abnormalities and dysmorphology than did the lens or interface matrix. Triplication of a chromosome may indirectly alter temporal and spatial organization of extracellular matrix through action on cells responsible for the production of this material. Possible mechanisms of action are discussed. peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} (Fgf) {{signalling}} plays {{a crucial role}} in many developmental processes. Among the Fgf pathway ligands, Fgf 9 (UniProt: P 54130) has been demonstrated to participate in maturation of various organs and tissues including skeleton, testes, lung, heart, and eye. Here we establish a novel Fgf 9 allele, discovered in a dominant N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) screen for eye-size abnormalities using the optical low coherence interferometry technique. The underlying mouse mutant line Aca 12 was originally identified because of its significantly reduced lens thickness. Linkage studies located Aca 12 to chromosome 14 within a 3. 6 Mb spanning interval containing the positional candidate genes Fgf 9 (MGI: 104723), Gja 3 (MGI: 95714), and Ift 88 (MGI: 98715). While no sequence differences were found in Gja 3 and Ift 88, we identified an A→G missense mutation at cDNA position 770 of the Fgf 9 gene leading to an Y 162 C amino acid exchange. In contrast to previously described Fgf 9 mutants, Fgf 9 (Y 162 C) carriers were fully viable and did not reveal reduced body-size, male-to-female sexual reversal or skeletal malformations. The histological analysis of the retina as well as its basic functional characterization by electroretinography (ERG) did not show any abnormality. However, the analysis of head-tracking response of the Fgf 9 (Y 162 C) mutants in a virtual drum indicated a gene-dosage dependent vision loss of almost 50 %. The smaller lenses in Fgf 9 (Y 162 C) suggested a role of Fgf 9 during lens development. Histological investigations showed that lens growth retardation starts during embryogenesis and continues after birth. Young Fgf 9 (Y 162 C) lenses remained transparent but developed age-related cataracts. Taken together, Fgf 9 (Y 162 C) is a novel neomorphic allele that initiates <b>microphakia</b> and reduced vision without effects on organs and tissues outside the eye. Our data point to a role of Fgf 9 signalling in primary and secondary lens fiber cell growth. The results underline the importance of allelic series to fully understand multiple functions of a gene...|$|E
