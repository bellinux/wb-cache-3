50|$|A hypercarnivore is {{an animal}} {{which has a}} diet {{that is more than}} 70% <b>meat,</b> with the <b>balance</b> {{consisting}} of non-animal foods such as fungi, fruits or other plant material. Some examples include crocodiles, alligators, owls, shrikes, eagles, felids, dolphins, snakes, marlin, spiders, scorpions and most sharks. Every species in the Felidae family, including the domesticated cat, is a hypercarnivore in its natural state. Additionally, this term is also used in paleobiology to describe taxa of animals which have an increased slicing component of their dentition relative to the grinding component. Hypercarnivores need not be apex predators. For example, salmon are exclusively carnivorous, yet they are prey at all stages of life for a variety of organisms.|$|R

The nutritional quality of frog <b>meat</b> includes properly <b>balanced</b> amino acids with a protein profile of high biological value, low fat and low cholesterol, and high digestibility due to its short chain molecule structure. It is recommended by doctors and nutritionists, especially for protein restricted children or malnourished children. Aiming to aggregate value to the segment and offer a product with nutritional properties that meet the need of children aged six months and above, a meat product based on the composition of frog meat was developed experimentally. To ensure raw material quality after bleaching and deboning, the microbiota present in the frog meat was determined. The analyses were performed according to Brazilian laws. It was observed that the resident and transient microbiota met the standards set by regulations. The results found were: mesophyll 4. 5 x 10 (4) CFU/g; Staphylococcus coagulase positive 2. 0 x 10 ² CFU/g; negative for Salmonella sp. and Aeromonas spp. The findings indicate that the raw material showed satisfactory sanitation even in terms of family industry...|$|R

40|$|Muscle cells undergo changes {{post-mortem}} {{during the}} process of converting muscle into meat, and this complex process is far from revealed. Recent reports have suggested programmed cell death (apoptosis) to be important in the very early period of converting muscle into <b>meat.</b> The dynamic <b>balance</b> that occurs between anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl- 2, and pro-apoptotic members (Bid, Bim) helps determine whether the cell initiates apoptosis. In this study, we used primary bovine skeletal muscle cells, cultured in monolayers in vitro, to investigate if apoptosis is induced when oxygen is removed from the growth medium. Primary bovine muscle cells were differentiated to form myotubes, and anoxia was induced for 6 h. The anoxic conditions significantly increased (P< 0. 05) the relative gene expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic markers (Aif, Bcl- 2, Bid and Bim), and the PARK 7 (P< 0. 05) and Grp 75 (Hsp 70) protein expressions were transiently increased. The anoxic conditions also led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which is an early apoptotic event, as well as cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Finally, reorganization and degradation of cytoskeletal filaments occurred. These results suggest that muscle cells enters apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway rapidly when available oxygen in the muscle diminishes post-mortem...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} brings current {{information}} on providing broilers with the required iodine level by {{the determination of}} its content in breast and leg muscles and {{on the relationship between}} those concentrations and iodine intake by the human population. The iodine content was assessed by the Sandell-Kolthoff method in 84 samples of broiler breast and leg muscles from seven farms in four districts of the Czech Republic, collected during the period from August to September 2004. Average iodine content in broiler breast and leg muscles was 18. 9 ± 6. 71 µg I·kg-l and 38. 1 ± 19. 79 µg I·kg-l, respectively, and coefficient of variation was 35. 5 % and 52. 0 %, respectively. Iodine concentration in leg muscles was statistically significantly higher (P < 0. 0001) relative to breast muscles. Iodine level variations in the samples from respective farms were expressed in the levels range of 11. 4 to 24. 3 µg I·kg-l and 18. 3 to 61. 2 µg I·kg-l in breast and leg muscles, respectively. The detected variations might have been caused by different iodine saturation of broilers from different herds, manifestation of physiological ability of respective animals to utilize the iodine source, potential effect of goitrogens and environmental conditions.

40|$|Nutritional deficiencies, {{especially}} micronutrient deficiencies, {{can occur}} in obese individuals. Surgical treatment may aggravate or cause these deficiencies, {{depending on the type}} of procedure, food intake and the use of multivitamins, minerals or other supplements. the objective of the study was to evaluate the nutrient intake of women who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. A cross-sectional, controlled study was conducted among 44 women after RYGB (operated-group, OG; mean years post-operation = 3. 4) and a control group of 38 healthy women (non-operated group, NOG) matched by age and economic condition. the women reported their dietary intake using a 4 -day record. the Dietary Reference Intakes was used as a reference. The macronutrient contributions to dietary energy intake presented an acceptable distribution for proteins and carbohydrates. Lipid intake was high among women in the OG and the NOG (43. 2 and 55. 3 %, respectively). in the evaluation of micronutrients, a statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for iron, zinc and vitamins B 1 and B 12. Both groups were at high risk for inadequate calcium intake, and the OG was at risk for inadequate zinc, iron and vitamin B 1 intake. The nutrient intake of women who had undergone RYGB is very similar to that of non-operated women, with the exception of a reduced intake of iron, zinc and vitamins B 1 and B 12, which may be due to the difficulty of consuming <b>meat</b> and a <b>balanced</b> diet. the findings of this study emphasize the importance of appropriate nutritional intervention and the regular use of multivitamin and mineral supplements for these patients.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • 1. Key findingsThis study {{examines}} the {{land use and}} greenhouse gas implications of UK food consumption change away from carbon intensive products. It shows that the UK agricultural land base can support increased consumption of plant-based products arising from the reduced consumption of livestock products. A 50 % reduction in livestock product consumption reduces the area of arable and grassland required to supply UK food, both in the UK and overseas. It also reduces {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} from primary production by 19 %. A switch from beef or sheepmeat (red meat) to pork or poultry (white meat) reduces food consumption related greenhouse gas emissions and the land area required but increases overseas arable land use. With this exception, the release of arable land now used to grow animal feed exceeds the additional arable land required for increased plant based foods in both the UK and overseas. Reducing livestock product consumption also has the potential to enable delivery of other significant environmental benefits, for example, reductions in ammonia and nitrate emissions. A 50 % reduction in livestock product consumption reduces UK grassland needs for UK food production by several million hectares. This land could be used to supply livestock products for export markets although our scenarios assume that the proportions of imports, domestic production and exports remain constant. In these circumstances, some of the grassland released could be used to produce arable crops, including crops for biofuel production. Almost all of it could be converted to woodland or managed in other ways for biodiversity and/or amenity purposes. Conversion of this land resource to woodland has significant potential to increase soil carbon storage while supplying biomass for energy.

The area of land needed to supply UK food and the greenhouse gas emissions from food production under current circumstances and under the seven scenarios studied. In a reduction scenario, concentrating remaining livestock production on different land types (e. g. concentrating on intensive production on lowland farms versus extensive production on lower quality land) has little effect on greenhouse gas emissions from primary production. This indicates that there is relatively little scope to reduce emissions by restructuring production (at least restructuring in relation to land use). It is further noted that concentrating livestock production on higher quality land would cause an almost complete closure of production for UK markets on land not suited to intensive grass or arable production, with biodiversity and economic impacts (discussed further below). The risks of unintended consequences with respect to greenhouse gas emissions are relatively low given the assumptions in the scenarios, but the actuality of such change will depend on future economic, social and political drivers. The report includes detailed analyses of land use and emissions data together with extensive discussion {{of a wide range of}} effects based on literature analysis. • 2. Study objectivesThis study was conducted for the UK Government's Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to examine if UK agriculture can support consumption change away from carbon- intensive food products. For the purposes of the consumption scenarios, it is assumed the relationships between imports, exports and domestic consumption remain constant for each of the commodities used by the UK food system. The following questions were addressed: 1. Land needs: Given land quality considerations (e. g. land capability and constraints), to what extent is it possible to support a change in the UK consumption of meat and dairy products with a corresponding increase in substitute goods from UK agricultural land? Can a reduction in meat and dairy product consumption release land for other purposes? To what use would this freed-up land be suitable (e. g. food production, biomass production, carbon sequestration, other ecosystem service provision, forestry, etc.) ? 2. Greenhouse gas emissions: What are the implications of the transition in production for GHGs both in the UK and abroad (including soil carbon releases, sequestration, reduced production of feed, etc, as well as reductions in direct N 2 O and CH 4 emissions? 3. Other effects: What are the other implications, including for water, other pollutants, farm incomes, availability of manure as a fertiliser input, public health, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and animal welfare? 4. International implications: If UK agricultural land cannot support consumption changes, what are the international implications in terms of agricultural production and land-use displacement (e. g. deforestation, land for biofuels, land for food), and GHGs?• 3. MethodsWe developed and used a combination of consumption and production scenarios to examine potential consequences of change. Life-cycle assessment (mainly life cycle inventory analysis) was applied to these scenarios to examine the overall effects of the consumption change on GHG and other emissions from primary production, in the UK and overseas. The production under the various scenarios was allocated to agricultural land resources by a combination of survey-based data analysis and model-derived calculations. Land use change (LUC) emissions (from changing soil C and biomass stocks) were calculated from data in the UK national inventory as well as from the UK Renewable Fuel Agency for overseas land types. Commodity flows as affected by consumption were calculated from FAOSTAT and Defra data. The resulting emissions were allocated to the various inventories in which they are registered, e. g. the UK's GHG inventories for agriculture, LUC, energy use and industry, together with those from overseas that are made up by components from our UK consumption of food and drink. Scientific literature relevant to the wider assessment of these scenarios was analysed (and an ecosystems services method was applied) to enable a qualitative assessment to complement the quantitative analysis. ScenariosWe designed a range of consumption and production scenarios to examine options on both the demand and supply sides. These comprise three consumption and three production scenarios. The consumption scenarios are as follows: Consumption Scenario 1. A 50 % reduction in livestock product consumption balanced by increases in plant commodities. Consumption Scenario 2. A shift from red meat (beef and lamb) to white meat (pork and poultry). Red meat consumption is reduced by 75 %. Consumption Scenario 3. A 50 % reduction in white <b>meat</b> consumption <b>balanced</b> by increases in plant commodities. It must be stressed that the nature of scenarios is such that they contain a variety of assumptions about possible future demands and supplies of agricultural commodities. The scenarios are not forecasts. The focus has been on the technical capacity of land and agricultural production, not on the market changes needed to enable change. It should be noted that the balance of supply from the UK and overseas is assumed to remain as it is now. The 50 % reduction in livestock products was not applied uniformly across these commodities. Under the reduction scenario (Consumption scenario 1), consumption of milk and eggs is 60 % of current consumption, and meat consumption is 36 % of current consumption. Sugar consumption is also reduced to align with healthy eating guidelines. Reduction in consumption of livestock products is balanced by increasing plant consumption on the basis of constant food energy supplied. Fruit and vegetable consumption was increased by 50 % and basic carbohydrate (e. g. cereals, potatoes) and oil rich commodities (except palm oil) by 33 %. Substitution was estimated on the basis of food energy use at the commodity level using FAOSTAT data. Expert opinion was obtained in relation to the viability of consumption change under Scenario 1. This indicated that diets at the consumer level under this scenario are viable from a nutritional viewpoint. It was also noted that Consumption Scenario 1 aligns with healthy eating guidelines in other countries. The production scenarios are focused on the intensity of use of different types of land. The result is a difference in the quantity and type of land ‘released' from production from change that reduces land needs. The production scenarios are: Production Scenario 1. Uniform land release - ‘pro-rata' changes in land requirements across land types. Production Scenario 2. Maximise release of tillable land - ruminant meat production concentrated on lower quality land. Production Scenario 3. Maximise release of low quality land - ruminant meat production concentrated on high quality land. The combination of consumption scenarios 1 and 2 and three production|$|R
