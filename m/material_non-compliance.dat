The audit further stated that [...] "most significantly", it [...] "found that BBBSA's practices for recording and supporting grant-related expenditures were inadequate to safeguard grant funds and ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the grants".|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the standards for attest engagements {{is an important component}} of the body of knowledge that certified public accountants are expected to possess, and attestation standards became a more important portion of the CPA exam in 2011. However, few instructional case studies are available that deal specifically with the attestation function outside of the financial statement audit. This case is based on real events and addresses some of the key aspects of the attestation standards. The CPA firm of Altschuler, Melvoin, and Glasser, LLP provided an attestation report regarding the assertion of Sentinel Management Group (a registered investment adviser) that it had complied with regulations regarding recordkeeping and custody of assets held for its investment clients. The accounting firm failed to follow the applicable attestation standards and, as a result, did not detect <b>material</b> <b>non-compliance</b> record-keeping and custody regulations for investment advisers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A need exits {{to develop}} a {{protocol}} for preventing pressure ulcers (PUs) in private for-profit nursing homes in Hong Kong, where the incidence of PUs is relatively high and which have high proportion of non-professional care staff. The implementation of such protocol would involve changes {{in the practice of}} care, likely evoking feelings of fear and uncertainty that may become a barrier to staff adherence. We thus adopted the Systems Model of Action Research in this study to manage the process of change for improving PU prevention care and {{to develop a}} pressure ulcer prevention protocol for private for-profit nursing homes. Methods A total of 474 residents and care staff who were health workers, personal care workers, and/or nurses from four private, for-profit nursing homes in Hong Kong participated in this study. Three cyclic stages and steps, namely, unfreezing (planning), changing (action), and refreezing (results) were carried out. During each cycle, focus group interviews, field observations of the care staff’s practices and inspections of the skin of the residents for pressure ulcers were conducted to evaluate the implementation of the protocol. Qualitative content analysis was adopted to analyse the data. The data and methodological triangulation used in this study increased the credibility and validity of the results. Results The following nine themes emerged from this study: prevention practices after the occurrence of PUs, the improper use of pressure ulcer prevention <b>materials,</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with several prevention practices, improper prevention practices, the perception that the preventive care was being performed correctly, inadequate readiness to use the risk assessment tool, an undesirable environment, the supplying of unfavorable resources, and various management styles in the homes with or without nurses. At {{the end of the third}} cycle, the changes that were identified included improved compliance with the revised risk assessment method, the timely and appropriate use of PU prevention materials, the empowering of staff to improve the quality of PU care, and improved home management. Conclusion Through the action research approach, the care staff were empowered and their PU prevention care practices had improved, which contributed to the decreased incidence of pressure ulcers. A PU prevention protocol that was accepted by the staff was finally developed as the standard of care for such homes...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{establish}} midwives’ perception of ethical and professional malpractices in labour units and to enhance the awareness of ethical behaviour and professional practice by midwives. Design: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and cross sectional design was followed to explore the midwives understanding of and experiences of ethical practice and professional malpractices in Labour Units of Tshwane, Gauteng Province. A non-probability purposive sampling was used to draw a sample from midwives with two or more years of experience working in Labour Units. Data collection: Individual in-depth interviews using open ended questions were used to collect data. Interviews were recorded using an audio tape recorder, which was later transcribed verbatim. Data collection was continuous until saturation was reached with the eight (n= 8) participant. Findings: the results of the study revealed that midwives do understand the ethical code of conduct. However, due to challenges such as shortage of staff; shortage of <b>material</b> resources; <b>non-compliance</b> of midwives to policies and guidelines; fear of decision-making; and lack of management support, all this makes ethical conduct more challenging. It is hoped that the findings of this research will make contributions to midwifery training and practice. Health StudiesM. A. (Health Studies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is the world's second {{leading cause}} of {{long-term}} disability. The current estimate reveals that 120 million people in 83 {{countries of the world}} are infected with LF parasites and more than 20 % of the world's population are at risk of acquiring infection. The present study was con-ducted to assess the program effectiveness of the 2 -drug strategy in terms of actual coverage, compliance rates of MDA against filariasis in the district along with the reasons for non-compliance. Objectives: To eval-uate independently the MDA Programme against Filariasis with respect to its coverage and compliance among the community. To know the reasons for <b>non-compliance.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: A Community based Cross-Sectional Study was conducted in Bijapur District. A total of four clusters, one urban and three rural clusters were selected randomly. All the sampled eligible population who belong to the MDA campaign area were included. The eligible population did not include pregnant and lactating women, children below two years of age and seriously ill persons. The data were collected in pretested Performa, tabulated using Microsoft Excel 2013 and analysed using OPENEpi software. Results: The demographic profile of the study sample is as follows, 67. 6 % of the population were in the age group of 14 - 60 years. Male to female ratio was equal. 66. 48 % of the study population were from rural area and 33. 52 % were from urban area. 81. 63 % of the population received the drugs. 79. 21 % of the population consumed the DEC and Albendazole tablets. 14. 60 % of the sample population did not consume. Major reasons for not taking tablets were fear of side effects (56. 67 %) and 22. 50 % forgotten to take the tablets. Conclusions: The effective coverage was below the target (85 %). The overall coverage was better in rural areas compared with urban areas...|$|R
40|$|Two runways {{at a major}} Australian airport were {{overlaid}} with asphalt. Approximately {{six months}} after the completion of the works, a number of localised horizontal surface deformations were identified in one runway, concentrated in the heavy braking and turning zone. Initial investigations found no evidence of <b>material</b> <b>non-compliance,</b> systemic construction deficiency or design inadequacy. Both the bond to the underlying asphalt layer and critical aircraft-induced shear stresses were consistent across both runways. The failures were the result of low resistance to cyclic shear creep due to asphalt tenderness. A different dust source was used in the manufacture of the asphalt surface on each of the two runways. Subsequent investigation also identified a coincidentally concurrent change in the crude oil used in the manufacture of the nominally identical batches of bitumen. Forensic testing of the asphalts’ constituent materials found no significant differences except in the petrography of the two dust sources and the post-ageing viscosity of the bitumen when tested two years after construction. The dust used in the manufacture of the poorly performing asphalt contained a potentially detrimental clay mineral called Hisingerite. The change in dust was confounded with the change in measured binder properties. These simultaneous changes in the asphalt mastic constituents were correlated with the reduction in cyclic shear creep resistance observed in the field. Further investigation is required to determine which element of the mastic was responsible for the asphalt tenderness...|$|E
