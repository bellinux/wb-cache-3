5|$|A CeSID poll in June 2015 {{conducted}} {{with the support of}} the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) indicated that only 12 percent of those polled supported for NATO membership, down from 25 percent in 2012, and 73 percent were opposed. The minor Liberal Democratic Party and Serbian Renewal Movement remain the <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> political parties in favor of NATO membership. Although Serbia aspires to join the European Union, Serbia may seek to maintain military neutrality, joining neither NATO nor the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).|$|E

50|$|Sportin' Life is {{the fifteenth}} studio album by Weather Report, {{released}} in 1985. Although featuring many more vocal performances {{than any of}} their previous albums, words are rare and <b>most</b> <b>vocals</b> are chants from Bobby McFerrin or Carl Anderson. The album is named after a character from Porgy and Bess.|$|R
5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms {{that regularly}} made {{the front pages}} of newspapers, because they went beyond the war to American government, business, and military leadership. He feared the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there. Historian Robert Buzzanco noted that Shoup may have been the <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> former military member to oppose the war.|$|E
5|$|King Stanisław Augustus {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. In Polish historiography and popular works, {{he has been}} criticized or marginalized by Szymon Askenazy, Joachim Lelewel, Jerzy Łojek (whom Andrzej Zahorski describes as Poniatowski's <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> critic among modern historians), Tadeusz Korzon, Karol Zyszewski and Krystyna Zienkowska, whereas more neutral or positive views have been expressed by Paweł Jasienica, Walerian Kalinka, Władysław Konopczyński, Stanisław Mackiewicz, Emanuel Rostworowski and Stanisław Wasylewski.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} of feathered dinosaurs {{has not been}} without controversy; perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils {{are the result of}} the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin, and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but convergent with dinosaurs. However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, {{to the point that the}} scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.|$|E

5000|$|When [...] "Spritneybears", one of Norway's most selling {{artists for}} 3 years finally {{released}} its album in 2003, rumours arose that the artists had never sung any vocals on the albums themselves. It was rumoured that <b>most</b> <b>vocals</b> were instead performed by Kjetil Tefke, {{who was never}} officially attached to the band or credited.|$|R
5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to enforce the}} revenue laws were met with stiff resistance {{from a number of}} Massachusetts communities. Several towns refused to choose commissioners to assess the town population and estates, and officials from a number of them were consequently arrested and brought to Boston. Some were fined and released, while others were imprisoned until they promised to perform their duties. The leaders of Ipswich, who had been <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> in their opposition to the law, were tried and convicted of misdemeanor offenses.|$|E
5|$|In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio. While this news was met with excitement at first, scholars—after reading the work—began {{to argue that the}} manuscript was a fraud, with humanist Antonio Riccoboni being among the <b>most</b> <b>vocal.</b> However, Sigonio continued to defend the work until his death, even mentioning in two different orations his belief in the truthfulness of the text. The scholar Latino Latini, however, later claimed in a letter that Sigonio had admitted to the forgery on his deathbed. By and large, the academic community concluded that the version of the Consolatio discovered was not genuine, and the document later earned the name the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio.|$|E
5|$|Norway sent {{a strong}} {{contingent}} with four jumpers {{able to win}} the event, including reigning Olympic and world champion Jacob Tullin Thams. Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualification events. World record holder Nels Nelsen from Canada was not permitted to participate due to financial problems. Japan participated in an international ski jumping competition for the first time, also becoming the first Asian country to do so. After the first jump, three Norwegians were in the lead. A 40-minute discussion erupted regarding the speed, with Central European jumpers wanting it increased. This was complied with by the jury, resulting in falls by several favorites, including the <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> speed increase proponents, Gérard Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani. Andersen and Ruud won by reducing their speed on the in-run.|$|E

Furthermore, they issued four independent CD productions.|$|R
5|$|The Kop {{is a large}} single-tiered stand. Originally a large terraced banking {{providing}} accommodation {{for more}} than 30,000spectators, the current incarnation was constructed in 1994–95 and is single-tiered with no executive boxes. The Kop houses the club's museum, the Reducate centre and the official club shop. The Kop is the most-renowned stand at Anfield among home and away supporters, {{with the people who}} occupy the stand referred to as kopites. Such was the reputation that the stand had it was claimed that the crowd in the Kop could suck the ball into the goal. Traditionally, Liverpool's <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> supporters congregate in this stand.|$|E
5|$|The Sumatran rhino is {{a mostly}} solitary animal except for {{courtship}} and offspring-rearing. It is the <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> rhino species and also communicates through marking soil with its feet, twisting saplings into patterns, and leaving excrement. The species {{is much better}} studied than the similarly reclusive Javan rhinoceros, {{in part because of}} a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species. There was little or no information about procedures that would assist in ex situ breeding. Though a number of rhinos died once at the various destinations and no offspring were produced for nearly 20 years, the rhinos were all doomed in their soon to be logged forest. In March 2016, a Sumatran rhinoceros was spotted in Indonesian Borneo.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} El-Sherbini {{immediately}} resulted in international reactions, with the <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> responses coming from predominantly Muslim nations. The Egyptian public and media {{focused attention on}} the religious and racial hatred aspect of the killing, especially as the initial confrontation between the victim and perpetrator had happened because she wore an Islamic headscarf. In response to anti-German sentiments and public protests in Egypt and other countries, the German government issued a statement of condolence nine days after the incident. Wiens's trial for murder and attempted murder occurred under strict security measures and was observed by national and international media, diplomats and legal experts.|$|E

5|$|Theo died in January 1891, {{removing}} Vincent's <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> and well-connected champion. Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her twenties who had {{not known}} either her husband or her brother-in law very long and who suddenly {{had to take care}} of several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. Gauguin was not inclined to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh's reputation, and Johanna's brother Andries Bonger also seemed lukewarm about his work. Aurier, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters among the critics, died of typhoid fever in 1892 at the age of twenty-seven.|$|E
5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E
5|$|Bosniak {{scholars}} {{object to}} the ostensibly negative portrayal of Muslim characters in Andrić's works. During the 1950s, his <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> Bosniak detractors accused him of everything from plagiarism to being a Serb nationalist, and made remarks insinuating that he was homosexual. Some {{went so far as}} to call for his Nobel Prize to be taken away. Most Bosniak criticism of his works appeared in the period immediately before the breakup of Yugoslavia and in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. In early 1992, a Bosniak nationalist in Višegrad destroyed a statue of Andrić with a sledgehammer. Twenty years later, in 2012, filmmaker Emir Kusturica and Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik unveiled another statue of Andrić in Višegrad, this time as part of the construction of an ethno-town called Andrićgrad, sponsored by Kusturica and the Government of Republika Srpska. Andrićgrad was officially inaugurated in June 2014, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1944, Alejandro Cordova, {{the editor}} of El Imparcial, the main {{opposition}} newspaper, was assassinated. This led to the military coup plotters {{reaching out to the}} leaders of the protests, in an attempt to turn the coup into a popular uprising. Ponce Vaides announced elections, but the pro-democracy forces denounced them as a fraud, citing his attempts to rig them. Ponce Vaides sought to stabilize his regime by playing on inter-racial tension within the Guatemalan population. The <b>most</b> <b>vocal</b> support for the revolution had come from the Ladinos, or people of mixed racial or Spanish descent. Ponce Vaides sought to exploit their fear of the Indians by paying thousands of indigenous peasants to march in Guatemala City in his support, and promising them land if they supported the Liberal party that Ubico had begun as a front for the dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} is an {{especially}} noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter may be the <b>most</b> <b>vocal.</b> Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream {{may be used in}} bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates.|$|E
