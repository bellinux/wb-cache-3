In light of these findings, it is essential to preserve the peripheral rim during partial meniscectomy to avoid irreversible disruption of the structure's hoop tension capability.|$|E

50|$|These <b>menisci</b> act to {{distribute}} body weight across the knee joint. Without the <b>menisci,</b> {{the weight of}} the body would be unevenly applied to the bones in the legs (the femur and tibia).

The <b>menisci</b> also contribute to the stability of the joint.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Cushioning' of {{the joint}} is {{provided}} by two C-shaped pieces of cartilage called <b>menisci</b> which sit between the medial and lateral chondyles of the distal femur and the tibial plateau. The main biomechanical function of the <b>menisci</b> is probably to divide the joint into two functional units—the 'femoromeniscal joint' for flexion/extension movements and the 'meniscotibial joint' for rotation—a function analogous {{to that of the}} disc dividing the temporomandibular (jaw) joint. The <b>menisci</b> also contain nerve endings which are used to assist in proprioreception.|$|E
5000|$|The {{articular}} disks of the knee-joint {{are called}} <b>menisci</b> because they only partly divide the joint space. [...] These two disks, the medial meniscus and the lateral meniscus, consist of connective tissue with extensive collagen fibers containing cartilage-like cells. Strong fibers {{run along the}} <b>menisci</b> from one attachment to the other, while weaker radial fibers are interlaced with the former. The <b>menisci</b> are flattened {{at the center of}} the knee joint, fused with the synovial membrane laterally, and can move over the tibial surface.|$|E
50|$|The joint capsule {{attaches}} to the entire periphery of each <b>meniscus</b> but adheres more firmly to the medial <b>meniscus.</b> An interruption in the attachment of the joint capsule to the lateral <b>meniscus,</b> forming the popliteal hiatus, allows the popliteus tendon to pass through to its femoral attachment site. Contraction by the popliteus during knee flexion pulls the lateral <b>meniscus</b> posteriorly, avoiding entrapment within the joint space. The medial <b>meniscus</b> {{does not have a}} direct muscular connection. The medial <b>meniscus</b> may shift a few millimeters, while the less stable lateral <b>meniscus</b> may move at least 1 cm.|$|R
50|$|The lateral <b>meniscus</b> has firm {{attachments}} medially to the intercondylar area via {{the ends}} of the <b>meniscus,</b> and posteromedially via the posterior meniscofemoral ligament, which attaches the posterior limb of the <b>meniscus</b> to the posterior cruciate ligament and medial femoral condyle. The lateral <b>meniscus</b> is not directly connected to the fibular collateral ligament, and is thus more movable than the medial <b>meniscus.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of bilateral, {{permanent}} subluxation of the lateral <b>meniscus.</b> To our knowledge, the present case is the first reported description of bilateral irreducible anterior dislocation of the posterior segment of the lateral <b>meniscus.</b> This disorder {{is characterized by a}} flipped <b>meniscus</b> sign of the lateral <b>meniscus</b> on sagittal magnetic resonance images of the knee joint, with no history of trauma or locking symptoms. A detailed examination of serial magnetic resonance images of the lateral <b>meniscus</b> can help differentiate this condition from malformation of the lateral <b>meniscus,</b> that is, a double-layered <b>meniscus.</b> We recommend two-stage treatment for this disorder. First, the knee joint is kept in straight position for 3 weeks after the lateral <b>meniscus</b> is reduced to the normal position. Second, if subluxation of the lateral <b>meniscus</b> recurs, meniscocapsular suture is then performed.

5000|$|It is also worthy {{to mention}} that {{different}} pore geometries result in different types of curvature. In scientific studies of capillary condensation, the hemispherical meniscus situation (that resulting from a perfectly cylindrical pore) is most often investigated due to its simplicity. [...] Cylindrical <b>menisci</b> are also useful systems because they typically result from scratches, cuts, and slit-type capillaries in surfaces. Many other types of curvature are possible and equations for the curvature of <b>menisci</b> are readily available at numerous sources.

Meniscus tears occur during sports often when the knee is twisted. <b>Menisci</b> injury may be innocuous and one may be able to walk after a tear, but soon swelling and pain set in.

Therefore, cell-based strategies for <b>meniscus</b> tissue engineering play a fundamental role in meniscal regeneration. According to current studies, the main cell-based strategies for <b>meniscus</b> tissue engineering are single cell type strategies; cell coculture strategies also were applied to <b>meniscus</b> tissue engineering. Likewise, on the one side, the zonal recapitulation strategies based on mimicking meniscal differing cells and internal architectures have received wide attentions.

40|$|The knee <b>meniscus</b> {{is prone}} to damage, which leads to pain and {{inhibits}} mobility in the joint long term. Due to the minimal vascularity, low cellularity and large mechanical forces imparted on the <b>meniscus</b> with normal use, endogenous repair is limited. Resection of the damaged region of the tissue (meniscectomy) remains the most common treatment for a torn <b>meniscus,</b> but this procedure results in cartilage degradation and other adverse changes in the knee joint. Given the prevalence of <b>meniscus</b> damage, there is thus a pressing need for novel approaches to <b>meniscus</b> repair. To address this issue, this thesis developed in vitro techniques to analyze the time-varying properties of the aging <b>meniscus,</b> and to address how the <b>meniscus</b> repair interface might be modulated {{through the use of}} growth factors. Further, electrospun scaffolds were designed to replicate key architectures of the native tissue while providing controlled release of biologic factors. Our findings demonstrated marked biological, biochemical, and structural changes in <b>meniscus</b> with age. These findings pointed to key factors that could play a role in <b>meniscus</b> integration (ie repair) capacity after <b>meniscus</b> injury; these factors were evaluated in the context of <b>meniscus</b> repair using a mechanical in vitro model.

5000|$|Acute {{injury to}} the medial <b>meniscus</b> {{frequently}} accompanies an {{injury to the}} ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) or MCL (medial collateral ligament). A person occasionally injures the medial <b>meniscus</b> without harming the ligaments. Healing of the medial <b>meniscus</b> is generally not possible unless the patient is very young, usually <15 years old. Damage to the outer third of the <b>meniscus</b> has the best healing potential because of the blood supply, but the inner {{two thirds of the}} medial <b>meniscus</b> has a limited blood supply and thus limited healing ability. Large tears to the <b>meniscus</b> may require surgical repair or removal. In terms of a <b>meniscus</b> tear, the doctor can categorize the injury in a plethora of ways. For example, a tear on {{the outer edge of the}} <b>meniscus</b> has great chance of healing. Doctors call this site the “red zone” because this outer portion of the <b>meniscus</b> is highly vascularized; therefore, it receives the amount of nutrients and support needed for a successful recovery. Conversely, the inner two-thirds of the <b>meniscus</b> are called the “white zone.” This portion of the <b>meniscus</b> is not highly vascularized; it receives its nourishment from only the synovial fluid via diffusion.

5000|$|The medial {{meniscus}} is a C-wedge shaped {{piece of}} cartilage {{that acts as}} a"shock absorber" [...] between the femur and the tibia.

5000|$|When {{the knee}} is being {{extended}} the ligament prevents the anterior horns of the <b>menisci</b> from moving forward, and the condylar {{surfaces of the}} femur and tibia from exerting pressure on the <b>menisci.</b> [...] It has a restricting effect on anterior-posterior excursion of the anterior horn of the medial meniscus at lower degrees of knee flexion.|$|E
50|$|When {{water is}} {{in contact with}} solid {{particles}} (e.g., clay or sand particles within soil), adhesive intermolecular forces between {{the water and the}} solid can be large and important. The forces between the water molecules and the solid particles in combination with attraction among water molecules promote surface tension and the formation of <b>menisci</b> within the solid matrix. Force is then required to break these <b>menisci.</b> The magnitude of matrix potential depends on the distances between solid particles—the width of the <b>menisci</b> (also capillary action and differing Pa at ends of capillary)—and the chemical composition of the solid matrix (meniscus, macroscopic motion due to ionic attraction).|$|E
