In September, he announced that his goal was to participate in the 2014 Winter Olympics. In October, U.S. Figure Skating announced that he would not compete at the 2011 Skate America due to a financial disagreement, and Lysacek confirmed that he would not take part in the Grand Prix series, explaining on his Twitter that [...] "a suitable agreement could not be reached between U.S. Figure Skating and <b>myself</b> <b>by</b> the event entry deadline".

500|$|Although Wollstonecraft argues against {{excessive}} sensibility, {{the rhetoric}} of the Rights of Woman is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at Rousseau. For example, after excerpting a long passage from [...] (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, [...] "I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness." [...] A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau's plan for female education, she writes [...] "I must relieve <b>myself</b> <b>by</b> drawing another picture." [...] These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader will agree with them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience, she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self. Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.|$|E
500|$|De Girolamo left York to join League Two rivals Northampton on {{loan for}} the rest of the season, {{explaining}} that [...] "Northampton play attractive football and express <b>myself</b> <b>by</b> getting on the ball a lot". Winfield was recalled from his loan at AFC Wimbledon, having made seven appearances for them, after Zubar injured his thigh during the Bury match. Richard Cresswell was appointed as Wilcox's first-team coach, having previously held a consultancy role at the club since April 2014. York were held to a 2–2 draw away to Accrington; after Summerfield gave York the lead with a deflected 20-yard shot in the 63rd minute, Seán Maguire equalised after pouncing on a loose ball six minutes later. In the 76th minute Hyde put York back in the lead with a close-range finish before Josh Windass scored for Accrington with a 20-yard free kick in the 90th minute. This result meant York were one point above the relegation zone, but just two points from the bottom of the table. Ahead of the transfer deadline for loan signings, York signed two strikers on loan {{for the rest}} of the season; Shaun Miller from Coventry City and Josh O'Hanlon from Bournemouth. York moved three points above the relegation zone after beating Mansfield 4–1 away, Lowe opening the scoring with a header before Coulthirst scored with a low finish. Despite Olejnik being off sent off later in the first half for handling outside the penalty area, Hyde scored with a header shortly after half-time. Matt Rhead pulled one back for Mansfield before Coulthirst finished the scoring in the 89th minute.|$|E

She {{also stated that}} when she expressed her desire to part with the label, she was threatened with the public being told {{that she had been}} dropped instead of parting amicably. However, further creative differences in relation to her fifth studio album finally caused Lewis to leave the label. Of her departure, she stated, [...] "I was asked to make a record {{that would not have been}} true to <b>myself.</b> <b>By</b> all means as an artist in this climate, I was thankful to even get the chance to make another record.

The following summer, July if I remember correctly, I went as usual to visit him when Mr. Aston, laughing, said ‘similarly you don’t know about this person’s publications’ and showed me five books containing six volumes in temporary bindings which had been published. They, the Kawatake Mokuami script series, had been published as articles by the Ginza’s Kabuki Shinpō [...] (Kabuki News) Company. They covered ‘Nakamitsu’, ‘Four Thousand Ryō‘ (...)

2500|$|Critic Joseph Conte {{describes}} the epic {{as a long}} poem that [...] "has to have grand voice and purpose[...] [...] it has to say something big." [...] Lynn Keller describes one of the epic's aspects as including a [...] "quasi-circular quest-journey structure" [...] that she says {{is present in the}} long poem Song of <b>Myself</b> <b>by</b> Whitman. [...] Yet that long poem, Keller notes, does not have a [...] "specified end toward which the poem or speaker is directed," [...] unlike a more traditional long poem. [...] Though long poems do have roots in the epic form, that does not mean long poems that are epic-like are completely epic. [...] A second example of long poems distancing themselves from the traditional epic form is seen in Helen In Egypt by H.D. [...] Though traditional epics feature physical quests or journeys, Helen In Egypt is about the psychological journey of Helen.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a period}} of the game's history when betting and match-fixing was rife, Beldham was not immune to the lure of easy money. When interviewed by Pycroft in the late 1830s, he said: [...] "You may hear that I sold matches. I will confess I once was sold <b>myself</b> <b>by</b> two men, one of whom would not bowl, and the other would not bat, his best, and lost ten pounds. The next match, at Nottingham, I joined in selling, and got my money back. But for this once, I could say I never was bought {{in my life and}} this was not for want of offers from C and other turfmen, though often I must have been accused. For where it was worth while to buy, no man could keep a character; because to be out without runs or to miss a catch was, by the {{disappointed}} betting-men, deemed proof as strong as Holy Writ".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first film}} {{to be based}} upon Moore's work was From Hell in 2001, which was {{directed}} by the Hughes Brothers. The film {{made a number of}} radical differences from the original comic, altering the main character from an older, conservative detective to a young character played by Johnny Depp. This was followed in 2003 with The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, a film that departed radically from the books, changing the ending from a mob war over the skies of London to the infiltration of a secret base in Tibet. For these two works, Moore was content to allow the filmmakers to do whatever they wished and removed himself from the process entirely. [...] "As long as I could distance <b>myself</b> <b>by</b> not seeing them," [...] he said, he could profit from the films while leaving the original comics untouched, [...] "assured no one would confuse the two. This was probably naïve on my part." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Terry Nation {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} Ronnie Marsh, the BBC's Head of Serials, to discuss ideas for new television series. Marsh was looking for formats for co-productions with American television channels. Nation suggested a number of ideas, mostly for crime dramas, none of which appealed to Marsh. According to Nation, [...] "...the interview was {{drawing to a close}} when I surprised <b>myself</b> <b>by</b> starting to detail a new science fiction adventure [...] 'Have you got a title?' someone asked. Blake's 7 I replied without hesitation". Marsh's notes of the meeting survive and record the pitch Nation made as follows: “cracking Boy's Own/ kidult sci-fi. A space Western adventure. A modern swashbuckler. Blake's Seven. Group of villains being escorted onto a rocket ship (transported) which goes astray & lands on an alien planet where inhabitants are planning to invade & destroy Earth. Possibly live underground". Nation left the meeting with a commission for a pilot script and [...] "...the bewildered feeling that [...] I could not trace the source of the idea". Nation submitted his pilot script, titled [...] "Blake's 7 – A Television Series created by Terry Nation", in April 1976, sub-titling the draft episode Cygnus Alpha.|$|E

2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all going to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated <b>myself</b> <b>by</b> everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
