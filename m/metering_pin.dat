40|$|Soil surface {{roughness}} (SSR) expresses soil susceptibility to {{wind and water}} erosion and {{plays an important role}} in the development and the maintenance of soil biota. Several methods have been developed to characterise SSR based on different methods of acquiring data. Because the main problems related to these methods involve the use and handling of equipment in the field, the present study aims to fill the need for a method for measuring SSR that is more reliable, low-cost and convenient in the field than traditional field methods. Shadow analysis, which interprets micro-topographic shadows, is based on the principle that there is a direct relationship between the soil {{surface roughness}} and the shadows cast by soil structures under fixed sunlight conditions. SSR was calculated with shadows analysis in the laboratory using hemispheres of different diameter with a diverse distribution of known altitudes and a surface area of 1 m 2 . Data obtained from the shadow analysis were compared to data obtained with the chain method and simulation of the micro-relief. The results show a relationship among the SSR calculated using the different methods. To further improve the method, shadow analysis was used to measure the SSR in a sandy clay loam field using different tillage tools (chisel, tiller and roller) and in a control of 4 m 2 surface plots divided into subplots of 1 m 2 . The measurements were compared to the data obtained using the chain set and <b>pin</b> <b>meter</b> methods. The SSR measured was the highest when the chisel was used, followed by the tiller and the roller, and finally the control, for each of the three methods. Shadow analysis is shown to be a reliable method that does not disturb the measured surface, is easy to handle and analyse, and shortens the time involved in field operations by a factor ranging from 4 to 20 compared to well known techniques such as the chain set and <b>pin</b> <b>meter</b> methods...|$|R
40|$|Testing to {{determine}} the effects of joint freeplay and pretensioning of diagonal members on the dynamic characteristics of a two-dimensional box truss beam was conducted. The test article was ten bays of planar truss suspended by long wires at each joint. Each bay measured 2 <b>meters</b> per side. <b>Pins</b> of varying size were used to simulate various joint freeplay conditions. Single-point random excitation was the primary method of test. The rational fraction polynomial method was used to extract modal characteristics from test data. A finite element model of the test article was generated from which modal characteristics were predicted. These were compared with those obtained from tests. With the exception of the fundamental mode, correlation of theoretical and experimental results was poor, caused by the resonant coupling of local truss member bending modes with global truss beam modes. This coupling introduced many modes in the frequency range of interest whose frequencies were sensitive to joint boundary conditions. It was concluded that local/global coupling must be avoided in the frequency range where accurate modal characteristics are required...|$|R

40|$|Erosion {{potential}} {{and the effects}} of tillage can be evaluated from quantitative descriptions of soil surface roughness. The present study therefore aimed to fill the need for a reliable, low-cost and convenient method to measure that parameter. Based on the interpretation of micro-topographic shadows, this new procedure is primarily designed for use in the field after tillage.

Performance tests on multi-plot sprinkler infiltrometer studies conducted on the Santa Rita Experimental Range in southeastern Arizona indicated that the meter was accurate and relatively precise in repeating soil surface roughness measurements but was not precise in defining the theoretical characteristics of constructed surfaces. It was concluded, however, that these errors in precision were insignificant and due partly to surface geometry construction errors and that the meter is a convenient, quick, simple and accurate means of measuring surface roughness in studies requiring many plots and data points...|$|R

50|$|Dandi Biyo {{is played}} by two or more players. The wooden pin is laid across a four-inch-deep hole in the ground. One player puts {{one end of the}} stick inside the hole and holds the other end. The player jerks the stick against the pin to launch the pin into the air while other players called 'fielders' try to catch the pin. If one of the fielders catch the pin in the air, the turn is over and the catcher takes the stick. If the pin instead hits the ground, that player plays to score. One of the fielders then throws the pin into the hole while the player tries to hit and throw the pin away. If the pin goes into the hole, the player's turn is over and the points {{accumulated}} by the player automatically becomes zero. If the pin doesn't go into the hole, the player plays to score by hitting the pin at one end by the stick. In another version of the game, a circular boundary of about one-meter diameter is drawn on the ground. The player throws the pin into the circle from a distance of about two <b>meters.</b> If the <b>pin</b> lies within the circle the player continues to play and score.|$|R

These are moves than can be performed in certain situations with certain superstars when a finisher is obtained. An example of this is Mark Henry superplexing the Big Show, making the ring break and the match stop. Better weight detection was implemented to WWE '13, so the smaller Rey Mysterio can't body slam the 500 pound Big Show. In fact, super heavyweights like [...] now have different frames to better capture their enormous size. Pinning is now not only influenced by damage, but the power of the move that was previously executed. In WWE '13 alongside selecting arenas, characters and the number of finishing moves available at the start of a match (a new option, which can range from 0 to Infinite), players will be able to adjust a setting called 'Match Experience'. Three settings – [...] "Quick", [...] "Normal" [...] and [...] "Epic" [...] – will affect the overall pacing of a fight, independent of AI difficulty. Factors such as momentum, damage, enemy aggressiveness and even kick out and reversal rates will be affected.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the indices}} {{currently}} employed for assessing soil surface micro-topography, such as random roughness (RR), are merely descriptors of its vertical component. Recently, multifractal analysis provided a new insight for describing the spatial configuration of soil surface roughness. The main {{objective of this}} study was to test the ability of multifractal parameters to assess decay of initial surface roughness induced by natural rainfall under different soil tillage systems in field conditions. In addition, we evaluated the potential of the joint use of multifractal indices plus RR to improve predictions of water storage in depressions of the soil surface (MDS). Field experiments were performed on an Oxisol at Campinas, São Paulo State (Brazil). Six tillage treatments, namely, disc harrow, disc plough, chisel plough, disc harrow + disc level, disc plough + disc level and chisel plough + disc level were tested. In each treatment soil surface micro-topography was measured four times, with increasing amounts of natural rainfall, using a <b>pin</b> <b>meter.</b> The sampling scheme was a square grid with 25 &times; 25 mm point spacing and the plot size was 1350 &times; 1350 mm (≈ 1. 8 m 2 ), so that each data set consisted of 3025 individual elevation points. Duplicated measurements were taken per treatment and date, yielding a total of 48 experimental data sets. MDS was estimated from grid elevation data with a depression-filling algorithm. Multifractal analysis was performed for experimental data sets as well as for oriented and random surface conditions obtained from the former by removing slope and slope plus tillage marks, respectively. All the investigated microplots exhibited multifractal behaviour, irrespective of surface condition, but the degree of multifractality showed wide differences between them. Multifractal parameters provided valuable information for characterizing the spatial features of soil micro-topography as they were able to discriminate data sets with similar values for the vertical component of roughness. Both, rough and smooth soil surfaces, with high and low roughness values, respectively, can display similar levels of spectral complexity. Although in most of the studied cases trend removal produces increasing homogeneity in the spatial configuration of height readings, spectral complexity of individual data sets may increase or decrease, when slope or slope plus tillage tool marks are filtered. Increased cumulative rainfall had significant effects on various parameters from the generalized dimension, Dq, and singularity spectrum, f(α). Overall, micro-topography decay by rainfall produced was reflected on a shift of the singularity spectra, f(α) from the left side (q&gt;&gt; 0) to the right side (q&lt;&lt; 0) and also on a shift of the generalized dimension spectra from the right side (q&gt;&gt; 0) to the left side (q&lt;&lt; 0). The use of an exponential model of vertical roughness indices, RR, and multifractal parameters accounting for the spatial configuration such as D 1 , D 5 , and D 10 improved estimation of water stored in surface depressions...|$|R
