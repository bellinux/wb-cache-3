They also did not show topography and were not marked with crucial positions. U.S. Navy ships providing naval gunfire and U.S. Marine, U.S. Air Force and Navy fighter/bomber support aircraft providing close air support mistakenly fired upon and killed U.S. ground forces due to differences in charts and location coordinates, data, and methods of calling for fire support. Communications between services were also noted as not being compatible and hindered the coordination of operations.

40|$|Non-intrusive load {{monitoring}} (NILM) {{has three}} distinct advantages over today's smart meters. First, it offers accountability. Few people know where their kWh's are going. Second, it is a maintenance tool. Signs of wear are detectable through their electrical signal. Third, it provides awareness {{of human activity}} within a network. Each device has an electrical fingerprint, and specific devices imply associated human actions. From voltage and current measurements at a single point on the network, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) disaggregates appliance-level information. This information is available remotely in bandwidth-constrained environments.

40|$|Introduction. Early {{repatriation}} of Canadian Forces personnel deployed to Europe, mainly to NATO, defines military members unable {{to complete their}} postings. This is a recent problem and its reoccurrence and prohibitive costs have a psychological and social impact at individual, family and institutional levels and therefore, have become a research priority. This thesis includes a group of doctorate studies whose innovative character undoubtedly helps understand this phenomenon and the factors contributing to its persistence or continuity. Goals. 1) Identify the determining factors (personal, interpersonal, environmental, institutional and social) involved with early repatriation; 2) Analyze {{over a period of}} three months the connection between quality of life, employability skills and problem management capabilities; secondly, identify the links between psychological quality of life and the factors that are mentioned, as well as the sense of belonging and socio-demographic characteristics; 3) Develop a program of preventive psychosocial actions for CF members serving in Europe (Programme d’actions préventives psychosociales destiné aux militaires des FC affectés en Europe (PAPFCE)); 4) Assess, with a group of participants, the quality and usefulness of the different components involved in the psychosocial intervention program and analyze over a three month period, the relationship between quality of life, employability skills and problem management capabilities for one group of participants and two groups not participating in the program. Method. In order to reach our goals, 343 CF members were invited to participate in various investigations. 1) Comments from soldiers that repatriated to Canada were analyzed. 2) A questionnaire based on previously established scales, was built to measure quality of life, employability skills, ability to manage problems and sense of belonging for newcomers of summer 2009. 3) Creation of the PAPFCE was designed and submitted to the newcomers of summer 2010. 4) A data comparison was carried out between the non participating military members and those who participated in the psychosocial intervention. Furthermore, using an evaluation <b>grid,</b> <b>military</b> members subjected to psychosocial intervention were questioned about the usefulness and quality of the different parts of the program. Results. A total of 74 military members participated in the project (participation rate 22 %). The participants were men (81. 1 %), average age of 41. 8 years [from 23 years to 56 years], using English at home (59. 5 %) and reported living as married (81. 1 %). Their job profile is as follows: 20. 7 years of service in the CF [from 5 years to 38 years], non commissioned officers (52. 7 %) and Germany as place of employment (54. 1 %). The main contributing factors to early repatriation are: 1) deficiencies in the military selection process and its application, 2) occurrence or development of psychosocial problems, 3) application of disciplinary or administrative actions (such as revealing psychosocial imbalance), 4) expectations that were unfulfilled by the posting. After {{the first three months of}} deployment, quality of life, employability skills and capability to manage problems have not changed. The military member’s psychological quality of life is positively associated with "physical" and "social" aspects, the extent of "acquisition of social support" and the "restructuring" of the capability to manage problems. A data comparison between military personnel who participated in the PAPFCE and the non participants neither confirms its effectiveness nor significant contribution. However, for most participants, the quality of components and their satisfaction with the program were positively assessed, although the program did not seem to be able to prevent the occurrence of psychosocial problems, major factors for premature repatriation. Conclusion. The analysis of the determining factors involved in the success or failure of a military posting to Europe has led to a better understanding of the complexity of the cultural and professional adjustment process necessary by the members and their families. This work provides site specific realities to reflect upon and possible intervention methods that can be adopted to improve the posting or deployment support and encourages a more critical observation of challenges and issues that may have an impact on the future of the CF...|$|R
50|$|USNG {{allows a}} common {{system based on}} the US <b>Military</b> <b>Grid</b> system using {{landmarks}} like hills or streams, anything permanent. It allows these maps to be printed anywhere by responders totally unfamiliar with the local area.

50|$|The {{term has}} a {{particular}} use {{in connection with the}} British Ordnance Survey National Grid and the US <b>Military</b> <b>Grid</b> Reference System, where the grids are divided into 100 km &times; 100 km squares, each with a two letter prefix. For example, in an OS grid reference the prefix TL refers to the myriad 500 km east and 200 km north of the grid origin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{combination}} of a zone and a latitude band defines a grid zone. The zone is always written first, followed by the latitude band. For example (see image, top right), a position in Toronto, Canada, would find itself in zone 17 and latitude band [...] "T", thus the full grid zone reference is [...] "17T". The grid zones serve to delineate irregular UTM zone boundaries. They also {{are an integral part}} of the <b>military</b> <b>grid</b> reference system.|$|E
50|$|The Cassini Grid {{system was}} {{introduced}} in 1927 for maps of the United Kingdom for the British military. It is so called {{from the use of}} Cassini map projection.

It may also be referred to as <b>Military</b> <b>Grid,</b> War Office Grid, or Purple Grid (due to the grid colour on some issues of maps). It continued in use until some time after World War II.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} systems exist that can provide grid references for locations within the British Isles: {{this article describes the}} system created solely for Great Britain and its outlying islands (including the Isle of Man); the Irish grid reference system is a similar system created by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland for the island of Ireland. The Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system (UTM) is used to provide grid references for worldwide locations and this is the system commonly used for the Channel Islands. European-wide agencies also use UTM when mapping locations, or may use the <b>Military</b> <b>Grid</b> Reference System (MGRS) system, or variants thereof.|$|E
50|$|To {{establish}} {{the position of}} a geographic location on a map, a map projection is used to convert geodetic coordinates to two-dimensional coordinates on a map; it projects the datum ellipsoidal coordinates and height onto a flat surface of a map. The datum, along with a map projection applied to a grid of reference locations, establishes a grid system for plotting locations. Common map projections in current use include the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), the <b>Military</b> <b>Grid</b> Reference System (MGRS), the United States National Grid (USNG), the Global Area Reference System (GARS) and the World Geographic Reference System (GEOREF).Coordinates on a map are usually in terms northing N and easting E offsets relative to a specified origin.|$|E
