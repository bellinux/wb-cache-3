Lenin asked Höglund if the Swedish Socialist Youth Organization {{possibly}} could donate some much needed money to the Bolsheviks. Höglund offered Lenin some money, and {{although it was a}} small amount, Lenin was extremely joyful and grateful. Höglund realized afterwards that <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> was more about political trust than money.|$|E

2500|$|Interpretations of the film's {{themes and}} {{messages}} {{have been widely}} discussed among critics and general commentators. In his review for The Washington Times, Peter Suderman expressed that [...] "aybe it's a liberal story about inequality and the class divide. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it's</b> a libertarian epic about the evils of authoritarian government. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it's</b> a feminist revision on the sci-fi action blockbuster. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it's</b> a bloody satire of reality television", but concludes the film only proposes these theories and brings none of them to a reasonable conclusion.|$|R

25|$|Part of {{the survey}} {{required}} a short answer portion where participants could write a sentence or so to explain some answers given.

500|$|The film also {{influenced}} American film productions: John Carpenter {{has suggested that}} the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween. Carpenter recalls that the film crew [...] "didn't have any money to make a mask. It was originally written the way you see it, in other words, it's a pale mask with human features, almost featureless.

[...] Latta also felt that despite being familiar with the setting, Gaiman never utilized the period to its full potential.

500|$|The hit single [...] "Basket Case", which {{appeared}} on many singles charts worldwide, was also inspired by Armstrong's personal experiences. The song deals with Armstrong's anxiety attacks {{and feelings of}} [...] "going crazy" [...] prior to being diagnosed with a panic disorder. [...] In the third verse, [...] "Basket Case" [...] references soliciting a male prostitute; Armstrong noted that [...] "I wanted to challenge myself and whoever the listener might be.
