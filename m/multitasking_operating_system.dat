2500|$|The context {{register}} {{was important}} in a <b>multitasking</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> because it allowed the CPU to switch between processes without reloading all the translation state information. [...] The 4-bit context register could switch between 16 sections of the segment map under supervisor control, which allowed 16 contexts to be mapped concurrently. [...] Each context had its own virtual address space. [...] Sharing of virtual address space and inter-context communications {{could be provided by}} writing the same values in to the segment or page maps of different contexts. [...] Additional contexts could be handled by treating the segment map as a context cache and replacing out-of-date contexts on a least-recently used basis.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} to polling {{is the use}} of interrupts, which are signals generated by devices or processes to indicate that they need attention, want to communicate, etc. Although polling can be very simple, in many situations (e.g., <b>multitasking</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems)</b> it is more efficient to use interrupts because it can reduce processor usage and/or bandwidth consumption.|$|R
