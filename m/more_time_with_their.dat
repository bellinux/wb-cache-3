25|$|Though the {{simultaneous}} bilingual child learns two languages at once, {{this does not}} mean that he or she speaks them with identical competence. It is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other, and this is probably related to each child's relative exposure to each language; for example, many bilingual children are more proficient in the mother's than the father's language, arguably because their mothers assume most of the childcare responsibilities and/or simply spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> children. The dominant language is almost always the language spoken by the greatest number of the people the child interacts with (generally the language the child is educated in). The child sees this language as most effective and begins to favor it. However, their dominant language need not be their L1. In addition, it is possible to show language dominance in one language for one domain and dominance in the other language for another domain. For example, a child may be dominant in his or her L1 at home, but in the school context, his or her L2 becomes the dominant language being used.|$|E

500|$|Feeling {{that the}} band's {{previous}} two projects (The Alchemy Index and Vheissu) had a [...] "sleepy feeling" [...] to them, Thrice {{wanted to make}} a record that was [...] "a little more upbeat and energetic." [...] Thrice's members also hoped to save money and spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> families by building a recording studio in guitarist Teppei Teranishi's home. Originally, the band expressed interest in tracking the record live (i.e. recording the full band all at once, instead of each instrument individually and mixing together at a later time) in the home studio; however Thrice later abandoned the idea of recording this way. Instead, the band recorded songs with [...] "similar vibe musically, and tonally" [...] in the same session. Several wooden devices were constructed by the band for the home studio to make the recordings [...] "sound better." [...] The self-produced album was released through Vagrant Records.|$|E
500|$|On December 4, 1998, The University of South Carolina {{announced}} that Lou Holtz {{would serve as}} its next head football coach. Lou asked Skip if he would move down to Columbia to become his offensive coordinator—the same position Skip held during his final two years at Notre Dame. Skip accepted the offer, {{in part due to}} a desire to live closer to his parents and so his children could spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> grandparents. In 1996, Skip's mother, Beth, was diagnosed with throat cancer. Two years later, the cancer spread to her liver, lung, adrenal glands, and ovary. Meanwhile, Skip and Lou continued to coach football at South Carolina. As Lou began to struggle as head coach, the question of his eventual successor arose. When Skip was hired in 1998, Lou had included a clause in the hiring contract that Skip would succeed him after he retired. South Carolina Athletic Director Dave Tanner rebutted by saying, [...] "There are no formal or informal guarantees at him," [...] and [...] "It's always helpful to have potential succession in a staff." ...|$|E

40|$|Our {{recent study}} has told that mating {{preference}} of women change across the menstrual cycle. During peak fertility of women {{they become more}} sexually desired and also {{they want to go}} to some social events to look for their partners. At this <b>time</b> they choose <b>more</b> revealing dress to go to the social events to attract different kinds of men. Our results also suggest that during peak fertility the women try to spend <b>more</b> <b>times</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> friends or to talk {{for a long time in}} phone. They also like to go to shopping at this time to look for new cosmetic products. Due to increased intrasexual competition at this time the women try to be more attractive than their low fertility times. They also try to avoid the male kin and this type of psychological status fluctuates according to the fertility status. These data also suggest that at peak fertility the women try to avoid the genetic relatives for the betterment of their offspring...|$|R

40|$|Concerns {{over the}} {{perceived}} negative impacts of computers on social development among children are prevalent but largely uninformed by plausibly causal evidence. We provide {{the first test}} of this hypothesis using a large-scale randomized control experiment {{in which more than}} one thousand children attending grades 6 - 10 across 15 different schools and 5 school districts in California were randomly given computers to use at home. Children in the treatment group are more likely to report having a social networking site, but also report spending <b>more</b> <b>time</b> communicating <b>with</b> <b>their</b> friends and interacting <b>with</b> <b>their</b> friends in person.

40|$|Continuing {{advances}} in hardware technology have enabled {{the proliferation of}} faster, cheaper, and more capable personal computers. Users of all backgrounds rely on their computers to handle ever-expanding information, communication, and computation needs. As users spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> interacting <b>with</b> <b>their</b> computers, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to archive and later search the knowledge, ideas and information that they have viewed through their computers.

40|$|Male Indian Flying Foxes (Pteropus giganteus) that spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> {{performing}} {{oral sex}} on a female also spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating <b>with</b> her. In humans, men who spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating <b>with</b> <b>their</b> regular partner also perform more “semen-displacing” copulatory behaviors (e. g., deeper, more vigorous penile thrusting). We investigated whether men who spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> performing oral sex on their regular partner also spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating <b>with</b> her and perform more semen-displacing copulatory behaviors. We proposed and tested the ejaculate adjustment hypothesis for men's copulatory behaviors: Men adjust their copulatory behaviors {{to increase their}} sexual arousal and consequent ejaculate quality, thereby increasing their chances of success in sperm competition. Two hundred and thirty-three men in a committed, heterosexual relationship responded to questions about their copulatory behavior and sexual arousal during their most recent sexual encounter <b>with</b> <b>their</b> long-term partner. The results indicated that men who spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> performing oral sex on their partner also spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating <b>with</b> her, perform more semen-displacing copulatory behaviors, and report greater sexual arousal.

50|$|The flipped {{classroom}} {{is a concept}} in education (see Flip teaching). Clintondale High School, in Clinton Township, Mich., {{is the first to}} fully embrace this concept in 2011 in an effort to raise the school's failing grades. TechSmith products were used as their primary software, and the company also gave the school a grant to start the program. Teachers record lessons online for the students to watch at home and then the students come to class to do their homework. The videos normally consist of an overview of the lesson, the content and concludes with a summary. Voice, video clips, images and annotations can be included via TechSmith products like Camtasia to enhance the lesson. Camtasia and Relay give teachers the ability to share their content on a variety of platforms. Students can view the lessons on any computer or mobile device. This gives the students <b>more</b> class <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> teachers to work through problems rather than trying to work them out alone at home.|$|R
50|$|The medical {{education}} at FMC is a five-year curriculum {{leading to the}} MBBS degree, {{the equivalent of the}} basic M.D degree in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. The curriculum covers basic and clinical medical sciences. Students learn in a small-class environment opposed to a large-class environment so that ideally they will have <b>more</b> interaction <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> professors. In conjunction with the curriculum, students are encouraged to engage in research to refine their skills as well as to gain the most from their education. Guest speakers such as medical personalities, scientists, literary persons and military officers are invited on a weekly basis to give lectures to expose students to fields of work in the medical profession. Medical camps are held regularly so that students may travel to rural areas within a 50-kilometer radius to gather information and offer guidance to the community. These medical camps provide an extensive amount of social-interaction which prepare students for clinical training.|$|R
