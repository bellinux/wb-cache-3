As {{an average of two}} years, although statistically non-significant, the highest seed yield of 3065 kg/ha from north east-south west (NESW) and the lowest yield of 2624 kg/ha were obtained from east-west (EW) row directions. The most pronounced effect of row directions was noted on the seed <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> As an average of two years, the <b>maximum</b> seed <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> (21. 4 %) at harvest was obtained from east-west (EW) and the minimum (14. 6 %) from north-south (NS) row directions. NESW row direction also gave significantly lower <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> (15. 1 %) than EW (21. 4 %) and NWSE (18. 1 %) row directions. Therefore, using north-south and NESW row directions would help to dry standing crop more quickly before harvest and reduce post harvest costs and losses. Seed production fields that require examination of sunflower heads to detect pollen production should be planted in NS rows for efficient rouging to keep genetic purity. For research plots, EW rows with plot labels on the east end often are preferred, because it is easier to evaluate most plots when all heads face the viewer...|$|R
