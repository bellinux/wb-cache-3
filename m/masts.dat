5|$|On 9 May 2010, a {{ceremony}} was held aboard Belfast {{to mark the}} 65th anniversary of end of the Second World War in Europe. Veterans of the Arctic convoys were in attendance to receive medals from the Russian Ambassador Yuri Fedotov. During the ceremony it was announced that, {{as part of the}} restoration of the ship, two new <b>masts</b> had been manufactured at the Severnaya Verf shipyard near Saint Petersburg. The production of the <b>masts,</b> to replace corroded originals, had been supported by a number of Russian businesses at a reported cost of £500,000. The restoration of the <b>masts</b> involved removing the fittings from both <b>masts,</b> allowing them to be individually restored. The old <b>masts</b> were then cut down in sections, the new <b>masts</b> erected, and the original fittings replaced. On 19 October 2010, the new <b>masts</b> were dedicated at {{a ceremony}} attended by HMS Belfast veterans, by Prince Philip and officials from the Russian embassy and government.|$|E

5|$|Little to {{no major}} {{modifications}} {{were made to}} the two active Colorados in the opening months of the U.S.'s entry into the war; all of the battleships in the Pacific Fleet had a constant order to be ready to sail within 48 hours in case of a Japanese attempt to invade Hawaii or the West Coast and could not be spared for any major yard work. Colorado was hurried through the rest of her refit with the addition of essential items like radar, splinter protection, 14 Oerlikon 20mm and four 1.1in light anti-aircraft guns; Maryland received a similar treatment later, the only difference being 16 20mm's and no 1.1in. Although tower <b>masts</b> were constructed for Colorado and Maryland and a majority of the old cage <b>masts</b> were cut down by the ships' crews in the beginning of 1942, the ships could not be spared the time needed to install the new <b>masts.</b> The tower <b>masts</b> were placed into storage and not used until early 1944.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower <b>masts</b> in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the <b>masts.</b> The three <b>masts</b> and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985.

40|$|Background: The D-mannose binding lectin ArtinM {{is known}} to recruit neutrophils, to {{degranulate}} <b>mast</b> cells and may have potential therapeutic applications. However, the effect of ArtinM on <b>mast</b> cell recruitment has not been investigated. Methodology: Male Wistar rats were injected i. p. with ArtinM or ConA (control). The ability of the lectin to degranulate peritoneal and mesenteric <b>mast</b> cells was examined. Recruitment of <b>mast</b> cells to the peritoneal cavity and mesentery after ArtinM injection was examined with or without depletion of peritoneal <b>mast</b> cells by distilled water. Results: ArtinM degranulated both peritoneal and mesentery <b>mast</b> cells in vitro. Three days after i. p. injection of the lectin there were reduced numbers of <b>mast</b> cells in the peritoneal lavage, while at 7 days post injection of ArtinM, the number of peritoneal <b>mast</b> cells was close to control values. Since immature <b>mast</b> cells are recruited from the bone marrow, {{the effect of the}} lectin on bone marrow <b>mast</b> cells was examined. Injection of ArtinM resulted in an increased number of <b>mast</b> cells in the bone marrow. To determine if degranulation of <b>mast</b> cells in the peritoneal cavity was required for the increase in bone marrow <b>mast</b> cells, the peritoneal cavity was depleted of <b>mast</b> cells with ultrapure water.

40|$|SummaryImmunological {{functions}} of <b>mast</b> cells remain poorly understood. Studies in Kit mutant mice suggest key roles for <b>mast</b> cells in certain antibody- and T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. However, Kit mutations affect multiple cell types of both immune and nonimmune origin. Here, {{we show that}} targeted insertion of Cre-recombinase into the <b>mast</b> cell carboxypeptidase A 3 locus deleted <b>mast</b> cells in connective and mucosal tissues by a genotoxic Trp 53 -dependent mechanism. Cre-mediated <b>mast</b> cell eradication (Cre-Master) mice had, {{with the exception of}} a lack of <b>mast</b> cells and reduced basophils, a normal immune system. Cre-Master mice were refractory to IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, and this defect was rescued by <b>mast</b> cell reconstitution. This <b>mast</b> cell-deficient strain was fully susceptible to antibody-induced autoimmune arthritis and to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

40|$|<b>Mast</b> {{cells are}} immune {{cells that are}} found in the brain. Behavioral and {{endocrine}} states increase the number and activation of brain <b>mast</b> cells, independent of the animal's immune status. Activation causes the release of many neuro-active mediators into the brain parenchyma. However, the function or impact of <b>mast</b> cells in the brain has not been studied. The recruitment of <b>mast</b> cells to the brain, and their subsequent activation following a stressor suggests that they may have a role in regulating the stress response through interactions with neural systems. The goal of this thesis is to examine the functional role of brain <b>mast</b> cells using a mouse model. <b>Mast</b> cells are present in the mouse brain parenchyma, meninges and choroid plexus from birth throughout adulthood. A <b>mast</b> cell deficient (KitW-sh /W-sh) mouse is a strong model to study the effects of <b>mast</b> cells on brain physiology and behavior. The homozygote mutant lacks all brain <b>mast</b> cells resulting in reductions of <b>mast</b> cell-derived mediators. Interestingly, <b>mast</b> cell deficient mice have increased levels of anxiety-like behavior and stress-induced defecation compared to heterozygote (<b>mast</b> cell competent) littermate controls. Since <b>mast</b> cells are activated by stressors via corticotrophin releasing factor, it is surprising that no differences in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity are seen between <b>mast</b> cell deficient mice and littermate controls. Instead, the effects of <b>mast</b> cells on anxiety behavior and physiology may be mediated through <b>mast</b> cell contribution of serotonin to the hippocampus, a brain region where many <b>mast</b> cells reside. In vitro, application of a <b>mast</b> cell activator to hippocampal slices causes a rise in serotonin levels in the hippocampus of control, but not <b>mast</b> cell deficient mice. Given the known effects of hippocampal serotonin as a trophic factor and transmitter, hippocampal function is likely affected by the absence of <b>mast</b> cells. There are deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis, but not subventricular zone neurogenesis (a brain region with no <b>mast</b> cells), in <b>mast</b> cell deficient mice. This deficit can be reversed by increasing serotonin signaling with SSRI treatment or by enriched housing conditions. <b>Mast</b> cell deficient mice also have deficits in hippocampal dependent spatial learning and memory which can be reversed by enriched housing. Overall these results show that <b>mast</b> cells affect neural systems and behavior {{in the absence of an}} immune stimulus. These studies link an immune cell to the brain and behavior, and suggest a beneficial role for the recruitment of <b>mast</b> cells and subsequent neuroimmune interactions...|$|R

40|$|The {{roles of}} <b>mast</b> cells {{in health and}} disease remain incompletely understood. While the {{evidence}} that <b>mast</b> cells are critical effector cells in IgE-dependent anaphylaxis and other acute IgE-mediated allergic reactions seems unassailable, studies employing various mice deficient in <b>mast</b> cells or <b>mast</b> cell-associated proteases have yielded divergent conclusions about the roles of <b>mast</b> cells or their proteases in certain other immunological responses. Such "controversial" results {{call into question the}} relative utility of various older versus newer approaches to ascertain the roles of <b>mast</b> cells and <b>mast</b> cell proteases in vivo.

We particularly focus on settings in which divergent conclusions about the importance of <b>mast</b> cells and their proteases have been supported by studies that employed different models of <b>mast</b> cell or <b>mast</b> cell protease deficiency.
