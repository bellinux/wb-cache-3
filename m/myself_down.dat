500|$|By early 1975, Nixon's {{health was}} improving. He {{maintained}} {{an office in}} a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home, at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs. He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; {{the fact that his}} assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly. He was handicapped in this work {{by the end of his}} transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with many of his staff, including Ziegler. In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producer David Frost, who paid him $600,000 (...) for a series of sit-down interviews, filmed and aired in 1977. They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate. Nixon admitted that he had [...] "let down the country" [...] and that [...] "I brought <b>myself</b> <b>down.</b> I gave them a sword and they stuck it in. And they twisted it with relish. And, I guess, if I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing." [...] The interviews garnered 45–50million viewers—becoming the most-watched program of their kind in television history.|$|E

500|$|By coincidence, Olympic team {{training}} {{took place}} in Tarwater's hometown of Knoxville. At the Olympics, Tarwater swam the third leg of the preliminary round of the men's 4×200-meter relay. His time of 1:46.33 was a personal best, and the second-fastest leg for Team USA, which turned in the fastest preliminary swim, and third-fastest among all 64 swimmers. He attributed his performance to concentrating exclusively on the freestyle during the two months between Trials and the Games. Of his Olympic experience, Tarwater said, [...] "Even at 28, {{with a lot of}} international experience, nothing matches the Olympics. [...] My heart was pumping so intensely that I was just trying to calm <b>myself</b> <b>down.</b> [...] Standing on the blocks, waiting to take the exchange, I was just saying, 'Breathe. [...] Breathe. [...] Breathe.'... It's such a rush." [...] Typically, the relay team for the finals is composed of the top two qualifiers plus the two fastest swimmers in the preliminaries. In 2012, however, the U.S. team had its top three swimmers in reserve, as Phelps would swim the relay final despite dropping the individual 200-meter freestyle from his program. [...] After Tarwater's fast preliminary swim, the U.S. coaches strongly considered replacing number three Olympic Trials qualifier Ricky Berens with Tarwater in the finals, before electing to go with Berens due to Berens' greater experience. In the finals, the U.S. relay team beat the second-place French team by three seconds, winning Tarwater a gold medal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} to the 2006 Labour Party Conference in Manchester, Prescott apologised for the bad press he had caused the party during the {{previous}} year. He said: [...] "I know in the last year I let <b>myself</b> <b>down,</b> I let you down. So Conference, I just want to say sorry", and confirmed that he would stand down as deputy leader when Blair resigned the premiership. Prescott subsequently announced in the House of Commons that he was [...] "... in a rather happy demob stage", in January 2007.|$|E

Reflecting on the mistake in Sweden that turned the championship around, Rainey says: “It’s really hard {{to tell you what}} I feel like. I just feel like I’ve been beat up by everybody in the world, and I just feel so down and disappointed in myself. I just felt I really let <b>myself</b> <b>down</b> and my team.

2500|$|Until the 1990s, Steeleye often toured as part {{of double}} bill, {{supporting}} Status Quo, or featuring support from artists such as Rock Salt & Nails and The Rankin Family. When Steeleye Span supported Status Quo on tour in 1996, the latter had just issued their version of [...] "All Around My Hat" [...] as a single. [...] "The video was filmed at Christmas," [...] Prior recalled. [...] "We'd supported them, and I found <b>myself</b> <b>down</b> in the mosh pit. Francis saw me and told the audience, 'Oh look, there's a Maddy lookalike down there… Fuck me, it is Maddy!' I was hoyed over the barrier , to join them for the encore. It was all very jolly." [...] Status Quo's single is credited to [...] "Status Quo with Maddy Prior from Steeleye Span" [...] and reached number 47 in the charts.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{build-up}} to No Way Out, McMahon had re-signed the New World Order (nWo), {{who started}} a feud {{with him after}} (kayfabe) Austin refused a beer gift following them costing him his match against Jericho. Problems in the backstage creativity were however then seemingly beginning to surface. Austin was reported as being unhappy regarding Hulk Hogan's return to the WWF, and was reported as refusing to lose to Hogan in a proposed match at WrestleMania X8, while Hogan reportedly told McMahon the same regarding losing to Austin. In recent years, Austin has {{this to say about}} why the match never took place: [...] "I guarantee you, if my head had been at a little different place, then by all rights, a [...] should have happened", Austin told JR. [...] "Physically and mentally where I was at, I could go. I think Hogan probably would have been a step or two behind that. That wasn't acceptable to me, and I didn't want to slow <b>myself</b> <b>down.</b> I say that {{with all due respect to}} Hulk Hogan, because he had a hellacious run. That was my thought process back in the day. I didn't think we could deliver". Consequently, the match was re-billed as The Rock defeating Hogan, whilst Austin defeated Scott Hall, climaxing his feud with the nWo.|$|E
2500|$|... 2Pacalypse Now {{generated}} significant controversy {{for numerous}} reasons. The songs [...] "Trapped" [...] and [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby" [...] were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney {{claimed he was}} influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, [...] "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It {{has no place in}} our society." [...] Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, [...] "I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang," [...] Shakur said. [...] "I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie <b>myself</b> <b>down</b> to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. I just figured since I lived that life I could do that, I could rap about that." [...] The record was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, 2Pacalypse Now was listed as one of Shakur's [...] "certified classic" [...] albums, along with Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me and [...] 2Pacalypse Now went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. It featured three singles: [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby", [...] "Trapped", and [...] "If My Homie Calls".|$|E
