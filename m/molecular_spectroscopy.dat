40|$|Noy's Handbook of <b>Molecular</b> Force <b>Spectroscopy</b> is both {{a timely}} and useful summary of {{fundamental}} aspects of <b>molecular</b> force <b>spectroscopy,</b> and I believe {{it would make a}} worthwhile addition to any good scientific library. New research groups that are entering this field would be well advisedto study this handbook in detail before venturing into the exciting and challenging world of <b>molecular</b> force <b>spectroscopy.</b> " Matthew F. Paige, University of Saskatchewan, Journal of the American Chemical Society Modern materials science and biophysics are increasingly focused on studying and controlling intermolecular interactions on the single-molecule level. <b>Molecular</b> force <b>spectroscopy</b> was developed in the past decade as the result of several unprecedented advances in the capabilities of modern scientific instrumentation, and defines a number of techniques that use mechanical force measurements to study interactions between single molecules and molecular assemblies in chemical and biological systems. Examples of these techniques, which typically target a specific range of experimental systems and geometries, include atomic force microscopy, optical tweezers, surface forces apparatus, and magnetic tweezers. With contributions by internationally renowned scientists, Handbook of <b>Molecular</b> Force <b>Spectroscopy</b> is a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of modern force spectroscopy, including fundamentals of intermolecular forces, technical aspects of the force measurements, and practical applications. The Handbook presents reviews of fundamental physical concepts of loading single and multiple chemical bonds on the nanometer scale, covers practical aspects of modern single-molecule level techniques, and describes several representative applications of force spectroscopy to the study of chemical and biological processes. Computer modeling of force spectroscopy experiments is addressed as well. In sum, this volume is an authoritative guide to planning, understanding, and analyzing modern <b>molecular</b> force <b>spectroscopy</b> experiments with an emphasis on biophysical research...|$|R

25|$|Observations of {{the energy}} levels of atoms and {{molecules}} were inconsistent with the nuclear spin expected from proton–electron hypothesis. <b>Molecular</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> of dinitrogen (14N2) showed that transitions originating from even-numbered rotational levels are more intense than those from odd levels, hence the even levels are more populated. According to quantum mechanics and the Pauli exclusion principle, the spin of the 14N nucleus is therefore an integer multiple of ħ (the reduced Planck constant). Yet both protons and electrons carry an intrinsic spin of ½ħ, {{and there is no}} way to arrange an odd number (14 protons + 7 electrons = 21) of spins ±½ħ to give a spin that is an integer multiple of ħ.|$|E

25|$|The high {{symmetry}} of the double-cone topology of the linear E ⊗ e JT system directly reflects the high underlying symmetry. It {{is one of}} the earliest (if not the earliest) examples in the literature of a conical intersection of potential energy surfaces. Conical intersections have received wide attention in the literature starting in the 1990s and are now considered paradigms of nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics, with far-reaching consequences in <b>molecular</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> photochemistry and photophysics. Some of these will be commented upon further below. In general, conical intersections are far less symmetric than depicted in the figure. They can be tilted and elliptical in shape etc., and also peaked and sloped intersections have been distinguished in the literature. Furthermore, for more than two degrees of freedom, they are not point-like structures but instead they are seams and complicated, curved hypersurfaces, also known as intersection space. The coordinate sub-space displayed in the figure is also known as a branching plane.|$|E

[...] During his time at Sheffield he also was the art editor of [...] "Arrows" [...] – the University student magazine, played tennis for the University team (reaching the UAU finals twice) and was President of the Student Athletics Council (1963–64). Among other things such as making the first phosphaalkenes (compounds with carbon phosphorus double bonds), his doctoral studies included unpublished research on carbon suboxide, O=C=C=C=O, and this led to a general interest in molecules containing chains of carbon atoms with numerous multiple bonds. He started his work with an interest in organic chemistry, but when he learned about spectroscopy it inclined him towards quantum chemistry; he later developed an interest in astrochemistry.|$|E
