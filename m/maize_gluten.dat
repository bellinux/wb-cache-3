40|$|A {{procedure}} for the ileostomisation of adult roosters {{has been described}} {{with the use of}} flexible silicon cannulas. Apparent ileal digestibility coefficients for dry matter (aDC DM), crude protein (aDC CP) and amino acids (aDC AA) in six diets, formulated with <b>maize,</b> wheat <b>gluten,</b> faba beans, lupins, soybean meal and casein as the main protein sources were determined in the ileostomised roosters fitted with silicon cannulas. In addition, aDC data determined using roosters (present study) were correlated with previously published aDC data of the same diets determined with pigs [van Leeuwen et al. (1996 a). Apparent dry matter and crude protein digestibility of rations fed to pigs and determined with the use of chromic oxide (Cr 203) and linsoluble ash as digestive markers. Br. J. Nutr. 76, 551 - 562; van Leeuwen et al. (1996 b). Validation of a mathematical model to explain variation in apparent ileal amino acid digestibility of diets fed to pigs. J. Anim.

Between aDC in roosters and pigs linear relations were found. The linear models explained 85 % of the variation in ileal aDC CP between the six diets determined in roosters and pigs. For ileal aDC AA, the explained part of the variation between roosters and pigs, ranged from 62 to 96 %, depending on the particular amino acids, with the exception of aDC of Arg.

40|$|Ruminant {{husbandry}} {{constitutes the}} most important source of anthropogenic methane (CH 4). In addition to enteric (animal-derived) CH 4, excreta are another source of CH 4, especially when stored anaerobically. Increasing the proportion of dietary concentrate is often considered as the primary CH 4 mitigation option. However, {{it is unclear whether}} this is still valid when diets to be compared are energy-balanced. In addition, non-structural carbohydrates and side effects on nitrogen (N) emissions may be important. In this experiment, diet types representing either forage-only or mixed diets were examined for their effects on CH 4 and N emissions from animals and their slurries in 18 lactating cows. Apart from a hay-only diet, treatments included two mixed diets consisting of maize stover, pelleted whole <b>maize</b> plants and <b>gluten</b> or barley straw and grain and soy bean meal. The diets were balanced in crude protein and net energy for lactation. After adaptation, data and samples were collected for 8 days including a 2 -day CH 4 measurement in respiratory chambers. Faeces and urine, combined proportionately according to excretion, were used to determine slurry-derived CH 4 and N emissions. Slurry was stored for 15 weeks at either 14 °C or 27 °C, and temperatures were classified as ‘cool' and ‘warm', respectively. The low-starch hay-only diet had high organic matter and fibre digestibility and proved to be equally effective on the cows' performance as mixed diets. The enteric CH 4 formation remained unaffected by the diet except when related to digested fibre. In this case emission was lowest with the hay-only diet (61 v. 88 to 101 g CH 4 /kg digested NDF). Feeding the hay diet resulted in the highest slurry-CH 4 production after 7 weeks of storage at 14 °C and 27 °C, and after 15 weeks at 14 °C. CH 4 emissions were, in general, about 10 -fold higher at 27 °C compared with 14 °C but only after 15 weeks of storage. Urinary N losses were highest with the barley diet and lowest with the maize diet. There was a trend towards similar differences in N losses from the slurry of these cows (significant at 14 °C). However, contrary to CH 4, slurry-N emissions seemed to be temperature-independent. In conclusion, energetically balanced diets proved to be widely equivalent in their emission potential when combining animal and their slurry, this even at a clearly differing forage : concentrate ratio. The variation in CH 4 emission from slurry stored shortly or at cold temperature for 15 weeks was of low importance as such conditions did not support methanogenesis in slurry anywa...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} the nutritional aspects of dietary protein for the New Zealand black-footed abalone (Haliotis iris) as an aquaculture species, and thus provide an affordable option for formulated feeds {{to be used in}} this abalone industry. Young (4 hours) and mature (7 days) and nine of twenty strains were mixed to each other microalgal biofilms were tested for their effectiveness on H. iris larval early developmental processes (attachment, metamorphosis, settlement and survival). Amino acid profiles and percent biofilm cover of microalgae also were monitored. Significantly better effects on attachment, metamorphosis, settlement and survival were found when abalone were exposed to mature microalgal biofilms compared to young biofilms, but few significant differences were found among biofilms composed of different microalgal species. Attachment and metamorphosis {{did not appear to be}} affected by differences in essential or non-essential amino acid profiles in the diets, but positive correlations were found between developmental processes and total amino acid content and percent biofilm cover. Similar results were also found in dual strains experiment. Nine commercially available protein sources (white fish, red fish, blood, meat and bone, casein, soybean, <b>gluten,</b> <b>maize</b> protein, Spirulina) were used as sole protein sources in formulated diets, which was fed to juvenile H. iris at 18 °C for five months. Juvenile abalone fed with diets containing white fish, red fish, casein, soybean and Spirulina had significantly better growth than those of fed other protein sources, thus indicating that these diets could be suitable as sole protein sources for H. iris formulated feeds. Abalone juveniles fed soybean diets (with extremely low methionine content) had similar growth results as those fed fish meal diets, and did not show a decrease in certain amino acid content (such as methionine) in their soft body tissues. However, dietary amino acid profiles did affect the amino acid profiles of both soft bodies and shells, which may have caused changes in shell bio-mineralization. Red fish protein had the best performance and it was therefore used to determine protein requirements under two different temperature regimes (13 - 21 °C and 8 - 16 °C) that simulated the temperature regimes of the South and North Islands in New Zealand. Six different dietary protein levels (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 45 %) made from red fish meal were fed to juvenile abalone for four months. Growth performance increased steadily with increasing dietary protein. A second-order polynomial curve fit showed differences in protein requirements between the two temperature regimes, which were 42 - 53 % in low temperatures and 38 - 39 % in high temperature regimes. Shell morphology of previous two dietary experiments shown that: dietary protein sources and levels strongly affected H. iris shell morphology. Significantly wider, higher and heavier shells were found in animals fed casein diets. Both fish meal diets resulted in abalone with flatter and heavier shells. High dietary protein levels also promoted the enhancement of shell width and shell weight, and high temperature environments produced heavier and thicker shells. In conclusion, dietary protein is an important factor for H. iris aquaculture. The content of dietary protein strongly affects settlement of larvae and growth of juveniles in H. iris. Dietary amino acid profiles can change amino acid profiles in both soft bodies and shells, which may cause changes in shell morphology. A dietary protein content above 40 %, as can be provided with red fish meal in formulated diets, is recommended to improve H. iris production. Raising dietary protein contents can effectively recover the decreased growth that results from a low cultivation water temperature regime...|$|R

Voluntary forage DM intake remained unaffected in experiment 1 and was higher (P< 0 · 01) in experiment 2 for WS than for GS and GS+(128 v. 98 and 106 g/kg M 0 · 75). Within experiments, no treatment effects occurred for apparent nutrient digestibilities, milk yield, and composition. Protein utilization (milk-N/N-intake) was numerically lower on all clover-based diets (0 · 24 to 0 · 25) versus GS (0 · 29).

40|$|The cost of feed {{is about}} 70 - 80 {{percent of the}} total cost of broiler production. It is also a route for {{administration}} of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs), which effect productivity. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) {{is one of the key}} measures of cost of production. 1 It indicates the amount of feed consumed by a broiler chicken to gain one kg of weight. For example, an FCR of 1. 8 means that for every 1 kg of broiler weight, 1. 8 kg of feed was consumed. Poultry farmers across the world aim to reduce FCR to decrease the cost of production. AGPs in feed are known to increase feed utilisation thereby reducing the FCR. FEED CONSTITUENTS The poultry feed contains feed ingredients and feed additives.

40|$|Herbage intake (HI) was {{estimated}} with two procedures: (a) with the n-alkanes method (HIal), which combines {{the use of}} odd-chain n-alkanes, naturally occurring in plants, and dosed even-chain n-alkanes, as internal and external markers, respectively; (b) with the ratio between faecal excretion, estimated with chromium sesquioxide (Cr 2 O 3), and the herbage indigestibility, estimated in vitro (HICr). The two techniques were compared in an indoor experiment and under grazing conditions. In the indoor trial, 12 wethers were fed 40 g dry matter (DM) kg- 1 BW 0. 75 day- 1 {{of one of the}} following diets: herbage only (diet H); herbage plus maize (diet M; 26 % of DM intake); herbage plus maize plus <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> meal (diet MG; 13 % of DM intake each). Each wether was dosed once a day for 12 days with the external indicators impregnated on paper and inserted in gelatine capsules: n-dotriacontane, C 32, 600 mg day- 1; Cr 2 O 3, 500 mg day- 1. In the second experiment, six adult, lactating ewes grazing the pasture used for the indoor trial were divided into groups of three receiving 700 g day- 1 of two different supplements: maize (diet M) or a 50 : 50 mix of maize and <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> meal (diet MG). The external indicators (Cr 2 O 3 and C 32) were administered for 8 consecutive days. The trial was repeated four times with the same procedure between 10 th and the 40 th day after lambing. Recoveries of Cr 2 O 3, C 32 and herbage n-alkanes (n-hentriacontane, C 31, and n-tritriacontane, C 33) were incomplete, with lower values for the natural n-alkanes than the dosed n-alkane (Cr 2 O 3, 94. 9 ± 5. 5 %; C 31, 86. 7 ± 8. 7 %; C 32, 89. 6 ± 8. 5 %; C 33, 85. 1 ± 9. 9 %). Therefore, HICr gave an overestimate of the true herbage intake of 5. 5 % and HIal an underestimate of 3. 0 %, with a significant discrepancy between methods (803 vs. 733 g organic matter (OM) day- 1), not affected by diet. In the grazing trial, HICr was higher than HIal, but the difference between methods (1503 vs. 1273 g OM day- 1) was higher than that obtained in the indoor experiment and was influenced by diet (380 g OM day- 1 vs. 81 g OM day- 1 with diet M and diet MG, respectively).

Methods Eighteen Sahiwal calves were divided into three groups, based on average body weight (87. 24 kg) and age (6 to 12 mo), and treatments {{were assigned to the}} different groups randomly. The first group (GP-I) was kept as control and received GNC-based concentrate mixture. In second (GP-II) and third (GP-III) groups, 750 g/kg nitrogen (N) of GNC was substituted by RGM and MGM respectively, with similar forage:concentrate ratio (56 : 44). Results The 90 days of experimental feeding revealed that intake of dry matter, crude protein and digestibility coefficients for all nutrients did not differ among groups. Furthermore, although N balance was greater (p≤ 0. 05) for GP-III than GP-I and GP-II, average daily gain was similar between GP-I and GP-II but greater (p≤ 0. 05) for GP-III. In addition, feed efficiency and related haematological variables did not differ due to treatments.

The feed supplementation affects the water quality and culture systems. Aflatoxins are a family of extremely toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic compounds produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. The present study was planned to study the effect of aflatoxin B 1 on growth and histology of various development stages of Catla catla. For this purpose three trials were conducted on the different age groups i. e. advanced fry, fingerlings and on fingerling fish intra peritonially. Aspergillus parasiticus. National Road Racing League (NRRL) 2999 was grown on rice for aflatoxin production in Quality Operation Lab. Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology (University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore). A total number of 25 healthy Catla catla weighing 150 Â± 10 gm were collected from Fish Farm of the University and maintained in glass aquaria. The fish were supplied with a commercial fish ration (fish meal, <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> meal, soyabean meal, sunflower meal, rice polish, molases) previously analyzed without detectable aflatoxinB 1. The water temperature was kept at 29 Â± 2 oC throughout the experiment. Aflatoxin B 1 was administered intra peritoneally beneath the pelvic fin in each Catla catla weighing 150 gm. Dosages prepared were 0. 09 ml aflatoxin B 1 / 1 cc distilled water, 0. 180 ml/ 1. 5 cc distilled water, 0. 271 ml/ 2 cc distilled water, 0. 361 ml/ 2. 5 cc distilled water 0. 451 ml/ 3 cc distilled water which was here after regarded as 10 ppb, 20 ppb, 30 ppb, 40 ppb, 50 ppb respectively and served as different treatments. Control group, however, did not receive any aflatoxin B 1. Blood was sampled over 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours and 120 hours and collected from the caudal vein, gills and heart using a medical syringe previously rinsed with 2. 7 % ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) solution for laboratory analysis. Haematological parameters, like red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), haemoglobin (HB), albumen (ALB), and globulin(GLB) levels, A G and Total Protein were determined. The result showed that Catla catla is very susceptible to aflatoxin intoxication.

The cascade of events totally damages the functioning and viability of an organ ultimately succumbing the animal. In the 2 nd experiment, advanced fry Catla catla were used as an experimental animals and studies were conducted for the period of three months. There were 5 treatments and a control with two replicates in each. 180 advanced fry were randomly stocked having 15 No. each glass aquaria. 30 % crude protein containing feed ingredients such as fish meal, <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> meal, soya bean meal, sunflower meal, rice polish and molasses were analyzed for {{the presence or absence of}} toxins by qualitative and quantitative methods. Control group was free of aflatoxins while the remaining 5 treatment received aflatoxin in the order of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ppb hereafter termed as T 1, T 2, T 3, T 4 and T 5. All the fishes in various groups were regularly and equally fed at the rate of 5 % of their body weight daily. Response to feed was measured in growth increments and histopathological damages to the tissues /cells in vital organs. All the water quality parameters were monitored on fortnightly basis. At the end of the experiment, all fishes were harvested weighed, measured and dissected for histopathological studies. The result showed that the advanced fry of Catla catla were more susceptible as compared to fingerlings. Fishes in control group grew much better than those exposed to aflatoxin containing feed. In the 3 rd trial, fingerling of Catla catla were stocked in the aquariums for the period of three months. In this trial aflatoxin produced in the trial was mixed in feed at various proportions to elucidate its effect on growth performance of fingerlings Catla catla. For this experiment 10 fingerling were stocked into twelve glass aquaria containing twenty liter of water. One control without aflatoxin B 1 while other five test groups with duplicate received aflatoxin B 1. After twelve week experimental period, liver, kidney and intestine were collected from the control and aflatoxin B 1 exposed groups for histopathological studies of fingerlings. Feed ingredients such as fish meal, <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> meal, soya bean meal, sunflower meal, rice polish and molasses were analysed for the presence or absence of toxins by qualitative and quantitative methods. The results showed that Catla catla is very susceptible to aflatoxin intoxication. If administered orally its toxicity spread slowly and steadily with the increments of dosage. The control aquarium showed the best growth while growth decreased from T 1 to T 5 when aflatoxin B 1 dose increased in the feed.

A series of feeding experiments were conducted to determine the growth performance of grouper juveniles. Test diets were formulated for growth (4 replications/treatment) and digestibility experiments (3 replications/treatment). Each diet contained a test ingredient: white fish meal, white cowpea meal and ipil-ipil leaf meal (experiment 1); local meat and bone meal, soya protein concentrates and meat solubles (experiment 2); and imported meal and bone meal, blood meal and <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> meal (experiment 3). A feeding trial for each experiment was conducted for 85 days in a flow-through system with filtered and aerated seawater. 10 and 20 juveniles were stocked in each of 60 - and 250 -litre fibreglass tanks, respectively. White cowpea meal (20. 5 % incorporation), local (16 % incorporation) and imported (19 % incorporation) meat and bone meals could partially replace fish meal in the diets for grouper juveniles without affecting their growth. Low ADMD and APD values for the processed feed ingredients (meat and bone meal, soya protein concentrates and blood meal-based diets) could be associated with the processing methods used in its preparation, which could damage the amino acids and contribute to low nitrogen digestibility.

Specifically, the study focused on the fate of selected GM soy DNA fragments from feed to fish to investigate their survival through the fish gastrointestinal (GI) tract and whether the DNA could be traced in a variety of fish tissues. Fish were fed three experimental diets for 6 weeks, which were formulated from defined components and represented either GM or non-GM materials (17. 2 % of the fish meal was replaced with either GM or non-GM soy). A control diet composed of fish meal as the only protein source was used for comparison purposes.

In the fish GI tract, however, only the smaller DNA fragment (120 bp) could be amplified from the content of the stomach, pyloric region, mid intestine and distal intestine. No transgenic or conventional soy DNA fragments could be detected in liver, muscle or brain tissues resected from sacrificed fish. The sensitivity limit of the method was evaluated to be 20 copies.

There {{were no significant differences between}} intake of MG 35 and Com. Thus, the action of changing the feed on its own did not affect feed intake since the decrease was shown to be feed-specific to FM 42. Six types of agonistic behaviours were identified and used to assign dominance rank, there were no correlations between dominance and feeding ranks. This was due to non-linear hierarchies with one dominant fish in each group. Feeding ranks were more stable when feeding MG 35 than FM 42. Feeding rank stability (Kendall's coefficient of concordance) was significant in 5 out of 6 groups fed MG 35 (compared with 3 out of 6 fed FM 42). Feeding rank stability was higher in 5 out of the 6 groups when they were fed MG 35 than when the same group was fed FM 42.

40|$|Background and Problem Statement There {{is a great}} {{interest}} in recent years to replace soybean meal by cost effective protein sources such as rapeseed meal and <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> in animal feed. In poultry, this replacement, however, may result in a poorer performance due to among others its low ileal digestibility, which may lead to hindgut protein fermentation. This hindgut protein fermentation can result in the production of harmful compounds such as ammonia, branched chain fatty acids, biogenic amines and different sulfur containing compounds such as skatole, indole and phenolic compounds. This can negatively affect the cost of broiler meat production. When digestibility is low gut health may be compromised. Also feed to gain ratios will be high and overall performance will be low. Apart from the economic losses, good digestible protein sources may be preferably used for human consumption. Thus, the challenge is to provide the basis {{for the development of a}} new feeding strategy that meets the nutrient requirements of modern-day broilers, especially when they are fed a low ileal digestible protein source, i. e. rapeseed meal and <b>maize</b> <b>gluten,</b> thereby minimizing the interruption of their production performance. Objectives of the Study The aim of the study was to find ways to improve protein digestibility of poor ileal digestible resources, to reduce potential hindgut protein fermentation by developing appropriate dietary strategies such as an adequate diet structure, the supplementation of organic acids and/or fermentable energy that improve nutrient availability at ileal level and gut health in broilers. The specific objectives of the present study were to: Review various factors that influence hindgut protein fermentation in broilers and nutritional strategies that may reduce hindgut protein fermentation (Chapter 2). Determine the effects of protein source, differing in fermentation characteristics, and of digestible dietary protein content on performance, gut morphology and cecal fermentation characteristics in broiler (Chapter 3). Investigate the effects of diet structure combined with different levels of indigestible dietary protein source on performance and gut morphology in broilers (Chapter 4). Study the main and interactive effects of protein source, diet structure, butyric acid and fermentable energy supplementations on performance, gut morphology and cecal fermentation characteristics (Chapter 5). Analyze the effects of protein source, diet structure, butyric acid and fermentable energy supplementation on cecal microbiota population and composition (Chapter 6). Major Findings of the Thesis This thesis provides a literature review and describes the results of three experiments in which different nutritional strategies were tested. All experiments were carried out with Ross- 308 broilers. Chapter 2 reviews the literature on hindgut fermentation in broilers with special attention to protein fermentation, its detrimental effects on performance, gut health and on gut microbiota population. A wide range of harmful products such as ammonia, branched chain fatty acids, biogenic amines and different sulfur containing compounds such as skatole, indole and phenols are produced as a result of protein fermentation. Greater concentrations of biogenic amines, branched chain fatty acids, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, indole, phenols, cresol and skatole in the cecal indicate more proteolytic fermentation. Low concentrations of some of the protein fermentation products including biogenic amines are necessary for a normal gut development. This may result in distinct differences in protein digestibility when measured at the ileum and the total digestive tract. It was concluded that nutritional strategies, such as a reduction in dietary CP, supplementation of pre- and probiotics and organic acids, or feeding diets with coarse particles may increase ileal CP digestibility, thereby reducing the amount of substrate available for fermentation. These nutritional interventions can potentially enhance protein digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and, therefore, reduce the chances of protein fermentation in the hindgut. In Chapter 3, effects of three major protein sources, soybean meal, rapeseed meal and <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> at two different digestible CP levels (15. 8 and 17. 2 %) were studied to test the hypothesis that broilers fed a diet with high levels of indigestible protein, will result in a reduced growth performance, lower villus heights, deeper crypts, and more protein fermentation products in cecal digesta. In total, 288 one-day-old male broilers were used for this study. Broilers fed soybean meal diet showed a better performance compared with those fed rapeseed meal and <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> diets due its greater ileal digestibility compared with the other two protein sources. High digestible CP (17. 2 %) diet fed broilers showed better performance compared with those on low digestible CP (15. 8 %) diet. No significant effects of protein source as well as digestible CP level were found on gastrointestinal tract development, cecal ammonia and volatile fatty acid concentrations. Broilers fed soybean meal had improved duodenal morphology compared with those fed the rapeseed meal and <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> diets. A lower cecal pH and greater branched chain fatty acids concentrations in the cecal digesta were observed in broilers fed the rapeseed meal diet compared with those fed the soybean meal and <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> diets, indicating more proteolytic fermentation. In conclusion, protein source as well as digestible CP level affected growth performance, gut morphology and protein fermentation characteristics in broilers. In Chapter 4, a hypothesis that a coarse diet improves performance of broilers fed a poorly digestible protein source was tested by using 210 one-day-old broilers. A highly digestible protein diet based on soybean meal was gradually replaced by a low digestible protein diet based on rapeseed meal (RSM) in five steps (RSM- 0 %, RSM- 25 %, RSM- 50 %, RSM- 75 % and RSM- 100 %) with two diet structures (fine vs. coarse). An increase in indigestible dietary protein decreased the performance of broilers. Total cecal volatile fatty acid concentrations decreased from 209 to 126 mmol/kg DM digesta in broilers with increasing rapeseed meal in diets. Increase in the indigestible protein level, from RSM- 0 % to RSM- 100 %, decreased villus heights (1782 vs. 1574 µm), whereas crypt depths increased (237 vs. 274 µm). A coarse diet improved the performance with a 15 % heavier empty gizzard weight and changed gut morphology. Coarseness of the diet reduced the empty weights of the crop, proventriculus and jejunum, and reduced gizzard pH by 16 %. Protein fermentation indices such as branched chain fatty acids and biogenic amines were reduced by 24 and 12 %, respectively, in the cecal digesta of broilers fed coarse diets compared with those fed fine diets. In conclusion, feeding coarse particles improved the performance of broilers even with a poorly digestible protein source. Hindgut protein fermentation was reduced in broilers fed diets with a low CP digestibility by coarse grinding of the diet. In Chapter 5, the effects of protein source, diet structure and supplementation of butyric acid and fermentable energy on growth performance and cecal digesta characteristics were investigated to test the hypothesis that a coarse diet supplemented with butyric acid and fermentable energy improves growth performance of broilers fed a poorly digestible protein source. The interaction effects of diet structure (fine vs. coarse), fermentable energy (with vs. without) and butyric acid supplementation (with vs. without) in a poorly digestible diet based on rapeseed meal were evaluated. Coarseness of the diet positively affected performance and improved relative empty gizzard weights by on average 14 %. The relative empty weights of the crop, duodenum, jejunum and ileum, were reduced in coarse diets fed broilers compared with those fed fine diets. Broilers fed coarse diet showed a 6 % greater ileal protein digestibility, 20 % lower gizzard pH, improved gut morphology, and 23 % reduced cecal branched chain fatty acids compared with those fed the fine diets. Broilers fed butyric acid supplemented diets had improved performance and gut morphology compared with those fed the diets without butyric acid. Fermentable energy supplementation did not influence growth performance nor gut development and contents of total branched chain fatty acids and total biogenic amines in the cecal digesta. Supplementation with fermentable energy, however, decreased the concentration of spermine by approximately 31 %. In conclusion, feeding a coarse diet supplemented with butyric acid improves growth performance of broilers even if they are fed a diet containing a poorly digestible protein source. The negative effects of a low digestible protein source can thus be partly counterbalanced by coarse grinding and butyric acid supplementation in the diet. In Chapter 6, the effects of protein source, diet structure, butyric acid and fermentable energy supplementations on cecal microbiota population and composition in broilers were evaluated. Cecal digesta samples collected in experiments 1, 2 and 3 were therefore, analysed for some microbiota. The results indicated that cecal microbial diversity was suppressed by dietary coarseness. Similarly, butyric acid and fermentable energy supplementation also resulted in a lower microbial diversity. Soybean meal promoted the average relative contribution of health beneficial L. paracasei and C. lactifermentans spp. compared with those fed rapeseed meal. Dietary coarseness reduced the average relative contribution of E. coli. Butyric acid supplementation promoted the average relative contribution of C. lactifermentans and R. bromii, and suppressed the pathogenic C. perfringens in the cecal digesta. Fermentable energy, in contrast, promoted C. perfringens. In conclusion, feeding a poorly digestible protein source, with coarse grinding and supplemented with butyric acid may be an effective strategy to promote health beneficial and suppress pathogenic microbiota in the cecal digesta. Conclusions The main conclusion of the study is that rapeseed meal diets reduce performance and gut health, but these negative effects can be partially counterbalanced by coarse grinding and butyric acid supplementation. Some specific conclusions based on the results of the studies described in this thesis are: Rapeseed meal is a poorly digestible protein source for broilers and results in reduced growth performance and gut morphology (Chapter 3). Coarse diet feeding enhances the development of the foregut, specially the gizzard, and it increases villus heights and reduces crypts depths in the duodenum (Chapters 4 and 5). The negative effects of moderate inclusion of indigestible protein can be counterbalanced to some extent by feeding a coarse diet (Chapters 4 and 5). The improved foregut development and villus height in the duodenum is associated with an enhanced ileal digestibility of protein, thereby allowing less protein available for fermentation in the hindgut (Chapter 5). Butyric acid supplementation improves growth performance and gut morphology (Chapter 5). Both soybean meal and dietary coarseness suppress cecal microbial diversity and promotes health beneficial microbiota (Chapter 6). Dietary coarseness suppresses pathogenic bacteria and promotes health beneficial microbiota in the ceca (Chapter 6). Coarsely ground diet with a moderate inclusion of poorly digestible protein source, supplements with butyric acid, is a good strategy to improve the ileal digestibility of protein and thus growth performance of broilers (Chapters 4 and 5). Practical Implementations This study might have some practical conclusions. Rapeseed meal can be used as a protein source in a broiler ration. Coarsely ground rapeseed meal, supplemented with butyric acid (approximately € 2. 1 / 100 broilers), can potentially replace soybean meal. It will not only provide a cheaper protein source but will also reduce the cost of feed production by reducing the steps in grinding the feed ingredients or using a roller mill instead of a hammer mill. These coarse particles will improve gut morphology and growth performance of broilers as well as increase the profitability of broiler feed producers and also broiler farmers (approximately € 6 / 100 broilers). The most perspective feeding strategy to enhance the growth performance of broilers fed a poorly digestible protein source is the use of coarsely ground supplemented with butyric acid...|$|E
