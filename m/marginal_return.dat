[...] Traditionally, comparative results in economics are obtained using the Implicit Function Theorem, an approach that requires the concavity and differentiability of the objective function as well as the interiority and uniqueness of the optimal solution. The methods of monotone comparative statics typically dispense with these assumptions. It focuses on the main property underpinning monotone comparative statics, which is a form of complementarity between the endogenous variable and exogenous parameter. Roughly speaking, a maximization problem displays complementarity if a higher value of the exogenous parameter increases the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> of the endogenous variable.

30|$|Production {{functions}} {{describe the}} relationship between individualsâ€™ contribution of resources and {{the achievement of the}} public good. Different types of production functions create dramatically different dynamics in otherwise similar situations and so produce different outcomes. Generally, decelerating production function (i.e. decelerating <b>marginal</b> <b>returns)</b> involves decreasing <b>marginal</b> <b>returns</b> to contributions and refers to situations in which the first few units of resources contributed have the largest effect on the collective good and subsequent contributions progressively less. In contrast, accelerating production function (i.e. accelerating <b>marginal</b> <b>returns)</b> involves increasing <b>marginal</b> <b>returns</b> and causes subsequent contributions to generate progressively larger payoffs. In this way, each contribution makes the next one more likely. Noticeably, the collective good with accelerating production function will suffer the daunting start-up problems but optimization and sustainability can be achieved once the initial contributions are obtained.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{findings}} in public good provision experiments via the voluntary contribution mechanism is that subjects contribute {{a considerable amount of}} their initial holdings to the provision of a public good even when no contribution is the dominant strategy [see Ledyardâ€™s survey article (1995) ]. This seemingly non-rational behavior has been interpreted as resulting from confusion, kindness or fairness. For example, Andreoni (1995) developed a method to distinguish between confusion and kindness, and concluded that a relatively large part of positive contributions is interpreted as kindness. On the other hand, there are three fundamental criticisms of voluntary contribution mechanism experiments. First, most experiments to date have used a linear utility function where the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> of a public good out of one unit of contribution of a private good is less than one. Therefore, no contribution is the best strategy. Since the solution is a corner solution, the experimental results were biased in favor of contribution. In order to answer this criticism, Saijo and Nakamura (1995) conducted experiments where the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> of a public good is greater than one (high <b>marginal</b> <b>return).</b> That is, all contribution is the dominant strategy. They compared the results to experiments where the marginal benefit of a public good is less than one (low <b>marginal</b> <b>return)</b> and found that the deviation from the dominant strategy in the case of high <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> is larger than {{that in the case of}} low <b>marginal</b> <b>return.</b> They also found subjects who did not contribute cared about their relative ranking as well as monetary reward.

40|$|The seminal {{articles}} by Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) {{have led to}} the misconception that the optimal investment strategy of an all equity firm is to set the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> on investment equal to the rate of return required by shareholders.

On the basis of data from the North Sea herring fishery, we analyze the consequences of the combined effects of increasing <b>marginal</b> <b>returns</b> and fixed costs. We find that regardless of the magnitude of the fixed costs, cyclical policies can be optimal instead of the optimal steady state equilibrium advocated in much of the existing literature. We also show that the risk of stock collapse increases significantly with increasing fixed costs as this implies higher period cycles which is a quite counterintuitive result as higher costs usually are considered to have a conservative effect on resources.

40|$|AbstractThe {{conversion}} of the potential energy of dammed water into hydropower depends on both reservoir storage and release, which are the major difficulties in hydropower reservoir operation. This study evaluates the marginal utility principle, which determines the optimal carry-over storage between periods, for long-term hydropower scheduling. Increasing marginal cost and decreasing <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> are two important characteristics that determine the marginal utility principle in water supply. However, the notion of decreasing <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> is inapplicable in hydropower scheduling. Instead, the carry-over storage from one period has an increasing marginal contribution to the power generation in the next period. Although carry-over storage incurs an increasing marginal cost to the power generation in the current period, the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> {{is higher than the}} marginal cost. The <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> from the carry-over storage further increases in the multi-period case. These findings suggest saving as much carry-over storage as possible, which is bounded by the operational constraints of storage capacity, environmental flow, and installed capacity in actual hydropower scheduling. The marginal utility principle is evaluated for a case study of the Three Gorges Reservoir, and the effects of the constraints are discussed. Results confirm the theoretical findings and show that the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> from carry-over storage is larger than the marginal cost. The operational constraints help determine the optimal carry-over storage...|$|E
