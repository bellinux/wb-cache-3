5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
500|$|Weinberg {{returned}} to the E Street Band briefly when Springsteen re-grouped the band in early 1995 to record a few new songs for the Greatest Hits release. The regrouping was only temporary and the band {{returned to}} inactivity. Also in 1995, Weinberg drummed on two of Johnnie Johnson's songs: [...] "I'm Mad" [...] and [...] "She Called <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Name," [...] on Johnnie's 1995 album Johnnie Be Back. [...] Weinberg spent two years building an [...] house in Middletown Township, New Jersey that they moved into in 1999; he picked up many of the furnishings for it from locations around the world during subsequent tours.|$|E

[...] Robert Corell, chairman of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment was also impressed. [...] "I sat there and I'm amazed at how thorough and accurate. After the presentation I said, 'Al, I'm absolutely blown away. There's a lot of details you could get wrong.'...I could find no error." [...] Michael Shermer, scientific author and founder of The Skeptics Society, wrote in Scientific American that Gore's slide show [...] "shocked <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> doubting stance." [...] Eric Steig, a climate scientist writing on RealClimate, lauded the film's science as [...] "remarkably up to date, with reference {{to some of the}} very latest research." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Madonna pleads the {{listener}} {{to stop for}} a moment, {{to get away from}} the world through music, with the lines going as: [...] "I don't know how I got to this stage / Let <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cage cause I'm dying / Turn up the radio, turn up the radio / Don't ask me where I wanna go, we gotta turn up the radio." [...] During the intermediate verses, Madonna sings about making speakers blow, which is accompanied by a subtle sound of an actual speaker blowing up. It also talks about the need to relax as well as the need to have fun. According to NMEs Priya Elan, [...] "the song continues [...] career-spanning themes of getting into the groove, of uniting the bourgeoisie and rebelling." [...] O'Mancey gave a detailed analysis of the lyrics: ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Misery" [...] {{details the}} {{feelings}} one receives following a new relationship. Stefani sings: [...] "Hurry up, {{come see me}} / Put <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> misery", which shows the singer debating whether she wants to relive the pain or experience the pleasure. Elsewhere, she compares her boyfriend to medications: [...] "You're like drugs to me / You're like drugs to me", and warns him that their newfound relationship is becoming a bit much: [...] "You're in so much trouble / Yeah, you're in so much trouble". Additionally, she requests that the lover should come visit her: [...] "You're at the door / I'm thinking things I never thought before / Like what your love would taste like / Give me more". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that Stefani's ex-husband Gavin Rossdale was not the track's subject, despite the misleading {{use of the word}} [...] "Misery".|$|E
500|$|On the 41st {{episode of}} Transmission Gagavision, Gaga {{announced}} that the song {{was going to be}} released soon. She added the abstract message along with the announcement: [...] "Let the cultural baptism begin. If they were not who you were taught they would be, would you still believe?" [...] "Judas" [...] was scheduled to be sent to mainstream airplay on April 19, 2011, and digital retailers on the same day, but after the track was leaked to the internet, its release was brought forward to April 15, 2011. This was done to counteract the pre-release leaks. Before the release, Gaga tweeted about the single, saying: [...] "#PawsUpForJudas! I've learned love is like a brick, you can build a house or sink a dead body." [...] On April 15, 2011, hours before the song was played on radio she again tweeted: [...] "Even After Three Times He Betrays Me," [...] she wrote, harking back to the song's lyrics about love and betrayal. In the United Kingdom, the song premiered on The Capital FM Network on April 15, 2011, during their program Home Run. Gaga addressed the leak in the 43rd episode of Transmission Gagavision, likening it to a disembodiment, saying, [...] "A slow death! Just put <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> f---ing misery, just put that sh-- out. They were tearing [...] limb for limb. First it was the arm of the song, then the liver...." ...|$|E

It has been used in The Block in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|... "Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)" [...] debuted {{at number}} one on the UK Singles Chart, selling 58,840 {{downloads}} in its first week. [...] Lott described her reaction upon learning the song reached number one: [...] "I was in bed at my mum and dad's, where I still live, in Brentwood, Essex. I was on the laptop, and I {{got a phone call from}} my A man. He really dragged it out. I said, 'Please put <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> misery.' And he said, 'I'm really, really sorry but... you're No 1!' I spent the rest of the day running around the house, screaming." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{most of his}} career, Douglas enjoyed {{good health}} and what seemed like an inexhaustible supply of energy. Much of that {{vitality}} he attributes to his childhood and pre-acting years: [...] "The drive that got <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hometown and through college {{is part of the}} makeup that I utilize in my work. It's a constant fight, and it's tough." [...] His demands on others, however, were an expression of the demands he placed on himself, rooted in his youth. [...] "It took me years to concentrate on being a human being—I was too busy scrounging for money and food, and struggling to better myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} we {{returned}} down Broadway, {{it seemed to me}} that the city was flying before some awful calamity. [...] "Why," [...] said I, [...] "Colonel, what under heaven is the matter? Everyone appears to be pitching out their furniture, and packing it off." [...] He laughed, and said this was the general [...] "moving day." [...] Such a sight nobody ever saw unless it was in this same city. It seemed a kind of frolic, as if they were changing houses just for fun. Every street was crowded with carts, drays, and people. So the world goes. It would take a good deal to get <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> log-house; but here, I understand, many persons [...] "move" [...] every year.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983 [...] "You're Driving <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Mind" [...] {{became the}} group's last single {{to reach the}} US Top40. The band moved towards a more 1980s style sound and added a keyboardist, David Hirschfelder (ex-Peter Cupples Band), in September 1983. The {{pressures}} of success and constant touring took their toll on the band as line-up changes continued. Birtles left in October {{because he did not}} like the harder, more progressive musical path that Goble was taking the group and because he had preferred Shorrock's vocals. Birtles contributed to soundtracks for feature films, From Something Great (1985) and Boulevard of Broken Dreams (1988); he also worked as a session musician. Pellicci left in February 1984 for similar reasons and Steve Prestwich (ex-Cold Chisel) was his replacement on drums. Pellicci became a session musician: including working for Brian Cadd.|$|E
2500|$|With Farnham, Little River Band {{recorded}} three studio albums, {{which had}} modest success – {{not enough to}} pay back the advances the record company had provided. The first studio album, The Net, was already written and Farnham had no say in the songs, he just had to record his lead vocals. In the US, charting albums with Farnham's vocals, were Greatest Hits (1982), The Net (1983) and Playing to Win (1984) on Billboard Pop Albums chart/Billboard 200. While charting singles were, [...] "The Other Guy", [...] "We Two", [...] "You're Driving <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Mind" [...] and [...] "Playing to Win".

2500|$|Sandé first {{appeared}} in public when she sent a video into Trevor Nelson's BBC urban music competition, where she played piano while singing one of her favourite songs, [...] "Nasty Little Man". It was later announced that she had won the competition and Sandé was offered a record deal. However, once she met the management to finalise the contract for the recording contract, the management decided against giving Sandé a deal. Her parents later sent BBC Radio 1Xtra a CD of her songs and Ras Kwame played the songs on his [...] "Homegrown Sessions", and four artists that year were asked {{to do a show}} in Soho in the United States. She later met Shahid Khan, who has previously worked with Ms Dynamite and Bashy. Khan said [...] "When we started together it took the music to something completely original. It took <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> jazz piano niche, and it took him out of his urban scene. Then we started writing for pop people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rick Moranis drove <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind. There's {{this whole}} wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults {{you a couple}} of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E
