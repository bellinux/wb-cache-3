25|$|Another American {{group to}} develop a {{distinct}} style of quilting were the Amish. Typically, these quilts use only solid fabrics, are pieced from geometric shapes, do not contain appliqué, and construction is simple (corners are butted, rather than <b>mitered,</b> for instance) and done entirely by hand. Amish quilters also tend to use simple patterns: Lancaster County Amish {{are known for their}} Diamond-in-a-Square and Bars patterns, while other communities use patterns such as Brick, Streak of Lightning, Chinese Coins, and Log Cabins, and midwestern communities are known for their repeating block patterns. Borders and color choice also vary by community. For example, Lancaster quilts feature wide borders with lavish quilting, while Midwestern quilts feature narrower borders to balance the fancier piecing.|$|E
2500|$|House left Wheeler and Wilson in 1869 {{and turned}} his {{attention}} to developing a machine that could knit various-sized goods, both flat and tubular. At the time, there were no machines on the market doing that type of work. In 1870, the Armstrong and House Manufacturing Company was organized and a shop was built to produce the new knitting machines. [...] Five patents were issued to House from 1869 to 1872, among them was one for a new system of knitting stockings in a continuous tube. The process would first knit the leg, then form a <b>mitered</b> heal, then the foot and <b>mitered</b> toe then a leg, and so on. The toe was then separated from the leg by drawing a thread leaving all the loops ready to close.|$|E
5000|$|A primary {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} <b>miter</b> saw is the <b>miter</b> index that allows {{the angle of the}} blade to be changed relative to the fence. While most <b>miter</b> saws enable precise one-degree incremental changes to the <b>miter</b> index, many also provide [...] "stops" [...] that allow the <b>miter</b> index to be quickly set to common angles (such as 15°, 22.5°, 30°, and 45°).|$|R
5000|$|Power <b>miter</b> saws {{have been}} {{available}} in various forms since the 1970s as specialized cross cut saws but with limited width of cut, especially compared to radial arm saws. Simple <b>miter</b> saws allowed the saw table to pivot allowing <b>miters</b> to be cut in one plane. Compound <b>miter</b> saws also provided saw head tilting allowing compound <b>miters</b> to be cut. <b>Miter</b> saws with abrasive cutting wheels are often used in metal work where they are known as [...] "drop saws" [...] or more commonly [...] "chop saws".|$|R
25|$|<b>Miter</b> gauge: The table has {{one or two}} slots (grooves) {{running from}} front to back, also {{parallel}} to the cutting plane of the blade. These <b>miter</b> slots (or <b>miter</b> grooves) are used to position and guide either a <b>miter</b> gauge (also known as a crosscut fence) or crosscut sled. The <b>miter</b> gauge is usually set to be at 90 degrees to {{the plane of the}} blade's cut, to cause the cut made in the workpiece to be made at a right angle. The <b>miter</b> gauge can also be adjusted to cause the cut to be made at a precisely controlled angle (a so-called <b>miter</b> cut).|$|R
2500|$|My {{first piece}} of four-way Bargello was started {{approximately}} ten years ago [...] I placed a mirror on a Bargello design {{in a way that}} showed me how it would look if I <b>mitered</b> [...] a corner. This intrigued me so much, I graphed a design starting in the center and mitering all four corners.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{economical}} method of bicycle frame construction uses cylindrical steel tubing connected by TIG welding, {{which does not}} require lugs to hold the tubes together. [...] Instead, frame tubes are precisely aligned into a jig and fixed in place until the welding is complete. [...] Fillet brazing is another method of joining frame tubes without lugs. It is more labor-intensive, and consequently {{is less likely to}} be used for production frames. As with TIG welding, Fillet frame tubes are precisely notched or <b>mitered</b> and then a fillet of brass is brazed onto the joint, similar to the lugged construction process. A fillet braze frame can achieve more aesthetic unity (smooth curved appearance) than a welded frame.|$|E
2500|$|The spur to such {{commercial}} designs can {{be found}} in the [...] "free Renaissance" [...] style that was espoused by Charles Eastlake. In 1868 he published Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and other Details which was very influential in Britain and later in the United States, where the book was published in 1872. Although the archaeology of Mr. Eastlake's volume was always careful, most of the principles in it are beyond question, and can be generally stated in a few words. The Italianate style would have no carving or molding or other ornament glued on—such work must be done in the solid; no <b>mitered</b> joints, but joints made at the right angle, and secured by mortise, tenon and pin; woods in their native colour, and unvarnished, or else painted in flat colour, with a contrasting line and a stenciled ornament at the angles; unconcealed construction everywhere, and purposes plainly proclaimed; and with veneering, round corners and all curves weakening the grain of the wood being absolutely forbidden. The furniture that he thus proposed has straight, strong, squarely cut members equal to their intention. Its ornament is painted panels, porcelain plaques and tiles, metal trimmings, and conventionalized carvings in sunk relief, a part of the construction entering into the ornament, also in the shape of narrow striated strips of wood radiating in opposite lines, after a fashion not altogether unknown in the time of Henry III. It has the honesty and solidity, but not the attraction, of the Medieval; and if it is stiff and somewhat heavy, and fails entirely to please, it has yet a wholesome and healthy air.|$|E
50|$|A <b>miter</b> gauge is {{a device}} used for holding {{workpieces}} at a set angle while being cut on table saws, band saws or sanded on stationary disk sanders. The <b>miter</b> gauge slides in a slot on the worktable (known as a <b>miter</b> slot) {{on the machine}} being used. Typically, the <b>Miter</b> Gauge and the workpiece are held together by hand and moved across the worktable making the cut (or sanded edge). Although, there are more sophisticated <b>miter</b> gauges that {{have the ability to}} clamp the workpiece or have adjustable stops for repetitive machining of workpieces.|$|R
5000|$|Electric <b>miter</b> saw or [...] "chop saw," [...] or [...] "cut-off saw" [...] or [...] "power <b>miter</b> box": {{for making}} {{accurate}} cross cuts and <b>miter</b> cuts. The basic version has a circular blade fixed at a 90° {{angle to the}} vertical. A [...] "compound <b>miter</b> saw" [...] has a blade that can be adjusted to other angles. A [...] "sliding compound <b>miter</b> saw" [...] has a blade that can be pulled through the work, in an action {{similar to that of}} a radial-arm saw, which provides more capacity for cutting wider workpieces.|$|R
50|$|The Imperial Crown was {{originally}} made for Otto I (probably in the workshops of Reichenau abbey, the single arch {{of the crown}} {{from front to back}} originally separating the two halves of the now collapsed inner cap like the ribbon which similarly caused the 10th bishops' <b>miters</b> to bulge up on either side. Thus the Imperial Crown is the first example of the <b>miter</b> crown worn as a unique privilege of the Holy Roman Emperors and Empresses. Later personal crowns of the Emperors were worn over <b>miters</b> with points like that of contemporary bishops' <b>miters,</b> the <b>miter</b> eventually becoming a part of the crown itself, although in the Baroque period the two halves of the <b>miter</b> took the form of two hemispheres.|$|R

Now that we perceive how great she was, now that her name fills the whole world, it seems strange that what I am saying is true; for it is as if a perishable paltry candle should speak of the eternal sun riding in the heavens and say, [...] "He was gossip and housemate to me when we were candles together." [...] And yet it is true, just as I say. I was her playmate, and I fought at her side in the wars; to this day I carry in my mind, fine and clear, the picture of that dear little figure, with breast bent to the flying horse's neck, charging {{at the head of the}} armies of France, her hair streaming back, her silver mail plowing steadily deeper and deeper into the thick of the battle, sometimes nearly drowned from sight by tossing heads of horses, uplifted sword-arms, wind-blow plumes, and intercepting shields. I was with her to the end; and when that black day came whose accusing shadow will lie always upon the memory of the <b>mitered</b> French slaves of England who were her assassins, and upon France who stood idle and essayed no rescue, my hand was the last she touched in life.|$|E

50|$|Platform {{construction}} {{is based on}} box designs and uses frame-and-panel construction in simple form during earlier periods evolving into more and more modified forms in later periods. While earlier pieces show full frame-and-panel construction techniques, {{different parts of the}} construction were modified through the centuries to produce diverse looking pieces which still share the same basic construction. First the panel, originally complete, is subject to cut-out sections, followed by further reduction to what may appear to be simply decorative brackets. Further refinement of the same pattern lead the shape of the decorative brackets being incorporated into the shape of the surrounding frame and simultaneously the two <b>mitered</b> vertical pieces comprising a corner become one solid piece. Pieces start to have small cross-pieces attached {{to the bottom of the}} feet rather than a frame that is equal on all sides and finally, with evolution of the complex woodworking joints that allow it, the cross-pieces are removed entirely, leaving a modern table with 3-way <b>mitered</b> corners. Unlike European-derived styles, table designs based on this style will nearly always contain a frame-in-panel top, the panel serving as the tabletop center and the frame sometimes also serving as what would be rails on a European table. Cabinets in this style have a top that does not protrude beyond the sides or front. The critical element in almost all pieces of this type is the <b>mitered</b> joints, especially the 3-way <b>mitered</b> joining of the leg and two horizontal pieces at each corner.|$|E
