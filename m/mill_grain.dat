25|$|A {{windmill}} is a mill {{that converts}} {{the energy of}} wind into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades. Centuries ago, windmills usually were used to <b>mill</b> <b>grain</b> (gristmills), pump water (windpumps), or both. The majority of modern windmills {{take the form of}} wind turbines used to generate electricity, or windpumps used to pump water, either for land drainage or to extract groundwater.|$|E

40|$|Most rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars {{grown in}} the United States were {{selected}} for endosperm starch properties and not soluble sugar content. The minor pool of soluble sugar may affect the qualities of rice as a food. Some cultivar variation in soluble sugar content was detected in <b>milled</b> <b>grain,</b> essentially the starchy endosperm, of long <b>grain</b> varieties. <b>Milled</b> <b>grain</b> of cultivars Lemont and Texmati had a soluble sugar content of 0. 21 and 0. 35 % (w/w), respectively, on a fresh weight basis. The dorsal portion of the <b>milled</b> <b>grain</b> contained {{the greatest amount of}} soluble sugar, approximately tenfold the amount found in the central core of the grain. Extracts of the <b>milled</b> <b>grain</b> contained sucrose-phosphate synthase (EC 2. 4. 1. 14) and sucrose synthase (EC 2. 4. 1. 13) activities, which were separated by anion exchange chromatography. The presence of sucrose-phosphate synthase in the rice endosperm suggested a mechanism for sucrose accumulation which might be involved in carbon partitioning during grain development...|$|R

50|$|Owing to {{the hardships}} {{associated}} with a difficult physical relief and climate, many of the early poor suffered {{from a lack of}} foodstuffs.

Some innovative farmers constructed local mills, powered by oxen, horse or donkey that allowed them to <b>mill</b> <b>grain</b> or corn for their respective families or friends. The construction of windmills, particularly at Arrebentão permitted continuous milling, but dependent on wind.|$|E

5000|$|At the weir the Saale {{is partly}} diverted, {{while some of}} the river flows over the weir and {{continues}} on its natural path, the rest is channeled through an artificial path, known as [...] "Mühlgraben".

After flowing between the mills the water continues on an artificial path for a couple of miles before returning to the Saale proper.|$|E
50|$|Four-roller millsFour-roller mills {{have two}} sets of rollers. When using a four-roller mill to <b>mill</b> <b>grain,</b> the grain first goes through rollers with a rather wide gap, which {{separates}} the seed from the husk without much damage to the husk, but leaves large grits. Flour is sieved out of the cracked grain, and then the coarse grist and husks are sent through {{the second set of}} rollers, which further crush the grist without damaging the crusts. Similarly, there are three-roller mills, in which one of the rollers is used twice.|$|E
