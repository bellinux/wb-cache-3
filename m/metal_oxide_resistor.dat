40|$|Mesoporous <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> are {{nowadays}} {{widely used}} in various technological applications, for instance in catalysis, biomolecular separations and drug delivery. A popular technique used to synthesize mesoporous <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> is the nanocasting process. Mesoporous <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> replicas are obtained from the impregnation of a porous template with a <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> precursor followed by thermal treatment and removal of the template by etching in NaOH or HF solutions. In a similar manner to the traditional casting wherein the product inherits {{the features of the}} mold, the <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> replicas are supposed to have an inverse structure of the starting porous template. This is however not the case, as broken or deformed particles and other structural defects have all been experienced during nanocasting experiments. Although the nanocasting technique is widely used, not all the processing steps are well understood. Questions over the fidelity of replication and morphology control are yet to be adequately answered. This work therefore attempts to answer some of these questions by elucidating the nanocasting process, pin pointing the crucial steps involved and how to harness this knowledge in making wholesome replicas which are a true replication of the starting templates. The rich surface chemistry of mesoporous <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> is an important reason why they are {{widely used in}} applications such as catalysis, biomolecular separation, etc. At times the surface is modified or functionalized with organic species for stability or for a particular application. In this work, nanocast <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> (TiO 2, ZrO 2 and SnO 2) and SiO 2 were modified with amino-containing molecules using four different approaches, namely (a) covalent bonding of 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), (b) adsorption of 2 -aminoethyl dihydrogen phosphate (AEDP), (c) surface polymerization of aziridine and (d) adsorption of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) through electrostatic interactions. Afterwards, the hydrolytic stability of each functionalization was investigated at pH 2 and 10 by zeta potential measurements. The modifications were successful except for the AEDP approach which was unable to produce efficient amino-modification on any of the <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> used. The APTES, aziridine and PEI amino-modifications were fairly stable at pH 10 for all the <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> tested while only AZ and PEI modified-SnO 2 were stable at pH 2 after 40 h. Furthermore, the functionalized <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> (SiO 2, Mn 2 O 3, ZrO 2 and SnO 2) were packed into columns for capillary liquid chromatography (CLC) and capillary electrochromatography (CEC). Among the functionalized <b>metal</b> <b>oxides,</b> aziridinefunctionalized SiO 2, (SiO 2 -AZ) showed good chemical stability, and was the most useful packing material in both CLC and CEC. Lastly, nanocast <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> were synthesized for phosphopeptide enrichment which is a technique used to enrich phosphorylated proteins in biological samples prior to mass spectrometry analysis. By using the nanocasting technique to prepare the <b>metal</b> <b>oxides,</b> the surface area was controlled within a range of 42 - 75 m 2 /g thereby enabling an objective comparison of the <b>metal</b> <b>oxides.</b> The binding characteristics of these <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> were compared by using samples with different levels of complexity such as synthetic peptides and cell lysates. The results show that nanocast TiO 2, ZrO 2, Fe 2 O 3 and In 2 O 3 have comparable binding characteristics. Furthermore, In 2 O 3 which is a novel material in phosphopeptide enrichment applications performed comparably with standard TiO 2 which is the benchmark for such phosphopeptide enrichment procedures.

30|$|A {{range of}} <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> (Co 3 O 4, MoO 3, NiO, Fe 2 O 3, MnO 3, and CuO), mixed <b>metal</b> <b>oxides,</b> such as CoO/MoO 3, and {{supported}} <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> {{have also been}} explored for lignin pyrolysis [48, 53]. In general, the liquid bio-oil yield was higher for all catalysts than for thermal pyrolysis, with phenol alkoxy compounds as the primary products over the <b>metal</b> <b>oxides.</b> Nickel and manganese oxide offered a similar product distribution to thermal pyrolysis, with 2 -methoxy phenol favoured by NiO and CuO, and MoO 3 favouring vanillin instead of phenols and 2 -methoxy phenols. The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons was increased by supporting nickel or cobalt oxides over ZSM- 5 [53], which promoted direct deoxygenation of the aromatic lignin backbone compared to the unsupported <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> counterparts.|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous silica <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> (ZnO and CdO) {{thin films}} {{have been used}} as metal ion {{precursors}} to produce the first examples of mesoporous silica metal sulfide (meso-SiO 2 @ZnS, meso-SiO 2 @CdS) or silica metal selenide (meso-SiO 2 @ZnSe, meso-SiO 2 @CdSe) thin films, in which the pore walls are made up of silica and metal sulfide or metal selenide nanoflakes, respectively. A gentle chemical etching with a dilute HF solution of the meso-SiO 2 @CdS (or meso-SiO 2 @CdSe) produces mesoporous cadmium sulfide (meso-CdS) (or cadmium selenide, meso-CdSe). Surface modified meso-CdS displays bright blue photoluminescence upon excitation with a UV light. The mesoporous silica <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> are formed as <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoislands over the silica walls through a self-assembly process of a mixture of metal nitrate salt-two surfactants-silica source followed by calcination step. The reactions, between the H 2 S (or H 2 Se) gas and solid precursors, have been carried out at room temperature and monitored using spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. It has been found that these reactions are: 1) taking place through the diffusion of sulfur or selenium species from the top <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> layer to the silica <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> interface and 2) slow and can be stopped at any stage to obtain mesoporous silica <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>metal</b> sulfide or silica <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>metal</b> selenide intermediate thin films.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Patterning of <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> {{typically}} {{involves a}} multi step process, involving depositing a resist, patterning that resist with {{some form of}} lithography, etching the oxide through the resist, and finally removing. This process can be simplified if the resist is removed and replaced with a <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> that can be directly patterned. Solution deposition of <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> allows the possibility of depositing materials that are responsive to traditional lithographic patterning methods. A directly patterned resist can be integrated into devices with less difficulty. It is also possible, with a directly patterned <b>metal</b> <b>oxide,</b> to consider this material also as a resist for the patterning of another material. This <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> can then be considered an inorganic resist. Inorganic resists have proven to offer a higher resolution and etch resistance than a comparable polymer resist. The work presented here represents efforts to develop directly patterned <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> that exhibits these desired resist properties, but which also competes with polymer resist in terms of sensitivity, the one area inorganic resists have always performed unsuitably. An inorganic resist has been developed that exhibits excellent performance in these important metrics, {{as well as others}} which are required of state-of-the-art resists. This inorganic resist has shown sensitivity to a variety of modern exposure sources. The patterning chemistry which has been develop is adaptable to a large number of <b>metal</b> <b>oxides.</b> Direct pattern of <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> also offers potential for the modification of the material through solution based or solid state methods in order to access a variety of material properties not found in the initial <b>metal</b> <b>oxide...</b>|$|R
