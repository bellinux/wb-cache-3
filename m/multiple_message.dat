40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} broadcasting <b>multiple</b> <b>messages</b> from one processor to many processors in telephone-like communication systems. In such systems, processors communicate in rounds, where in every round, each processor can communicate with exactly one other processor by exchanging messages with it. Finding an optimal solution for this problem was open for over a decade. In this paper, we present an optimal algorithm for this problem {{when the number of}} processors is even. For an odd number of processors, we provide an algorithm which is within an additive term of 3 of the optimum. A by-product of our solution is an algorithm for the problem of broadcasting <b>multiple</b> <b>messages</b> for any number of processors in the simultaneous send/receive model.

40|$|Abstract—Epidemic-based communications, or “gossiping”, {{provides}} a robust and scalable method for maintaining a knowledge base in a sensor network {{faced with an}} unpredictable network environment. Since sensed information is often periodic in time, protocols {{should be able to}} manage <b>multiple</b> <b>messages</b> in an efficient way. We describe a mathematical model of gossiping dealing with <b>multiple</b> <b>messages.</b> We present simulation results that suggest the model can provide insights into the design and optimisation of sensor networks in the case of dissemination of periodically generated data. We show {{that it is possible to}} control data freshness without increasing overhead, and quantify the importance of topology in achieving timely dissemination...|$|R

Selection of larger element sizes and stronger hash functions, such as 512-bit elements and SHA-512, ensures greater security margins to manage these unknowns.|$|E

50|$|Many {{species of}} animals engage in {{some type of}} {{courtship}} display to attract a mate, such as dancing, the creation of sounds and physical displays. However, many species {{are not limited to}} just one of these behaviors. It has been show that the males of a multitude of species ranging many taxa create complex multi-component signals that have an effect on more than one sensory modality, also known as multi-modal signals. There are two leading hypothesis on the adaptive significance of multi-modal signal processing. The <b>multiple</b> <b>message</b> hypothesis states that each signal that a male exhibits will contribute to a possible mate's perception of the male. The redundant signal hypothesis states that the male exhibits multiple signals that portray the same 'message' to the female, with each extra signal acting as a fall-back plan for the male should there be a signaling error. The choosy sex may only evaluates one, or a couple, traits at a given time when interpreting complex signals from the opposite sex. Alternatively, the choosy sex may attempt to process all of the signals at once to facilitate the evaluation of the opposite sex.|$|E
