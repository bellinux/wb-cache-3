For a {{class of}} <b>multigroup</b> SIR {{epidemic}} <b>models</b> with varying subpopulation sizes, we establish that the global dynamics are completely determined by the basic reproduction number R 0.

In comparison with models described by ordinary differential equations (ode), the stochastic differential equation (sde) models provide of course a means of accommodating randomness in the model. Two themes of special interest in the modeling of population dynamics of a disease are the stability of equilibrium points and the optimal control of interventions such as vaccination, quarantine, public health education and others. For sde models, optimal control problems and solutions are presented in [1] of Cai and Luo, [2] of Ishikawa and in [3].

The entropy closure model (M 1) is applied to multigroup radiation transfer in a radiation hydrodynamics code.

We also account for the energy exchange between neighbouring groups which is important in flows with strong velocity divergence. These terms were computed using a finite volume method in the frequency domain. The radiative transfer aspect of the method was first tested separately for global consistency (reversion to grey model) and against a well established kinetic model through Marshak wave tests with frequency dependent opacities. Very good agreement between the multigroup M 1 and kinetic models was observed in all tests.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Received {{social support}} is {{considered}} important for health-enhancing exercise participation. The enabling hypothesis {{of social support}} suggests an indirect association of social support and exercising via constructs of self-regulation, such as self-efficacy. This study aimed at examining an expanded enabling hypothesis by examining effects {{of different kinds of}} social support (i. e., emotional and instrumental) on exercising not only via self-efficacy but also via self-monitoring and action planning. DESIGN AND METHODS: An 8 -week online study was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. The intervention comprised finding and then exercising regularly with a new exercise companion. Intervention and control group effects were compared by a manifest <b>multigroup</b> <b>model.</b> RESULTS: Received emotional social support predicted self-efficacy, self-monitoring, and action planning in the intervention group. Moreover, received emotional social support was indirectly connected with exercise via the examined mediators. The indirect effect from received emotional social support via self-efficacy mainly contributed to the total effect. No direct or indirect effect of received instrumental social support on exercise emerged. In the control group, neither emotional nor instrumental social support was associated with any of the self-regulation constructs nor with exercise. CONCLUSION: Actively looking for a new exercise companion and exercising together seems to be beneficial for the promotion of received emotional and instrumental social support. Emotional support in turn promotes exercise by enabling better self-regulation, in particular self-efficacy. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? With the 'enabling hypothesis', Benight and Bandura (2004, Behav. Res. Ther., 42, 1129) claimed that social support indirectly affects behaviour via self-efficacy. Research in the domain of physical exercise has provided evidence for this enabling hypothesis on a correlational basis only preventing causal inferences. What does this study add? We found evidence for the enabling hypothesis of received social support via self-efficacy on physical exercise in an intervention study. Moreover, this study demonstrated the distinct contribution of received emotional and instrumental social support {{in the context of the}} enabling hypothesis...|$|E

An algorithm is suggested which allows the complete solution of the general scalar problem in all separable geometries of interest, for homogeneous boundary conditions. The results are the time igenvalues and the spatial eigen functions. The algorithm is suitable for direct computer implementation. Examples of application are given. The multigroup problem can be solved by adequate extensions of the one-group algorithm. Since the associated operators are nonselfadjoint, the eigenvalues form in general a spectrum that has a discrete plus a continuous part. All of the discrete spectrum can be obtained using the suggested method. An example with two groups of neutrons in a three-region domain is given. Extensions to inhomogeneous equations and boundary conditions are considered. Application of the methods to other problems rather than the pulsed neutron problem are studied. The method is shown to be useful in the solution of nonlinear boundary-value problems. Pulsed neutron experiments can be analyzed as problems similar to Sturm-Liouville systems.
