50|$|Space {{was limited}} {{underneath}} the SPOT 1 satellite, and Viking {{had to be}} quite sturdy in order to withstand the stress of launch. The basic shape of the Swedish satellite was a flat octagonal disc, 0.5 metres thick and 1.9 metres across. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>interface</b> of the payload adapter from the Ariane rocket was duplicated on top of Viking.

After SPOT had been released, Viking fired its own rocket engine and was sent into its proper polar orbit.|$|E
50|$|Although {{commonly}} referred to as an RJ45 in the context of Ethernet and category 5 cables, it is incorrect to refer to a generic 8P8C connector as an RJ45. A telephone-system-standard RJ45 plug has a key which excludes insertion in an un-keyed 8P8C socket. The registered jack (RJ) standard specifies a different <b>mechanical</b> <b>interface</b> and wiring scheme for an RJ45S from TIA/EIA-568-B which is often used for modular connectors used in Ethernet and telephone applications. 8P8C modular plugs and jacks look very similar to the plugs and jacks used for FCC's registered jack RJ45 variants, although the RJ45S is not compatible with 8P8C modular connectors.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{spacecraft}} subsystems {{are designed}} and manufactured separately, and are integrated {{only during the}} final stages of satellite development. This requires containers for the subsystems' hardware, <b>mechanical</b> <b>interfaces,</b> panels, frames, bulky wire harnesses, etc., which add considerable mass and volume. As all subsystems are generally secured to the structure, the multifunctional structure approach aims at merging these elements into the structure, so that the structure also carries out some of the typical functions of the subsystems (e. g. electrical energy storage). The main advantages are as follows: (i) removal of the bolted <b>mechanical</b> <b>interfaces</b> and most of the subsystems' containers; (ii) reduction of the satellite structure mass, as the strength of the parts of the subsystem imbedded into the structure are exploited, and substitute purely structural parts; (iii) reduction of the overall satellite volume, as elements such as battery packs or electronic harnesses can be built into the structure's volume. There are still issues {{that need to be addressed}} to allow a wider utilization of multifunctional structures. However, the development of concurrent engineering approaches, to carry out an integrated design of the spacecraft, together with advances in the subsystems' disciplines, will help to promote the further diffusion of multifunctional structures. © 2007 SAGE Pulications...|$|R

50|$|Conductive {{polymers}} {{have been}} shown to lower the impedance of electrodes (an important property as mentioned above), increase the charge density, and improve the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interface</b> between the soft tissue and hard electrode. The porous (rough) structure of many conductive polymer coatings on the electrode increases the surface area. The high surface area of conductive polymers is directly related to decreased impedance and charge transfer improvement at the tissue-electrode interface. This improved charge transfer allows for better recording and stimulating in neural application. Table 2 below shows some common impedance and charge density values of different electrodes at a frequency of 1 kHz, which is the characteristic of neural biological activity. The porous, high surface area of the conductive polymer coatings allows for target cell adhesion (increased cell and tissue integration), which increase the bio-compatibility and stability of the device.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Santonian-Campanian Flamborough Head chalk cliffs (Yorkshire, UK) are an {{outstanding}} outcrop of once deeply-buried tight-chalk (until 1200 m). Flamborough Chalk showed that porosity ranges from 9 to 20 % and permeability from 0. 04 to 0. 2 mD (e. g. Faÿ-Gomord et al., 2016; Sagi et al., 2013). These outcrops {{are likely to}} be representative of sub-surface chalk reservoirs in nearby onshore and offshore regions, e. g. the North Sea. The zone had been strongly affected by transpressive tectonic deformations during Tertiary; which has been widely studied (e. g. Bell et al., 1999; Starmer, 2013; Welch et al., 2014), but the precoce fracture network, far from these intense deformation zone, has not been investigated yet. Evidence of synsedimentary faulting associated with polygonal-shaped fractures network was revealed by the observation of plateform images (acquired at low altitude and used in photogrammetry). These feature argue for isotropic horizontal state of stress during compaction. Thus, the measured multiple fracture orientations were active simultaneously and mechanically interacting, instead of the intersection of multiple regional sets of different ages reported in the literature. Compaction-related stylolitization occurred in chalk synchronously or soon after synsedimentary deformation, from 800 m to 1200 m, the maximum burial depth estimated for these outcrops, under the same stress field (sub-vertical s 1, and sub-horizontal s 2 and s 3). It results in numerous horizontal stylolithic planes and small cemented synsedimentary faults with small displacements often used as preferential pressure-dissolution planes with vertical stylolithic peak. This fracture pattern, observed in high resolution aerial images and in the field, is also studied using a mechanical stratigraphy approach (e. g. D Jacquemyn et al., 2012). The mechanical units have been characterized using the DigiFract software on high resolution photogrammetry panoramas (Bisdom et al., 2014). The <b>mechanical</b> <b>interfaces</b> have been defined and their strength quantified. It appears that sedimentological bedding is non-existent or invisible and that the fracture spacing is strongly controlled by the mechanical unit thickness. The mechanical units are mostly delimited by compaction features, such as stylolites and marl-seams, which accumulate insoluble residue, clay essentially. However not all insoluble residue layers behave as <b>mechanical</b> <b>interfaces</b> and the relationship between the thickness of the insoluble residues and the strength of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interfaces</b> have also been investigated...|$|R

40|$|Interfacial {{delamination}} {{is a key}} reliability {{challenge in}} composites and micro-electronic systems due to (high-density) integration of dissimilar materials. Predictive finite element models are used to minimize delamination failures during design, but require accurate interface models to capture (irreversible) crack initiation and propagation behavior observed in experiments. Therefore, an Integrated Global Digital Image Correlation (I-GDIC) strategy is developed for accurate determination of <b>mechanical</b> <b>interface</b> behavior from in-situ delamination experiments. Recently, a novel miniature delamination setup was presented that enables in-situ microscopic characterization of interface delamination while sensitively measuring global load-displacement curves for all mode mixities. Nevertheless, extraction of detailed <b>mechanical</b> <b>interface</b> behavior from measured images is challenging, because deformations are tiny and measurement noise large. Therefore, an advanced I-GDIC methodology is developed which correlates the image patterns by only deforming the images using kinematically-admissible ‘eigenmodes’ that correspond to the few parameters controlling the interface tractions in an analytic description of the crack tip deformation field, thereby greatly enhancing accuracy and robustness. This method is validated on virtual delamination experiments, simulated using a recently developed self-adaptive cohesive zone (CZ) finite element framework...|$|E
