50|$|Keasling’s {{microbial}} {{production process}} {{has a number}} of advantages over extraction from plants. First, microbial synthesis will reduce the cost of artemisinin, the most expensive component of artemisinin-based combination therapies—by as much as tenfold—and therefore make artemisinin-derived anti-malarial drugs more affordable to people in the Developing World. Second, weather conditions or political climates that might otherwise affect the yield or cost of the plant-derived version of the drug will not affect the <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> for the drug. Third, microbial production of artemisinin in large tanks will allow for more careful distribution of artemisinin to legitimate drug manufacturers that formulate artemisinin combination therapies, rather than monotherapies. This will, in turn, slow the development of resistance to this drug. Fourth, severe shortages of plant-derived artemisinin are projected for 2011 and beyond, which will increase the cost of artemisinin combination therapies. Finally, microbially-derived artemisinic acid will enable production of new derivatives of artemisinin that Plasmodium may not be resistant to, thereby extending the time over which artemisinin may be used.|$|E
40|$|The {{impairment}} of water quality by faecal pollution {{is a global}} public health concern. <b>Microbial</b> <b>source</b> tracking methods help to identify faecal sources but the few recent quantitative <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> tracking applications disregarded catchment hydrology and pollution dynamics. This quantitative <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> tracking study, conducted in a large karstic spring catchment potentially influenced by humans and ruminant animals, {{was based on a}} tiered sampling approach: a 31 -month water quality monitoring (Monitoring) covering seasonal hydrological dynamics and an investigation of flood events (Events) as periods of the strongest pollution. The detection of a ruminant-specific and a human-specific faecal Bacteroidetes marker by quantitative real-time PCR was complemented by standard microbiological and on-line hydrological parameters. Both quantitative <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> tracking markers were detected in spring water during Monitoring and Events, with preponderance of the ruminant-specific marker. Applying multiparametric analysis of all data allowed linking the ruminant-specific marker to general faecal pollution indicators, especially during Events. Up to 80 % of the variation of faecal indicator levels during Events could be explained by ruminant-specific marker levels proving the dominance of ruminant faecal sources in the catchment. Furthermore, soil was ruled out as a source of quantitative <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> tracking markers. This study demonstrates the applicability of quantitative <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> tracking methods and highlights the prerequisite of considering hydrological catchment dynamics in source tracking study design...|$|E

Potassium nitrate {{was added to the}} fermentation substrates in vitro to form three different levels of nitrate-N (4, 8 and 16 g kg - 1 DM). Compared with <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> from urea diet-fed wethers, ruminal microbes from nitrate diet-fed animals had increased total gas production, CH 4 and CO 2 production, acetate molar proportion and DM digestibility but had decreased ruminal nitrite accumulation, NH 3 -N concentration, total VFA production and molar proportion of propionate and butyrate. There was no effect of interaction between <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> and nitrate-N addition level on ruminal fermentation characteristics, methane production and dry matter digestibility. Along with the increase of nitrate- N addition level, production of CH 4 and CO 2 and molar proportion of propionate were reduced whereas residual concentrations of both nitrate and nitrite in the incubation medium were increased. Nevertheless, total VFA production and DM digestibility was not affected by nitrate-N addition level in vitro. In conclusion although, nitrate addition has ability to inhibit ruminal methane production, the inhibition ability would gradually vanish after the microbes acclimate to the nitrate diet. The results imply that nitrate has a potential value as a dietary nitrogen supplement used by ruminant animals...|$|E

This paper provides three classes of recommendations to improve MST technology: optimization, development and evaluation.

Methods development recommendations focus on identifying new genomic targets and quantification procedures for library-independent methods. Longer-term methods development recommendations include integration of microarrays and other direct pathogen detection technology with MST. Studies defining host specificity and population dynamics should aid selection of target species during methods development.

40|$|Fecal {{pollution}} {{is a serious}} environmental problem that affects many coastal and inland waters worldwide. Both human and animal fecal pollution impose risks to human health from exposure to pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. To assist authorities {{with the implementation of}} the changes suggested by more restricted legislation concering water quality in Europe, methods are needed which can identify the sources of fecal pollution. Management of fecal contamination of water would be improved if the origin of the fecal pollution could be correctly identified since remediation efforts could then be allocated in a more effective manner. The concept that the origin of fecal pollution can be traced has been termed <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> tracking. In <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> tracking (MST) endogenous markers of fecal sources are used for identification of the fecal pollution in aquatic environments. Chemical MST-methods can be used to trace mainly sewage pollution, but the used chemical targets have no direct relationship with pathogenic bacteria. This is not the case in microbial MST-methods where source-specific bacteria or viruses are cultured to identify fecal pollution sources. However, sometimes these microbial targets can be present in too low numbers to be detected. This is circumvented by using molecular assays for host-specific marker detection. Phenotypic and genotypic library-based methods can be used to discriminate among different fecal sources. However, the isolation step makes this procedure very labour-intensive, and issues as temporal and geographical variability remain unresolved. The underlying assumptions will be discussed and the methods mostly used in <b>microbial</b> <b>source</b> tracking will be described in more detai...|$|E
