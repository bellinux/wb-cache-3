5000|$|Because {{most of the}} A82 {{is single}} carriageway, and the local {{geography}} means a detour can be a significant distance, there {{is a history of}} strong protest about closing the road. In August 2011, John Grieve, owner of Lochleven Shellfish Company, attempted to challenge Transport Scotland's plans to close the A82 overnight five days a week, for a period of up to three weeks, around the village of Onich, between Glencoe and Fort William. The Scottish Herald reported that, if the road closed, a journey from Oban to Fort William, normally 44 miles km, would require diverting via Loch Tay and Ballinluig, a journey of 166 miles km. Stewart MacLean from the A82 Partnership said, [...] "The proposal to close the road is ludicrous because there is no reasonable detour ... There are commercial vehicles running all the time. The delivery vehicles, the fish farm <b>lorries,</b> <b>refrigerated</b> wagons, they all need to get through." [...] In April 2013, Transport Scotland announced further plans to close the A82 at Onich for resurfacing, but they postponed the work due to an adverse reaction from local business owners.|$|R
40|$|Este trabajo presenta un estudio de campo sobre confort térmico basado en la concepción adaptativa, para la determinación de las temperaturas y rangos de confort térmico de sujetos habituados a espacios enfriados mecánicamente en viviendas con aire acondicionado (AA) en el clima cálido y húmedo de la ciudad de Maracaibo (Venezuela) y las consecuentes implicaciones energéticas que tiene la satisfacción de esa demanda de confortabilidad en el sector residencial de la ciudad. Para la estimación de la temperatura de confort (Tc) y el rango de temperaturas de confort se aplican diferentes metodologías de análisis estadístico, las cuales son comparadas con las respectivas calculadas con el índice PMV; se analizan también otros aspectos asociados a la confortabilidad térmica, tales como las respuestas en las diferentes escalas de valoración de la confortabilidad, las preferencias, experiencias y expectativas térmicas de los sujetos. Las implicaciones energéticas se determinan en base al consumo de la energía eléctrica residencial debido exclusivamente a la variación de la Tc, entre la obtenida inicialmente en espacios naturalmente ventilados (NV) en Maracaibo (Bravo y Gonzalez 2001 a) y la determinada ahora en espacios con AA. Para ello, se utiliza una metodología que es el resultado de la modificación parcial de la propuesta por Yamtraipat et al (2006). Entre los resultados y conclusiones derivadas de este estudio se encuentra que el 57 % de las personas prefieren las mismas condiciones confortables experimentadas en los ambientes con AA y solamente un 30 % prefieren experimentar ambientes ligeramente fríos y ligeramente calientes. Mientras tanto, las estimaciones de la Tc, y el respectivo rango, varían de {{acuerdo a}} la metodología empleada. Con la convencional metodología adaptativa, la Tc se estima en 25 °C en un amplio rango de 6 °C, entre 22 °C y 28 °C; mientras que con la metodología denominada “método de los promedios de los intervalos de las sensaciones térmicas” (Gómez-Azpeitia et al, 2007), la misma Tc se estima en 24 °C, en un rango estrecho de 22, 5 °C a 25, 5 °C y en un rango ampliado de 21 °C a 27 °C (amplitud 6 °C), donde se encuentran las tres cuartas partes de las personas del estudio. Ambas Tc son muy próximas a la temperatura operativa optima de 24, 5 °C (rango de 23 °C a 26 °C) establecida por las normas internacionales ISO 7730 : 1994 y ASHRAE 55 : 1992 para el verano en climas templados. Sin embargo, la Tc estimada con los valores de PMV resulta ser {{superior}} en 1 °C y 2 °C a la Tc estimada con la metodología adaptativa (25 °C) y con el metodo de los promedios de los intervalos (24 °C), respectivamente. Con la metodología aplicada y la muestra del estudio se estima que de haberse registrado una Tbsint igual o próxima a 28 C (equivalente a la Tc en espacios NV en Maracaibo) en todos los espacios medidos (con Tbsint entre 19 C y 29 C), el ahorro total de la energía anual seria de 1. 648, 1 GWh en un ano respecto al consumo de AA en el año 2007 (2. 522, 3 GWh en un ano), mientras que el ahorro de energía asumiendo Tbsint de 24 C y de 25 C, resultan en 651, 9 GWh en un ano y 425, 7 GWh en un ano, respectivamente. Esto significa respectivos consumos adiciones de energía eléctrica equivalentes al 60, 4 % y 74, 2 %. Finalmente, los hábitos o conductas adoptadas por las personas de este estudio, sumado a las predominantes manifestaciones de confortabilidad en ambientes enfriados mecánicamente, redundan en mayores adaptaciones a condiciones de frio y exigencias de temperaturas de confort más bajas, con su consecuente consumo energético para proveerlas. ABSTRACT This investigation presents {{a study on}} thermal comfort following the adaptive approach for {{the determination of the}} thermal comfort temperatures and ranges of subjects accustomed to <b>mechanically</b> <b>refrigerated</b> spaces in dwellings with air conditioning (AA) systems in the hot and humid weather of the city of Maracaibo (Venezuela) and the ensuing energy use implications it has on the satisfaction of such demand of comfortability in the residential sector of the city. For the estimation of the comfort temperature (Tc) and the range of comfort temperatures different statistical analysis methodologies were used, which are then compared to the respective values calculated with the PMV index, also discusses other aspects related with thermal comfortability were analyzed, such as the responses on the different scales of perception of thermal comfortability, preferences, experiences and expectations of the analyzed subjects. The energetic implications are determined through the residential energy consumption related exclusively with the variation of the Tc between the originally calculated for naturally ventilated (NV) spaces in Maracaibo (Bravo y Gonzalez 2001 a) and the one calculated on the present study with AA. For this, a new methodology was developed by partially modifying the Yamtraipat et al (2006) proposal. Among the results and conclusions of this study are that 57 % of the studied subjects prefer the same comfortable conditions experienced on AA environments and only a 30 % prefer to experience slightly cooler or warmer environments. Also, estimations of the Tc and its respective range vary according to the used methodology. With the conventional adaptive methodology, the Tc is estimated in 25 °C {{with a wide range of}} 6 °C, between 22 °C and 28 °C, while using the “thermal sensation intervals averages method” (Gomez-Azpeitia et al, 2007) the Tc is estimated in 24 °C on a narrow range between 22. 5 °C and 25. 5 °C and a widened range of 21 °C to 27 °C (6 °C in amplitude), a range where. of the studied subjects are located. Both Tc are very close to the optimum operation temperature of 24. 5 °C (with a range between 23 °C and 26 °C) established on the ISO 7730 : 1994 and ASHRAE 55 : 1992 international norms for the summer on warm climates. However, the estimated Tc with the PMV indexes results to be 1 °C and 2 °C above the Tc estimated with the adaptive methodology (25 °C) and the thermal sensation intervals averages method (24 °C), respectively. With the applied methodology and this study sample, its estimated that if a Tbsint equal or close to 28 °C (equivalent to the Tc in NV spaces in Maracaibo) was registered in all measured spaces (with Tbsint between 19 °C and 29 °C) the total yearly energy savings would be of 1. 648, 1 GWh in a year with respect to the AA consumption in the year 2007 (2. 522. 3 GWh in a year), while the energy savings assuming a Tbinst of 24 °C and 25 °C result in 651. 9 GWh and 425. 7 Gwh in a year, respectively. This means that the respective additional electrical energy consumption amount to 60. 4 % and 74. 2 %, respectively. Finally, the habits or behaviors adopted by the subjects analyzed on this study, added to the predominant manifestations of comfortability in <b>mechanically</b> <b>refrigerated</b> environments result in greater adaptations to colder conditions and lower thermal comfort temperature demands, with the consequential increase in power consumption to meet them...|$|R
5000|$|By the 1890s {{refrigeration}} {{played a}} vital role in the distribution of food. The meat-packing industry relied heavily on natural ice in the 1880s and continued to rely on manufactured ice as those technologies became available. [...] By 1900, the meat-packing houses of Chicago had adopted ammonia-cycle commercial refrigeration. By 1914 almost every location used artificial refrigeration. The big meat packers, Armour, Swift, and Wilson, had purchased the most expensive units which they installed on train cars and in branch houses and storage facilities in the more remote distribution areas. [...] By the middle of the 20th century, refrigeration units were designed for installation on trucks or <b>lorries.</b> <b>Refrigerated</b> vehicles are used to transport perishable goods, such as frozen foods, fruit and vegetables, and temperature-sensitive chemicals. Most modern refrigerators keep the temperature between -40 and -20 °C, and have a maximum payload of around 24,000 kg gross weight (in Europe). [...] Although commercial refrigeration quickly progressed, it had limitations that prevented it from moving into the household. First, most refrigerators were far too large. Some of the commercial units being used in 1910 weighed between five and two hundred tons. Second, commercial refrigerators were expensive to produce, purchase, and maintain. Lastly, these refrigerators were unsafe. It was not uncommon for commercial refrigerators to catch fire, explode, or leak toxic gases. Refrigeration did not become a household technology until these three challenges were overcome.|$|R
40|$|In 1996, the European banana import {{regime was}} {{under attack by}} the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The United States, {{supported}} by three major multinational corporations in the banana industry along with four Latin American countries, placed pressure on Europe to comply with trade obligations regarding its banana import regime, as they deemed it was functioning illegally. There will be many meetings and consultations {{in the coming year}} culminating in a vote on modifying fundamental rules of the Common Market Organization for Bananas (CMOB), which had been adopted at Marrakech in 1995. The new legislation may be very detrimental to member states of the ACP. The possibilities for growth of ACP member states, traditional suppliers to Europe, is dependent upon current negotiations regarding repartition of quotas. The extent of the current socioeconomic crisis, which could prompt WTO to take corrective measures, is already quite alarming for other Caribbean countries where banana production is the main resource (particularly, for example, Dominica, St Lucia, and Jamaica). Indeed, for several years now, these countries have suffered from diminished competitivity because they have not made needed structural changes. However, opportunities for diversification exist, these include: the opening up of other markets, reinvigoration of local markets, amelioration of channels of production and commercialization of high quality products such as organic bananas and the fair trade banana. But it is wise to be realistic, the roads to diversification, although realizable, are not without their challenges. World trade figures for bananas account for only 13. 3 tonnes of bananas (FAO, 1996). Whereas 80 % of all bananas produced worldwide go to domestic markets. In most producing countries, bananas are very popular and used in a variety of local dishes. Both in terms of production and consumption, plantain {{is at the top of}} the popularity hit list. It literally provides food security for millions of people. Of the 28. 3 million tonnes of plantain produced worldwide, 69. 4 % is destined for human consumption, 11. 1 % processed and 8 % fed to livestock. More than 60 % of this world volume is produced and consumed in central and western Africa. Plantain production is targeted for domestic consumption and thus marketed according to traditional strategies. The plantain trade is closely tied to urban market trends, with demand rising steadily as the population grows. This trade is also dependent on the marketing subsector organisation - transporters, wholesalers, retailers - which varies from country to country. Plantain is transported from plantation to market in a variety of ways, e. g. on labourers' backs, in a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>lorry,</b> by canoe and on bicycles. In Ghana, market retailers and traders go to the plantations or villages themselves to purchase plantain supplies from farmers with whom they have established agreements. Whole bunches are placed in baskets; banana hands and fingers are put in bags and carried out manually to the road. A lorry driver is then paid to transport the fruit to market, and collector-wholesalers often arrange the lorry transport operation. The bananas are sold to middlemen or traders, who sell them to retailers, who in turn sell them to consumers in bunches or separate fingers. The complexity of the intermediary subsector increases proportionally around distribution hubs with the distance between production and supply markets, especially when the approach routes are in good shape. This trend is well established in Caribbean countries such as St Vincent, whereas it is just emerging in Africa. For instance, jobbers group around important markets in southwestern Cameroon (Mile 60, Bole and Owe). The banana plantations are quite remote from Douala (100 - 150 km), not easily accessible, and often impassable in the rainy season. Large quantities of plantain are delivered to the city markets on a daily basis via regular distribution channels, and the longest one involves three main types of middleman: collector-wholesalers (purchasing 50 - 500 bunches from the producers), sedentary wholesalers, who sell to retailers on a per-bunch basis in the wholesale and retail markets of Douala, and these retailers in turn sell to consumers or other retailers on a per-finger basis. Middlemen have a key role in the plantain marketing subsector - from the wholesaler to the retailer. As this domain becomes increasingly complex, growers are forced to produce greater quantities of higher-quality plantain, more regularly, and at lower cost. Production criteria are gathered by middlemen on the basis of information they obtain on selling prices, consumer demand and market trends. By professionalizing the subsector, the most organized of these go-betweens (dealers, transport agents, etc.) could become key stakeholders and thereby influence domestic market patterns. Reducing postharvest losses As domestic consumer demand is constantly increasing, local market dynamics depend on producers' capacity to maintain adequate sustainable production levels, while staving off postharvest banana losses. The most common cropping practice involves extending yearly production over as long a period as possible. Soil potential is crucial for the success of this strategy. In Cameroon and Rwanda, on volcanic soils in the Dominican Republic, and on river alluvia in the humid intertropical zone, plantain growers have adopted a sustainable production strategy, and this crop is often their main source of income. In Ghana, consumer demand for plantain is high and its retail price is steadily rising, however production has been stagnant for 10 years. This situation could be turned around by planting high yield, strongly pest and disease resistant, cultivars. Postharvest plantain losses are generally heavy and are estimated at about 3 million tonnes worldwide. These losses are due to poor harvest and handling conditions, in addition to a shortage of distribution channels (e. g. Côte d'Ivoire). The quality of communications networks is also an important factor. In most African countries, access routes to markets are in poor condition and poorly maintained, except around large urban centres. For instance, farmers in Rusitu valley in Zimbabwe produce high volumes of dessert bananas. They lose a substantial portion of their overall production during the rainy season because of the very long distances along poor roads that have to be travelled to the nearest urban markets. The EU has set up a system whereby farmers can rent vehicles to facilitate getting to local markets. Still, asphalting the roads represents the most efficient way of promoting trade to external markets. Cameroon is a case in point, there are now paved roads allowing comparatively easy access to the main markets and the capital. In 1996, the European banana import regime was under attack by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ...|$|R
