5|$|Bal Gangadhar Tilak has {{credited}} Jainism {{with the}} cessation of slaughter of animals in the brahamanical religion. Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. This particular image <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E
5|$|The plumage colour is genetically controlled, {{and studies}} in Finland and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than brown birds. Although this <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference {{when choosing a}} mate, so the adverse selection pressure is reduced. There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.|$|E
5|$|Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin {{that the}} birth of his and Æthelburg's {{daughter}} at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus' prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a hand on his head. As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin, he laid his hand on the king's head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald's court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.|$|E
50|$|The {{characterization}} of these behaviors <b>might</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> crown shyness {{is simply the}} result of mutual shading based on well-understood shade avoidance responses. Malaysian scholar Francis S.P.

5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E
25|$|Wealthier {{households}} derive {{a larger}} share of their income from abroad. This <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> government policies in host countries favor capital-intensive activities. Even though work migration is mainly a low and middle class activity the high-income households are able to derive {{a larger share}} of their income from abroad due to favorable investment policies. These favorable investment policies causes an increase in income inequalities and do not promote domestic investments that can lead to increased standard of living.|$|E
25|$|Ichthyoconodon, a eutriconodont {{from the}} Berriasian of Morocco, is {{currently}} known from molariforms found in marine deposits. These teeth are sharp-cusped and similar in shape {{to those of}} piscivorous mammals, and unlike the teeth of contemporary mammals they do not show degradation, so rather than being carried down by river deposits the animal died in situ or close. This has been taken to mean {{that it was a}} marine mammal, likely one of the few examples known from the Mesozoic. Alternatively, its close relations to Volaticotherium and Argentoconodon <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it was a flying mammal.|$|E

25|$|While this <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} no {{positive}} British contribution during the Raj era, that is not entirely the case. Missionaries' wives such as Martha Mault née Mead and her daughter Eliza Caldwell née Mault are rightly remembered for pioneering the education and training of girls in south India. This practice was initially met with local resistance, as it flew {{in the face of}} tradition. Raja Rammohan Roy's efforts led to the abolition of Sati under Governor-General William Cavendish-Bentinck in 1829. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's crusade for improvement in the situation of widows led to the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856. Many women reformers such as Pandita Ramabai also helped the cause of women.|$|E
25|$|The {{sentinel}} {{hypothesis of}} REM sleep was {{put forward by}} Frederick Snyder in 1966. It {{is based upon the}} observation that REM sleep in several mammals (the rat, the hedgehog, the rabbit, and the rhesus monkey) is followed by a brief awakening. This does not occur for either cats or humans, although humans are more likely to wake from REM sleep than from NREM sleep. Snyder hypothesized that REM sleep activates an animal periodically, to scan the environment for possible predators. This hypothesis does not explain the muscle paralysis of REM sleep; however, a logical analysis <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the muscle paralysis exists to prevent the animal from fully waking up unnecessarily, and allowing it to return easily to deeper sleep.|$|E
25|$|If the {{cladogram}} {{above is}} correct it {{has implications for}} the evolution of land plants. The earliest diverging polysporangiophytes in the cladogram are the Horneophytopsida, a clade at the 'protracheophyte' grade that is sister to all other polysporangiophytes. They had essentially an isomorphic alternation of generations (meaning that the sporophytes and gametophytes were equally free living), which <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> both the gametophyte-dominant life style of bryophytes and the sporophyte-dominant life style of vascular plants evolved from this isomorphic condition. They were leafless and did not have true vascular tissues. In particular, they did not have tracheids: elongated cells that help transport water and mineral salts, and that develop a thick lignified wall at maturity that provides mechanical strength. Unlike plants at the bryophyte grade, their sporophytes were branched.|$|E

25|$|Goram’s name {{seems to}} have been {{borrowed}} from Iseult’s father, the king of Ireland in early versions of the romance of Tristan and Iseult, which <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the legend arose sometime after 1200. Gorm is Irish for 'blue' or 'dark-skinned'. The Christian name Vincent is first found in England in the 13th century, suggesting a fashionable cult of the saint (St Vincent the Deacon) around that time. These two factors conspire to suggest a possible 13th-century origin for the Bristol legend, but that is completely uncertain. It is not known, for example, whether the Clifton hermit was himself called Vincent and later became associated with the famous saint. St Vincent might also have been known in Bristol relatively early through the city’s wine trade with Portugal and Spain (he was born in Huesca, lived and worked in Zaragoza, and is patron saint of Lisbon and of vintners).|$|E
25|$|Takelot I's {{authority}} was not fully recognised in Upper Egypt, and Harsiese A, or another local Theban king, challenged his power there. Several Nile Quay Texts at Thebes mention two sons of Osorkon I--namely, the High Priests of Amun Iuwelot and Smendes III in Years 5, 8 and 14 of an anonymous king who {{can only be}} Takelot I, since Takelot I was their brother. Uniquely, however, the Quay Texts specifically omit any reference to {{the identity of the}} king himself. This <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> there was a dispute in the royal succession following Osorkon I's death in Upper Egypt, which seriously impaired Takelot I's control there. Harsiese A, as the son of the High Priest Shoshenq C and grandson of Osorkon I, or a hypothethical king named Maatkheperre Shoshenq must have appeared as a rival. The Theban priests henceforth chose to avoid any involvement in this dispute by deliberately leaving the name of the king in the Quay Texts 'Blank' rather than choosing sides, as G. Broekman notes in his study of the Karnak Quay Texts. This situation was ultimately later resolved by Osorkon II who is clearly attested as Pharaoh at Thebes by his 12th Regnal Year, according to Nile Quay Text No.8 and Text No.9.|$|E

Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right." [...] The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles. However the Prince of Wales has no constitutional role in modern Wales.

500|$|Both photons and {{electrons}} create analogous interference patterns when {{passed through}} a double-slit experiment. For photons, this corresponds to the interference of a Maxwell light wave whereas, for material particles (electron), this corresponds to the interference of the Schrödinger wave equation. Although this similarity <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Maxwell's equations describing the photon's electromagnetic wave are simply Schrödinger's equation for photons, most physicists do not agree. For one thing, they are mathematically different; most obviously, Schrödinger's one equation for the electron solves for a complex field, whereas Maxwell's four equations solve for real fields. More generally, the normal concept of a Schrödinger probability wave function {{cannot be applied to}} photons. As photons are massless, they cannot be localized without being destroyed; technically, photons cannot have a position eigenstate , and, thus, the normal Heisenberg uncertainty principle [...] does not pertain to photons. A few substitute wave functions have been suggested for the photon, but they have not come into general use. Instead, physicists generally accept the second-quantized theory of photons described below, quantum electrodynamics, in which photons are quantized excitations of electromagnetic modes.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{have long}} debated whether {{traditional}} Egyptian religion ever {{asserted that the}} multiple gods were, on a deeper level, unified. Reasons for this debate include the practice of syncretism, which <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> all the separate gods could ultimately merge into one, and the tendency of Egyptian texts to credit a particular god with power that surpasses all other deities. Another point of contention is {{the appearance of the}} word [...] "god" [...] in wisdom literature, where the term does not refer to a specific deity or group of deities. In the early 20th century, for instance, E. A. Wallis Budge believed that Egyptian commoners were polytheistic, but knowledge of the true monotheistic nature of the religion was reserved for the elite, who wrote the wisdom literature. His contemporary James Henry Breasted thought Egyptian religion was instead pantheistic, with the power of the sun god present in all other gods, while Hermann Junker argued that Egyptian civilization had been originally monotheistic and became polytheistic in the course of its history.|$|E
30|$|Microbes produce EPS, {{which is}} stored as a thick gel {{surrounding}} the cell, the major ecological characteristic of EPS {{is that it}} can form and maintain protective microhabitats around microorganism in aquatic and frozen atmosphere (Stoderegger and Herndl 1998; Decho 1990; Tamaru et al. 2005). We found that EPS production by the Pseudomonas strains was higher at lower temperatures (4 or 15 °C) in comparison to their optimal growth temperature (28 °C). Enhanced EPS production by the Pseudomonads at low temperature <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> EPS {{plays an important role in}} desiccation protection or prevention of drying of bacterial cells from freezing temperature (Figures  2 and 4; Roberson and Firestone 1992).

30|$|Identified genetic {{mutations}} {{appeared to be}} commoner in the black population. Studies in different populations have shown the A 1555 G mutation to be relatively rare; a frequency of 0.48, 0.09, and 0  % were seen in studies done {{in the general population}} of New Zealand, America and Argentina respectively (Scrimshaw et al. 1999; Tang et al. 2002; Gravina et al. 2007).

This <b>might</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the mutation <b>might</b> be more frequent among Blacks compared to other human races. Both A 1555 G and C 1494 T mutations decrease translation accuracy in the mitochondrion.

500|$|... while Herodotus {{suggests}} that there were 60,000 men in the army {{under the command of}} Tigranes. Squaring these two accounts, <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> there were c. 40,000 men with the fleet. Given that the Persian fleet appears to have been undermanned in the aftermath of Salamis, 200-300 ships would indeed give this number of naval personnel (using Herodotus's standard complement of 200 men per ship). However, this total of 100,000 is probably too high; to accommodate 100,000 men and 200+ ships, the Persian camp would have to have been enormous. Estimates made of Mardonius's huge camp at Plataea, which was planned and built with plenty of time, suggest it might have accommodated 70,000-120,000 men; it is improbable that such a large camp could have been built at Mycale in the time-frame that Herodotus suggests. It is therefore possible that the 60,000 quoted by Herodotus is actually the total number of Persians present at Mycale; the Persians certainly outnumbered the Allies, emerging from the palisade in confidence after seeing the smaller number of the Allied troops.|$|E
