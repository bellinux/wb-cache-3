5|$|Being very small, {{and unknown}} until the {{invention}} of the microscope, <b>microbes</b> do not feature directly in art or literature before Early Modern times (though they appear indirectly in works about brewing and baking), when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek observed <b>microbes</b> in water in 1676; his results were soon confirmed by Robert Hooke.

5|$|In September 2009, {{the most}} common type of microbe on the surface of Lake Chillisquaque was Oscillatoria, which made up {{approximately}} 75 percent of the total. Raphidiopsis was the second most common type, making up approximately 15 percent of the total. In May 2010, approximately 40 percent of the <b>microbes</b> were Navicula and 35 percent were Oscillatoria. Slightly less than 10 percent of the <b>microbes</b> are Anabaena. In July 2010, Oscillatoria and Synechococcus each made up approximately 25 percent of the <b>microbes</b> and between 10 and 15 percent were Anabaena.|$|E

50|$|Active {{immunization}} {{can occur}} naturally when a <b>microbe</b> or other antigen is received {{by a person}} who has not yet come into contact with the <b>microbe</b> and has no pre-made antibodies for defense. The immune system will eventually create antibodies for the <b>microbe,</b> but this is a slow process and, if the <b>microbe</b> is deadly, there may not be enough time for the antibodies to be used.|$|R

5|$|<b>Microbes</b> {{can make}} {{nutrients}} and minerals {{in the soil}} available to plants, produce hormones that spur growth, stimulate the plant immune system and trigger or dampen stress responses.

5|$|Since <b>microbes</b> {{were not}} known until the Early Modern period, {{they appear in}} earlier {{literature}} indirectly, through descriptions of baking and brewing. Only with {{the invention of the}} microscope, as used by Robert Hooke in his 1665 book Micrographia, and by Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670s, the germ theory of disease, and progress in microbiology in the 19th century were <b>microbes</b> observed directly, identified as living organisms, and put to use on a scientific basis. The same knowledge also allowed <b>microbes</b> to appear explicitly in literature and the arts.|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with <b>microbes</b> in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured {{dairy products}} such as yogurt and cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties. The principal <b>microbes</b> involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, and ordinary bread; and bacteria, in the case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, dairy products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of Effective Microorganism (EM) lengthen the setting time of <b>microbed</b> cement paste {{with respect to}} the control cement paste. However, the investigation on the influence of EM ingredients to the setting time was not performed yet in the earlier study. Therefore, the test of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was performed on the EM product used in order to determine their ingredients. Further examination was carried out to analyse the pore characteristics in examining the effect of the pore size distribution to the setting time of <b>microbed</b> cement paste. Potassium Chloride (KCl) was detected in EM liquid using XRD test. It can be concluded, the ingredient of EM which is consist of the molasses influenced the setting time of <b>microbed</b> cement paste. The hardening rate of <b>microbed</b> cement paste was effected by the presence of KCl. The pore size of <b>microbed</b> cement paste recorded the lower pore volume (mL/g) {{with respect to the}} control cement paste. The larger intrusion of mercury was recorded at smaller pore diameter in <b>microbed</b> cement paste while control cement paste occupied at the bigger pore diameter.

5|$|Biofuels are fuels {{derived from}} biomass {{conversion}}, {{as in the}} conversion of cellulose contained in corn stalks, switchgrass, and other biomass into cellulosic ethanol.

5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} {{important}} in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some Tenebrionidae use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection {{from a wide range}} of <b>microbes.</b> Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Terephthalic acid {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{contaminations}} released by PET processing and it's toxic to environment and animals. Useful <b>microbe</b> must be found out to biodegrade it. Bacillus came from waste water may be powerful to biodegrade it, so the waste water were used as the sources of bacillus. The <b>microbe</b> was enriched in enrichment medium first and then isolated on selective medium containing terephthalic acid as the only carbon source to get the <b>microbe</b> suitable for degradation. The purified <b>microbe</b> was used to biodegrade terephthalic acid at different temperature to find out its suitable living and degradation condition. The <b>microbe</b> was identified with molecule biological identification and biolog express identification. The fermentation condition of the purified <b>microbe</b> was studied. The enzyme activity, growth condition and degradation condition was studied. The results showed that the isolated <b>microbe</b> was a kind of bacillus named comamonas testosteroni. It's powerful to degrade terephthalic acid at 37 ℃ with the rotational speed of 200 rpm. The pH of the medium would increase during degradation of substrate. The degradation would consumed a lot of oxygen. A degradation path may be deduced...|$|R

5|$|From this core, {{specifically}} from {{ice that}} {{is thought to}} have formed from lake water freezing onto the base of the ice sheet, extremophile <b>microbes</b> were found, suggesting that the lake water supports life.

5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these <b>microbes</b> or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} <b>microbes.</b> This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E
5|$|<b>Microbes</b> {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with larger organisms.

5|$|<b>Microbes</b> simply secrete {{digestive}} enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including {{the stomach and}} pancreas, and salivary glands.

5|$|Microorganisms {{and plants}} can {{synthesize}} many uncommon amino acids.
