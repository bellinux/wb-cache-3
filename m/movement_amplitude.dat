40|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{repetitive}} finger movement performance {{in people with}} Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be rate dependent. When performing acoustically cued repetitive finger movements at rates near to and above 2 Hz, they exhibit increased movement rate, reduced <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude,</b> and loss of phase accompanied by frequent hesitations. The relationship between this movement deficit and functional fine motor tasks in people with PD is unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine if people with PD who demonstrate repetitive finger movement impairment at rates near to and above 2 Hz perform worse on a buttoning task and a Purdue pegboard task compared to those that do not demonstrate repetitive finger movement impairment at rates near to and above 2 Hz. Forty-eight participants with PD completed an acoustically cued repetitive finger movement task, incrementing from a rate of 1 Hz to 3 Hz in 0. 25 Hz. Movement rate and <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude</b> was compared to participants’ performance at 1 Hz and 1. 25 Hz, respectively. Participants with PD were divided into groups based upon changes in movement rate and <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude</b> at rates near to and above 2 Hz. Participants also completed a buttoning and Purdue pegboard assembly task. Buttoning and Purdue pegboard performance was compared between groups. For movement rate, there were no significant differences between the fast rate group (moved faster than the tone at rates near to and above 2 Hz) and the normal group (those that were within 2 SD of the tone rate) on the buttoning and Purdue Pegboard tasks. Similarly, there were no significant differences between subgroups for <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude</b> alone on the functional tasks. This study demonstrated that changes in movement rate and <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude</b> during the performance of repetitive finger movement at rates near to and above 2 Hz have differential relationships to performance of functional fine motor tasks in persons with PD. Consideration and evaluation of both movement rate and <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude,</b> separately, may have clinical applications in the treatment of people with PD...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{functional}} integration between the jaw and neck regions with head extension-flexion movements during jaw-opening/closing tasks. We recently reported that trigeminal nociceptive input by injection of hypertonic saline into the masseter muscle altered this integrated jaw-neck function during jaw-opening/closing tasks. Thus, in jaw-opening to a predefined position, the head-neck component increased during pain. Previous {{studies have indicated}} that muscle spindle stimulation by vibration of the masseter muscle may influence jaw <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> but the possible effect on the integrated jaw-neck function is unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of masseter muscle vibration on jaw-head movements during a continuous jaw-opening/closing task to a target position. Sixteen healthy men performed two trials without vibration (Control) and two trials with bilateral masseter muscle vibration (Vibration). Movements of the mandible and the head were registered with a wireless three-dimensional optoelectronic recording system. Differences in jaw-opening and head <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> between Control and Vibration, as well as achievement of the predefined jaw-opening target position, were analysed with Wilcoxon's matched pairs test. No significant group effects from vibration were found for jaw or head <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> or in the achievement of the target jaw-opening position. A covariation between the jaw and head <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> was observed. The results imply a high stability for the jaw motor system in a target jaw-opening task and that this task was achieved with the head-neck and jaw working as an integrated system...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Rocking {{movements}} {{appear to}} influence sleep and studies suggests a facilitated transition from wake to sleep due to lateral rocking movements. In {{a recent study}} of our lab, investigating the effect of different movement directions on relaxation and their potential to promote sleep, an increase in respiration frequency was found. Respiration was increased in all conditions with movement, reaching values close to the movement frequency. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of different <b>movement</b> frequencies and <b>amplitudes</b> on respiration. Furthermore, it was of interest whether subjects also adapt their respiration to movement frequencies below their spontaneous respiration frequency. Methods. 21 subjects (24 – 42 years, 12 male) were measured using an actuated bed, moving along a lateral translation. Following movement frequencies were applied: + 30 %, + 15 %, − 15 %, and − 30 % of subject’s resting respiration frequency during baseline (no movement). Furthermore, two different <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> were tested. Respiration frequency was measured with a thermistor flow sensor as well as with a respiration belt. Results. An increase in respiration frequency compared to baseline was found for all <b>movement</b> frequencies and <b>amplitudes.</b> No differences between the different movement frequencies as well as between the two different <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> were observed. Conclusion. Movements along a lateral translation induced an increase in respiration frequency. This increase appeared to be independent of the applied <b>movement</b> frequencies or <b>amplitudes.</b> Furthermore, no synchronization of the respiration frequency to the movement frequency was observed. In particular, subjects did not lower their respiration frequency below their resting frequency...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} is a {{comparative study of}} native signers, fluent signers and student signers on tasks designed to elicit a variety of rhythmic measures. Three groups of seven subjects each signed isolated lexical items, phrases and paragraphs under different rate conditions yielding measures of duration, <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude</b> and velocity from which rhythmic structure could be studied. ^ The native, fluent and student signing groups performed differently from one another {{on a number of}} measures, including: rate of signing, frequency and duration of pauses, <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude,</b> velocity and numbers of self corrections. When marking the ends of phrases, native signers produced signs that were significantly longer, larger and with greater velocity than the two non-native signing groups. Native signers altered their rate of signing by changing the duration and <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude</b> of the lexical items and transitions between signs. Non-native signers made the greatest change in transition duration resulting in a choppy, segmented appearance rather than a smooth flow from one sign to the next. Native signers produced signs in isolation that were different from those same signs produced in context, a behavior that the non-native signing groups did not exhibit. ^ Perceptually, the three groups were viewed as distinctly different from one another. Additionally, they were perceived to be signing at different rates, as was their intention. ^ Implications for ASL second language learning are discussed. ...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate possible sex-related differences in integrated jaw-neck movements following experimental masseter muscle pain. We evaluated head-neck and jaw movements in 22 healthy women and 16 healthy men in a jaw opening-closing task.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the hypothesis that}} the basal ganglia (BG) are involved specifically in the planning of <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude</b> (or covariates). Although often advanced, based on observations that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients exhibit hypokinesia in the absence of significant directional errors, this hypothesis has been challenged by a recent alternative, that parkinsonian hypometria could be caused by dysfunction of on-line feedback loops. To re-evaluate this issue, we conducted two successive experiments. In the first experiment we assumed that if BG are involved in extent planning then PD patients (who exhibit a major dysfunction within the BG network) should exhibit a preserved ability to use a direction precue with respect to normals, but an impaired ability to use an amplitude precue. Results were compatible with this prediction. Because this evidence did not prove conclusively that the BG is involved in amplitude planning (functional deficits are not restricted to the BG network in PD), a second experiment was conducted using positron emission tomography (PET). We hypothesized that if the BG is important for planning <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude,</b> a task requiring increased amplitude planning should produce increased activation in the BG network. In agreement with this prediction, we observed enhanced activation of BG structures under a precue condition that emphasized extent planning in comparison with conditions that emphasized direction planning or no planning.

Adult females produced speech <b>movements</b> of equal <b>amplitude</b> and velocity to those of adult males. The children produced speech <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> equal to those of adults; but they had significant ly lower peak velocities of orofacial movement.

40|$|Augmented visual {{feedback}} (VF) may offer benefits {{similar to those}} of rhythmic external cues in alleviating some mobility-related difficulties in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, due to an impaired ability to reweigh sensory information under changing circumstances, subjects with PD may be rather vulnerable to incongruity of visual information. In the present study, we investigatedwhether VF is indeed effective in improving motor functioning in a weight-shifting task during upright stance, and whether subjects with PD are affected more by incongruent VF than healthy controls. Participants performed sideways swaying motions based on tracking of real-time and delayed VF – the first providing congruent, and hence more accurate, visual information than the latter. We analyzed center-of-pressure signals patterns for 28 individuals with PD and 16 healthy, age- and gender-matched controls by estimating task accuracy, movement pattern variability, and normalized <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude.</b> For conditions without feedback and with real-time feedback, subjects with PD performed lateral swaying motions with greater error (F(1, 42) = 12. 065, p =. 001) and with more variablemovement patterns than healthy controls (F(1, 24) = 113. 086, p <. 001). Error change scores revealed that patients with PD were nevertheless still able to use VF to improve tracking performance (t(24) = 2. 366, p =. 026).

The processing of movement direction is fundamental to efficiently reach the target object. Many neurophysiological studies reported neuronal populations selective for movement direction in many regions of the monkey brain. In my thesis, I investigated which areas in the human brain show directional selectivity. Moreover, I measured to what extent directional selective regions are sensitive to changes in other movement parameters, like the type of motor act and <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude.</b> In three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, participants were adapted to execute reaching movements in the adaptation direction. Occasionally, test trials were presented. Test trials differed from adaptation trials in movement direction only, or in movement direction as well as in another movement parameter (Experiment 1 and 2 : type of motor act; Experiment 3 : <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude).</b> By comparing the fMRI signal in conditions where only movement direction was manipulated with conditions where also other movement parameters changed, we were able to measure sensitivity of directionally tuned neuronal populations to these additional movement parameters. Multiple regions in the human visuomotor system showed selectivity for movement direction. This selectivity was modulated by the type of motor act to varying degrees, with the largest effect in M 1 and the smallest modulation in the parietal reach region. Moreover, directional selectivity was clearly sensitive also to changes in <b>movement</b> <b>amplitude.</b> These results extend the current knowledge on the representation of actions from monkey physiology to the human brain and furthermore may have important practical implications for restoring lost motor functions in tetraplagic patients. ...|$|E

Cyclical single-limb movements of the forearm and lower leg {{as well as their}} coordination, with the segments moving either in the same (isodirectional) or in different directions (nonisodirectional), were investigated under normal vision and blindfolded conditions. Findings revealed that stroke patients experienced difficulties with coordination of the limb segments on the ipsilesional side and this effect was more pronounced during nonisodirectional than during isodirectional coordination. In addition, cycle durations were larger and <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> shorter in stroke patients as compared to controls. Overall, the present findings clearly demonstrated motor control deficits in stroke patients on the so-called "unaffected side. " The availability of normal vision did not alleviate these deficits. Therefore, the more general implication of the present findings appears to be that interlimb coordination is a complex function, requiring the integrity of both hemispheres. Comparison of the left- and right-hemispheric stroke groups revealed that patients with a left-hemisphere lesion tended to be more variable in performing the more difficult nonisodirectional pattern than patients with a right-hemisphere lesion.

40|$|For centuries, rocking {{has been}} used to promote sleep in babies or toddlers. Recent {{research}} suggested that relaxation could play a role in facilitating the transition from waking to sleep during rocking. Breathing techniques are often used to promote relaxation. However, studies investigating head motions and body rotations showed that vestibular stimulation might elicit a vestibulo-respiratory response, leading to an increase in respiration frequency. An increase in respiration frequency would not be considered to promote relaxation in the first place. On the other hand, a coordination of respiration to rhythmic vestibular stimulation has been observed. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of different <b>movement</b> frequencies and <b>amplitudes</b> on respiration frequency. Furthermore, we tested whether subjects adapt their respiration to movement frequencies below their spontaneous respiration frequency at rest, which could be beneficial for relaxation. Twenty-one healthy subjects (24 - 42 years, 12 males) were investigated using an actuated bed, moving along a lateral translation. Following movement frequencies were applied: + 30 %, + 15 %, - 15 %, and - 30 % of subjects' rest respiration frequency during baseline (no movement). Furthermore, two different <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> were tested (Amplitudes: 15 cm, 7. 5 cm; movement frequency: 0. 3 Hz). In addition, five subjects (25 - 28 years, 2 males) were stimulated with their individual rest respiration frequency. Rocking movements along a lateral translation caused a vestibulo-respiratory adaptation leading to an increase in respiration frequency. The increase was independent of the applied <b>movement</b> frequencies or <b>amplitudes</b> but did not occur when stimulating with subjects' rest respiration frequency.

Our key insight is {{to regard the}} unfolding velocity profile of a pointing movement as a 2 -D stroke gesture and to use template matching to predict the endpoint based on prior observed movements. We call our technique kinematic template matching (KTM), which is simple to implement, user-adaptable, and kinematically expressive. In a study of 17 able-bodied participants evaluated over <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> ranging from 100 - 800 pixels, we found KTM to predict endpoints that were within 83 pixels of the true endpoint at 50 % {{of the way through}} the movement, within 48 pixels at 75 %, and within 39 pixels at 90 %, using 1000 templates per participant. These accuracies make KTM as successful an approach to endpoint prediction as any prior technique, while being easier to implement and understand than most.

40|$|Using {{spatially}} identical displays (variants of the Müller–Lyer illusion), {{we compared}} the accuracy of spatial verbal judgments with that of saccadic (eye) and pointing (hand) movements. Verbal judgments showed a clear effect of the illusion. The amplitude of the primary saccade from one endpoint of the pattern (at fixation) to the other also showed an effect of the illusion. Conversely, <b>movement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> when pointing from one endpoint (initial finger position) to the other were significantly more accurate than both saccades and verbal responses. In a control experiment in which the viewing conditions between the saccade and pointing experiments were equalized, saccade amplitude was again affected by the illusion. In several studies, systematic biases in conscious spatial judgments have been contrasted with accurate open-loop pointing in peripersonal space. It has been proposed that such seeming dissociations between vision- for-action and vision-for-consciousness might in fact be because of a simple oculomotor strategy: saccade to the target before it disappears, then use the efference copy of the (accurate) saccadic movement to drive pointing. The present data {{do not support the}} hypothesis in this simple form...|$|R
