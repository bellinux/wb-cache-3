Presque Isle Park is Marquette's most popular park located {{on the north side of}} the city. It includes [...] of mostly forested land and juts out into Lake Superior. The park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, noted for designing Central Park in New York City.

McCarty's Cove, flanked by the red U.S. Coast Guard Station lighthouse on its south shore, serves as a reprieve from hot summer days, where city and county residents alike take advantage of the cool, but tolerable, water temperatures and the cooling effects of the lake-generated sea breeze. Both beaches have picnic areas, grills, children's playgrounds and lifeguard stands.

60|$|It was a {{dense and}} damp spruce and fir wood {{in which we}} lay, and, except for our fire, {{perfectly}} dark; and when I awoke in the night, I either heard an owl from deeper in the forest behind us, or a loon from a distance over the lake. Getting up some time after midnight to collect the scattered brands together, while my companions were sound asleep, I observed, partly in the fire, which had ceased to blaze, a perfectly regular elliptical ring of light, about five inches in its shortest diameter, six or seven in its longer, and from one eighth to one {{quarter of an inch}} wide. It was fully as bright as the fire, but not reddish or scarlet like a coal, but a white and slumbering light, like the glowworm's. I saw at once that it must be phosphorescent wood, which I had often heard of, but never chanced to see. Putting my finger on it, with a little hesitation, I found that it was a piece of dead <b>moosewood</b> which the Indian had cut off in a slanting direction the evening before.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Moosewood</b> Restaurant is a {{restaurant}} that was founded by Therese Tischler, Judy Barringer, Kris Miller, Josh Katzen and others in 1973 in downtown Ithaca, New York. <b>Moosewood</b> {{is located on the}} first floor of the Dewitt Mall building, which is a converted high school. When The Seed Company (a bookstore cafe) closed, the owners gave Therese Tischler the money they had left saying, [...] "We're giving this ($1200) to you because we know you'll find something good to do with it." [...] Therese had been politically active as a student at Cornell and was very concerned with ecology and the health of people and the planet. The work of Frances Moore Lapp√© and Adelle Davis formed part of her inspiration. She wanted to open a vegetarian restaurant and went to Judy Barringer and Kris Miller with the idea. About a year later <b>Moosewood</b> opened its doors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Moosewood</b> Sandhills -One of Lilburn's earlier works, <b>Moosewood</b> Sandhills is a {{collection}} of poetry that intuits a strong sense of locality that is both metaphysical and physical. With due reference to his prairie birthplace, Saskatchewan, Lilburn struggles to find a connection with the desolate world that surrounds him. In an interview with Peter Gzowski on Morningside, Lilburn reveals that he found the sandhills [...] "initially repellent, and too sparse, and yielding," [...] but that the place [...] "completely claimed my imagination, claimed my vision, claimed my love". Lilburn's poetry in <b>Moosewood</b> Sandhills seemingly becomes intertwined with Robert Frost's iconic image of the deer amongst nature, but Lilburn separates himself from Frost's work by taking observance from a different perspective. In Lilburn's poems, lying down seems to encourage kinds of patience and contact unlike those found through that favourite, more familiar activity of nature poets, walking.|$|E

Lilburn's writing discusses the strangeness of the inhabitants of the riverscape and contrasts it with his acute familiarity with his local surroundings: willow, geese, river ice, coyote and snowberry.|$|E

50|$|<b>Moosewood</b> is an {{understory}} tree of cool, moist forests, often preferring slopes. It {{is among}} the most shade-tolerant of deciduous trees, capable of germinating and persisting for years as a small understory shrub, then growing rapidly to its full height when a gap opens up. However, it does not grow high enough to become a canopy tree, and once the gap above it closes through succession, it responds by flowering and fruiting profusely, and to some degree spreading by vegetative reproduction.|$|E

5000|$|Dirca is a genus {{of three}} or four species of {{flowering}} plants in the family Thymelaeaceae, native to North America. The genus is named after Dirce in Greek mythology. The general common name for this deciduous shrub is leatherwood; other names include <b>moosewood,</b> ropebark and Powhatan-derived wicopy. The stems of Dirca are exceptionally pliable and the bark is difficult to tear by hand; for this reason, its stems were used by Native Americans in eastern North America as thongs or ropes. Members of the genus can grow to a maximum height of about three meters, and are often associated with rich, moist woods or slopes above creeks or streams.|$|E

The second, The Vegetable Dishes I Can't Live Without, came out in 2007 and returned to Katzen's original hand-written style after years of more conventionally designed books such as Still Life with Menu and Pretend Soup.|$|E

5000|$|Ithaca High School {{was founded}} in 1875 as the {{successor}} to the Ithaca Academy, a private school that had operated since the 1820s.

[...] A new building for the high school {{on the site of}} the former academy was built in 1885; that building burned on February 14, 1912.

That building was later used as DeWitt Junior High school for a number of years and then saved from demolition by local architect William Downing. Downing converted the building into an eclectic collection of shops, offices, studios, apartments, and restaurants known as the Dewitt Mall. The nationally renowned <b>Moosewood</b> Restaurant is also in the mall.|$|E
