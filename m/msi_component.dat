50|$|The {{engineers}} {{who designed the}} Fairchild F8 Microcomputer did so mindful {{of a set of}} goals. The computer needed to be electrically frugal. It needed characteristics that permitted easy interface to standard SSI and <b>MSI</b> <b>components.</b> It needed a moderate instruction set. It needed to be easy to incorporate into a design. The design needed to put the maximum number of computer components and circuits into the LSI components to minimize the package count. This approach reduced the time spent on designing support logic circuits.|$|R
40|$|A special {{processor}} {{was designed}} {{to function as a}} Reed Solomon decoder with throughput data rate in the Mhz range. This data rate is significantly greater than is possible with conventional digital architectures. To achieve this rate, the processor design includes sequential, pipelined, distributed, and parallel processing. The processor was designed using a high level language register transfer language. The RTL can be used to describe how the different processes are implemented by the hardware. One problem of special interest was the development of dependent processes which are analogous to software subroutines. For greater flexibility, the RTL control structure was implemented in ROM. The special purpose hardware required approximately 1000 SSI and <b>MSI</b> <b>components.</b> The data rate throughput is 2. 5 megabits/second. This data rate is achieved through the use of pipelined and distributed processing. This data rate can be compared with 800 kilobits/second in a recently proposed very large scale integration design of a Reed Solomon encoder...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design goals, micro-architecture, {{and implementation of}} the microprogrammed processor for a compact high performance personal com-puter. This computer supports a range of high level lang-uage environments and high bandwidth I/O devices. Besides the processor, it has a cache, a memory map, main storage, and an instruction fetch unit; these are described in other papers. The processor can be shared among 16 microcoded tasks, performing microcode context switches on demand with essentially no overhead. Conditional branches are done without any Iookahead or delay. Micro-instructions are fairly tightly encoded, and use an interes-ting variant on control field sharing. The processor imple-ments a large number of internal registers, hardware stacks, a cyclic shifter/masker, and an arithmetic/logic unit, together with external data paths for instruction fetching, memory interface, and t/O, in a compact, pipe-lined organization. The machine has a 50 ns microcycle, and can execute a simple macroinstruction in one cycle; the available 1 /O bandwidth is 640 Mhits/sec. The entire machine, including disk, display and network interfaces, is implemented with approximately 3000 <b>MSI</b> <b>components,</b> mostly ECL 10 K; the processor is about 35 % of this. In addition there are up to 4 storage modules, each with about 300 16 K or 64 K RAMS and 200 MS! components, for a total of 8 Mbytes. Several prototypes are currently running. 1...|$|R

50|$|Thunderbolt 3 was {{introduced}} in late 2015, with several motherboard manufacturers and OEM laptop manufacturers including Thunderbolt 3 with their products. Gigabyte and <b>MSI,</b> large computer <b>component</b> manufacturers, enter the market {{for the first time}} with Thunderbolt 3 compatible components. Dell was the first to include Thunderbolt 3 ports in laptops with their XPS Series and their Dell Alienware range. Although Thunderbolt has had poor hardware support outside of Apple devices and has been relegated to a niche gadget port, the adoption of the Thunderbolt 3 using USB-C connector standard into a wide array of hardware bodes well for market acceptance of the standard.|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of the Automatic Telephone Dialling System is to detect any sort of alarm such as fire, equipment failure, burglary. It then has to transmit the alarm information over the switched telephone network to a Control Station, where the alarm information is displayed. The attending personnel can then take the appropriate action. The Dialling system designed and constructed in this thesis consists of two parts: the Alarm Unit and the Control Station. As soon as an alarm occurs, the Alarm Unit selects the first available telephone number of the Control Station and dials the number. Using Frequency Shift Keying method, the Alarm Unit transmits the information identifying itself and the alarm to the Control Station. Initiate and Acknowledge Signalling as well as error checking ensure correct data transmission. Data re-transmissions and rediallings take place until successful transmission is acknowledged. A micro-program rather than a hardwired control logic is used in each the Alarm Unit and the Control Station for controlling their operations. The Central Processing Unit has been designed using <b>MSI</b> <b>components.</b> A microprocessor was not used because, {{at the time of}} the commencement of the project, its cost was high. Nevertheless the design was microprocessor - oriented, so that a microprocessor can be adopted in the future. A prototype was implemented using CMOS technology. This offers the advantages of lower power dissipation and higher noise immunity when compared with existing technologies such as TTL. Automatic gain control amplifiers and filters are used in the system to compensate for transmission line losses and reduce noise influence on information reception. Provision has been made so that, if a number of alarms occur at the same time at the Alarm Unit, they will be transmitted sequentially. At the Control Station, apart from displaying current alarm, memory space is provided for queueing the received alarms. System testing can be carried out at the push of a button from either the Alarm Unit or the Control Station. The test routine involves the same sequence of operations as in the case of an alarm, thus enhancing the thoroughness of the test. The system is expandable to any desired number of Alarm Units and Control Stations. With a system of this type, if one Control Station is busy, an a Alarm Unit can be programmed to attempt communicating with another Control Station...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the DELTIC DFPCC serial mode signal processor is discussed. The processor is designed to detect {{in the presence of}} background noise a signal coded into the zero crossings of the waveform. The unique features of the DELTIC DFPCC include versatility in handling a variety of signals and relative simplicity in implementation. A theoretical performance model is presented which predicts the expected value of the output signal {{as a function of the}} input signal to noise ratio. Experimental results obtained with the prototype system, which was breadboarded with LSI, <b>MSI</b> and SSI <b>components,</b> are given. The device was compared with other LSI schemes for signal processing and it was concluded that the DELTIC DFPCC is simpler and in some cases more versatile than other systems. With established LSI technology, low frequency systems applicable to sonar and similar problems are feasible...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Histogram generation, a standard image processing operation, {{is a record}} of the intensity distribution in the image. Histogram generation has straight forward implementations on digital computers using high level languages. A prototype of an optical-electronic histogram generator has been designed and tested for 1 -D objects using wirewrapped <b>MSI</b> TTL <b>components.</b> The system has shown to be fairly modular in design. The aspects of the extension to two dimensions and the VLSI implementation of this design are discussed. In this paper, we report a VLSI design to be used in a two-dimensional real-time histogram generation scheme. The overall system design is such that the electronic signal obtained from the optically scanned two-dimensional semi- opaque image is processed and displayed within a period of one cycle of the scanning process. Specifically, in the VLSI implementation of the two- dimensional histogram generator, modifications were made to the original design. For the two-dimensional application, the output controller was analyzed as a finite state machine. The process used to describe the required timing signals and translate them to a VLSI finite state machine using Computer Aided Design Tools is discussed. In addition, the circuitry for sampling, binning, and display have been combined with the timing circuitry on one IC. In the original design, the pulse width of the electronically sampled photodetector is limited with an analog one-shot. The high sampling rates associated with the extension to two dimensions requires significant reduction in the original 1 -D prototype's sample pulse width of approximately 75 ns.

40|$|We {{report on}} the first {{metallicity}} determination for gas in the Magellanic Stream, using archival HST GHRS data for the background targets Fairall 9, III Zw 2, and NGC 7469. For Fairall 9, using two subsequent HST revisits and new Parkes Multibeam Narrowband observations, we have unequivocally detected the <b>MSI</b> HI <b>component</b> of the Stream (near its head) in SII 1250, 1253 yielding a metallicity of [SII/H]=- 0. 55 +/- 0. 06 (r) +/- 0. 2 (s), consistent with either an SMC or LMC origin and with the earlier upper limit set by Lu et al. (1994). We also detect the saturated SiII 1260 line, but set only a lower limit of [SiII/H]>- 1. 5. We present serendipitous detections of the Stream, seen in MgII 2796, 2803 absorption with column densities of (0. 5 - 1) x 10 ^ 13 cm^- 2 toward the Seyfert galaxies III Zw 2 and NGC 7469. These latter sightlines probe gas near {{the tip of the}} Stream (80 deg down-Stream of Fairall 9). For III Zw 2, the lack of an accurate HI column density and the uncertain MgIII ionization correction limits the degree to which we can constrain [Mg/H]; a lower limit of [MgII/HI]>- 1. 3 was found. For NGC 7469, an accurate HI column density determination exists, but the extant FOS spectrum limits the quality of the MgII column density determination, and we conclude that [MgII/HI]>- 1. 5. Ionization corrections associated with MgIII and HII suggest that the corresponding [Mg/H] may range lower by 0. 3 - 1. 0 dex. However, an upward revision of 0. 5 - 1. 0 dex would be expected under the assumption that the Stream exhibits a dust depletion pattern similar to that seen in the Magellanic Clouds. Remaining uncertainties do not allow us to differentiate between an LMC versus SMC origin to the Stream gas.

40|$|PTEN on 10 q 23. 3 encodes a dual-specificity {{phosphatase}} that negatively {{regulates the}} phosphoinositol- 3 -kinase/Akt pathway and mediates cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Germline PTEN mutations cause Cowden syndrome {{and a range}} of several different hamartoma-tumor syndromes. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome is characterized by germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes and by microsatellite instability (<b>MSI)</b> in <b>component</b> tumors. Although both colorectal carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma are the most frequent component cancers in HNPCC, only endometrial cancer {{has been shown to be}} a minor component of Cowden syndrome. We have demonstrated that somatic inactivation of PTEN is involved in both sporadic endometrial cancers and HNPCC-related endometrial cancers but with different mutational spectra and different relationships to MSI. In the current study, we sought to determine the relationship of PTEN mutation, 10 q 23 loss of heterozygosity, PTEN expression, and MSI status in colorectal cancers (CRCs). Among 11 HNPCC CRCs, 32 MSI+ sporadic cancers, and 39 MSI− tumors, loss of heterozygosity at 10 q 23. 3 was found in 0 %, 8 %, and 19 %, respectively. Somatic mutations were found in 18 % (2 of 11) of the HNPCC CRCs and 13 % (4 of 32) of the MSI+ sporadic tumors, but not in MSI− cancers (P = 0. 015). All somatic mutations occurred in the two 6 (A) coding mononucleotide tracts in PTEN, suggestive of the etiological role of the deficient MMR. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed 31 % (14 of 45) of the HNPCC CRCs and 41 % (9 of 22) of the MSI+ sporadic tumors with absent or depressed PTEN expression. Approximately 17 % (4 of 23) of the MSI− CRCs had decreased PTEN expression, and no MSI− tumor had complete loss of PTEN expression. Among the five HNPCC or MSI+ sporadic CRCs carrying frameshift somatic mutations with immunohistochemistry data, three had lost all PTEN expression, one showed weak PTEN expression levels, and one had mixed tumor cell populations with weak and moderate expression levels. These results suggest that PTEN frameshift mutations in HNPCC and sporadic MSI+ tumors are a consequence of mismatch repair deficiency. Further, hemizygous deletions in MSI− CRCs lead to loss or reduction of PTEN protein levels and contribute to tumor progression. Finally, our data also suggest that epigenetic inactivation of PTEN, including differential subcellular compartmentalization, occurs in CRCs...|$|R
