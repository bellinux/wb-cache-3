5|$|The true {{impact of}} Operation <b>Mincemeat</b> is unknown, {{although}} {{the island was}} liberated more quickly than anticipated and losses were lower than predicted. The events were depicted in Operation Heartbreak, a 1950 novel by the former cabinet minister Duff Cooper, before one of the agents who planned and carried out <b>Mincemeat,</b> Ewen Montagu, wrote a history in 1953. Montagu's work {{formed the basis for}} a 1956 film.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{selected}} the code name <b>Mincemeat</b> {{from a list}} of centrally held available possibilities. On 4 February 1943 Montagu and Cholmondeley filed their plan for the operation with the Twenty Committee; it was a re-working of Cholmondeley's Trojan Horse plan. The <b>Mincemeat</b> plan was to place documents on the corpse, and then float it off the coast of Spain, whose nominally neutral government was known to cooperate with the , the German military intelligence organisation. The plan was passed by the committee, who passed it up the chain of command to the senior Allied strategists; Montagu and Cholmondeley were ordered to continue with their preparations for the operation.|$|E
2500|$|Wingate {{participated in}} the {{planning}} for many deceptions, including Operation <b>Mincemeat's</b> sister, codenamed Brass for which he approved the letters planted on a fake corpse. [...] Three agent karens were dropped and turned by the Japanese, who thought they had new transmitters, but in fact were doubled by the Allied controller. Wingate was also involved in the cover plans for Operation Neptune, the cross channel phase of Operation Overlord. [...] Sir Frederick Morgan, the original planner of Operation Overlord, initially believed that no deception plan could successfully disguise Neptune, but Wingate convinced him to at least allow LCS to make an effort. After First Thoughts the ultimate decision was encapsulated in deception codenamed Jael.|$|R
5|$|Another Malta convoy (Operation Substance) was {{conducted}} in mid-July, heavily escorted by Force H and elements of the Home Fleet and another in early August (Operation Style), albeit with only Force H covering the convoy. Several weeks later, Fury participated in Operation <b>Mincemeat,</b> during which Force H escorted a minelayer to Livorno to lay its mines while Ark Royals aircraft attacked Northern Sardinia as a diversion. In late September, the destroyer escorted another convoy to Malta in Operation Halberd.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{are also}} used in savoury cooking because their {{astringency}} creates added flavour in many sauces, meat and other dishes and they are included in some unusual combinations of foods. They {{can be added to}} tomato and mint to make a salad, used to accompany roast or grilled lamb, used to accompany seafood and shellfish, used as a dipping sauce at barbecues, blended with mayonnaise, used to invigorate bananas and other tropical fruits, combined with dark chocolate or added to <b>mincemeat</b> in traditional mince pies at Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Most major belligerents {{attempted}} {{to solve the}} problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine. Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception, which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations <b>Mincemeat</b> and Bodyguard. Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the wider}} Operation Barclay, <b>Mincemeat</b> {{was based on the}} 1939 Trout memo, written by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of the Naval Intelligence Division, and his {{personal}} assistant, Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming. With the approval of the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the plan began with transporting the body to the southern coast of Spain by submarine, and releasing it close to shore. It was picked up the following morning by a Spanish fisherman. The nominally neutral Spanish government shared copies of the documents with the , the German military intelligence organisation, before returning the originals to the British. Forensic examination showed they had been read, and decrypts of German messages showed the Germans fell for the ruse. Reinforcements were shifted to Greece and Sardinia both before and during the invasion of Sicily; Sicily received none.|$|E

25|$|Spain unknowingly {{played an}} {{important}} role in the invasion of Sicily through Operation <b>Mincemeat,</b> where a corpse with the fabricated identity of a British intelligence officer was purposefully washed ashore with false allied documents hinting to an invasion of Sardinia. Spanish officials handed these papers over to German intelligence officials, who in turn placed an emphasis on troop placement and defense in Sardinia rather than the true target of allied invasion, Sicily.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September 1943, Lanz assumed {{command of}} the newly formed (on 20 August) XXII Mountain Corps in Epirus, Greece. The Germans feared an Allied landing in Greece (a belief {{reinforced}} by British disinformation measures like Operation <b>Mincemeat),</b> and were engaged in continuous anti-partisan sweeps, during which several hundred villages were evacuated and often torched. Collective punishment of entire localities for guerrilla attacks was common, with directives to execute 50 to 100 hostages for each German casualty; only four days before Lanz assumed command, men of the 98th Regiment of 1st Mountain Division under Lieutenant-Colonel Josef Salminger, an ardent Nazi, had executed 317 civilians {{in the village of}} Kommeno.|$|E

Dumped {{back at the}} farmhouse, the family sees tomacco-addicted animals from other farms eating their crops. With only one plant left, the family runs into the house, where Lisa urges Homer to destroy it, but Homer refuses until the livestock breaks in.

Homer does and is shot in the arm, but declines to go to the hospital until after eating one of Marge's <b>mincemeat</b> pies.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} historian Jon Latimer {{observes that}} the relative {{ease with which}} the allies captured Sicily was not entirely because of <b>Mincemeat,</b> or the wider deception of Operation Barclay. Latimer identifies other factors, including Hitler's distrust of the Italians, and his unwillingness to risk German troops alongside Italian troops {{who may have been}} on the point of a general surrender. The military historian Michael Howard, while describing <b>Mincemeat</b> as [...] "perhaps the most successful single deception operation of the entire war", considered <b>Mincemeat</b> and Barclay to have less impact on the course of the Sicily campaign than Hitler's [...] "congenital obsession with the Balkans". Macintyre writes that the exact impact of <b>Mincemeat</b> is impossible to calculate. Although the British had expected 10,000 killed or wounded {{in the first week of}} fighting, only a seventh of that number became casualties; the navy expected 300 ships would be sunk in the action, but they lost 12. The predicted 90-day campaign was over in 38.|$|E
500|$|A 1956 {{episode of}} The Goon Show, {{entitled}} [...] "The Man who Never Was", was set during the Second World War, {{and referred to}} a microfilm washed up on a beach inside a German boot. The play Operation <b>Mincemeat,</b> written by Adrian Jackson and Farhana Sheikh, was first staged by the Cardboard Citizens theatre company in 2001. The work focused on Michael's homelessness.

500|$|Montagu was {{appointed}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944 {{for his part}} in Operation Mincemeat; for masterminding the plan, Cholmondeley {{was appointed}} a Member of the Order in 1948. Duff Cooper, a former cabinet minister who had been briefed on the operation in March 1943, published the spy novel Operation Heartbreak (1950), which contained the plot device of a corpse – with papers naming him as William Maryngton – being floated off the coast of Spain with false documents to deceive the Germans. The British security services decided that the best response was to publish the story of <b>Mincemeat.</b> Over the course of a weekend Montagu wrote The Man Who Never Was (1953), which sold two million copies and formed the basis for a 1956 film. The security services did not give Montagu complete freedom to reveal operational details, and he was careful not to mention the role played by signals intelligence to confirm that the operation had been successful. He was also careful to obscure [...] "the idea of an organised programme of strategic deception... with <b>Mincemeat</b> being presented as a 'wild' one-off caper". In 1977 Montagu published Beyond Top Secret U, his wartime autobiography which gave further details of <b>Mincemeat,</b> among other operations.|$|E
500|$|Another {{effect of}} Operation <b>Mincemeat</b> was that Germans became wary of deception.

500|$|Operation <b>Mincemeat</b> was a {{successful}} British disinformation strategy used during the Second World War. As a deception intended to cover the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily, two members of British intelligence obtained the body of Glyndwr Michael, a homeless man who died from eating rat poison, dressed him as {{an officer of the}} Royal Marines and placed personal items on him identifying him as Captain (Acting Major) William Martin.

As the plot proceeds readers see his struggle to remain loyal to the dictator {{in the face of the}} regime's increasingly horrific acts. Angel Face is faced with the challenge of reconciling his position of power among a terrorized people with his desire to fulfill a higher moral purpose. In the words of literary critic Richard Franklin, he [...] "struggles to affirm his absolute existence and to relate this to an authentic self".

500|$|On 29 September 1939, {{soon after}} the start of the war, Godfrey {{circulated}} a memorandum that, [...] "bore all the hallmarks of... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming", according to historian Ben Macintyre. It was called the Trout Memo and compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing. The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers to lure U-boats and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy; the suggestion is similar to Operation <b>Mincemeat,</b> the successful 1943 plan to conceal the intended invasion of Italy from North Africa, although that idea was developed by Charles Cholmondoley in October 1942. The recommendation in the Trout Memo was titled: [...] "A Suggestion (not a very nice one)", and continued: [...] "The following suggestion is used in a book by Basil Thomson: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed.

2500|$|The casting of Ali was a {{huge problem}} for Holland and Smith. During {{that time in the}} 80s only three Turkish-speaking actors could be located in London, and one of those was {{considered}} unsuitable. The other two, Haluk Bilginer and Nejdet Salih, were possibilities. Deciding which to cast caused major rows between Holland and Smith. Holland favoured Bilginer as he looked the part. He felt Salih did not have the physical presence needed and also believed that Sandy Ratcliff (the actress playing his on-screen wife) would [...] "make <b>mincemeat</b> out of him". Smith disagreed. As Salih was actually an East Londoner whose parents were Turkish Cypriots (whilst Bilginer was Turkish) she felt he would have actual knowledge to bring to the character and wouldn't have to act the part as [...] "he was the part". He also lived in the East End, as did his large family. To resolve the conflict both actors were given readings with Sandy Ratcliff and Salih eventually won the role following a cheeky, sexist remark aimed at Ratcliff and her tardy time-keeping. Both Holland and Smith felt this typified the character perfectly. Ironically, both actors eventually featured in the series, as Bilinger was brought back to take on the role of Ali's older brother.|$|E

2500|$|In 1962, Fo {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a variety show, Canzonissima, for RAI. Fo used the show to give Italians {{a glimpse of a}} type of television resembling the origins of theatre, far removed from the [...] "junk TV" [...] previously produced by the company. Canzonissima featured satirical songs and sketches depicting the lives of the working classes. However, it was frequently censored. One sketch featured a fat aunt who came to visit her nephew at his workplace (a canned meat factory) only to fall into a machine and come out as <b>mincemeat,</b> which the nephew retained in a cupboard at home and often displayed to friends: this led to complaints from canned meat producers and [...] "industrialists in general"—though none from aunts, Fo later observed. Nonetheless Canzonissima proved popular, attracting millions of viewers, and Rame maintained that taxi drivers in Italian cities would often say they had no work during broadcasts as everyone was watching it. Its eighth episodewhich referenced the dangerous conditions faced by workers on building sitesled to a dispute with the programme's producers, and prompted Fo and Rame to walk out on 29 November 1962. RAI maintained it would not broadcast the sketch as it risked further inflaming the annoyance of building workers' unions at working conditions. National uproar ensued over this censorship, with headlines in the daily newspapers and questions in the Italian parliament. RAI sued Fo and Rame and destroyed all the Canzonissima recordings. The dispute led to the effective banning of Fo and Rame from Italian television for 14 years.|$|E
