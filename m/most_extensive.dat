5|$|The ribs {{are bound}} to the spine by {{flexible}} cartilage, which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While sperm whales are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signals decompression sickness in humans.

This damage may indicate that sperm whales are susceptible to decompression sickness, and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.|$|E
