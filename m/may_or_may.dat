5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected. Though {{this is not always}} the case, genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis.

5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not be commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E
