50|$|The Information Management Model (IMM) is a {{model of}} the process by which {{children}} decide to employ coping strategies to manage their identities. This model is based on Bandura's (1986) social-cognitive framework and Goffman's work on the management of identity. In situations where the child feels different, she or he may decide to <b>manage</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> that others know about him or her. Strategies include: disidentification with giftedness, trying to maintain a very low visibility (invisibility), or creating a high-visibility identity (playing a stereotypical role associated with giftedness). This range of strategies is called the Continuum of Visibility.|$|E

Coping strategies include: disidentification with giftedness, attempting to maintain a low visibility, or creating a high-visibility identity (playing a stereotypical role associated with giftedness).

50|$|The {{vision for}} MRP and MRPII was to {{centralize}} and integrate business {{information in a}} way that would facilitate decision making for production line managers and increase the efficiency of the production line overall. In the 1980s, manufacturers developed systems for calculating the resource requirements of a production run based on sales forecasts. In order to calculate the raw materials needed to produce products and to schedule the purchase of those materials along with the machine and labor time needed, production managers recognized that they would need to use computer and software technology to <b>manage</b> <b>the</b> <b>information.</b> Originally, manufacturing operations built custom software programs that ran on mainframes.|$|E

50|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, naval ships were {{starting}} to mount guns with over-the-horizon range. At these sorts of distances, spotters in the towers could not accurately estimate range by eye, leading to the introduction of ever more complex range finding systems. Additionally, the gunners could no longer directly spot the fall of their own shot, relying on the spotters to do this and relay this information to them. At the same time the speed of the ships was increasing, consistently breaking the 20 knot barrier en masse {{around the time of the}} introduction of the Dreadnought in 1906. Centralized fire control followed in order to <b>manage</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> flow and calculations, but calculating the firing proved to be very complex and error prone.|$|E

50|$|Clause 6.1.3 {{describes}} how an organization {{can respond to}} risks with a risk treatment plan; {{an important part of}} this is choosing appropriate controls. A very important change in the new version of ISO 27001 is that there is now no requirement to use the Annex A controls to <b>manage</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> security risks. The previous version insisted ("shall") that controls identified in the risk assessment to manage the risks must have been selected from Annex A. Thus almost every risk assessment ever completed under the old version of ISO 27001 used Annex A controls but an increasing number of risk assessments in the new version do not use Annex A as the control set. This enables the risk assessment to be simpler and much more meaningful to the organization and helps considerably with establishing a proper sense of ownership of both the risks and controls. This is the main reason for this change in the new version.|$|E
