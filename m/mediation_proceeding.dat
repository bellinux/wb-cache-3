40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the scarce {{diffusion}} of the ADR practice in Europe. Regarding the arbitration, the reason lies in {{the high costs of}} this procedure, while respect to the other out-of-Court procedures, like mediation, there is a large mistrust among lawyers, due to lack of training to cooperation and dialogue. Recently a EU Directive has pushed towards mediation in civil and commercial lawsuits, where cross-border cases are particularly complex due to different national laws and practical matters like costs or language. National legislators have used this occasion to introduce a general discipline of mediation, applicable to domestic disputes as well. So most lawyers are called to abandon their adversarial approach in order to prepare for a cooperative negotiation. The author examines the numerous aspects on which a lawyer can play his role in every step of a <b>mediation</b> <b>proceeding,</b> and bring the client to an amicable satisfactory settlement...|$|E
40|$|California law {{requires}} that all unsettled child custody cases must be referred to court sponsored mediation prior to any judicial hearing. 1 Parents meet in confidential session with a mediator 2 to develop a parenting plan allocating 1 Cal. Fam. Code Section 3170 states: If it appears {{on the face of}} a petition, application, or other pleading to obtain or modify a temporary or permanent custody or visitation order that custody, visitation, or both are contested, the court shall set the contested issues for mediation. 2 Cal. Fam. Code Section 3711 states: "Mediation proceedings pursuant to this chapter shall be held in private and shall be confidential". The effects of the rule of confidentiality are considered below. The reference to privacy is amplified by Cal. Fam. Code Section 3182, which states that the "mediator has authority to exclude counsel from participation in the mediation proceedings". As a matter of practice, the presence of attorneys at a <b>mediation</b> <b>proceeding</b> is extremely rare. All mediators, and most attorneys, prefer the parents to mediate the custody issues without their lawyers present. Mediators will only allow the attorneys to be present where the parents want them to be and will never allow an attorney to be present on behalf of one party unless all the parties are represented...|$|E

In typical phenomenological scenarios, SUSY breaking takes place in a hidden sector of particles without direct coupling...|$|R
40|$|The {{cathodic}} {{reduction of}} copper(II) is {{studied in the}} absence and {{in the presence of}} chloride ions (1 x 10 (- 3) {{less than or equal to}} c(Cl) less than or equal to 8 X 10 (- 3) M) in an electrolyte that is comparable to galvanic copper baths (2. 2 M H 2 SO 4 + 0. 3 M CuSO 4). Experiments conducted with the electrochemical quartz-microbalance, largely under conditions of cyclic voltammetry, demonstrate the formation and reduction of CuCl on the copper surface. A mechanism of Cu(II) reduction with intermediate formation of CuCl is postulated. Its rate is comparable to that of chloride-free Cu(II) reduction. The enhancement of the reduction current observed in the presence of chloride is proposed to result from the fact that the mechanism involving CuCl <b>mediation</b> <b>proceeds</b> in parallel with the chloride-free path...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s the five- to eleven-member people's {{mediation}} committees {{were elected}} by popular vote to two-year {{terms with the}} option of being reelected. Members served without pay and could be removed at any time by the electors for dereliction of duty. They were responsible for settling disputes, strengthening popular unity, promoting production and order, and conducting propaganda activities. Parties in dispute came voluntarily to the mediation committee; people seemed to feel they should try <b>mediation</b> before <b>proceeding</b> to a lawsuit. Mediators' duties ranged from acting as go-betweens for parties who {{refused to talk to}} one another to defining issues, deciding questions of fact, and issuing tentative or advisory decisions. Mediation committees also exerted strong political, economic, social, and moral pressures upon one or both parties to gain [...] "voluntary" [...] compliance with the decisions. In addition to mediation committees, other officials, police officers, party members, and work supervisors were expected to serve as mediators. Members of the residents' committees and small groups who were not members of the mediation committees were also involved in the mediation process.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} argue that {{mediation}} has been hitherto conceived in the construction industry, and indeed by practitioners in other related disciplines such as property management, as largely a ‘problem-solving’ mechanism. Whilst this is clearly an aim of mediation {{there is also the}} appended danger that the value of mediation is conceived in these terms alone. If this is the case, then its value, or success, is conceived very narrowly. The aim of this paper is, then, {{to argue that}} there are wider values to mediation in a construction setting. These values can be considered as a ‘family’ of related attitudes, skills and perceptions that can positively affect the persons involved. By affecting growth in individuals an organisational change may follow. This, in turn, can result in a significant cultural change in the industry, and associated professions as a whole, as well as having a positive impact on construction education. The paper begins by an overview of the development of <b>mediation</b> and <b>proceeds</b> to consider its current use of mediation in construction. It then considers the question of how mediation success is conceived. The paper argues that both the current practice of construction mediation {{and the way in which}} its success is measured are too narrow. It argues that a wider approach to construction mediation is required. Finally, drawing from the literature on ‘idealist’ mediation an account of mediation as a developmental process is developed...|$|R
40|$|Dispute {{is defined}} as “any {{contract}} question or controversy that must be settled beyond the jobsite management”. Most of the construction disputes related to the contractual matters. The {{aim of the research}} was to develop a framework as a strategy that could mitigate to the occurrences of contractual disputes in Sri Lankan construction industry. Literature synthesis aimed at adapt the nature of contractual disputes by establishing critical attributes of contractual disputes, causes of contractual disputes, strategies used to avoid contractual disputes, Alternative Dispute Resolution methods and attributes in ADR methods. The five Semi-structured interviews and thirty five detailed questionnaire surveys were aimed at detailed studying of practical situation in Sri Lankan contractual disputes, identifying the areas, causes, effects, avoidance strategies of contractual disputes and attribute in Alternative Dispute Resolution methods and behaviour of the attributes in ADR methods. The research findings revealed major areas of contractual disputes named as general causes, contractor and owner related causes. Major causes of contractual disputes are ambiguities in contract documents, delays in work progress, design errors and major effects identified as cost overruns, project delays and damage business relationships. Contract documentation, proper coordination between contract documents and proper contract administration are the major contractual dispute avoidance strategies. Furthermore, major attributes in ADR methods are identified as duration of the proceeding, obtaining fairness decision and binding of the decision. Further research findings are revealed that arbitration require highest duration of the <b>proceeding,</b> <b>mediation</b> provide the more fair decision and arbitration decision is more binding and enforceable...|$|R
40|$|A {{standard}} mood-induction procedure using film clips {{was used}} to induce happy, sad and neutral states. Positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) were used as indicators of mood to assess subsequent levels of authenticity, self-consciousness and life satisfaction. No {{significant differences were found}} between happy and neutral conditions relative to positive and negative affect and thus the mood manipulation failed to distinguish between happy and neutral states. PA was not significantly correlated with any of the measures. Possible explanations for the failure of PA are discussed. Two new scales to measure authenticity as a state were constructed, The State-Authenticity Questionnaire and the Visual State-Authenticity Scale, (VSAS) which were inspired from scales previously used in the research area (State-Authenticity Questionnaire and Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale). Mood was shown to predict authenticity over and above the effects of trait happiness for the VSAS scale but not the state-authenticity questionnaire. Authenticity was also found to mediate the relationship between mood and life-satisfaction, thus lower NA leads to higher authenticity which leads to higher life satisfaction. This was found for the two authenticity scales. The mediating relationship of private self-consciousness between mood and authenticity was also explored but because of an insignificant correlation between private self-consciousness and authenticity the <b>mediation</b> could not <b>proceed.</b> The results provide the foundations for future research as it is the first study to report authenticity as a mediator in the relationship between mood and life-satisfaction and the first study to induce authenticity as a state...|$|R
40|$|Dans cette étude, l'auteur montre comment l'intérêt public est engagé dans les {{relations}} du travail. Il expose dabord ce que l'on entend par « intérêt public ». Ensuite, il envisage comment doit se comporter le gouvernement dans les questions d'intérêt public. Public {{interest is}} at stake in labour-management relations. Government intervention, which has been denied by the upholders of « laissez-faire » economy, is commonly accepted in all countries. However, what is meant by « public interest », and the degree and the form of government intervention lead to discussions. PUBLIC INTERESTSociety as a whole is concerned with the establishment of labour-management relations in compliance with the fundamental rights of production agents and in the maintenance of public peace on one hand, and in the assurance of continuity in producing goods and services on the other. Public interest covers those two aspects at the same time. The first one consists in the existence and functioning of a convenient system of labour relations; the second one, in the possibility of satisfying the needs of the population. At the society level, the needs for goods and services {{do not have the same}} importance; therefore, they do not concern public interest in the same degree. Certain needs can only be satisfied by government initiative; the satisfaction of others being taken care of by private initiative. In a country, as ours, where everything is not nationalized, the proper services provided by the State are a very function of general interest, and it is presumed that those assumed by the State also concern very much public interest. However, we must remember that other services, although exploited by private enterprise, also affect public interest : this is the reason why they have been usually called « public services ». Therefore, in any attempt to saveguard public interest, it is not so much the quality of the employer in labour relations which is important but the character of the service which is exploited. In our labour-management relations system, collective bargaining is considered by all as being the most desirable means; it is an essential part of an economic system based on free enterprise, freedom of work, and freedom of association. Right at the beginning, it is admitted that divergent interests and viewpoints may exist, which are legitimate and may become conflictual. When the dispute cannot be solved through discussion, recourse is given to strike or lock-out in order to put a pressure on the other party. But a strike and lock-out lead to a stoppage in the production of a good or a service. The population or one part thereof is forced for a time to do away without that good or that service. Any production stoppage involves some drawbacks for a third party. In what situation and at what time does a strike really affect public interest? When is common good really in danger ? Is it possible to determine it in advance, without taking into account all concrete circumstances ?Public interest is a very difficult concept to define, as the concept of « good morals », « public order ». We have an insight of it, but to give a universally valuable and objective meaning is impossible. Public interest concept is essentially relative to time, places, to the state of civilization which a population is going through. Public interest is without a shadow of doubt the interest of public at large, but there are many publics and their interests are sometimes incongruent or do not always command the same degree of importance. What is the proper scope of public interest is very limited. It is what is called « an emergency case », for instances, when public health or security is threatened, when the welfare of a population risks of undergoing serious and irreparable damage. We are inclined to inflate the consequences of strikes and to call for immediate and radical governmental action, even when it is proven that those consequences do not present a threat to security and to the economy. Unconscious prejudices against strike utilization are easily hidden behind « reasons of common good », this one being not engaged as often as it is believed. Cyrus Ching, a man of experience, said : « A good case can be made for the statement that the nation has never really suffered seriously from a strike [...] . There have been few, if any, real national emergencies resulting from labour-management conflicts [...] . I can say, looking back on my own experience, pressure of that kind led me to refer matters to the President and we in the Federal <b>Mediation</b> Service <b>proceeded</b> on the basis that it was a national emergency. I confess that in regard to some of the instances there now is serious doubt in my mind as to the correctness of the label ». STATE INTERVENTIONThe legislative branch must at first establish behavior frameworks which will enable the parties involved in the field of labour relations to come to an understanding and bring their disputes to an end. The government cannot take an attitude of non-intervention when facing disputes in essential services and vital industries at the very critical moment when common good is really threatened. In those cases of general emergency situation, the decisions rendered by production agents are so intimately related to normal living conditions that they see their character changed into one of a political nature. Consequently, they fall into the scope of State action. Any kind of external intervention which can be relied on and anticipated by either party leads to hamstring and even to destroy collective bargaining, since an unavoidable tendency exists for the party which feels weaker at the dispute to seek support and help from government. A series of well-defined procedures on the part of government will tend to entice either party to evaluate the cost of the terms of a voluntary agreement in line with what it would probably get if it did not come to an understanding or if the government interfered. In labour relations, no panacea exists and it is impossible to get rid of all evils. Certain drawbacks must be accepted beforehand, which are the ransom of democracy and freedom. Totalitarian regimes undergo other evils that are worse. To withstand a work stoppage must be the opportunity for third parties to consider the constant benefits they draw from the usual collaboration between workers and management...|$|R
