Corroborating this text with the norms in article 937 paragraph (1) of the Civil Code and article 1273 paragraph (1) of the Civil Code it leads to the solution according to which article 1275 of the Civil Code regards only the cases where the transfer of successive property are of the same nature, the onerous primary act has not resulted in immediate transmission of real previous right of the document with the free subsidiary title and when the primal act is free, and the alternative is onerous.

Classical massage is a form of mechanotherapy that affects the regulation of the work of muscles, joints, tendons and ligaments. Aim of work: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of classical massage section of thoracolumbar spine to increase the mobility in these segments. Material: The study was carried out on 36 healthy volunteers (20 women and 16 men) aged 21 to 27 years old (average age - 23. 8) who were subjected to a series of five classical massages (according to strictly established protocol). In order to objectify the effects in all subjects before and after a series of treatments the following measurements were made: the fingers-floor test; the Otto -Wurna test; the straightening of the spine; lateral flexion of the spine; twist of the spine. Results A statistically important difference has been shown in the results of all tested variables before the first and after the last treatment of classical massage. Conclusions The results of personal research apply to young, healthy volunteers. It is worth to continue research into the effects of this form of therapy in the case of restrictions of <b>movable</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>property,</b> resulting from spinal pain syndromes...|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been argued that {{intellectual}} property is justified {{on a number of}} alternative bases. Economic, labour and spiritual theories have been advanced to justify propertising intellectual creations. The thesis of this article is that justifications used for <b>tangible</b> <b>property</b> cannot be used to support the propertising of intellectual property. Intellectual <b>property</b> differs to <b>tangible</b> <b>property</b> because <b>tangible</b> creations are physically scarce. Intellectual property does not suffer from the same scarcity problem because it makes use of a plentiful commodity in the form of information. Intellectual property becomes scarce because of artificial constraints which are imposed by a legal framework that restricts access to public dissemination and use of the intellectual work that is created. It is, therefore, argued that justifications used to support the propertising of <b>tangible</b> <b>property</b> cannot be used to justify the propertising of intangible creations. Instead, an explanation founded upon the creation and protection of investor value can be advanced to explain, but not justify, the enforcement of intellectual property rights as they currently exist...|$|R

However, some property, despite being physical in nature, is classified in many legal systems as intangible <b>property</b> rather than <b>tangible</b> <b>property</b> because the rights associated with the physical item are of far greater significance than the physical properties. Principally, these are documentary intangibles. For example, a promissory note is a piece of paper that can be touched, but the real significance is not the physical paper, but the legal rights which the paper confers, and hence the promissory note is defined by the legal debt rather than the physical attributes.|$|R
