5|$|In 2015, Barr {{revealed}} she {{has been}} diagnosed with both <b>macular</b> degeneration and glaucoma, and thus is gradually losing her eyesight and expects to eventually go blind; she is consuming medical marijuana to decrease her intraocular pressure that is a feature of these diseases.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to exploit RNA interference in therapy. Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful. Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of <b>macular</b> degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus. RNAi has also been shown to be effective in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the {{otic vesicle}} in turn form the vestibulocochlear nerve. These form bipolar neurons which supply {{sensation}} {{to parts of}} the inner ear (namely the sensory parts of the semicircular canals, <b>macular</b> of the utricle and saccule, and organ of Corti). The nerve begins to form around the 28th day.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} GWAS {{was published in}} 2005. It investigated patients with age-related <b>macular</b> degeneration and found two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency compared to healthy controls. , {{hundreds or thousands of}} individuals are tested in a typical GWA study, over 3,000 human GWA studies have examined over 1,800 diseases and traits, and thousands of SNP associations have been found.|$|E
5|$|Cats are obligate carnivores: their {{physiology}} {{has evolved}} to efficiently process meat, {{and they have}} difficulty digesting plant matter. In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein. Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine, with taurine deficiency causing <b>macular</b> degeneration, wherein the cat's retina slowly degenerates, causing irreversible blindness.|$|E
5|$|Fingolimod {{may give}} rise to {{hypertension}} and slowed heart rate, <b>macular</b> edema, elevated liver enzymes or a reduction in lymphocyte levels. Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development. Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While dimethyl fumarate {{may lead to a}} reduction in the white blood cell count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.|$|E
5|$|Luis Walter Alvarez {{was born}} in San Francisco on June 13, 1911, the second child and oldest son of Walter C. Alvarez, a physician, and his wife Harriet née Smyth, and a {{grandson}} of Luis F. Álvarez, a physician who lived {{for a time in}} Spain, then Cuba, and finally the United States, who found a better method for diagnosing <b>macular</b> leprosy. He had an older sister, Gladys, a younger brother, Bob, and a younger sister, Bernice. His aunt, Mabel Alvarez, was a California artist specializing in oil painting.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{reduction}} or deficiency {{can also}} be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically {{in the treatment of}} copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on copper ions. This is a promising avenue for investigation of treatments for cancer, age-related <b>macular</b> degeneration, and other diseases that involve a pathologic proliferation of blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|The first GWA study, {{conducted}} in 2005, compared 96 patients with age-related <b>macular</b> degeneration (ARMD) with 50 healthy controls. It identified two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency {{between the two}} groups. These SNPs were located in the gene encoding complement factor H, which was an unexpected finding in the research of ARMD. The findings from these first GWA studies have subsequently prompted further functional research towards therapeutical manipulation of the complement system in ARMD. Another landmark publication {{in the history of}} GWA studies was the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study, the largest GWA study ever conducted {{at the time of its}} publication in 2007. The WTCCC included 14,000 cases of seven common diseases (~2,000 individuals for each of coronary heart disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, bipolar disorder, and hypertension) and 3,000 shared controls. This study was successful in uncovering many new disease genes underlying these diseases.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{is being done}} on <b>macular</b> degeneration which could help prevent cases of micropsia. A variety of drugs that block vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are being evaluated as a treatment option. These treatments {{for the first time}} have produced actual improvements in vision, rather than simply delaying or arresting the continued loss of vision characteristic of <b>macular</b> degeneration. A number of surgical treatments are also being investigated for <b>macular</b> degeneration lesions that may not qualify for laser treatment, including <b>macular</b> translocation to a healthier area of the eye, displacement of submacular blood using gas, and removing membranes by surgery.|$|E
25|$|Knotts {{struggled}} with hypochondria and <b>macular</b> degeneration.|$|E
25|$|The Amsler {{grid test}} {{can be used}} to {{diagnose}} <b>macular</b> degeneration. For this test, patients are asked to look at a grid, and distortions or blank spots in the patient's central field of vision can be detected. A positive diagnosis of <b>macular</b> degeneration may account for a patient's micropsia.|$|E
25|$|A {{new study}} {{suggests}} that common cholesterol-reducing drugs may also prevent <b>macular</b> degeneration.|$|E
25|$|If <b>macular</b> edema is suspected, FFA and {{sometimes}} OCT may be performed.|$|E
25|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} {{often has}} no early warning signs. Even <b>macular</b> edema, {{which can cause}} rapid vision loss, may not have any warning signs for some time. In general, however, a person with <b>macular</b> edema {{is likely to have}} blurred vision, making it hard to do things like read or drive. In some cases, the vision will get better or worse during the day.|$|E
25|$|<b>Macular</b> {{degeneration}} typically produces micropsia due to {{the swelling}} or bulging of the macula, an oval-shaped yellow spot {{near the center of}} the retina in the human eye. The main factors leading to this disease are age, smoking, heredity, and obesity. Some studies show that consuming spinach or collard greens five times a week cuts the risk of <b>macular</b> degeneration by 43%.|$|E
25|$|A 'C' shaped {{area around}} the macula is treated with low {{intensity}} small burns. This helps in clearing the <b>macular</b> edema.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{have been}} approved to treat cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory diseases, <b>macular</b> degeneration, transplant rejection, multiple sclerosis and viral infection.|$|E
25|$|Japan {{begins a}} {{clinical}} trial of stem cells harvested from patients' own bodies. The stem cells {{will be used to}} treat age-related <b>macular</b> degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Management for ocular {{congenital}} rubella syndrome (CRS) {{is similar}} to that for age-related <b>macular</b> degeneration, including counseling, regular monitoring, and the provision of low vision devices, if required.|$|E
25|$|US and Swiss {{researchers}} {{develop a}} new form of telescopic contact lens designed to improve the vision of sufferers of age-related <b>macular</b> degeneration, which previously could not be ameliorated with contact lenses.|$|E
25|$|Phase I {{results of}} the first two {{therapeutic}} RNAi trials (indicated for age-related <b>macular</b> degeneration, aka AMD) reported at the end of 2005 that siRNAs are well tolerated and have suitable pharmacokinetic properties.|$|E
25|$|Systematic {{reviews of}} {{clinical}} trial results have shown {{there is no}} scientific evidence for effectiveness of ginkgo in treating high blood pressure, menopause-related cognitive decline, tinnitus, post-stroke recovery, peripheral arterial disease, <b>macular</b> degeneration, or altitude sickness.|$|E
25|$|Like most {{invasive}} surgical procedures, however, vitrectomy {{carries a}} risk of complications, including: retinal detachment, anterior vitreous detachment and <b>macular</b> edema – which can threaten vision or worsen existing floaters (in the case of retinal detachment).|$|E
25|$|Triamcinolone is a {{long acting}} steroid preparation. When {{injected}} in the vitreous cavity, it decreases the <b>macular</b> edema (thickening of the retina at the macula) caused due to diabetic maculopathy, and results {{in an increase in}} visual acuity. The effect of triamcinolone is transient, lasting up to three months, which necessitates repeated injections for maintaining the beneficial effect. Best results of intravitreal Triamcinolone have been found in eyes that have already undergone cataract surgery. Complications of intravitreal injection of triamcinolone include cataract, steroid-induced glaucoma and endophthalmitis. A systematic review found evidence that eyes treated with the intravitreal injection of triamcinolone had better visual acuity outcomes compared to eyes treated with <b>macular</b> laser grid photocoagulation, or sham injections.|$|E
25|$|A {{few studies}} {{have looked at the}} role of cystatin C or the CST3 gene in age-related <b>macular</b> degeneration. Cystatin C has also been {{investigated}} as a prognostic marker in several forms of cancer. Its role in pre-eclampsia remains to be confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Some people {{develop a}} {{condition}} called <b>macular</b> edema. It {{occurs when the}} damaged blood vessels leak fluid and lipids onto the macula, {{the part of the}} retina that lets us see detail. The fluid makes the macula swell, which blurs vision.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous or oral {{fluorescein}} {{is used in}} fluorescein angiography {{in research}} and to diagnose and categorize vascular disorders including retinal disease <b>macular</b> degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory intraocular conditions, and intraocular tumors. It is also being used increasingly during surgery for brain tumors.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, a {{retrospective}} analysis comparing the incidence of age-related <b>macular</b> degeneration (AMD) between patients taking vs. not taking L-DOPA found that the drug delayed onset of AMD by ~8 years. The authors state that significant effects were obtained for {{both dry and wet}} AMD.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{vigabatrin}} {{was shown}} by Frisén and Malmgren to cause irreversible diffuse atrophy of the retinal nerve fiber {{layer in a}} retrospective study of 25 patients. This has the most effect on the outer area (as opposed to the <b>macular,</b> or central area) of the retina.|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes for}} {{floaters}} include cystoid <b>macular</b> edema and asteroid hyalosis. The latter is an anomaly of the vitreous humour, whereby calcium clumps attach {{themselves to the}} collagen network. The bodies that are formed in this way move slightly with eye movement, but then return to their fixed position.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{photocoagulation}} {{can be used}} in two {{scenarios for}} the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. It can be used to treat <b>macular</b> edema by creating a Modified Grid at the posterior pole and it can be used for panretinal coagulation for controlling neovascularization. It is widely used for early stages of proliferative retinopathy.|$|E
25|$|In March 2017 a {{team led}} by Masayo Takahashi {{completed}} the first successfull transplant of iPS-derived retinal cells into the eye of a patient suffering from advanced <b>macular</b> degeneration. The benefits of using autologous iPSCs are that there is theoretically no risk of rejection and that it eliminates the need to use embryonic stem cells.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{responses}} to bites vary, ranging from no visible effect (in about 20–70%), to small <b>macular</b> spots, to prominent wheals and bullae formations along with intense itching that may last several days. The bites often {{occur in a}} line. A central hemorrhagic spot may also occur due {{to the release of}} anticoagulants in the saliva.|$|E
