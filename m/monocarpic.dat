40|$|This paper {{provides}} a thorough {{analysis of the}} current state of biodiversity of a model city in the Northern Pre-Azov region ofUkraine– Henichesk (Khersonregion). The species composition of the urban flora of this city is presented here for the first time. There are 507 species, which belong to two divisions, 61 families and 233 genera. The urban flora was analyzed in its systematic, biomorphological and environmental aspects. The species richness of families of the studied urban flora is characterized by a predominance of families which include 1 – 2 species. The majority of the urban flora species are herbaceous plants – 80. 1 % (406 species), including herbaceous <b>monocarpics</b> – 236 species and herbaceous polycarpics – 170. It was found that the ecological category with the largest number of species was therophytes l – 36. 1 % of species in the urban flora of Henichesk, the second place taken by hemicryptophytes – 31. 9 %. Other biological types are represented in a small quantity – 32. 0 %. An important characteristic of flora is distribution of species according to the main vegetation types (rythmologic groups). Summer green plants – 430 species (84. 8 %) are the dominant group in the researched urban flora. The plant community includes differentiated rosette, semirosette and rosetteless plants. Species with rosetteless shoot dominate. Rhizomeless species dominate in the flora of Henichesk (51. 1 %) and species with caudex (23. 6 %), indicating the dominance of xerophytic habitats and increased soil density in cities. In terms of moisture requirements, the largest environmental group is that which requires moderate moisture, accounting for 349 species (68. 8 % of the total species number). Heliophyllous, shade-tolerant species, and mezotrophs dominate. The adventive component of the Henichesk flora includes 217  species (159 genera and 52 families). Most of them are kenophytes, xenophytes, epecophytes. It was found that Henichesk has a specific urban flora that combines elements of natural flora and typical urban components...|$|R
