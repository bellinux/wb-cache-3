Slayer and Hoglan would play Dark Angel songs during soundchecks, which is how Hoglan eventually joined Dark Angel. Hoglan approached Dark Angel guitarist Jim Durkin: [...] "He came up to <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> and started giving me his criticisms of the band. He said we needed to be more evil. And then he goes, 'By the way, I'm a better drummer than the guy you have in Dark Angel right now.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to Carey signing {{her record}} deal with Columbia, she and Margulies had written and {{produced}} fourteen songs {{over a three-year}} period, seven of which made the final track listing of her self-titled debut studio album (1990), including [...] "Someday". [...] "Someday" [...] {{was one of the}} four songs which were on the demo tape handed to Mottola prior to her signing the contract. Carey explained the process behind the song's conception, saying that Margulies would play different notes on an electric keyboard with Carey directing him on chord changes, and provided the lyrics, chorus and melody. Producer Ric Wake later recalled that [...] "Someday" [...] was his favorite song from the beginning of recording sessions for the album, saying [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> and said 'I'd love to do it {{if you want to do}} it.'

500|$|When Carey {{worked with}} Walden on [...] "I Don't Wanna Cry", {{they worked on}} several other songs. Together, they decided to [...] "slow down the tempo" [...] and create a [...] "crying type of ballad," [...] one which {{according}} to him, featured a direct inspiration from gospel genres. After they completed the song, Lawrence noted {{how much of a}} perfectionist Carey was. He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct [...] "one line" [...] that troubled her. As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, [...] "Someday" [...] became Wake's favorite from the start, [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> and said 'I'd love to do it {{if you want to do}} it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me." [...] During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio. As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody. In [...] "All in Your Mind", Carey does a great vocal performance, doing staccatos up to F7. According to the artist, her voice [...] "split" [...] while doing those ornaments. While she thought to remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.|$|E

Since the song was really working at radio, our manager and label wanted us to also put it on our new album. We reluctantly agreed because we didn't want to blow any {{opportunities}} or ruin momentum for the band. It was a weird time. A friend of ours at the label called <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> and politely {{let me know that}} we were making a lot of mistakes with our career. We decided to fire our manager and try to get off of Victory Music.|$|E
2500|$|Connecticut Republican {{voters were}} displeased {{to learn of}} McMahon's {{donations}} to Emanuel, a highly partisan figure who helped orchestrate the Democratic shift in the House in 2006 and Barack Obama's presidential win. McMahon explained to voters that her donations to Emanuel were on behalf of Rahm's brother, Ari Emanuel, who had represented WWE in Hollywood since 1992. According to McMahon, in 2002, [...] "He (Ari) called <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> and he said, my brother is running for Congress in Illinois. It happened to be Rahm. I didn't know Rahm." [...] McMahon made more donations {{over the course of}} the next several years, including one check she wrote when Rahm Emanuel came to WWE headquarters to meet her. McMahon's spokesperson clarified that McMahon didn't know who Rahm Emanuel was in '02, but was aware of his partisan status in '06.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his last}} days, {{some of his}} new disciples began to preach him as God Almighty. I was afraid my meeting with such men would give rise to {{unpleasant}} discussions. So, I kept away. At last, when the news of his fast declining health was brought to <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> I left all work and went to Dakshineswar. I found him very low. That was before his removal to a more commodious house on the riverside for treatment. Ramkrishna took me to task for neglecting him. I pleaded guilty to the charge and made a clean breast of it by letting him know the exact causes, I smiled and said, “As there are many editions of a book so {{there have been many}} editions of God Almighty and your disciples are about to make you a new one.” He too smiled and said, “Just fancy, God Almighty dying of cancer in the throat.

And I was delighted because she was going out {{with the head of the}} studio. She could have been the biggest pain in the ass alive. And I would be in a terribly awkward position if she started with the limousines and the special means and whatever the hell it is—or complaining about whatever. But never a peep out of her. Most pleasant, most charming, very cooperative, very hard-working. She was always there half an hour before her call and she always stayed on for a half hour just in case. Interested in everything that went on, and was a total joy. I couldn't ask for a more cooperative actor." ...|$|E

We're going to Mars....But when?...More practically, we're going within 20 years. Some of you could be walking on Mars before you are forty years old. You just have to believe. Your...attitude...matters. You must believe in discovery and adventure.

2500|$|Prince Rogers Nelson {{was born}} on June 7, 1958 in Minneapolis, to Mattie Della (née Shaw; 1933–2002) and John Lewis Nelson (1916–2001). His parents were both African-American and his family ancestry is {{centered}} in Louisiana, with all four of his grandparents hailing from that state. Prince's father was a pianist and songwriter, {{and his mother was}} a jazz singer. Prince was given his father's stage name, Prince Rogers, which his father used while performing with a jazz group called the Prince Rogers Trio. In 1991, Prince's father told A Current Affair, [...] "I named my son Prince because I wanted him to do everything I wanted to do." [...] Prince's childhood nickname was Skipper.

2500|$|She {{then decided}} to {{coordinate}} with musician Vo Thien Thanh to release her third dance-oriented album with 3 CDs named Thiên đàng (Heaven), also the same name of her first live show in 2004. This album seemingly opened a heaven for her career. Although Thu Minh owned a great degree of artistic credibility before, her Thiên đàng album began to conquer professional dance-pop music in Vietnam. Her strong and unique voice was noticed, which soon gave her a leading position among Dance-pop singers. Vietnamese musical specialists and experts were impressed by the high artistic quality of Vietnamese hit dance-pop songs in this album such as [...] "Bóng mây qua thềm", [...] "Chuông gió"("Wind chime") and [...] "Ngày của tôi" [...] ("My day"). Along with new songs, she also achieved success performing completely different versions of some famous classic songs such as [...] "60 năm cuộc đời" [...] ("60 years of life"), [...] "Cho em một ngày thôi" [...] ("'Give <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> only") a duo with Vietnamese diva Thanh Lam, [...] "Hoa sữa" [...] ("Milkwood pine") a duo with Thanh Lam, and [...] "Xích lô" [...] ("Cyclo"). Thu Minh also blew the audience away at her Belting (now known as Thu Minh’s feature) {{as well as with}} her beautiful, bright voice when performing live on some English hits including [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "All by myself", [...] "Queen of the Night", and [...] "Tell Him". This third album received notable music awards and nominations in Vietnam.|$|E
