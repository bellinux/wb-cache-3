40|$|SUMMARY: Notice is hereby {{given that}} {{the staff of the}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has {{prepared}} a model safety evaluation (SE) and model license amendment request (LAR) relating to the modification of technical specification (TS) moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) <b>surveillance</b> <b>requirements</b> (SR) associated with implementation of WCAP- 16011 -P-A, “Startup Test Activity Reduction (STAR) Program. ” The NRC staff has also prepared a model no significant hazards consideration (NSHC) determination relating to this matter. The purpose of these models are to permit the NRC to efficiently process amendments that propose to modify TS MTC <b>surveillance</b> <b>requirements</b> for implementing the STAR Program. Licensees of nuclear power reactors to which the models apply could then request amendments, confirming the applicability of the SE and NSHC determination to their reactors. DATES: The NRC staff issued a Federal Register notice (72 FR 41360, July 27, 2007) which provided a model SE, model application, and model NSHC related to modification of TS MTC <b>surveillance</b> <b>requirements.</b> Similarly, the NRC staff herein provides a revised model SE, model LAR, and model NSHC incorporating changes based upon the public comments received. The NRC staff can most efficiently consider applications based upon the model LAR, which references the model SE, if the LAR is submitted within one year of this Federal Register Notice...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} US Nuclear Regulatory Commission`s Nuclear Plant Aging Research Program, Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) {{evaluated}} the standard technical specifications for nuclear power plants {{to determine whether the}} current <b>surveillance</b> <b>requirements</b> (SRs) were effective in detecting age-related degradation. Nuclear Plant Aging Research findings for selected systems and components were reviewed to identify the stressors and operative aging mechanisms and to evaluate the methods available to detect, differentiate, and trend the resulting aging degradation. Current <b>surveillance</b> and testing <b>requirements</b> for these systems and components were reviewed for their effectiveness in detecting degraded conditions and for potential contributions to premature degradation. When the current <b>surveillance</b> and testing <b>requirements</b> appeared ineffective in detecting aging degradation or potentially could contribute to premature degradation, a possible deficiency in the SRs was identified that could result in undetected degradation. Based on this evaluation, PNL developed recommendations for inspection, surveillance, trending, and condition monitoring methods to be incorporated in the SRs to better detect age- related degradation of these selected systems and components...|$|R
