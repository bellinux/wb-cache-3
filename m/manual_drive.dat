40|$|Abstract: The {{significant}} increment in {{the number}} of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in mass-produced cars suggest the idea of autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles driving in roads in a medium-large term. Consequently, a system to allow the communication among this kind of vehicles and <b>manual</b> <b>driven</b> vehicles will have to be used in order to permit the circulation of both of them at the same time. Two communication modes have to be taken into account. First, a vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V 2 V) to permit the traffic data flow among cars. Second, a vehicle-to-infrastructure communication (V 2 I) to allow a central station to coordinate the movements of the vehicle in case of a failure in the V 2 V. In this paper we present an architecture capable of operating either in autonomous vehicles or <b>manual</b> <b>driven</b> vehicles and coordinating their movements based on a V 2 I communication. Two mass-produced vehicles are used in order to test the behavior of the architecture implementation. Experimental trials to study the response of the system and the information flow have been carried out...|$|R

40|$|Automated {{driving is}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular and is often proposed {{as a solution to}} commonly known human errors in driving. However, fully autonomous driving has not yet reached the point where it can be implemented in real world driving. Current automated driving systems are often designed {{in such a way that}} the role of the human operator is changed to that of a supervisor. This shift in operator role towards that of a supervisor has brought about issues with automation such as loss of vigilance, unbalanced workload, loss of situation awareness, and misplaced trust. As a solution to such issues encountered with automation, and to issues encountered without automation, an intermediate step between manual driving and full automated driving is proposed herein. Accordingly, an adaptive automation system was designed with the goal of increasing road and driving safety. This meant that function allocation occurred based on pre-determined factors. Based on a performed concept study, this study focused on adaptively allocating steering control either to the driver or to the automated pilot. The pre-determined factor used for adaptive function allocation within this experiment is visual distraction based on gaze direction measurements performed using an eye tracker. Participants were asked to use a steering wheel to control a simulated vehicle. At specific periods during each condition, the participants were required to perform a secondary task (i. e. changing a CD), which imposed a visual, physical and cognitive distraction upon the driver. Three different conditions were tested: (1) The <b>manual</b> <b>drive</b> (Manual) condition consisted of manual driving. (2) The automated back-up (Back-up) condition consisted of manual driving except during moments of visual distraction, where the driver was backed up by an automated pilot that was automatically initiated. (3) The forced <b>manual</b> <b>drive</b> (Forced) condition consisted of automated driving except during moments of visual distraction, where the driver was forced back into the loop because <b>manual</b> <b>drive</b> was automatically forced upon them. The Back-up condition showed a significant decrease in lane deviations and both max and mean absolute lateral errors when compared to the control condition. The Back-up condition also showed the lowest selfreported workload ratings and acceptance scale ratings, whereas the Forced condition showed the highest workload rating. Finally, 22 out of 31 drivers indicated that they preferred the Back-up condition to the other two conditions. The Forced condition did appear to increase attention to the road when compared to the Backup condition during secondary tasks. The Forced condition also showed a significant decrease in performance when compared to the Manual condition during the secondary task periods. In conclusion, the Back-up condition appeared to significantly increase performance, and as a result also safety, when compared to the Manual condition, which was the main hypothesis of this study. The Back-up was also well accepted by the drivers. It would appear that the Back-up condition shows real promise for increasing driving safety. However, more research is required before it can be implemented in real cars. Fidelity of the simulation, as well as the quality of eye tracking, should be increased for future studies. The Forced condition shows the possibility of decreasing misuse and increasing awareness to the road but more extensive research is required to investigate the effectiveness in real-life applications.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, several noninterference wrist {{mechanisms}} for articulated forceps have been proposed. The wrist {{mechanism of the}} Kymerax [4], a system of handheld articulated robotic forceps, adopts {{a combination of the}} wire-pulley drive and gear drive mechanism [9]. The mechanism of the gripper axis is decoupled from the pitch and roll axis. Thus, a hybrid drive mechanism of the <b>manual</b> <b>drive</b> gripper axis and motor drive pitch and yaw axes is realized. Nishizawa and Kishi [10] proposed a noninterference mechanism using a wire-pulley and gear mechanism. In the mechanism, a middle plate connects two parts that make rolling contact with each other. Therefore, the path length of the wires is independent of the joint angle. The wrist mechanism of the Radius [3] is a combination of the torque tube, gear, and link drive mechanisms [11]. The mechanism of the gripper axis is decoupled from pitch and roll axes. However, it is not suitable for dissections since the open motion of the gripper is driven by a spring force and the dissecting force is small. Compared to interference mechanisms, the noninterference mechanisms need more parts to realize decoupling between joints.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new member}} of Epi. q robot family, a series of mobile robots with a wheel-legged locomotion and {{with the ability to}} overcome obstacles and move on uneven terrains. The particular feature of this robot family is the ability to switch from a wheel locomotion to a leg locomotion without any external active control but only depending on the dynamic conditions. In particular this work deals with the design of the latest prototype developed, analyzing the design and construction phases. This prototype is more powerful than the previous thanks to the possibility to have four driving units instead of two. The robot architecture has been studied in order to be modular. Several robot configurations can be obtained with the same structure and this allows to test how each component affect the overall robot behavior. Moreover the mechanical design is more accurate and reliable respect to previous versions. A sensing system has been introduced with the aim to evaluate the performances of each robot architecture. Finally an on-board processor has been added. This allows the definition of more complex control logics such as the cooperation between a speed control with a torque control in the four driving units configuration. Moreover it increases the smart tasks that the robot is able to perform such as the developing of a remote autonomous control rather than a <b>manual</b> <b>drive</b> by an operato...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{progress}} in developing highly automated driving applications {{and the corresponding}} opportunities for the driver to take {{himself out of the}} loop have raised a couple of questions regarding the effects of highly automated driving on the driver's state. Within this framework a simulator study was conducted at the Wuerzburg Institute for Traffic Sciences (WIVW GmbH) in collaboration with Volkswagen Group Research with 16 test drivers. The drivers took part in three sessions each requiring him/her to drive on a highway with a speed limit of 120 km/h. Drowsiness was assessed continuously during the drive by eye lid closure measurements and was classified into 4 different levels. Whenever a driver reached a certain drowsiness level during the <b>manual</b> <b>drive,</b> a test phase of 15 minutes was initiated ending with a take-over scenario. Depending on the experimental condition, the test phase was 1) driving with a highly automated system (lateral and longitudinal control was performed by the automated system allowing hands-off driving), 2) driving with the system and additionally performing a quiz task or 3) driving manually during the test phase. The results show that especially in the manual and the highly automated condition without secondary task engagement the drowsiness level clearly increased during the 15 minutes test phases. During the phases with highly automated system active and the additional quiz task, drowsiness stayed on a low level and remained constant during the test phase. This implicates that an interesting and motivating secondary task has the potential to raise driver's alertness significantly, especially during highly automated driving...|$|E

30|$|Recording {{and editing}} of the 3 D LIDAR map {{as well as}} the driving path are {{currently}} conducted by the shuttle supplier based on proprietary models and procedures {{in the context of a}} complex, largely manual preparation process. The initial data is recorded with <b>manual</b> <b>drives</b> at a speed of 1 metre per second (using SLAM technology) [11]. These test runs result in a 3 D LIDAR point cloud as well as a digital trajectory of the path. Both data have to be manually edited afterwards (removing dynamic objects such as vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians from the point cloud and manual smoothing and correcting the trajectory). Additionally, driving rules have to be manually added (e.g. vehicle speed, priorities or stops). As soon as the 3 D LIDAR map {{as well as the}} driving path have been prepared, the shuttle is ready for driving the test route for the first time in automatic mode. The manual adaptation process of the virtual path as well as test drives have to be continued until a satisfying quality level has been reached.
