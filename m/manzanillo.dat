5|$|On October 12, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the coast from Culiacán to <b>Manzanillo</b> and the Baja California Peninsula south of latitude 24°N. At the same time, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued from <b>Manzanillo</b> to Tepic. On October 14, {{a hurricane}} warning was issued for the coast between Culiacán and Cabo Corrientes, and a tropical storm warning south of Cabo Corrientes to <b>Manzanillo.</b> All watches and warnings were lifted later that day.|$|E
5|$|About 27hours before landfall, Mexican {{officials}} {{issued a}} hurricane watch from Mazatlán to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, with {{a tropical storm}} watch issued further south to <b>Manzanillo.</b> Six hours later when its track became more apparent, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Mazatlán to La Fortuna, with a tropical storm warning southward to <b>Manzanillo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the system's designation, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the southwestern coastline of Mexico stretching from Acapulco to La Fortuna. By 0300UTC on July5, the watch was extended from Acapulco to <b>Manzanillo,</b> while {{a tropical}} storm warning was issued from Lázaro Cárdenas to <b>Manzanillo.</b> Several hours later, the watch was discontinued for the coastline stretching from Acapulco to Lázaro Cárdenas and issued from La Fortuna to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Meanwhile, the warning from Lázaro Cárdenas to <b>Manzanillo</b> was discontinued, with a new warning issued from Zihuatanejo to La Fortuna. All tropical storm watches in effect were discontinued by 0300UTC the following morning, with the warning being extended from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. After being upgraded to a hurricane, Erick prompted the issuance of hurricane watches stretching from Punta San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes. At 1500UTC on July6, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued from Santa Fe to La Paz, though this was upgraded to a warning several hours later. Following many other revisions, all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued after Erick degenerated into a remnant low early on July9.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, {{air rescue}} {{operations}} were conducted, but {{the destruction of}} roads in the area hindered convoys carrying aid. Planes also made supply drops, but rescue operations were hindered by broken roads and rails. Survivors were vaccinated against typhoid and tetanus. Part of <b>Manzanillo</b> was placed under quarantine.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, Marty was {{threatening}} enough to prompt the Mexican government {{to issue a}} tropical storm watch from <b>Manzanillo</b> to Acapulco. The warning was dropped on October 9 when Marty moved away. There were no associated casualties or damages with this tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance southwest of <b>Manzanillo,</b> Colima became a tropical depression on September 12 when its convection became persistent around a newly formed center of circulation. Conditions were not favorable for development because of strong wind shear environment {{caused by a}} trough. The depression took a northward track and dissipates on September 13 as it was being sheared {{just south of the}} Gulf of California.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the navy, army, and local government devised a cleanup plan. Three hundred government employees (with guidance of the military) worked to clear debris. They quickly restored water and power service, and within a few days streets had been cleaned for most of the impacted area. Authorities in <b>Manzanillo</b> asked for medicine, clothing and food from nearby areas while the red cross treated the injured. Many of the displaced were evacuated to government offices. Within {{a few days after the}} storm, the ports of <b>Manzanillo,</b> Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Lazaro Cardenas were reopened. The remnants of the storm later brought rain to the Rockie Mountains and the Southwestern United States. Eugene is one of three known July Pacific hurricane strikes, where hurricane-force winds are estimated over land. The other two hurricanes were Hurricane Calvin in 1993 and a hurricane that struck Baja California Sur in 1954.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Delores' approach, the Mexican government issued {{a tropical storm}} warning and a hurricane watch from Ixtapa to <b>Manzanillo</b> on June 24. The watch and the warning were dropped the next day. The cyclone remained far away enough that no reports of high winds were received. Satellite observations indicated that heavy rains fell in affected areas from June 23 to 26. However, no damages or casualties were reported.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Norman's upgrade into {{a tropical storm}}, a tropical storm warning was issued for the coast from Zihuatanejo to <b>Manzanillo</b> on September 20. The warning was dropped after Norman made landfall the next day. No additional warnings were issued upon Norman's reemergence over water because it was never expected to restrengthen.|$|E
5|$|Of {{all of the}} Category5 Pacific hurricanes, {{the only}} ones to make {{landfall}} at any intensity were Hurricane Kenna, Hurricane Rick, and Hurricane Patricia. None made landfall as Category5 hurricanes; Patricia and Kenna had weakened to Category4 {{at the time of their}} landfalls, and Rick was a tropical storm at its landfall. Patricia was the strongest landfall among Pacific hurricanes; 1976's Hurricane Madeline and 1992's Hurricane Iniki are tied as the second strongest storms at landfall, both of which didn't reach Category5 strength, but made landfall as stronger Category 4 storms than Kenna. Originally, a hurricane in 1959 was thought to have struck <b>Manzanillo</b> at Category5 intensity, but a reanalysis in 2016 indicated the storm had peaked as a Category4 hurricane, and made landfall with the same winds as Kenna. Patricia was also originally thought to have made landfall as a Category5 hurricane near <b>Manzanillo</b> before post-season analysis in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Players {{who were}} {{eligible}} {{for the first time}} who were not included on the ballot were: Paul Abbott, Andy Ashby, Danny Bautista, Darren Bragg, Brian Boehringer, Dave Burba, Greg Colbrunn, Mike Fetters, Brook Fordyce, Karim García, Tom Goodwin, Ricky Gutiérrez, Jimmy Haynes, Sterling Hitchcock, Curt Leskanic, Josías <b>Manzanillo,</b> Brent Mayne, Mark McLemore, Scott Service, Chris Stynes, Scott Sullivan, Todd Van Poppel, John Vander Wal, Fernando Viña, and Turk Wendell.|$|E
5|$|The 1959 Mexico {{hurricane}} is {{the deadliest}} eastern Pacific tropical cyclone on record. First observed south of Mexico on October23, the cyclone tracked northwest. It intensified into a Category3 hurricane on October25 and reached Category4 intensity the following day. After turning toward the northeast, the hurricane maintained Category4 status and made landfall near <b>Manzanillo,</b> Mexico. The system continued on that trajectory prior to dissipating the next day.|$|E
5|$|The NHC issued several {{watches and}} {{warnings}} for {{portions of the}} Mexican coastline; {{the first was a}} tropical storm watch for areas between Zihuatanejo and <b>Manzanillo</b> on June22. Several hours later, a portion of the watch was upgraded to a warning as Andres neared the coastline. By 1500UTC, a hurricane watch was declared for areas between Lazaro Cardenas and Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco and the tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Lazaro Cardenas was discontinued. Roughly six hours later, a hurricane warning was raised for Punto San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes and the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were extended northward to Punto San Telmo. By the following afternoon, the hurricane watch was discontinued and several hours later, areas under a tropical storm warning followed suit. Early on June24, all watches and warnings associated with Andres were discontinued as it rapidly dissipated offshore. Authorities closed ports in Lázaro Cárdenas, <b>Manzanillo</b> and Puerto Vallarta because of rough seas. Schools throughout Colima were closed prior to the storm and Mexican officials raised the awareness level to orange.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} storm was observed offshore of Mexico, on September17. Tropical Storm Five had {{no change in}} intensity past a 50mph (85km/h) {{tropical storm}}, similar to Tropical Storms One, Two, and Three. While paralleling the coast of Mexico, Tropical Storm Five passed only 75mi (120km) southwest of <b>Manzanillo.</b> The tropical storm curved northwestward on September18, and headed out to sea. The system dissipated 135mi (215km) west-southwest of Islas Marías on September19.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} destroyed about 15sq. mi (39 km2) {{of fruit}} crop. A total of 18 {{people were injured}} during the storm. The storm destroyed 3,107 acres of mango trees and 5,662 acres of bananas were destroyed, with the worst crop damage occurring in Jalisco. Moreover, 540 acres of cocoa, 580 acres of papaya, and at least 382 acres of lemon trees were also destroyed by Eugene. Due {{to a combination of}} Eugene and Hurricane Greg, the region registered rainfall amounts for times the average. In addition, three people were killed; two of the deaths occurred in Michoacán. One man died in Venustiano Carrazano when a palm tree was blown over. Another man perished in <b>Manzanillo</b> when he was struck by a fallen palm tree. Over 5,000people were left homeless (mostly from poor and rural areas), including 60people in <b>Manzanillo.</b> Total crop damage amounted to $142million (1987USD); fruit crop damage alone amounted to more than $2.6million (1987USD). Damage to eight beach houses totaled to $120,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{hurricane}} of its season, Winifred existed in October 1992. It formed southeast of Acapulco on October 6 as the twenty-fourth east Pacific tropical cyclone of its season, and recurved as it strengthened. It peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It made landfall southeast of <b>Manzanillo,</b> Colima and dissipated inland.|$|E
5|$|Two {{fatalities}} occurred offshore when a trimaran capsized; two fishermen {{were also}} reported missing. A pair children {{were killed by}} a mudslide. Damage to boats and shoreline structures extended from Acapulco to <b>Manzanillo.</b> Electrical and water services were cut off {{to the city of}} Mazanillio. In all, 4,000people were evacuated from their homes throughout the state. Several ports were also closed. Throughout Colima, lime and mango crops sustained $4.3million in damage.|$|E
5|$|While Olaf was at peak strength, a {{tropical}} storm warning issued for Punta San Telmo to Lazaro Cardenas and a hurricane warning was issued from Punta San Telmo to San Blas, including the Islas Marias. The next day, the tropical storm warning was extended to include <b>Manzanillo.</b> At that same time, a hurricane watch was issued from San Blas to Mazatlán. In addition, hurricane warning was extended to include areas from <b>Manzanillo</b> to San Blas including the Islas Marias. Thee hours later, when Olaf was revealed to be much weaker, the hurricane warnings and hurricane watches were canceled. However, the tropical storm warnings remained in effect until October 7. A yellow alert was declared in the Mexican states of Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco, and a green alert was declared in Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Guerrero. Local authorities also opened shelters.|$|E
5|$|After visiting Guacanayabo and Cienfuegos late in March {{and early}} in April, Bridgeport moved to <b>Manzanillo</b> and {{remained}} nearby until setting sail for New York on 24 April. She arrived at New York on 30 April {{for several days}} of upkeep and liberty {{before moving on to}} her summer base. On 17 May, she sailed for Newport, Rhode Island, the summer base for the destroyer squadrons, and arrived there the following day to tend the destroyers of Flotilla2.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forecasts}} {{underestimated the}} peak intensity of Pauline by 65mph (105km/h). On October 7, about 41hours before landfall, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a hurricane warning from Tapachula in Chiapas to Punta Maldonado in Guerrero. Shortly after Pauline made landfall, the warning was extended northwestward to <b>Manzanillo,</b> Colima, and later to Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Pauline's turn to the west-northwest near landfall was unexpected, resulting in hurricane conditions {{with only a few}} hours notice in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Eugene was {{the only}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in Mexico during the 1987 Pacific hurricane season. The eighth tropical cyclone, fifth named storm, and first hurricane of the season, Eugene developed on July22 from a tropical disturbance centered well offshore of Mexico. Later that day, the system intensified into a tropical storm while moving northwestward. Eugene reached hurricane status on July24; it briefly peaked as a Category 2 hurricane two days later. Hurricane Eugene weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane; subsequently, the hurricane made landfall near <b>Manzanillo.</b> Shortly after landfall, Eugene rapidly weakened inland, and was only a tropical storm when it re-emerged into open water, where it quickly dissipated. Throughout Mexico, the storm produced high winds, especially in the southwestern portion of the country. The hurricane deluged the southwest Mexican coastline, resulting in the highest rainfall totals from a tropical cyclone in five Mexican states. Over 5,000people were left homeless, including 60 in <b>Manzanillo.</b> The cities airport control tower was also damaged, thus requiring closure. Elsewhere, 200 to 300 houses were destroyed in Colima. In all, Eugene injured 18 people and caused three fatalities and $142.12million (1987USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lily was a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane of August 1971 that devastated {{the city of}} Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. Forming from an area of cloudiness associated with former Atlantic Tropical Storm Chloe, the storm slowly intensified, building to peak intensity just before landfall northwest of <b>Manzanillo,</b> Colima on August 31. The hurricane quickly weakened and became extratropical. After leaving land, the extratropical remnants of Lily dissipated on September 1. The storm's movement close to land affected shipping due to the limited warning, which was partially set back due to difficulties in clarifying the hurricane's position on radar from reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Sergio was {{the third}} strongest Pacific {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} November on record. The nineteenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Sergio developed from a tropical wave on November 13 about 460miles (740km) south of <b>Manzanillo,</b> Mexico, and steadily intensified as it tracked southeastward. It reached peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) on November 15, and subsequently began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it turned to the north. Sergio later turned to the west, remaining well off the coast of Mexico, and dissipated on November 20 about 320miles (515km) west-northwest of it originally formed.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Hurricane Ismael was {{predicted}} to remain over the open {{waters of the}} Pacific Ocean. However, when a northward motion became apparent, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from <b>Manzanillo,</b> Colima, to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco and for the Islas Marias. Shortly thereafter, the warning was extended to Los Mochis and issued for the eastern coast of Baja California Sur south of 25° N. Ten hours before Ismael made its final landfall, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning from Mazatlán to Los Mochis. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane, 1,572people evacuated to five emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Olivia were from an {{extended}} area of convection, or thunderstorm activity, that persisted southwest of Mexico in late October. Following {{the development of}} a circulation, the system formed into a tropical depression early on October22 about 430mi (690km) southwest of <b>Manzanillo,</b> Colima. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Olivia as it tracked northwestward, although further strengthening was slowed. The circulation became much better defined on October23 and after Olivia turned northeastward, it attained hurricane status that evening.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Odile's existence, the National Weather Service of Mexico {{declared}} several {{tropical storm}} watches and warnings for the Pacific coast of Mexico spanning from Jalisco to Oaxaca. They were extended and discontinued as Odile progressed westward. On October 11 at around 2 AM PDT, a hurricane watch was declared for the Pacific coast of Mexico from Tecpán de Galeana to Punta San Telmo. Six hours later, the hurricane watch was adjusted and {{in effect for}} the coast from Zihuatanejo to <b>Manzanillo.</b> They were all discontinued later that day as the chance of Odile becoming a hurricane diminished.|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} the homes in Cihuatlán, Jalisco, were totally destroyed, leaving many homeless. In <b>Manzanillo,</b> Colima, 40 percent of all homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos. In Colima, all coconut plantations were blown down {{and thousands of people}} were left out of work. That state's economy was damaged enough that officials thought it would take years to recover.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave crossed Central America {{and entered}} the eastern Pacific Ocean on November 7. An area of convection along the wave tracked westward {{to the south of}} Central America and Mexico, and became more concentrated on November 12 while located about 400miles (645km) south of Acapulco. Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the convection continued to organize. Early on November 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late on November 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized convection for it to be designated Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E while located about 460miles (740km) south of <b>Manzanillo,</b> Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not upgraded until eleven hours later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa behind Hurricane Luis on August 31. Strong outflow from Luis prevented development of the wave, and it continued westward until crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 12. Convection increased as it moved through the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and the cloud pattern organized sufficiently to warrant Dvorak classifications for the system on September 15. Based on the development of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on September 16 while located around 290miles (465km) south of <b>Manzanillo,</b> Mexico. Due to the tropical depression moving over an area of warm water temperatures with favorable upper level outflow, the National Hurricane Center forecast the tropical depression to slowly intensify to 70mph (110km/h) winds within 72hours the forecast early on September 16.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on October4. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on October18. The next day, it combined with a previously existing area of disturbed weather, resulting in a large area of convection extending northward into southern Mexico. The broad and disorganized system moved westward at 1015mph (1624km/h). On October20, the system developed an area of low pressure, and began to show signs of organization. It continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression Seventeen-E on October21 while located about 265miles (425km) south-southwest of <b>Manzanillo.</b> Upon forming, the depression possessed a small, tight low-level circulation beneath a well-defined mid-level circulation. Easterly wind shear initially restricted upper-level outflow as the cyclone moved to the west, a motion due to a subtropical ridge to its north.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, with the northern portion dissipating over Cuba on August 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 16. Deep convection increased over the wave upon entering the Pacific, and early on August 19 it started to become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 20 while located about 275miles (445km) south-southwest of <b>Manzanillo,</b> Colima.|$|E
5|$|As Emilia first {{approached}} the southwest coast of Mexico, officials issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from <b>Manzanillo</b> to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; the watch was discontinued 30hours after it was issued. The storm passed the region on July 22, and {{is believed to have}} produced tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. A ship recorded 40mph (65km/h) winds while Emilia was just off the coast. Further up the coast, in Mazatlán, strong waves from the storm caused beaches to close, while the outer fringes of the storm dropped 4.68inches (119mm) of precipitation. Inland, the interaction between Emilia and a tropical wave brought increased moisture and precipitation to southeastern and central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Early on July 23, {{the storm}} briefly became disorganized, with the {{low-level}} circulation becoming ill-defined. Around the same time, Emilia passed about 175mi (280km) southwest of <b>Manzanillo,</b> which was its closest approach to southwestern Mexico; {{it is believed}} to have caused tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. Later that day, after turning west-northwestward, the convection increased markedly as an eyewall began to form. Operationally, it was estimated to have reached winds of 70mph (115km/h), and it was forecast to continue strengthening to attain Category2 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the NHC later re-assessed Emilia as reaching peak winds of 65mph (105km/h), since the eye feature was temporary and not well-defined.|$|E
5|$|Few {{official}} surface {{observations are}} available for {{the passage of the}} hurricane. Upon making landfall, Kenna was accompanied with an estimated 16foot (4.9m) storm surge in San Blas. The surge also affected Puerto Vallarta, with reports of 10foot (3m) waves rushing inland from the bay. The hurricane dropped about 1.38inches (35mm) of precipitation while passing about 60mi (95km) east of the offshore archipelago, Islas Marías. There, sustained winds reached an estimated 106mph (170km/h). On land, Kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 18.91inches (480mm) at San Ignacio, Sinaloa, and 12.89inches (327mm) near <b>Manzanillo,</b> Colima. The highest recorded sustained wind on land was about 100mph (161km/h) at Tepic, Nayarit, with wind gusts at Puerto Vallarta reaching 50mph (80km/h). The hurricane also produced heavy rainfall in Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco, and hit Baja California Sur with strong winds and rough seas.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{classification}} of Tropical Depression Two-E on June19, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas between Zihuatanejo and <b>Manzanillo.</b> A hurricane watch was also put in place from Tecpán de Galeana to Punta San Telmo. Later that day, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the watch was extended westward to La Fortuna. As Beatriz continued to strengthen, the watches and warnings were extended westward to Cabo Corrientes on June20. Early on June21, the easternmost advisories were discontinued as Beatriz moved away. Later that morning, all watches and warnings were discontinued in light of Beatriz's rapid weakening.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Daniel {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on July2. The wave moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little associated convection, and on July12, it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean. Convection increased on July13, and two days later the system began to exhibit signs of tropical development to the south of Mexico. It tracked westward at about 15mph (25km/h), and on July16, the disturbance became better organized. With convective rainbands near an associated low-level circulation, it is estimated the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression late on July16. At the time, it was located about 525miles (845km) south-southwest of <b>Manzanillo,</b> Colima.|$|E
