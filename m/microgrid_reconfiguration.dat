40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{presents}} a new multi-objective <b>microgrid</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> problem formulation. Unlike {{existing distribution system}} or <b>microgrid</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> algorithms, we consider the effect of uncertainty arising from the renewable energy generation and investigate the tradeoff between the invented index measuring the reliability of reconfiguration and the total load served. The resulting optimization problem is computa-tionally prohibitive due to the binary circuit breaker variables and the probability constraint accounting for the uncertainty of renewable generation. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) reformulation is developed based on convex relaxation techniques and the scenario-based approximation. Furthermore, weighted-sum method is applied in the reformulation and we eventually obtain the Pareto solution points of the <b>microgrid</b> <b>reconfiguration.</b> Numerical tests validate the intrinsic tradeoff between the two objectives and demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed solution methodology...|$|E

Utilizing renewable power sources requires more complicated control strategies to achieve acceptable power quality and maintain grid stability. In this research, {{we assume that}} the grid stability problem is already solved. As a next step, we focus on how the power can be dispatched from multiple power sources for improved grid efficiency. Isolated <b>microgrids</b> frequently require <b>reconfigurations</b> because of the grid expansion or component failures. Therefore, the control strategies ideally should be implemented in a plug-and-play fashion. Moreover, these strategies ideally require no pre-knowledge of the grid structure, and as little communication with neighboring power sources as possible. The control objective is to minimize a cost function that can be adjusted to reflect the desire to minimize energy cost and/or losses. An algorithm is designed to satisfy a derived necessary condition of function optimality. Such conditions are obtained by formulating Lagrange functions. An equivalent grid model approximates the grid structure which was later confirmed to represent the grid behavior adequately. For decentralized operations, we execute the distributed control sequentially using a simple token communication protocol. The performance of the combined system identification-Lagrange function minimization algorithm is demonstrated through simulations...|$|R
