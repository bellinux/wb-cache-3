60|$|He telephoned {{first of}} all to Li Faa's number but did not find her until he called up <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> Lucy. The news given, the {{marriage}} was dated ahead with ten times the brevity of the old-line Chinese custom. And if there be anything analogous to a bridesmaid in a Chinese wedding, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> Lucy was just that.|$|R
6000|$|The {{symptoms}} returned; {{the native}} Christian was sent for, and found <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang's</b> establishment full of buckets {{of water for}} extinguishing the sudden fires. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang's</b> daughter-in-law was now possessed, and [...] "drank wine in large quantities, though ordinarily she would not touch it". She was staring and tossing her arms wildly; a service was held, and she soon became her usual self.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the time}} when the X-Men were based in the Australian outback, Psylocke gained {{possession}} of a unique suit of armor. Made of an unknown metal, it was lightweight and form-fitting, yet extremely resistant to physical damage, giving Psylocke an added protection to her physical body. The armor was also resistant to projectiles and energy weapons. Wolverine had the armor custom-ordered through a weapons and technology firm named Landau, Luckman, and Lake for [...] "a colleague". <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang,</b> an agent of Landau, Luckman, and Lake, loaned the armor to Lindsay McCabe since Wolverine had sent her to him. Tyger Tiger also wore the body armor for a short time, and she was briefly trapped in the armor due to a built-in security mechanism, which Wolverine managed to free her from. After traveling through the Siege Perilous and trading bodies with Kwannon, Psylocke no longer used the body armor. When Kwannon, in Betsy's original body, returned to Xavier's mansion, she was wearing an armor that was similar to the one Betsy used to wear, but it has never been officially stated whether or not this armor had the same capabilities as Psylocke’s original one. The same can be said for the armor worn by Psylocke's resurrected original body, after it was brought back during by Madelyne's sisterhood, wearing armor of the same coloring.|$|E
60|$|In {{intellectual}} matters, on {{the other}} hand, Mr. Eng Nye was always dynamo, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> Riley was always motor; Mr. Eng Nye had a stately intellect, but couldn't make it go; <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> Riley hadn't, but could. That is to say, that while <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> Riley couldn't think things himself, he had a marvellous natural grace in setting them down and weaving them together when his pal furnished the raw material.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang,</b> of that ilk (Chang Chang Tien-ts), {{was a man}} of fifty- seven, and a {{graduate}} in letters. The ladies of his family having accommodated a demon with a shrine in his house, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> said he [...] "would have none of that nonsense". The spirit then entered into Mrs. Chang, and the usual fire-raising began all over the place. The furniture and crockery danced in the familiar way, and objects took to disappearing mysteriously, even when secured under lock and key. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> was as unlucky as Mr. Chin. At his house [...] "doors would open of their own accord, footfalls were heard, as of persons walking in the house, although no one could be seen. Plates, bowls and the teapot would suddenly rise from the table into the air." [...] {233a} ...|$|E
5000|$|Daniel reaches his {{breaking}} point. Miserable {{and determined}} not to be alone forever, he comes out to his mother the very next time she starts talking about available young women. This time he is direct and asserts {{that he wants to}} be with Robert. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> reacts angrily, lecturing Daniel in her native tongue and storming away from him. In her confusion, disappointment and fear of losing Daniel (who threatened to move out), she turns to the only other woman she knows with a gay son, Robert's mother. Robert's mother asks <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> if it wouldn't be so bad to have another son, a clever way of getting around the cultural taboo of same-sex love. Shortly thereafter, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> calls Daniel back home to meet another potential date. Daniel flips out and races back home to stand up to his mother for the last time. He opens the door bellowing out, [...] "Mother!" [...] but almost chokes from surprise when Robert walks toward him instead. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> had invited Robert to be part of their family.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> Lucy says," [...] Li Faa observed. [...] "She {{says that}} your honourable mother often {{complains}} {{to her that}} she has never made you cry." ...|$|R
50|$|Besides {{the extra}} money <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> makes playing Mahjong, she also rents out the {{basement}} illegally. Daniel relates how he was quite happy to leave the previous female tenant alone. Daniel expects his mother to replace the previous tenant with another woman and is astounded when the new tenant {{turns out to be}} Robert, a young attractive white man from Indiana. Daniel immediately has a crush on him. Following a plumbing mishap that floods the basement with raw sewage, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> apologetically moves Robert into the only other bedroom that is not hers—Daniel's room. Even though reality has merged with Daniel's deepest fantasies, he bows to the paranoia that his mother will find out he is gay and decides to sleep on the living room sofa. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> eventually kicks Daniel off the couch so she can watch her late-night TV programs, and he is forced to share his bed with Robert. Daniel manages to be prudish for a few nights but eventually the two become lovers.|$|R
60|$|For instance, {{in moral}} matters <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> Riley was always dynamo, Mr. Eng Nye was always motor; for while <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> Riley had a high--in fact, an {{abnormally}} high and fine moral sense, {{he had no}} machinery to work it with; whereas, Mr. Eng Nye, who hadn't any moral sense at all, and hasn't yet, was equipped with all the necessary plant for putting a noble deed through, if he could only get the inspiration on reasonable terms outside.|$|E
6000|$|The {{family have}} become Christians, the fires have ceased; <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> is an earnest inquirer, but opposed, for obvious reasons, to any public {{profession}} of our religion. {233b} ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have made}} this explanation, this analysis, this vivisection, so to speak, in order that you may enjoy these {{delightful}} adventurers understandingly. When Mr. Eng Nye's deep and broad and limpid philosophies flow by in front of you, refreshing all the regions round about with their gracious floods, you will remember that it isn't his water; it's the other man's, and he is only working the pump. And when <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> Riley enchants your ear, and soothes your spirit, and touches your heart with the sweet and genuine music of his poetry--as sweet and as genuine as any that his friends, {{the birds and the}} bees, make about his other friends, the woods and the flowers--you will remember, while placing justice where justice is due, that it isn't his music, but the other man's--he is only turning the crank.|$|E
50|$|Daniel's fear {{of being}} caught making out with a man {{constantly}} gets in between his relationship with Robert, and Daniel begins to wish that the basement repairs would finish soon so they could move their lovemaking to a safer area. However, one day <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> and Grandma return home earlier than expected {{right in the middle}} of one of Daniel and Robert's trysts. Grandma walks in on them during copulation to offer them mooncakes, one of the few English words she knows. She sheepishly leaves the mooncakes on the nightstand and exits, giving them enough time to roll apart to opposite sides of the bed just as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> walks in. Daniel quickly chastizes her for not knocking and makes up the excuse that he was napping. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> does not seem to notice that both he and Robert are naked, but she bluntly tells Robert to move his belongings back into the basement that night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Which is {{what your}} honoured mother told <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> Lucy, {{which is what}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> Lucy told me," [...] Li Faa {{completed}} equably. [...] "And I now tell you, O Third Husband To Be, that the man is not born who will lead me by the ear. It {{is not the way}} in Hawaii. I will go only hand in hand with my man, side by side, fifty-fifty as is the haole slang just now. My Portuguese husband thought different. He tried to beat me. I landed him three times in the police court and each time he worked out his sentence on the reef. After that he got drowned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a device}} {{of all the}} devils," [...] Mrs. Tai Fu agreed, taking a fresh grip on the stick. [...] "Yet shall the {{telephone}} remain. I like to talk with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Chang</b> Lucy over the telephone." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, {{by way of}} {{clearing}} the decks for action, I am going to start even by getting rid once for all (so far as we are here concerned) of that famous but misleading old distinction between genius and talent. It is really a distinction without a difference. I suppose there is probably no subject under heaven on which so much high-flown stuff and nonsense has been talked and written as upon this well-known and much-debated hair-splitting discrimination. It is just like that other great distinction between fancy and imagination, about which poets and essayists discoursed so fluently {{at the beginning of}} the present century, until at last one fine day the world at large woke up suddenly to the unpleasant consciousness that it had been wasting its time over a non-existent difference, and that fancy and imagination were after all absolutely identical. Now, I won't dogmatically assert that talent and genius are exactly one and the same thing; but I do assert that genius is simply talent raised to a slightly higher power; it differs from it not in kind but merely in degree: it is talent at its best. There is no drawing a hard-and-fast line of demarcation between the two. You might just as well try to classify all mankind into tall men and short men, and then endeavour to prove that a real distinction existed in nature between your two artificial classes. As a matter of fact, men differ in height and in ability by infinitesimal gradations: some men are very short, others rather short, others medium-sized, others tall, and yet others again of portentous stature like <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> and Jacob Omnium. So, too, some men are idiots, some are next door to a fool, some are stupid, some are worthy people, some are intelligent, some are clever, and some geniuses. But genius is only the culminating point of ordinary cleverness, and if you were to try and draw up a list of all the real geniuses in the last hundred years, no two people could ever be found to agree among themselves as to which should be included and which excluded from the artificial catalogue. I have heard Kingsley and Charles Lamb described as geniuses, and I have heard them both absolutely denied every sort of literary merit. Carlyle thought Darwin a poor creature, and Comte regarded Hegel himself as an empty windbag.|$|E

Please carry on propaganda that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> Ung is the tallest and in the highest position in the ITF. If only I had been as tall as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> Ung, I could have had less opponents, however, as my body was so tiny {{that there were many}} opponents. Thus, all alone, I could not but fight against them for so long. But I have never been worn out for the justice was on my side. I have always worried about a successor to the President, however, my mind is set at ease for there is <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chang</b> Ung.|$|E
