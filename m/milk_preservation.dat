40|$|During the {{production}} and manufacturing stages, milk is liable to microbial contamination. Unless protective measures are taken to prohibit the microbes growth during the transportation and storage of milk, its properties will, in turn, deteriorate rapidly. This {{is determined by the}} contamination volume, handling and storage conditions. Temperature is {{regarded as one of the}} most important factors that determine the preservability of milk and its products. Unless unprocessed milk is rapidly cooled, its properties will deteriorate and may not be good for pasteurization. Therefore, a particular care should be taken to maintain the milk cool at a temperature of 4. 5 ºC during storage and transportation. Several experiments have indicated that the pasteurized milk, produced cleanly, can be preserved for two weeks in a refrigerator at 4 - 5 ºC, before the spoilage symptoms appear on it. When stored at higher temperatures, <b>milk</b> <b>preservations</b> period will decrease. It was found that milk can hold good for consumption for 7 - 10 days when stored at 10 ºC. Psychotropic bacteria is regarded as responsible for most spoilage cases of the cooled pasteurized milk. Concerning yoghurt, where acidity plays a significant role in the determination of its acceptability to the consumer, this acidity increases when the yoghurt is stored at relatively high temperatures (7 - 10 ºC). But, when it is stored at temperature higher than 10 ºC, yeasts will grow and, in turn, impart an unacceptable flavor to the yoghurt. While liquid milk products are more affected by temperature than any other environmental effects such as light, humidity, and air, the light may lead to the oxidization of milk and its products if they were packed in transparent or light-permeated containers.

The milk was collected directly from a traditional farm, the collection and examination of samples was done during April- June 2005. The result indicated that non significant differences were found for total bacterial counts, coliform counts and acidity in the treated milk samples. Moreover this study showed that total bacterial counts and the acidity were not affected by temperature (room and refrigerator) after treatment with Lactoperoxidase System (LPS). Also the treatment of raw milk with the LPS revealed non significant differences in acidity due to variation of storage temperature. However the result indicated that there were significant differences in total bacterial and coliform counts (p< 0. 001) of the raw milk stored at both room and refrigerator temperatures.

40|$|The milk revolution, {{popularly known}} as White Revolution, started in India in 1970 with a governmentsponsored {{programme}} - Operation Flood. This brought significant improvement to smallholder dairy systems by promoting cross-breeding, improving access to feed, veterinary services, markets, <b>milk</b> processing and <b>preservation</b> infrastructure. By 2013, India was the world’s largest milk producing country with total production of 132 megatonnes up from 17 in 1951. However, the cooperative system, the main vehicle for dairy development, was not successful everywhere especially, in regions where dairying had less potential to scale-up, leaving traditional milk production, with 80 % of the market share, behind. Although cross-breeding became popular, average milk productivity per animal is still far below the global average and the traditional sector lacks awareness, capacity, incentives and resources.

40|$|Heat {{treatment}} is conventionally used in dairy industry {{to achieve the}} microbial safety and desired functional properties of dairy products. However, heat treatment can cause detrimental effects on dairy products such as changes in colour and loss of vitamins. Novel processing technologies including pulsed electric fields (PEF) and ultrasound (US) processing have shown great potential to be the alternatives to heat treatment for dairy processing. In this study, the effects of PEF and US processing on milk protein systems that are altered by pH adjustment, EDTA addition or high-heat treatment are examined. The results show that PEF processing {{did not affect the}} structure of the casein micelles or denature the whey proteins in reconstituted skim milk, despite the pH adjustment (pH 6. 7 to 8. 0) or the EDTA addition (10 to 30 mM). On the other hand, US processing (particularly at 20 kHz) of reconstituted skim milk can disrupt casein micelles and reform micelle-like particles with smaller size and comparable ζ-potential to native micelles. US processing of high-heat treated (90 °C/ 10 min) reconstituted skim milk can modify the physicochemical properties of casein micelle particles and the heat-induced protein aggregates. Based on the processing effects on the milk proteins, processed milk samples were selected for functionality tests. The results show that milk ultrasonicated at pH 8. 0 and adjusted to pH 6. 7 had superior renneting properties compared to untreated milks or milk ultrasonicated at pH 6. 7. The concentrated milk (&gt; 40 % total solid) made from milk ultrasonicated at pH 8. 0 and adjusted to pH 6. 7 had higher viscosity, compared to that made from untreated milk at pH 6. 7. However, the GDL-induced acid gels made from high-heat treated milks that were ultrasonicated had similar gelation properties, compared to those made from milks that were only high-heat treated. The heat stability of recombined concentrated milks made from high-heat treated milks that were ultrasonicated was unchanged, compared to those made from milks that were only high-heat treated. Therefore, PEF processing can be an alternative for pasteurization of <b>milk</b> with <b>preservation</b> of the important milk proteins, although the processing temperature should be carefully controlled. US processing can be integrated to dairy processing to modify the physicochemical properties of milk proteins and achieve desired functional properties...|$|R

Forty-five household women (15 from each group) were randomly selected. A survey and questionnaires addressing the comparison of milk sources, quantities consumed and their preference in terms of sources and dairy animals, dairy products, and the methods of preservation were conducted. Fresh milk samples were similarly collected in sterile containers from each family, participating in the present study; for microbial analysis, using the Resazurin reduction test, which is an indirect method for grading the microbial load. The laboratory analysis of milk samples revealed that 46. 7 % of the samples were graded as excellent milk, 35. 6 % were graded as good milk and 17. 8 % were reported as accepted milk, while no rejected milk sample was detected in the selected milk samples. Moreover, in the poor families the excellent milk grade was 46. 7, the good milk grade was 40 % and the accepted milk grade was 13. 3 % of the tested samples. In the middle class families, 53. 3 %, 33. 3 % and 13. 3 % were found to obtain excellent, good and accepted grades of milk, respectively.

Therefore, this study was conducted with the objectives of identifying and documenting farmers’ indigenous knowledge in livestock husbandry, and ethno veterinary practices in Endamohoni district of southern Tigray. The woreda was purposively selected based on its contrasting agro-ecologies (lowland, midland, and highland) and potential of being the source of traditionally knowledgeable peoples who for generations have been associated with livestock rearing. Six kebeles (two kebeles from each of the three agroecologies) were selected as study sites. A total of 175 households (55 from lowland, 60 each from midland and highland), assumed to have a better indigenous knowledge in livestock production were selected for the study. A structured questionnaire was administered to the selected households to collect data on use of indigenous knowledge on livestock husbandry and ethno veterinary practices. After completing the questionnaires for each division, group discussions have been held and an informal meeting with the key informants for triangulation. Result indicated that 88. 3, 76. 7 and 92. 7 % of the respondents in highland, midland and lowland agroecologies respectively were males. The level of education shows that of all the respondents, 55 % in highland, 50 % in midland and 72. 73 % in lowland were illiterate. Sheep and cattle in highlands and midlands and goat and cattle in lowland dominated the livestock populations. Shortage of feed in the study areas was ranked as the first constraints of animal production. Farmers use purchasing of crop residue in the highland and midland, destocking in the midland and movement (urna) in the lowland as mitigation mechanisms. Phenotypic selections of different animal species are employed and also keeping history of pedigree is important instrument in the breeding and selection of animals. Breeding of close related livestock is discouraged in the study sites. Seventeen animal diseases and 38 aliments were recorded in the study areas and 65 medicinal plants were accordingly documented to treat those diseases. About 83 % of the highland, 75 % of the midland and 92. 7 % of the lowland farmers acquire ethno veterinary knowledge from their old parents. Of the total medicinal plants, (81 %) were wild. In the preparation of the traditional medicine leaves constitute about 51 % and 47 % of the medicine was administered orally. The most common preparation method is by crushing and squeezing (45 %).

Also presented are the socio-economic, biophysical and agro-climatic characteristics that predispose uptake of each intervention. The third section presents some policy-relevant research results in three topical areas: Cost of milk production; Evaluation and assessment of alternative <b>milk</b> <b>preservation</b> techniques; and Employment generation in the dairy marketing chain...|$|E
30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that the preservation of camel milk is by three different mechanisms. First {{is the presence of}} higher levels of the natural antimicrobial compound ‘lysozyme’ in camel milk than cows’ milk (el Agamy et al. 1992). Secondly, the use of wood smoke provides a component of a hurdle system for <b>milk</b> <b>preservation.</b> This is because, among the functional components of smoke, phenols and acids have been shown to have the most antimicrobial activity, while carbonyls and acids have a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity even at low levels of phenols (Toledo 2008). The phenolic acid, acetic acid, and carbonyls individually have antimicrobial activity, but their combined effect is synergistic (Toledo 2007). Thus, a mixture of smoke compounds is an effective antimicrobial agent at a lower level of the components than any of the individual components. Lastly, the LAB have been reported to acquire resistance due to genetic changes resulting from acquisition of plasmids and/or transposon-encoding resistance proteins against the components of smoke in the smoked milk containers, and the LAB also secrete antimicrobial compounds particularly the production of bacteriocins (McDonnell and Russell 1999). These bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides which produce pores in the cytoplasmic membrane of other spoilage micro-organisms in milk, which inhibits their energy production and biosynthesis activities, thus resulting in the preservation of milk (McIntyre et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{treatment}} traditionally utilised for {{the conservation}} of human milk is the Holder pasteurisation (62. 5  °C for 30  min). In the present study, the application of an alternative processing method of breast milk was studied. High-pressure processing is an emerging food treatment that allows the food to keep many of its nutritional and healthy properties and inactivates pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore, the effect of the Holder pasteurisation and high-pressure processing (400 or 600  MPa for 3 or 6  min) on tocopherols, fatty acids and cytokines present in human milk was evaluated. Thermal treatment and pressurisation at 600  MPa of human milk significantly decreased the levels of α-, γ- and δ-tocopherol compared with control samples. In addition, pressurisation at 600  MPa for 6  min caused a significant reduction in the relative proportions of some key fatty acids, such as α-linolenic (C 18 : 3 n− 3) and docosahexaenoic (C 22 : 6 n− 3) acids. Regarding the effect of the different treatments on cytokines, in contrast to thermal treatment, pressurisation (400 or 600  MPa) did not affect the levels of IL- 6, IL- 8 and TNF-α. Therefore, the effect of pressurisation on human milk cytokines was lower than that of thermal pasteurisation. In conclusion, high-pressure processing at 400  MPa (for 3 or 6  min) caused minor changes in the parameters analysed and could be an alternative treatment for human <b>milk</b> <b>preservation...</b>|$|E

Despite the fact that mothers prefer to breastfeed, their return to work {{is associated with a}} reduction in breastfeeding frequency and duration. The present study evaluates the impact of occupational factors on continuation of breastfeeding and formula initiation in employed mothers with infants aged 6 - 12 months in Bandar-Abbas, Iran in 2010. Method and Materials: This is a descriptive-analytic study on employed mothers with infants aged 6 - 12 months referring to healthcare centers of Bandar-Abbas in 2010. Data were collected through a questionnaire dealing with work-related factors in mothers’ workplace. Findings: Out of 212 mothers who responded, 52. 38 % used formula to feed their children, and 27. 36 % had discontinued breastfeeding. The rate of formula use was significantly higher in mothers who had less than 6 months of maternity leave, those who did not have a suitable nursery or place to milk themselves and preserve the milk in their workplace, those working more than 6 hours per day, and those who could not take a breastfeeding break. Conclusion: It is essential to identify and support breastfeeding employed women. The employers should provide facilities such as nurseries, a suitable physical space for milking, as well as the equipment necessary for <b>milk</b> <b>preservation.</b> Also, such mothers should be granted breastfeeding breaks to feed their child or milk their breasts. <!

40|$|A Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was {{conducted}} in dairy farms of the North West Province of Cameroon. The aim of the PRA {{was to have a}} better understanding of the prevailing dairy systems, identify problems, and set priorities for research and development that can contribute to improved systems of production. A multidisciplinary team of researchers and extension agents was constituted. It was made up of scientists of the following fields: cattle management, forage science, agro economy, veterinary, dairy technology, nutrition and extension. The research team visited farmers' groups and divided itself into subgroups for farm and village walks during which direct observations were also noted. The extension agent of the locality, key informants, gave additional information overlooked by farmers. Interviews were also carried out with other stakeholders of the dairy sector. The research team met the day following the visit to agree on a common report. Results show that five small scale dairy production systems are found in the region: transhumance, improved extensive, semi intensive, zero grazing and peri-urban. Agriculture is well integrated to dairying. Main constraints include in order of importance: poor marketing opportunities and long distances to market, limited grazing land and poor supplementation strategies, poor reproductive management and poor calving interval, inadequate knowledge in processing, hygiene and <b>milk</b> <b>preservation,</b> and limited health control. In market oriented farms, reproduction and feeding were the most important constraints. Main factors influencing dairy production are: milk collection, fresh milk price, consumer demand, genotype and management. These results suggest that much can be done to improve production by extending improved packages to dairy farmers...|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} of milk preserved by refrigeration and CO 2 addition for {{the manufacture of}} rennet-coagulated Spanish hard cheeses was evaluated. Two types of cheeses were produced from milk preserved by refrigeration and CO 2 addition (pH 6. 2) and were compared with controls made from fresh milk. Degasified (50 - 52 °C and 300 mm Hg) and pasteurised milk was employed for the manufacture of 30 -day-old cheeses using a commercial starter. A degasified (30 - 32 °C and 350 - 375 mm Hg) mixture of 90 % cow's and 10 % ewe's raw milk {{was used for the}} manufacture of starter-free 75 day-old cheeses. <b>Milk</b> <b>preservation</b> did not affect multiplication and acidification capacity of lactic acid bacteria in cheeses from pasteurised milk but promoted lower levels of lactococci at first days of ripening in cheeses from raw milk and rendered lower amounts of lactic, pyruvic and succinic acids. Preservation did not affect the evolution of volatile compounds. Cheeses from preserved milk showed reduced clotting time, slightly higher cheese yields and increased curd hardness and whey losses during cheesemaking. The taste panel accepted cheeses from preserved milk. These results support the interest of CO 2 -addition in preservation of milk for the manufacture of Spanish hard cheeses. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate the effect of lactoperoxidase enzyme system (LPS) on the shelf life of sheep milk at different storage temperatures. Bulk sheep milk samples were collected from a farm in Shambat, Khartoum State. They were transported immediately after milking to the microbiology laboratory, Department of Dairy Production, Faculty of Animal Production. University of Khartoum. The milk samples were divided into two parts: One part of the samples was preserved with lactoperoxidase enzymes system and the other was kept as control. The two parts (treated and control) were further subdivided into three portions each and stored at temperatures of 37 ° C, 25 ° C and 7 ° C. Chemical analysis was carried out to determine (fat, protein, lactose and solid non fat contents). Similarly clot on boiling test, titrtable acidity and microbial content (TBC, psychrotrophic, coliform and yeast and moulds counts) were done. The result revealed that the sheep milk contained 6. 59 % fat, 4. 11 % protein, 10. 05 % SNF, 5. 28 % lactose and 0. 21 % acidity. The shelf life of sheep milk samples was 6 - 7 hours, 7 - 8 hours and 9 - 10 days for the control samples kept at 37 º C, 25 º C and 7 º C, x respectively, and were 8 - 9 hours, 9 - 11 hours and 15 - 16 days for LPS treated milk samples. The result showed highly significant (P≤ 0. 001) effect of LPS on the shelf life, acidity and microbial content of sheep milk. However, the data indicated that the treated milk samples did not show any significant differences in acidity, TBC, coliform and psychrotrophic counts at different storage temperatures after preservation with LPS. This finding supports the previous reports that the lactoperoxidase enzyme system has a bactericidal effect against the Gram negative bacteria (psychrotrophic and coliform). It was concluded that the lactoperoxidase system is acceptable as a suitable chemical method for raw <b>milk</b> <b>preservation,</b> particularly in the developing countries where refrigeration facilities are unavailable to farmers and thereby increase the amount of milk available for further processing and subsequent marketing. The LPS can be used in marketing sheep milk for added commercial values (e. g. making cheeses). Good hygienic practices in milk production are important to the efficacy of the lactoperoxidase system and to the microbiological quality of the raw milk...|$|E

Tyrimo uždaviniai: 1. Išanalizuoti pieno supirkimo taisykles. 2. Atlikti mėginio ėmimo auditą supirkimo įmonėse: stebėti pieno supirkėjų darbą (pieno mėginio ėmimą, lydraščių pildymą, konteinerių plombavimą ir kt.). 3. Atlikti mėginio ėmimo procedūros pažeidimų analizę. Apibendrinant galima pasakyti, kad imant mėginius nesilaikoma pieno supirkimo taisyklių, jos grubiai pažeidžiamos. Taip pat nesilaikoma Reglamento 853 / 2004 nuostatų dėl higienos sąlygų punktuose. Išvados: 1. Pieno supirkimo taisyklės beveik kiekvienais metais tobulinamos įtraukiant naujų punktų, keičiamos naujomis nuostatomis, tačiau apsilankius supirkimo punktuose nustatyta, kad šių taisyklių nesilaiko 54 proc. supirkėjų. Todėl būtina griežčiau kontroliuoti, arba taisyklės turi būti pakoreguotos, pritaikytos realiam darbui, kad jomis praktiškai būtų galima vadovautis. 2. Atliekant auditą, stebint, kaip įvairiems kodams imami mėginiai, pagrindiniai pažeidimai būtų: - Pienas pernelyg trumpai maišomas (tai ypač svarbu pirmam kodui). - Netiriami pirminiai kokybės rodikliai (kvapas ir išvaizda iš visų priimtų mėginių). - Netinkamai laikomi konservantai (blogėja jų kokybė), tai pat konservuoti mėginiai netinkamai laikomi, nededami į šaldytuvus. - Nardinančioji maišyklė nardinama labai greitai, netolygiai, neteisingai maišoma, todėl paimamas nereprezentatyvus mėginys su mažesniu riebalų kiekiu. - Pieno mėginių ėmimo priemonės po panaudojimo nedezinfekuojamos. - Nesilaikoma higienos punktuose. 3. Atliekant mėginio ėmimo procedūros pažeidimų analizę galima teigti, kad pieno perdirbėjai neaprūpina pieno punktų reikiamomis priemonėmis, nepakeičia senų atgyvenusių priemonių naujais moderniais, nepaisoma pagrindinių pieno supirkimo taisyklių nuostatų, supirkėjams trūksta kvalifikacijos, jie nėra tinkamai supažindinti su supirkimo taisyklėmis ir higienos reglamento nuostatomis. The aim {{of study}} – To analyze milk {{purchase}} process (according to milk purchase rules), and summarize {{information about the}} most commonly made violations {{during the process of}} the milk sample taking and sending to a laboratory. Tasks of work: 1. To analyze the raw milk purchase regulations. 2. Carry out the audit of milk sample taking process in appropriate plants: to monitor milk collectors work process (milk sampling, filling in leading documents, sealing of containers, etc.). 3. To analyze milk sample taking process violations. Research took place in 16 odd milk collection stations across Lithuania. Milk collection stations in main companies, like UAB “Žemaitijos pienas”, “Pieno Upes” “Pieno Zvaigzdes” were chosen for the research. To follow the milk analysis were chosen 16 stations, that were taken for the thorough research (it was watched 130 of the sampling). To ensure confidentiality, the milk collecting stations were coded A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P milk collecting stations were monitored by code: - Audit of sample taking code 1; - Audit of sample taking code 2; - Audit of sample taking code 3; - Audit of sample taking code 4 Milk sampling audit was carried out in accordance with Lithuanian Republic legislation act 853 / 2004. During the audit we were also monitoring hygiene conditions in accordance with Regulation 853 / 2004. Special audit dedicated questionnaire was used as research method, also during the audit following points were monitored: testing of the primary milk quality indicators, the color of milk, milk smell, consistency of milk, milk temperature, taste, acidity, purity, density, sampling means cleanliness, sample taking devices disinfection, milk mixing length (time wise), the milk sample movement during the sample taking, immersion mixer plunge, <b>milk</b> <b>preservation</b> time, conditions of preservatives storing, milk samples placing to the containers, storage of preserved samples, dispatch period of samples, accompanying paperwork filling in and sealing of containers. Conclusions: 1. Milk purchasing rules are been changed almost every year, improving them, including new regulations and rules, replacing elements already out of date, but after a visit to purchase stations, it was found that 54 percent. purchasers do not comply with the rules. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly control, or rules should be adjusted, adapted to the actual work, that they can be practically followed. 2. During audit, whilst monitoring sample taking in accordance with different codes, the main violations noticed would be: - The period milk is been stirred too short (this is particularly important for the first code). - Primary milk quality indicators are not been investigated (53 % of the odor, color, 28 %, 38 % acidity, purity 76 % of total samples taken). - Preservatives as well as preserved milk samples are been stored incorrectly, not been placed to refrigerators (which negatively affects their quality). - Immersion mixer is been plunged too quickly, irregularly, mixing incorrectly, therefore the taken sample does not represent lower fat content milk sample the way it should. -Milk sampling tools are not being disinfected after use. - Failure to comply with hygiene requirements at stations. 3. Analyzing violations of milk sample taking procedure, one came to conclusion that the milk manufacturers are not providing milk purchase stations with necessary equipment, do not replace the old/ outdated equipment to up to standard/ modern one, basic milk purchase rules are being constantly ignored, milk collectors are mostly lacking required qualifications, they are not properly made aware of milk purchase the rules and Hygiene Regulations. Recommendations: 1. Milk processors often audit their existing buying items, to familiarize them with the changing elements, frequent milk collectors training. 2. State Food and Veterinary Authority should more closely examine and issue a qualification certificate. State Food and Veterinary Authority should be more active in audit points. 3. Dairy producers themselves should be more interested in buying dairy rules as to prevent arbitrary action by purchasers of milk...|$|E
