A beta for the PlayStation 4 version of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn debuted {{on the same day}} as the Japanese release of the console, February 22, 2014. Owners of the PlayStation 3 client were able upgrade to the digital PlayStation 4 client for free. A two-week free trial version first became available for PC on July 31, 2014, with PlayStation 3 and 4 versions following in December. This two-week limitation was removed in March 2017; free trial players can access all content up to level 35 with no time restrictions. The Chinese version, published and administrated by Shanda Games, premiered on August 29, 2014 featuring content through patch 2.16. It features separate servers from the other language versions of the game and a pay-per-hour micropayment billing system. The Korean version, distributed by Actoz Soft, launched in South Korea on August 14, 2015 with content from patch 2.2. This version carries a flexible subscription model with increments as low as 5 hours, similar to the Chinese release, up to 90 days, much like the traditional <b>monthly</b> <b>payment</b> plan.|$|E
40|$|Multiple life {{models are}} useful in {{multiple}} life insurance and multiple life annuities when the payment times of benets in these insurance products are contingent on the future life times {{of at least two}} people.

5000|$|A report {{released}} in April 2009 by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Office of Thrift Supervision indicated {{that fewer than}} half of loan modifications during 2008 reduced homeowner payments by more than 10%. Nearly one in four loan modifications during the fourth quarter of 2008 actually increased <b>monthly</b> <b>payments.</b> Nine months after modification, 26% of loans where <b>monthly</b> <b>payments</b> were reduced by 10% or more were again delinquent, versus 50% where payment amounts were unchanged. The U.S. Comptroller stated: [...] "... modification strategies that result in unchanged or increased <b>monthly</b> <b>payments</b> run the risk of unacceptably high re-default rates." ...|$|R

25|$|These {{securitization}} trusts may {{be structured}} by government-sponsored enterprises {{as well as}} by private entities that may offer credit enhancement features to mitigate the risk of prepayment and default associated with these mortgages. Since residential mortgage holders in the United States have the option to pay more than the required <b>monthly</b> <b>payment</b> (curtailment) or to pay off the loan in its entirety (prepayment), the monthly cash flow of an MBS is not known in advance, and an MBS therefore presents a risk to investors.|$|E
25|$|A {{cash flow}} ARM is a minimum payment option {{mortgage}} loan. This {{type of loan}} allows a borrower to choose their <b>monthly</b> <b>payment</b> from several options. These payment options usually include the option to pay at the 30-year level, 15-year level, interest only level, and a minimum payment level. The minimum payment level is usually lower than the interest only payment. This type of loan can result in negative amortization. The option to make a minimum payment is usually available only for the first several years of the loan.|$|E

More importantly, he gave benefits never before seen such as non-working rain days, Sundays and public holidays, and finally paid sick leave. The employment contract was individual and is done by free recruitment. Pay was, at the beginning, 20 sols (1 livre) per day, double the agricultural wage. Discontent from farm owners, however, forced Riquet to reduce pay to 15, then 12 sols per day. In 1668 he established the <b>monthly</b> <b>payment</b> of 10 livres.|$|E

25|$|Gould's {{campaign}} was ultimately successful and Congress canceled the subsidy. Owed {{a million dollars}} by Pacific Mail, Roach was now in financial difficulty himself as nervous creditors began calling for immediate settlement of their debts. Roach bluffed {{his way out of}} the crisis by declaring his readiness to settle any debt within three days of receiving a detailed statement. But he now had to decide whether to foreclose on Pacific Mail in order to secure at least some of his investment in the ships, or to renegotiate the payment plan. He chose the latter, accepting Pacific Mail's old ships for their scrap value as part payment, and reducing its <b>monthly</b> <b>payment</b> obligation from $75,000 to $35,000. Roach was embittered by the affair, but ironically, his handling of the crisis increased his reputation as a businessman able to deal with adverse circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the <b>monthly</b> <b>payment</b> is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E
