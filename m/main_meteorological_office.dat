50|$|In 1947, {{the central}} office of the Weather Bureau was moved to Marsman Building (opposite Pier 15 at the Port Area of Manila), while the Forecasting Center was {{transferred}} to the old Balagbag terminal (site of the first terminal of the Manila International Airport) and became the Manila <b>Main</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Office</b> (MMMO). The first post-war geophysical observatory of the Bureau was established in 1949 behind the campus of the University of the Philippines in Diliman. In 1948, a set of electromagnetic photorecording seismographs was installed in order to improve its seismological services. On April 5, 1949, the Philippines was admitted into the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with the Weather Bureau as its National Meteorological Service. In the same year, temperature, relative humility and pressure observations in the upper atmosphere were made twice daily by the Laoag, Cebu and Zamboanga field stations.|$|E
