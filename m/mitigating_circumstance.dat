25|$|Similarly, in many {{countries}} in jurisprudence, the defence of infancy {{is a form of}} defence by which a defendant argues that, at the time a law was broken, they were not liable for their actions and thus should not be held liable for a crime. Many courts recognise that defendants who are considered to be juveniles may avoid criminal prosecution on account of their age and in borderline cases the age of the offender is often held to be a <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> on the sentencing outcome before and after the McKoy (1990) decision. In McKoy (1990) the Supreme Court decided that the jurors did not have to find <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> unanimously. Results are reported based on a sample of North Carolina first-degree murder cases where the state sought the death penalty. Logistic regression is used to determine the importance of <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> as predictors of jury decision-making in North Carolina, controlling for the variety of other factors that influence that decision. The descriptive statistics show that the average number of <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> submitted and accepted had doubled in the post-McKoy cases. At the same time, the number of aggravating circumstances presented and submitted stayed about the same...|$|R

2500|$|Jurors in the {{sentencing}} phase are first asked {{to determine whether}} the defendant represents a future danger to society; only after ruling that [...] "there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society" [...] will the jury choose the sentence itself, by deciding whether there is [...] "sufficient <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance</b> or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather than a death sentence be imposed" [...] or not.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1986, an Italian {{court ruled}} the Palestinians guilty of [...] "carrying out a kidnap with {{terrorist}} intent, {{leading to the}} death of a hostage". The court did not refer to the hijackers as terrorists, rather calling them soldiers fighting for their ideals." [...] Three of the hijackers were sentenced to prison terms ranging from fifteen to thirty years. While Youssef Majed Molqi (the hijacker whom had shot Klinghoffer) received one of the longest sentences of the group, the court cited the conditions of his childhood growing up surrounded by violence in a Palestinian refugee camp as a <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{juridical}} {{notion of}} crimes against humanity was developed following the Holocaust. The sheer number of people murdered and the transnational nature of the mass killing shattered any notion of national sovereignty taking precedence over international law when prosecuting these crimes. There {{were a number of}} legal efforts established to bring Nazis and their collaborators to justice. Some of the higher-ranking Nazi officials were tried as part of the Nuremberg Trials, presided over by an Allied court; the first international tribunal of its kind. Other trials were conducted in the countries in which the defendants were citizens — in West Germany and Austria, many Nazis were let off with light sentences, with the claim of [...] "following orders" [...] ruled a <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance,</b> and many returned to society soon afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|For a British {{intellectual}} {{to oppose}} the Spanish Republic was virtually unheard of, as was Campbell's glorification of military strength and masculine virtues. His reputation suffered considerably as a result. According to Pearce, [...] "Having witnessed the cold-blooded murder {{of his friends and}} acquaintances, it was not likely that Campbell was going to support the cause of the perpetrators. Bearing these horrific facts in mind, it is clearly a gross oversimplification to dismiss Campbell's stance in the Spanish Civil War as evidence that he was a Fascist. Such an obvious <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance</b> was, however, almost universally overlooked by Campbell's detractors in England, all of whom appended the 'Fascist' label to his person, employing it, and the accompanying stereotypical effluvia with which such an epithet is associated, with the cynical glee of seasoned character assassins." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Breyer reiterated his {{disagreement}} with the Apprendi rule, and then identified specific reasons not to apply the Blakely holding to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. [...] The facts used to determine a defendant's sentence had historically been solely within a judge's purview, and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines should be treated no differently. [...] Creating a system that frustrated the goal of increased sentencing uniformity hardly seemed fair to defendants or {{to the public at}} large. [...] The fact that the Guidelines were administrative rules rather than statutes also was significant to Breyer. [...] And {{to the extent that the}} Guidelines did not adequately take into account an aggravating or <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance,</b> a judge was free to depart from the Guidelines range. [...] Thus, the defendant had every expectation that, despite the Guidelines, he might receive a sentence at or near the statutory maximum rather than at the top end of the Guidelines range.|$|E

50|$|Mitigating {{evidence}} {{is evidence that}} is provided (usually by the defendant in a criminal trial) {{in order to try}} to establish the presence of <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances.</b> The presence of <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> can reduce the punishment imposed for the offense.

40|$|Abstract. Electronic {{contracts}} are {{a means of}} representing agreed responsibilities and expected behaviour of autonomous agents {{acting on behalf of}} businesses. They can be used to regulate behaviour by providing negative consequences, penalties, where the responsibilities and expectations are not met, i. e. the contract is violated. However, long-term business relationships require some flexibility in the face of circumstances that do not conform to the assumptions of the contract, that is, <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances.</b> In this paper, we describe how contract parties can represent and enact policies on <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances.</b> As part of this, we require records of what has occurred within the system leading up to a violation: the provenance of the violation. We therefore bring together contract-based and provenance systems to solve the issue of <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances.</b> ...|$|R

The research is focused on examining the provisions of the New Criminal Code and on formulating critical opinions. The paper can be useful to theorists and practitioners in this field in terms of entering into force of the New Criminal Code.

60|$|Three or {{four times}} a week, for nearly a month, had he now enjoyed his unhallowed nocturnal rambles with perfect impunity--keeping them secret even from his friend Mr. Blyth, whose toleration, {{expansive}} as it was, he well knew would not extend to viewing leniently such offenses as haunting night-houses at two in the morning, while his father believed him to be safe in bed. But one <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance</b> can be urged in connection with the course of misconduct which he was now habitually following. He had still grace enough left to feel ashamed of his own successful duplicity, {{when he was in his}} mother's presence.|$|E

60|$|Another <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance</b> in Schubart's lot was the {{character}} of his gaoler. This humane person had himself tasted the tender mercies of 'paternal' government; he knew {{the nature of a}} dungeon better even than his prisoner. 'For four years,' we are told, 'he had seen no human face; his scanty food had been lowered to him through a trap-door; neither chair nor table were allowed him, his cell was never swept, his beard and nails were left to grow, the humblest conveniences of civilised humanity were denied him!'[67] On this man affliction had produced its softening, not its hardening influence: he had grown religious, and merciful in heart; he studied to alleviate Schubart's hard fate by every means within his power. He spoke comfortingly to him; ministered to his infirmities, and, in spite of orders, lent him all his books. These, it is true, were only treatises on theosophy and mystical devotion; but they were the best he had; and to Schubart, in his first lonely dungeon, they afforded occupation and solace.|$|E

It would add strength to our defence if we could show to the satisfaction of a jury of our peers that in heeding the sacred promptings of humanity we had acted with some small degree of common sense.

40|$|Anger {{may be more}} {{responsive}} than disgust to <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> in judgements of wrongdoing. We tested this hypothesis in two studies where we had participants envision circumstances that could serve to mitigate an otherwise wrongful act. In Study 1, participants provided moral judgements, and ratings of anger and disgust, {{to a number of}} transgressions involving either harm or bodily purity. They were then asked to imagine and report whether there might be any circumstances that would make it all right to perform the act. Across transgression type, and controlling for covariance between anger and disgust, levels of anger were found to negatively predict the envisioning of <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> for wrongdoing, while disgust was unrelated. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings to less serious transgressions, using a continuous measure of <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and demonstrated the impact of anger independent of deontological commitments. These findings highlight the differential relationship that anger and disgust have with the ability to envision mitigating factors...|$|R
