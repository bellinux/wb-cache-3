5|$|After {{debating whether}} {{abolition}} of slavery would best proceed gradually or at once, with compensation to loyal Union <b>men</b> <b>or</b> without, the Convention resolved to abolish slavery immediately without compensation on April 10, 1864. It abolished the viva voce voting {{and called for}} secret balloting for electing state officials. Immediately on its proclamation, the Constitution of 1864 was enforceable only in areas under Union control, but it would serve as Virginia's fundamental law until the Constitution of 1870 went into force.|$|E

At this time, the mainland emu was also threatened by overhunting, and Greenway cautioned that it could end up sharing the fate of its island relatives if no measures were taken in time.|$|E

50|$|Prior to February 2013, {{there were}} no laws that {{directly}} regulate cyberstalking in India. India's Information Technology Act of 2000 (IT Act) was a set of laws to regulate the cyberspace. However, it merely focused on financial crimes and neglected interpersonal criminal behaviours such as cyberstalking (Behera, 2010; Halder & Jaishankar, 2008; Nappinai, 2010). In 2013, Indian Parliament made amendments to the Indian Penal Code, introducing cyberstalking as a criminal offence. Stalking {{has been defined as}} a <b>man</b> <b>or</b> woman who follows <b>or</b> contacts a <b>man</b> <b>or</b> woman, despite clear indication of disinterest to such contact by the <b>man</b> <b>or</b> woman, or monitoring of use of internet or electronic communication of a <b>man</b> <b>or</b> a woman.

5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay <b>men</b> <b>or</b> lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E

The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever...

5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women and argued that it should also either belong to <b>men,</b> <b>or</b> not at all for both individuals.

In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
