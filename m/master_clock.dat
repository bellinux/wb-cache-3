25|$|There {{were many}} {{different}} types of war memorials erected in Queensland, however, clock towers were comparatively rare. The memorial at Ithaca is the earliest of this type of memorial, and {{is the only one of}} its type in Brisbane. The clock was manufactured by the well-known Synchronome Electric Company of Brisbane, initially driven by a <b>master</b> <b>clock</b> in the adjacent Ithaca Fire Station.|$|E
25|$|The Main Roads Department {{building}} was purpose-designed, accommodating the Main Roads Department's diverse uses in repetitive and rationalised floor plates. Although offices and administration areas comprised the majority, the building also included: basement car parking; food facilities {{for the staff}} - a large cafeteria with kitchen, kiosk for snacks, and lunch room; staff training facilities - a large, double-height auditorium with the latest projection equipment; a technical and recreation library; a room for displaying models of major Main Roads projects, and; a large air-conditioning plant and a caretaker's flat. The {{building was}} designed to incorporate modern office technology. The department's technical and commercial electronic data processing divisions were accommodated in the basement, including their {{state of the art}} computer, the largest in Queensland at the time. The computer was serviced by a special, independent air-conditioning system, designed to keep the computer room at a constant temperature and humidity, with the heat generated by the computer absorbed by the ornamental ponds {{at the front of the}} building. A system of vacuum message tubes connected all sections of the building and there were telephones and a <b>master</b> <b>clock</b> system, CCTV, a teleprinter system, a Xerox machine, and a dumbwaiter for the movement of files between floors.|$|E

40|$|In Relativity the Newtonian {{notions of}} {{absolute}} motion, absolute time, and absolute reference frame {{have been replaced}} with relative motion, relativistic time, and inertial reference frames in motion. Relativity is essentially rooted in the assumed isotropy of light speed in earth centered inertial (ECI) reference frame. Under the current procedures of satellite based time transfer, due to the assumed isotropy of light speed in ECI frame, an e-synchronous or relativistic time gets distributed to the <b>master</b> <b>clocks</b> of Timing laboratories located all over the globe. That is, the <b>master</b> <b>clocks</b> in all Timing Labs get e-synchronized instead of achieving absolute synchronization. It is erroneous to compute UTC from the weighted average of relativistic time maintained by these <b>master</b> <b>clocks.</b> The absolute synchronization mismatch between two e-synchronized clocks is given by the relation (D. U) /c 2, where D is the separation distance between the two clocks and U is the absolute velocity vector (unknown) of the earth. This absolute synchronization offset between the <b>master</b> <b>clocks</b> at two distant Timing Labs can be physically measured with an appropriate portable clock and such measurements {{can be used to}} determine the unknown absolute velocity U of earth. By incorporating the absolute velocity U in the time transfer software, we can account for the anisotropic speed of light in the ECI frame and thereby ensure the distribution of absolute time to different clocks all over the globe. In that case it should even be possible to achieve absolute synchronization in space clocks in deep space flights...|$|R
50|$|The clock {{underwent}} restoration in 1995. The <b>master</b> <b>clock's</b> {{quartz crystal}} {{was replaced by}} a radio clock, and the tape recorders were replaced by a compact disc player. Without funding for maintenance, the clock has been stopped since July 1, 2003.|$|R
500|$|The {{first floor}} gives {{visitors}} their first {{view of the}} interior of the rotunda. Below the cast-iron dome, the ceiling displays eight muses painted in 1886. For more than a century, the muses' artist remained anonymous; it is now known that it was Tommaso Juglaris, who created them in his Boston studio and never came to Michigan. [...] In the east wing of the first floor is a large clock, called a long-drop clock. It was once the building's <b>master</b> <b>clock</b> and is at least as old as the Capitol. The clock was restored in 1990 and is in working condition.|$|E
2500|$|Each Galileo {{satellite}} has two master passive {{hydrogen maser}} atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks which {{are independent of}} one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10−9 or 1/1,000,000,000 s) translates into a [...] positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate {{the time that it}} takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen <b>master</b> <b>clock</b> to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the <b>master</b> <b>clock</b> and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the <b>master</b> <b>clock</b> fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.|$|E
2500|$|The Casein kinase 1 epsilon {{protein is}} part of the {{mammalian}} oscillator, a group of proteins that keep cells on a roughly 24-hour schedule. This oscillator, or [...] "circadian clock," [...] is made up of a transcription-translation negative feedback loop (TTNFL) in which several proteins work in tandem, each regulating the others' expression to generate a roughly 24-hour cycle of both mRNA and protein levels. The TTFNL also generates roughly 24-hour rhythms of outputs such as levels of cellular hormone release. Daily oscillations in protein and mRNA transcription have been observed in many cells, including the mammalian <b>master</b> <b>clock</b> known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). However, unlike most circadian rhythm proteins, casein kinase 1 epsilon is constitutively active.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{telecommunications}} networks use highly accurate primary <b>master</b> <b>clocks</b> that {{must meet the}} international standards requirement for long term frequency accuracy better than 1 part in 1011. To get this performance, atomic clocks or GPS disciplined oscillators are normally used.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} synchronize to their <b>master,</b> <b>clocks</b> must individually determine the network transit {{time of the}} Sync messages. The transit time is determined indirectly by measuring round-trip time from each <b>clock</b> to its <b>master.</b> The <b>clocks</b> initiate an exchange with their master designed to measure the transit time [...] The exchange begins with a clock sending a Delay_Req message at time [...] to the master. The master receives and timestamps the Delay_Req at time [...] and responds with a Delay_Resp message. The master includes the timestamp [...] in the Delay_Resp message.|$|R
2500|$|An {{arpeggiator}} (arp) is {{a feature}} available on several synthesizers that automatically steps through {{a sequence of}} notes based on an input chord, thus creating an arpeggio. [...] The notes can often be transmitted to a MIDI sequencer for recording and further editing. [...] An arpeggiator may have controls for speed, range, and order in which the notes play; upwards, downwards, or in a random order. [...] More advanced arpeggiators allow the user to step through a pre-programmed complex sequence of notes, or play several arpeggios at once. [...] Some allow a pattern sustained after releasing keys: in this way, a sequence of arpeggio patterns may be built up over time by pressing several keys one after the other. Arpeggiators are also commonly found in software sequencers. [...] Some arpeggiators/sequencers expand features into a full phrase sequencer, which allows the user to trigger complex, multi-track blocks of sequenced data from a keyboard or input device, typically synchronized with the tempo of the <b>master</b> <b>clock.</b>|$|E

50|$|Spectracom {{was founded}} in Rochester, New York USA in 1972. Its first product was a WWVB Receiver-Comparator, an {{instrument}} used to calibrate oscillators with traceability to national standards. Other early products included WWVB frequency and time standards which offered atomic clock accuracy {{at a fraction of}} the cost. This led to widespread use of these products in vital communications networks such as two-way police radio simulcast systems and <b>master</b> <b>clocks</b> for accurate time stamping of data and events within emergency call centers such as 9-1-1 public safety answering points. When GPS signals became publicly available in the 1990s, Spectracom offered its time and frequency products with embedded GPS receivers. These products are known by the registered trademarks Ageless and NetClock, the second being a popular brand of network time servers and <b>master</b> <b>clocks.</b>|$|R
