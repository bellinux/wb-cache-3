It has no link to a physical aspect of how the chip would operate in real life at the <b>materials,</b> <b>physics,</b> and electrical engineering side. For this reason, {{the next step in}} the IC design process, physical design stage, is to map the RTL into actual geometric representations of all electronics devices, such as capacitors, resistors, logic gates, and transistors that will go on the chip.|$|E

25|$|A {{molecular}} dynamics simulation requires {{the definition of a}} potential function, or a description of the terms by which the particles in the simulation will interact. In chemistry and biology this is usually referred to as a force field and in <b>materials</b> <b>physics</b> as an interatomic potential. Potentials may be defined at many levels of physical accuracy; those most commonly used in chemistry are based on molecular mechanics and embody a classical mechanics treatment of particle-particle interactions that can reproduce structural and conformational changes but usually cannot reproduce chemical reactions.|$|E
