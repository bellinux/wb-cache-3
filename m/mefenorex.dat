50|$|<b>Mefenorex</b> (Rondimen, Pondinil, Anexate) is a {{stimulant}} drug {{which was}} used as an appetite suppressant. It is an amphetamine derivative which was developed in the 1970s and used for the treatment of obesity. <b>Mefenorex</b> produces amphetamine as a metabolite, and has been withdrawn in many countries despite having only mild stimulant effects and relatively little abuse potential.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} prodrugs of {{amphetamine}} and/or methamphetamine exist, and include amfecloral, amphetaminil, benzphetamine, clobenzorex, D-deprenyl, dimethylamphetamine, ethylamphetamine, fencamine, fenethylline, fenproporex, furfenorex, lisdexamfetamine, <b>mefenorex,</b> mesocarb, prenylamine, selegiline, and tranylcypromine.|$|E
40|$|An ultra high {{performance}} liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–ESI–MS/MS) screening method for the direct analysis in oral fluid (OF) of 24 drugs, including new synthetic cannabinoids and so-called “smart” designer drugs, {{in a single}} chromatographic run was set up. Benzylpiperazine, methylone, 5, 6 -methylenedioxy- 2 -aminoindane (MDAI), fenproporex, 4 -fluoroamphetamine (4 -FA), 4 -methyl-N-ethylcathinone (4 -MEC), 4 -methylamphetamine (4 -MA), methylbenzodioxolylbutanamine (MBDB), mephedrone, methylthioamphetamine (MTA), methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), <b>mefenorex,</b> nabilone, furfenorex, clobenzorex, JWH- 200, AM 694, JWH- 250, JWH- 073, JWH- 018, JWH- 019, JWH- 122, HU 210 and CP 47497 were determined in a chromatographic run of 9 min only with no sample pre-treatment, after addition of ISs and dilution in mobile phase A. This method {{is designed to be}} applied to 250 L of OF sample, anyway is suitable to be used on smaller volumes (till 100 L). LODs vary from 1 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL. No interfering peaks were observed due to similar analytes, common therapeutic drugs or endogenous compounds. Matrix effect, although present especially for mephedrone, is acceptable, allowing the detection of the compounds at the LODs described. The developed method was applied on 400 real OF samples from on-site tests performed by police officers...|$|E
40|$|Four pigeons {{were trained}} to discnminate {{injections}} of d-am-phetamine (AMPH; 2. 0 mg/kg i. m.) from saline with responding maintained under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule offood delivery. When drugs used therapeutioally as anoreccs were tested, they con-sistendy produced greater than 80 % of AMPH-appropnate re-sponding. The order of potency for substifuting for AMPH was: mazindol> AMPH = phenmetrazine = phentermine> chior-phentern*ie = phendimetrazine = dlethyipropion> clortermine = <b>mefenorex.</b> Other anorectics such as phenyipropanolamine (0. 3 - 30. 0 mg/kg) and fenfluramine (1. 0 -i 7. 0 mg/kg) only sub-stituted paralIy for AMPH whereas benzphetamine (1. 0 -i 00. 0 mg/kg) resufted primarily in saline-appropriate responding. Corn-pounds related to AMPH in biochemical mechanism of action or psychomotor stimulant activity also were tested. Methyipheni-date (0. 1 - 3. 0 mg/kg), piribedil (0. 3 -i 7. 0 mg/kg) and nisoxetine (0. 03 - 1. 0 mg/kg) shared discriminative stimulus properties with AMPH whereas bupropion (1. 0 - 30. 0 mg/kg) and propyihexed-nne (1 0. 0 - 1 00. 0 mg/kg) substituted for AMPH in two of three pigeons tested. In contrast, caffeine and fenetylline resulted prindpally in saline-appropriate responding. Compounds from pharmacological classes not related to AMPH, such as morphine, diazepam and phencydildine, failed to substitute for AMPH. In general, compounds with anorectic and/or stimulant properties shared discriminative stimulus properties with AMPH. The DS properties of psychomotor stimulants have been studied extensively in several species, including pigeons (de l...|$|E
