500|$|Batman {{intercepts}} a drug shipment, provides Rachel {{with evidence}} against Falcone, and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, {{one of the}} few honest cops left in Gotham, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets with Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a fear-inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane (which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the word [...] "Scarecrow"), and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating [...] "the Scarecrow", Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply. He drugs Rachel with it, but Batman saves her and subdues Crane, who claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers the antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. Ducard reappears at Bruce's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful <b>microwave</b> <b>emitter</b> from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him.|$|E

30|$|At present, {{there is}} a {{considerable}} interest in development of compact emitters of high-frequency radiation in the terahertz (THz) and sub-THz spectral range. Various physical mechanisms of THz generation have been suggested and investigated in recent years. Most of these mechanisms rely on either purely optical THz radiation generation (e.g. CO 2 laser-pumped THz molecular lasers) or combination of optical and electrical excitation (e.g. using laser difference frequency photomixing or laser-excited uni-travelling carrier photodetectors). Development of compact sources of THz radiation with purely electronic excitation still presents a formidable challenge.

Unfortunately they were interrupted by the Autobots, and Wheeljack used a <b>microwave</b> <b>emitter</b> to knock her out. She was shackled to a table so Wheeljack and Ratchet could vivisect her.

While the Autobots were distracted fighting the newcomer, Rick freed Sephie. She, in turn, released Cliffjumper, knowing that he would be compelled to help the Decepticons while she was free to attack Blackrock. She used Groove's fuel evaporating power on the Centurion, which had the side effect of sending it into a meltdown, and Sephie was forced to fly the mech high into the air so its explosion wouldn't kill her friends. She herself survived the explosion thanks to Elita-One's time bubble power, though she was shocked when Blackrock announced that she was fired.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} film of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, Batman Begins (2005), they are called the League of Shadows. The foot {{soldiers}} are martial artists who utilized a number of martial arts including ninjutsu, jujitsu and various forms of kung fu. A mysterious man calling himself Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) recruited and trained Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) for a man that he called their leader Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) for an unspecified period of time. He told Wayne {{the story of how}} the injustice of his wife being taken from him led him on the path of the League of Shadows. Bruce rejected the League when he was ordered to kill a criminal to prove his commitment to justice and he learned that the League wanted him to lead a mission to destroy Gotham City. The League's base was destroyed in the subsequent battle as Wayne fought the man that he believed to be Ra's al Ghul and left him for dead. The League later enacted their plan to destroy Gotham and Ducard revealed to Wayne that he was Ra's al Ghul at Bruce Wayne's birthday party. They attacked Gotham because they felt that the city had become decadent. Ra's al Ghul said that the League had worked to restore the world to balance throughout history as human civilization achieved decadence around the world. Ra's stated [...] "We sacked Rome, loaded trade ships with plague rats, burned London to the ground." [...] The plan was to use the stolen Wayne Enterprises <b>microwave</b> <b>emitter</b> to vaporize Scarecrow's (Cillian Murphy) toxin and have the city's inhabitants tear each other apart in a state of fear.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) {{conversion of the}} energy released during the planetary entry phase of an interplanetary vehicle trajectory. The effect of MHD conversion is multi-fold. It reduces and redirects heat transferred to the vehicle, and regenerates the dissipated energy in reusable and transportable form. A vehicle on an interplanetary mission carries about 10, 000 kWh of kinetic energy per ton of its mass. This energy is dissipated into heat during the planetary atmospheric entry phase. For instance, the kinetic energy of Mars Pathfinder was about 4220 kWh. Based on the loss in velocity, Mars Pathfinder lost about 92. 5 % of that energy during the plasma-sustaining entry phase that is approximately 3900 kWh. An ideal MHD generator, distributed over the probe surface of Mars Pathfinder could convert more than 2000 kWh of this energy loss into electrical energy, which correspond to more than 50 % of the kinetic energy loss. That means that the heat transferred to the probe surface can be reduced by at least 50 % if the converted energy is adequately stored, or re-radiated, or directly used. Therefore, MHD conversion could act not only as the power generating, but also as the cooling process. In this paper we describe results of preliminary experiments with light and <b>microwave</b> <b>emitters</b> powered by model magnetohydrodynamic generators and discuss method for direct use of converted energy...|$|R
