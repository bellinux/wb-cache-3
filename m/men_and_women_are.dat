5|$|In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} make the claim for gender {{equality}} using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> equal, Wollstonecraft contends that <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law. For Wollstonecraft, <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} punishment by decapitation in Halifax is the beheading of John of Dalton in 1286, but official records were not maintained until the parish registers began in 1538.

5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. <b>Men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E

5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{acting on}} these {{feelings}} and perceptions, Stanton joined Mott, Mott's sister Martha Coffin Wright, Jane Hunt {{and a handful}} of other women in Seneca Falls. Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted a Declaration of Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed that <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no small measure, because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 percent of cases can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. <b>Men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression.
