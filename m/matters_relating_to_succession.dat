60|$|Having {{brought my}} Remarks to this Period, I design'd to have drop'd my Pen immediately, but {{considering}} that a Judicious Reader will expect I should advance something {{by way of}} Principle to justify the Reflexions I have made. I must add a Word or two more concerning the unjust, as well as unpolitick Proceedings {{of those who have}} been deluded by a Foreign Power to bring Destruction to their own native Country. And in the first place I must deliver my Thoughts as to the Cause in General. The Question of Hereditary, was not so well clear'd at the Revolution, but that many very discerning and well meaning Men might be drawn into a Belief, that lineal and immediate Right was part of the Divine Law, and so not dispensable. This was my Opinion in the Beginning, and it was a Principle which carried me through the Wars this Twenty Nine Years in Favour of King James, even at those Times, when I was fully convinc'd that France had no real Design to re-establish him. But afterwards when I began to look narrowly into the Question of Hereditary Right, and saw that the Notion of Jure Divino was only an assum'd Principle to buoy up the Faction. I by Degrees slacken'd in my Zeal, and having no other Nation of Government, then by submitting to the Supream National Power, where the Law of God was silent, I found this an effectual Means to quiet my Conscience. However I still persisted and follow'd the Pretender's Cause, the Success of the Roman-Catholick Interest provoking me to it: For I imagin'd that Salvo ought to weigh down in Practise, where other <b>Matters</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> <b>Succession</b> were still under Controversy; but when I took under serious Consideration the Practise of our Ancestors, and how in all Ages both Church and State came frequently into Non-Hereditary Measures, where I run over the String of Disappointments King James had met withal by the Politic Management of France. When I reflected what Misery had befallen, and was like to befall these Kings by adhering to the besoted Notion of Hereditary Right, I put the whole Controversy upon the Issue of Religion, and it plainly appear'd to me, that no Roman Catholick was oblig'd to oppose the Revolutionary Measures in Conscience, much less in Policy. I was fully satisfy'd in the first Part of the Enquiry by that unanswerable Piece lately printed, call'd, A Roman Catholick System of Allegiance. As for the latter Part, let the Tory and Roman Catholick Party sum up their Losses since 1688, and it will convince 'em how foolishly they acted. Thus settled in my Principles in regard of Loyalty, I design'd to pay an intire and unlimited Obedience to the present Constitution; as to my Religion, which I own is not conformable to that by Law Established. I will make a discreet Use of that Indulgence the Government is pleas'd to allow; and if Providence thinks fit to make me Suffer upon that Score, no rational Man will blame my Zeal till he does convince me of my Mistake.|$|E

Succession planning is a key issue influencing the sustainability of these family businesses. According to research, approximately 30 % of businesses fail due <b>to</b> <b>matters</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>succession</b> planning (Grote, 2003). Further research indicated that approximately 50 % of family businesses do not have adequate succession plans in place. Hence, family businesses are exposed to significant risk in sustainability due <b>to</b> insufficient <b>succession</b> planning. An effective approach <b>to</b> <b>succession</b> planning in a family business increases the chance of success of a family business in both the short and long term. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a better understanding of approaches <b>to</b> <b>succession</b> planning in two family businesses in East London, South Africa. This purpose was to improve the commercial viability of family businesses and improve the body of knowledge from an academic perspective. To this end, a detailed literature study was conducted on family businesses and succession planning. A qualitative case study research paradigm was implemented to ascertain the nature of the approaches adopted by the two businesses. An interview process was conducted with the incumbent founders (fathers) and successors (sons) of the family business. This process suggested that each business requires a unique approach <b>to</b> <b>succession</b> plan which may include aspects of formal and informal processes. It is necessary to understand the nature of the family business, its interrelated relationships and context to adequately determine the success of a succession approach. It is for this reason that families aspiring long term sustainability should invest in effective succession planning approaches that integrate the nuances of the individual family busines...|$|R

For instance, the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the Sharia law. For Muslims, these tribunals deal with questions of marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills. For non-Muslims, personal status jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody. Catholics can additionally appeal before the Vatican Rota court.|$|R
