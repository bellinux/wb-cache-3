5|$|Despite his improvements, Alexios did {{not have}} enough {{manpower}} to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor. Having been impressed by the abilities of the Norman cavalry at Dyrrhachium, he sent ambassadors west to ask for reinforcements from Europe. This mission was deftly accomplished– at the Council of Piacenza in 1095, Pope Urban II was impressed by Alexios's appeal for help, which spoke of the suffering of the Christians of the east and hinted at a possible union of the eastern and western churches. Pope Urban was concerned with increasing restlessness of the martial nobility in Western Europe, who, currently deprived of major enemies, were causing chaos throughout the countryside. Alexios's appeal offered a <b>means</b> <b>not</b> only to redirect the energy of the knights to benefit the Church, but also to consolidate the authority of the Pope over all Christendom and to gain the east for the See of Rome.|$|E

25|$|In {{ancient and}} medieval era Indian texts, the term brahmacharya {{is a concept}} with a more complex meaning {{indicating}} an overall lifestyle conducive {{to the pursuit of}} sacred knowledge and spiritual liberation. Brahmacharya is a <b>means,</b> <b>not</b> an end. It usually includes cleanliness, ahimsa, simple living, studies, meditation, and voluntary restraints on certain foods, intoxicants, and behaviors (including sexual behavior).|$|E
25|$|According to the Pāli Canon & Āgama (the Early Buddhist scriptures), {{there is}} no any saying that same or {{opposite}} gender relations {{have anything to do}} with sexual misconduct, and some Theravada monks express that same-gender relations do not violate the rule to avoid sexual misconduct, which <b>means</b> <b>not</b> having sex with someone under age (thus protected by their parents or guardians), someone betrothed or married and who have taken vows of religious celibacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{well-known}} eightfold path {{consists of}} the understanding that this world is floating and unsatisfying, and how craving keeps us tied to this floating world; a friendly and compassionate attitude to others; a correct way of behaving; mind-control, which <b>means</b> <b>not</b> feeding on negative thoughts, and nurturing positive thoughts; constant awareness of the feelings and responses which arise; {{and the practice of}} dhyana, meditation. The tenfold path adds the right (liberating) insight, and liberation from rebirth.|$|E

25|$|Esperanto {{has some}} slang {{in the sense}} of in-group talk as well. Some of this is borrowed; for example, fajfi priio (to whistle about something) <b>means</b> <b>not</b> to care about it, as in German. Other {{expressions}} deriving from Esperanto history or dealing with specifically Esperantist concerns have arisen over the years. A volapukaĵo, for example, is something needlessly incomprehensible, derived from the name of the more complex and less immediately readable constructed language Volapük, which preceded Esperanto by a few years and was replaced by it.|$|E
25|$|United Nations: Fundamentally, {{poverty is}} the {{inability}} of having choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It <b>means</b> <b>not</b> having enough to feed and clothe a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one's food or a job to earn one's living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living in marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation.|$|E
25|$|Science-fiction author Orson Scott Card {{was hired}} to write a novelization of the film based on the {{screenplay}} and discussions with Cameron. He wrote back-stories for Bud, Lindsey and Coffey as a <b>means</b> <b>not</b> only of helping the actors define their roles, but also to justify some of their behavior and mannerisms in the film. Card also wrote the aliens as a colonizing species which preferentially sought high-pressure deep-water worlds to build their ships as they traveled further into the galaxy (their mothership was in orbit {{on the far side}} of the moon). The NTIs' knowledge of neuroanatomy and nanoscale manipulation of biochemistry was responsible for many of the deus ex machina aspects of the film.|$|E

25|$|The {{delegation}} to St. Petersburg {{brought with it}} a letter signed {{in the name of}} the Khutuktu and the “four khans of Khalkha.” It asked for assistance against the Chinese, including arms, and implied that Russian troops would be needed against a Chinese unit which the Mongolians believed was at that moment advancing into Mongolia. To coax a commitment, the Mongols promised economic concessions in return. The letter itself was unclear as to the specific type of relationship the Mongols wished to establish with Russia. Russia wanted to include Outer Mongolia in its sphere of influence and as a buffer state offering protection from China and Japan, but never planned to make it a part of her empire. The Russian government decided to support, by diplomatic rather than by military <b>means,</b> <b>not</b> full independence for Mongolia, but autonomy within the Qing empire. It did, however, increase its consular guard in Urga to protect the returning delegation.|$|E
25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it <b>means,</b> <b>not</b> what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E
25|$|The code {{of ethics}} that is {{affiliated}} with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers {{like to hear from}} advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which <b>means</b> <b>not</b> using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.|$|E

As early as 1902, US Forester E. M. Griffith wrote [...] "Forest protection <b>means</b> <b>not</b> only increasing the rainfall, but more important still, conserving the water supply.

500|$|Norman Shrapnel, in his {{obituary}} of Powell, speculates {{whether the}} author ever regretted creating the [...] "maddening, mysterious, apparently indestructible Widmerpool" [...] and, like Ali, expresses disappointment with {{the manner of}} the character's death. Conversely, in a biographical sketch of Powell, Michael Barber believes that Widmerpool's demise accords with a principal theme of the novels, expressed in Casanova's Chinese Restaurant (fifth book in the sequence), that [...] "in the end most things in life—perhaps all things—turn out to be appropriate". Michael Gorra, reviewing Powell's autobiography To Keep the Ball Rolling, presents the view that, while the novels are built around Widmerpool, they are not essentially about him: [...] "He is an organising principle, a <b>means,</b> <b>not</b> an end, and serves primarily to establish a system of judgement." ...|$|E
