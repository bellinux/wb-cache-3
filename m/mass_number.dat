5|$|The {{most common}} decay mode of a {{radioisotope}} of zinc with a <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> lower than 66 is electron capture. The decay product resulting from electron capture is an isotope of copper.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} decay mode of a {{radioisotope}} of zinc with <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> higher than 66 is beta decay (β−), which produces an isotope of gallium.|$|E
5|$|At least 34 {{isotopes}} of hafnium {{have been}} observed, ranging in <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> from 153 to 186. The five stable isotopes {{are in the}} range of 176 to 180. The radioactive isotopes' half-lives range from only 400ms for 153Hf, to 2.0petayears (1015 years) for the most stable one, 174Hf.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{isotopes}} with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> at {{or below}} 88 decay primarily by positron emission (proton → neutron) to form strontium (Z = 38) isotopes. Yttrium isotopes with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> at or above 90 decay primarily by electron emission (neutron → proton) to form zirconium (Z = 40) isotopes. Isotopes with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> at or above 97 are also known to have minor decay paths of β− delayed neutron emission.|$|R
5000|$|There are no stable atoms with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> 5 or 8. There are stable atoms {{with all}} other <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> up to 208 with the {{exceptions}} of 147 and 151. (Bismuth-209 {{was found to be}} radioactive in 2003, but with a half-life of 1.9×1019 years.) ...|$|R
50|$|All odd <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> {{have only}} one beta decay stable nuclide.|$|R
5|$|Copernicium {{was first}} created on February 9, 1996, at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. This element {{was created by}} firing {{accelerated}} zinc-70 nuclei at a target made of lead-208 nuclei in a heavy ion accelerator. A single atom (a second was reported but {{was found to have}} been based on data fabricated by Ninov) of copernicium was produced with a <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> of 277.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the great}} rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the {{primordial}} isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given odd <b>mass</b> <b>number,</b> there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since {{there is not a}} difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. Beryllium is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Ghiorso et al. {{obtained}} the first isotope of lawrencium by irradiating californium (mostly californium-252) with boron-10 and boron-11 ions. The <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> of this isotope was not clearly established (possibly 258 or 259) at the time. In 1965, 256Lr was synthesized by Flyorov et al. from 243Am and 18O. Thus IUPAC recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium.|$|E
5|$|The element {{also has}} 18 nuclear isomers, with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> of 133 to 142, 144, 148, 149, 152, and 154 (some <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> {{have more than}} one isomer). The most stable of them is promethium-148m, with a {{half-life}} of 43.1days; this is longer than the half-lives of the ground states of all promethium isotopes, except for promethium-143 to 147. In fact, promethium-148m has a longer half-life than its ground state, promethium-148.|$|R
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} have odd atomic numbers; hence, their {{isotopes}} must be either odd–odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or odd–even (proton number is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even <b>mass</b> <b>numbers,</b> whereas odd–even nuclei have odd <b>mass</b> <b>numbers.</b> Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, {{and are therefore more}} strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|R
50|$|Copernicium {{has been}} {{observed}} as decay products of flerovium. Flerovium currently has seven known isotopes, all but one (the lightest, 284Fl) {{of which have been}} shown to undergo alpha decays to become copernicium nuclei, with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> between 281 and 286. Copernicium isotopes with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> 281, 284, 285, and 286 to date have only been produced by flerovium nuclei decay.Parent flerovium nuclei can be themselves decay products of livermorium or oganesson. To date, no other elements have been known to decay to copernicium.|$|R
5|$|In his research, Chadwick {{continued}} {{to probe the}} nucleus. In 1925, the concept of spin had allowed physicists to explain the Zeeman effect, but it also created unexplained anomalies. At {{the time it was}} believed that the nucleus consisted of protons and electrons, so nitrogen's nucleus, for example, with a <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. This gave it the right mass and charge, but the wrong spin.|$|E
5|$|The element {{also has}} 42 nuclear isomers, with masses of 150, 151, 153–162, 166–180 (not every <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> {{corresponds}} {{to only one}} isomer). The most stable of them are lutetium-177m, with half-life of 160.4 days and lutetium-174m, with half-life of 142 days; this is longer than half-lives of the ground states of all radioactive lutetium isotopes, except only for lutetium-173, 174, and 176.|$|E
5|$|Twenty radioisotopes of {{californium}} {{have been}} characterized, {{the most stable}} being californium-251 with a half-life of 898 years, californium-249 with a half-life of 351 years, californium-250 with a half-life of 13.08 years, and californium-252 with a half-life of 2.645 years. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than a year, {{and the majority of}} these have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes. The isotopes of californium range in <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> from 237 to 256.|$|E

40|$|The PIA {{instrument}} {{aboard the}} Giotto spacecraft (a {{time of flight}} spectrometer) has been presented elsewhere. The mass spectra {{used in this analysis}} were decoded and <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> assigned according to the presence of carbon and silver, using the global values for these elements in their spectral absence. The results presented here were obtained using a frequency of occurrence based on analysis which correlated how often <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> appear in the mass spectra and which <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> tend to occur together in the same spectra; no amplitude information is utilized. The data are presented as plots of mass vs coincident mass for different subsets of the PIA data set, with both axes having units of atomic mass. Frequency contours are plotted at approximately five percent contour intervals, relative to the maximum AMU occurrence in that plot. The plots presented are symmetrical about the matrix diagonal, i. e., every mass is coincident with itself in a given spectra...|$|R
5|$|Like other lanthanides, many isotopes, {{especially}} isotopes with odd <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> and neutron-poor isotopes like 152Eu, {{have high}} cross sections for neutron capture, often {{high enough to}} be neutron poisons.|$|R
5|$|Twenty-eight {{artificial}} isotopes of zirconium {{have been}} synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 78 to 110. 93Zr is the longest-lived artificial isotope, with a half-life of 1.53×106years. 110Zr, the heaviest isotope of zirconium, {{is the most}} radioactive, with an estimated half-life of 30milliseconds. Radioactive isotopes at or above <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> 93 decay by electron emission, whereas those at or below 89 decay by positron emission. The only exception is 88Zr, which decays by electron capture.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium has {{at least}} 20 {{metastable}} ("excited") isomers ranging in <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> from 78 to 102. Multiple excitation states have been observed for 80Y and 97Y. While most of yttrium's isomers {{are expected to be}} less stable than their ground state, 78mY, 84mY, 85mY, 96mY, 98m1Y, 100mY, and 102mY have longer half-lives than their ground states, as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than isomeric transition.|$|E
5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> from 164 to 197. The most stable {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241years, making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E
50|$|There are 32 known {{isotopes}} of astatine, with atomic <b>masses</b> (<b>mass</b> <b>numbers)</b> of 191 and 193-223. No stable or even long-lived astatine isotope is known, and no such isotope {{is expected}} to exist.|$|R
50|$|During the Soviet period, many {{leaders of}} the {{movement}} were persecuted and spent years in prisons and concentration camps. Pentecostals in <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> were given 20-25 year prison terms and many perished there, including Voronaev.|$|R
50|$|All other {{isotopes}} have half-lives {{less than}} 12 days, most less than 20 hours. The shortest-lived isotope is 148Xe with a half-life of 408 ns. Its 41 isotopes have <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> ranging from 108 to 148.|$|R
5|$|At least 32 {{synthetic}} isotopes of yttrium {{have been}} observed, and these range in atomic <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> from 76 to 108. The least stable {{of these is}} 106Y with a half-life of >150ns (76Y has a half-life of >200ns) and the most stable is 88Y with a half-life of 106.626days. Apart from the isotopes 91Y, 87Y, and 90Y, with half-lives of 58.51days, 79.8hours, and 64hours, respectively, all the other isotopes have half-lives of {{less than a day}} and most of less than an hour.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{isotopes}} of berkelium {{were identified}} with mass numbers 238–252. Only 249Bk {{is available in}} large quantities; it has a relatively short half-life of 330 days and emits mostly soft β-particles, which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak (1.45% with respect to β-radiation), but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. 247Bk is an alpha-emitter with a long half-life of 1,380 years, {{but it is hard}} to obtain in appreciable quantities; it is not formed upon neutron irradiation of plutonium because of the β-stability of isotopes of curium isotopes with <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> below 248.|$|E
5|$|Further {{separation}} {{was carried}} out {{in the presence of a}} citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH≈3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperature. The chromatographic separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for characteristic X-rays and conversion electron signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report, but was later established as 243.|$|E
50|$|Thirty-three {{artificial}} radioisotopes {{of tungsten}} have been characterized with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> ranging from 157 to 194, {{the most stable}} of which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2 days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1 days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4 days and 178W with a half-life of 21.6 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 24 hours, {{and most of these}} have half-lives that are less than 8 minutes. Tungsten also has 11 meta states with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> of 158, 179, with 3, 180, with 2, 183, 185, 186, with 2, and 190, the most stable being 179m1W (t1/2 6.4 minutes).|$|R
5000|$|Hassium {{has been}} {{observed}} as decay products of darmstadtium. Darmstadtium currently has eight known isotopes, {{all of which have}} been shown to undergo alpha decays to become hassium nuclei, with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> between 263 and 277. Hassium isotopes with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> 266, 273, 275, and 277 to date have only been produced by darmstadtium nuclei decay. Parent darmstadtium nuclei can be themselves decay products of copernicium, flerovium, or livermorium. To date, no other elements have been known to decay to hassium. For example, in 2004, the Dubna team identified hassium-277 as a final product in the decay of livermorium via an alpha decay sequence: ...|$|R
5000|$|Hornets - Zurg's robotic foot soldiers, {{extremely}} expendable and lousy shots. They {{always get}} vaporized in <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> by Lightyear's team. Hornets come in different models, {{but the most}} frequently seen are yellow and of average height.|$|R
5|$|In 1962–1966, {{there were}} {{attempts}} in the United States to produce transplutonium isotopes using {{a series of}} six underground nuclear explosions. Small samples of rock were extracted from the blast area immediately after the test to study the explosion products, but no isotopes with <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> greater than 257 could be detected, despite predictions that such isotopes would have relatively long half-lives of α-decay. This inobservation was attributed to spontaneous fission owing to the large speed of the products and to other decay channels, such as neutron emission and nuclear fission.|$|E
5|$|The known {{isotopes}} {{of plutonium}} range in <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> from 228 to 247. The primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers {{lower than the}} most stable isotope, plutonium-244, are spontaneous fission and alpha emission, mostly forming uranium (92 protons) and neptunium (93 protons) isotopes as decay products (neglecting {{the wide range of}} daughter nuclei created by fission processes). The primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium-244 is beta emission, mostly forming americium (95 protons) isotopes as decay products. Plutonium-241 is the parent isotope of the neptunium decay series, decaying to americium-241 via beta emission.|$|E
5|$|The neutron-capture {{product of}} fermium-257, 258Fm, {{undergoes}} spontaneous fission with a half-life of just 370(14)microseconds; 259Fm and 260Fm are also unstable {{with respect to}} spontaneous fission (t1/2= 1.5(3)s and 4ms respectively). This means that neutron capture cannot {{be used to create}} nuclides with a <b>mass</b> <b>number</b> greater than 257, unless carried out in a nuclear explosion. As 257Fm is an α-emitter, decaying to 253Cf, and no known fermium isotopes undergo beta minus decay (which would produce isotopes of the next element, mendelevium), fermium is also the last element that can be prepared by a neutron-capture process.|$|E
5|$|There are 19 {{isotopes}} of neptunium with <b>mass</b> <b>numbers</b> from 225 to 244; {{they are}} all highly radioactive. The most popular among scientists are long-lived 237Np (t1/2 = 2.20 years) and short-lived 239Np, 238Np (t1/2 ~ 2 days).|$|R
5|$|There are 39 known {{isotopes}} of astatine, with atomic <b>masses</b> (<b>mass</b> <b>numbers)</b> of 191–229. Theoretical modeling {{suggests that}} 37 more isotopes could exist. No stable or long-lived astatine isotope has been observed, nor is one expected to exist.|$|R
