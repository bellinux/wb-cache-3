25|$|The {{exhibition}} {{focused on}} the <b>maturity</b> <b>period</b> of the groundbreaking and multi-faceted artist, exhibiting on woman, bird and star themes of Miró, who was heavily inspired by his observations on the Mediterranean geography and people throughout his career. The exhibition provided the opportunity for viewers to understand the symbolic language of the artist through a rich selection of artworks in different mediums such as oil on canvas, sculpture, lithography and ceramics. With this exhibition, art enthusiasts in Istanbul {{will be able to}} witness the various interpretations of the energy the artist drew from the Mediterranean culture. ‘Joan Miró. Women, Birds, Stars’ consists of a total of 125 works – oil and acrylic paintings, lithographs, etchings, and assemblages with relevant models and drawings as well as his textiles and ceramic works. Joan Miró. Women, Birds, Stars’ comprised a total of 125 works.|$|E

40|$|Various intercrops were {{examined}} in an alternate row pattern with pigeonpea or sorghum on both Alfisol (red soil) and Vertisol (black soil). The slow-establishing and later-maturing pigeonpea combined well with earlier cereals and legumes to give very large yield advantages {{as measured by the}} Land Equivalent Ratio. In the pigeonpea/cereal combinations, the earlier the cereal the bigger the yield advantage tended to be, attributed to improved use of resources over time as the difference in <b>maturity</b> <b>periods</b> of the component crops increased. Sorghum was generally more competitive than pigeonpea and intercropping advantages tended to be less. But even where there was little difference in <b>maturity</b> <b>periods</b> of the component crops, both sorghum/legume and sorghum/cereal combinations gave substantial and statistically significant advantages, suggesting that improved ‘spatial’ use of resources was also importan...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the physical, {{mechanical}} and chemical properties of medlar during physiological <b>maturity</b> and ripening <b>period</b> were determined. The physical properties such as geometric mean diameter, sphericity, bulk and true densities, porosity, projected area and colour characteristics were measured during physiological <b>maturity</b> and ripening <b>period</b> of medlar. Mechanical properties such as rupture force, deformation and rupture energy and chemical properties (total soluble solid content, titratable acidity and pH) of medlar fruit were determined. The geometric mean diameter, sphericity, surface area and fruit density of medlar decreased, while, bulk density increased at ripening period. The fruit density of medlars increases of 10. 9 % occurred while bulk density and surface area decrease of 19. 7 % and 23. 81 % observed from physiological <b>maturity</b> to ripening <b>period</b> of medlar fruit, respectively.

30|$|The paddy yield was {{harvested}} at {{four different}} <b>maturity</b> <b>periods</b> (harvesting ages) at 25  days after 50 % flowering (DAFF), 30 DAFF, 35 DAFF and 40 DAFF, {{at each level}} of MOP application. In the present study, the rice variety reached 50 % flowering stage in about 66  days after planting in both seasons (years). Many rice varieties in Sri Lanka complete flowering after 2 – 3  days from reaching the 50 % flowering stage. A previous study had identified the correct time for paddy harvest as 30 – 34  days of post-completion of flowering [12]. Hence, in the present study, 30 DAFF was considered as the control based {{on the recommendation of}} the DOA as the optimum time to harvest paddy in Sri Lanka.|$|R
40|$|Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) {{is one of}} {{the major}} pulse crops of the {{tropical}} and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. In South Africa, it is usually grown singly or as a hedge plant in home gardens or around the sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) fields. Being one of the most drought tolerant legumes, pigeonpea has a great potential to increase the sustainability of cropping systems in the arid and semi-arid regions. In India, pigeonpea is generally intercropped with cereals, other legumes, cotton (Gossypium sp), and castor (Ricinus communis) (Saxena 1999). As intercropping is an important aspect of smallholder-farmer crop production systems, a study was initiated to evaluate the performance of pigeonpea cultivars with varying <b>maturity</b> <b>periods</b> with maize (Zea mays) in two intercropping systems...|$|R

50|$|Collaborative finance is a {{category}} of financial transaction that occurs directly between individuals without the intermediation of a traditional financial institution. This new way to manage informal financial transactions has been enabled by advances in social media and peer-to-peer online platforms. The wide variety of collaborative finance resources may vary not only in their organizational and operational aspects, but also by geographical region, share of the financial market etc. It is precisely this heterogeneity that enables the informal savings and credit activity to profitably reach those income-groups not served by commercial banks and other financial institutions. It is their informality, adaptability and flexibility of operations - characteristics which reduce their transactions costs and confers upon them their comparative advantage and economic rationale. Collaborative Finance is characterized by highly personalized loan transactions entailing face-to-face dealings with borrowers and flexibility in respect of loan purpose, interest rates, collateral requirements, <b>maturity</b> <b>periods</b> and debt rescheduling.|$|R
50|$|Savings bonds come {{in eight}} denominations: $25, $50, $75, $100, $200, $500, $1,000, and $5,000. After purchase, the holder must wait at least twelve months before cashing it in, {{when they will}} receive the capital plus some interest. The <b>maturity</b> <b>periods</b> can vary. For example, {{if you buy a}} bond with a value of $50 for $25, you'll have to wait at least 17 years to get back your {{investment}} from the government, depending on the interest rate. The longer you wait, the greater interest you earn, however savings bonds have a 30-year maximum of interest accrual. After that the bond no longer accrues interest. Savings bonds are protected because they are secured by the U.S. government. The principal and earned interest are registered with the Treasury Department, so if a bond is lost, stolen, or destroyed they can be replaced at no cost. Savings bonds can also have value as a collectible since the government stopped issuing them in paper form.|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of US interest rate swap spreads in the period including the financial crisis. The asymmetric impacts {{of the financial crisis}} on interest rate swap spreads are focused by dividing the whole sample period into two. Four determinants of swap spreads - default risk, the slope of yield curve, T-bill and EuroDollar (TED) spread and volatility - are chosen. The default risk measured both in Aaa and Baa corporate bonds are negatively incorporated in the period of financial crisis. The slope is positively incorporated in short- and long-term <b>maturities</b> in the <b>period</b> of financial crisis. The liquidity premium is positively incorporated in short- and long-term <b>maturities</b> in normal <b>period</b> and only in short-term <b>maturity</b> in the <b>period</b> of financial crisis. The market participants were uncertain as for the future of monetary policy by Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Thus the speculation on the path of monetary policy is considered to cause more volatility in the market. The volatility can be a positive determinant of US swap spreads in the period of financial crisis. ...|$|R
