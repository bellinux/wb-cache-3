It is shown that this flexibility can affect both wing-aileron and aileron-tab flutter, but each is affected differently. In wing-aileron flutter, mass-balance arm flexibility gives rise to ternary flutter and has a powerful stabilizing effect when the mass-balance natural frequency approaches the flutter frequency. In aileron-tab flutter, the mass-balance flexibility serves to produce an aileron overtone mode equivalent in effect to a rigidly mass-balmlced aileron mode of the same frequency. When this frequency is sufficiently high aileron-tab flutter results. The fundamental aileron mode (the lower frequency normal. mode of the aileron and its <b>mass-balance</b> <b>weight)</b> has no {{significant effect on the}} flutter. 1. Introduction. Th...|$|E

The forward section, which was integral with the intake ducts and neighbouring wing structure, accommodates the fire-control radar, cockpit, nose undercarriage, integral fuel tanks and various systems. The rear portion, which was manufactured as a single piece alongside {{the rest of the}} inner wing, contained the engine and afterburner, bag-type fuel tanks, armament, main landing gear, and other systems. The flight control surfaces consisted of a rudder, along with inboard and outboard elevons, the outer sections being fitted with <b>mass-balance</b> <b>weights.</b> Each surface was operated by a tandem hydraulic jack, which was connected to separate circuits. As a weight-saving measure, the hydraulic systems would operate at a line pressure of 2,9871b/sq, which would be greater than double the pressure used in the earlier Saab 29 Tunnan.|$|R
