Medics pulled about 200 pellets of birdshot from his chest and arms. Abutaki's elder brother, Ahmed, who was in the morgue while holding his brothers' hands, {{recalled}} the last conversation they had the previous night for the media present: [...] "He said, 'This is my chance, to have a say, so that <b>maybe</b> <b>our</b> country will do something for us.'

500|$|Kwame Opam at The Verge {{chose to}} examine rape {{and the nature}} of consent in the season. Comparing Jessica Jones to other {{television}} series that have depicted rape (Game of Thrones, Orange Is the New Black, and Outlander), Opam felt that [...] "since rape is one of the show’s core themes, we never need to see it... rape is a foundational part of the text, and its presence is constant. Even if it’s invisible, it’s always there." [...] He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, [...] "Jessica Jones moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don’t need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. <b>Maybe</b> <b>our</b> energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all." [...] The Guardians Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act, and saying, [...] "however exceptional Kilgrave’s power seems, the moral quagmire it produces is all too common. It’s the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It’s the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It’s the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays “of her own free will”. It’s the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future." [...] Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist [...] "red pillers", and noting that his taking of the pills [...] "renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill’s effects." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mighty {{few people}} that you and I will ever {{get a chance to}} see, Captain. Not a solitary {{commoner}} ever has the luck to see a reception of a prophet, I can tell you. All the nobility, and all the patriarchs and prophets--every last one of them--and all the archangels, and all the princes and governors and viceroys, were there,--and NO small fry--not a single one. And mind you, I'm not talking about only the grandees from OUR world, but the princes and patriarchs and so on from ALL the worlds that shine in our sky, and from billions more that belong in systems upon systems away outside of the one our sun is in. There were some prophets and patriarchs there that ours ain't a circumstance to, for rank and illustriousness and all that. Some were from Jupiter and other worlds in our own system, but the most celebrated were three poets, Saa, Bo and Soof, from great planets in three different and very remote systems. These three names are common and familiar in every nook and corner of heaven, clear from one end of it to the other-- fully as well known as the eighty Supreme Archangels, in fact-- where as our Moses, and Adam, and the rest, have not been heard of outside of our world's little corner of heaven, except by a few very learned men scattered here and there--and they always spell their names wrong, and get the performances of one mixed up with the doings of another, and they almost always locate them simply IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, and think that is enough without going into little details such as naming the particular world they are from. It is like a learned Hindoo showing off how much he knows by saying Longfellow lives in the United States--as if he lived all over the United States, and as if the country was so small you couldn't throw a brick there without hitting him. Between you and me, it does gravel me, the cool way people from those monster worlds outside our system snub our little world, and even our system. Of course we think a good deal of Jupiter, because our world is only a potato to it, for size; but then there are worlds in other systems that Jupiter isn't even a mustard-seed to--like the planet Goobra, for instance, which you couldn't squeeze inside the orbit of Halley's comet without straining the rivets. Tourists from Goobra (I mean parties that lived and died there--natives) come here, now and then, and inquire about our world, and when they find out it is so little that a streak of lightning can flash clear around it in the eighth of a second, they have to lean up against something to laugh. Then they screw a glass into their eye and go to examining us, as if we were a curious kind of foreign bug, or something of that sort. One of them asked me how long our day was; and when I told him it was twelve hours long, as a general thing, he asked me if people where I was from considered it worth while to get up and wash for such a day as that. That is the way with those Goobra people--they can't seem to let a chance go by to throw it in your face that their day is three hundred and twenty-two of our years long. This young snob was just of age--he was six or seven thousand of his days old--say two million of our years--and he had all the puppy airs that belong to that time of life--that turning- point when a person has got over being a boy and yet ain't quite a man exactly. If it had been anywhere else but in heaven, I would have given him a piece of my mind. Well, anyway, Billings had the grandest reception that has been seen in thousands of centuries, and I think it will have a good effect. His name will be carried pretty far, and it will make our system talked about, and <b>maybe</b> <b>our</b> world, too, and raise us in the respect of the general public of heaven. Why, look here--Shakespeare walked backwards before that tailor from Tennessee, and scattered flowers for him to walk on, and Homer stood behind his chair and waited on him at the banquet. Of course that didn't go for much THERE, amongst all those big foreigners from other systems, as they hadn't heard of Shakespeare or Homer either, but it would amount to considerable down there on our little earth if they could know about it. I wish there was something in that miserable spiritualism, so we could send them word. That Tennessee village would set up a monument to Billings, then, and his autograph would outsell Satan's. Well, they had grand times at that reception--a small-fry noble from Hoboken told me all about it--Sir Richard Duffer, Baronet." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Drawing on {{the notion}} that place is {{imagined}} through musical performance and the lens of nostalgia, the author argues that Calgarians imagine their landscape through an idea of what it once was, or is, but cannot be seen. The author investigates gentrification trends in the city and how they affect music consumption, as well as the programming practices of two roots music venues situated in the East Village, a perpetually gentrifying neighbourhood. Relegating roots music to such sites aligns with a tendency to contain nostalgia so it is unthreatening to Calgary’s public image of cosmopolitanism. “Facing our landscapes inside outside Four walls of answers cradle of questions I guess we’ve all seen these landscapes before <b>Maybe</b> within <b>our</b> past lives But the cradle’s a model for architect tower The cradle is our little world Hot rain falling down from the sky I hear you calling for a rid...|$|R

All forms of learning and change start with some form of dissatisfaction or frustration generated by data that disconfirm our expectations or hopes (Schein, 1993).
