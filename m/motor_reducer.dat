A specifically designed water jet machine tool with four axes {{was developed and}} a specially designed cutting head has developed, in which the inside diameter of orifice and focusing tube is φ 125 µm and φ 500 µm respectively, while the silicon carbide solid abrasives with average diameter of 25 - 100 µm was used. In order to control the flow rate of micro abrasives precisely, an abrasive feed system with auger mechanism driven by DC <b>motor</b> <b>reducer</b> was used. The diameters of monocrystalline silicon bars are around 50 mm. Two basic turning methods, i. e. turning with stationary jet and turning with moving jet were applied. The preliminary experimental results such as kerf width, wafer thickness, surface quality etc. were analyzed. It was found that micro abrasive water jet {{can be used to}} precisely turn brittle materials like monocrystalline silicon. The turned wafer with thickness of 1 mm above could be achieved. A thinner wafer less than 1 mm is difficult to obtain during experiments because of cracking or chipping. Experiments demonstrate that the wafer surface has macro stripping characteristics similar to linear cutting. It was observed that there is less waviness and smooth surface on the turned wafer when with moving jet. And it depends greatly on the water jet pressure, feed rate of the jet, rotation speed of silicon bar, abrasive particle siz...|$|E

It is noted that the key factor that has the most significant effect causing the SRPE failure is {{the balance of the}} beam pumping unit, which determines the amount of specific energy consumption for the rise of reservoir fluid and the level of dynamic loads on the machine units. The urgency of using software-recording systems for estimating the loading of units of oil field pumping installations is substantiated. The principle of operation and design of the «AKD-SK» software recording system is described. The prospects of using this method for controlling the performance parameters and evaluating the technical state of the sicker rod-pumping units is proved on the basis of an analysis of the magnitude and nature of the changes in the loads of drive motors determined by the registration of the instantaneous values of the consumed power. The main provisions of the methodology for analyzing the watt-meters of drive motors of the sucker rod-pumping units are outlined. The nature of the manifestation of the main defects of submersible pumps and beam-balanced pumping units is described. The results of pilot-industrial tests of the beam-balanced pumping units equipped with advanced permanent magnet motors and intelligent control stations are presented. It is proved that the use of permanent magnet motors allows to reduce the specific energy consumption for the rise of reservoir fluid, which increases the efficiency of the SRPE.
