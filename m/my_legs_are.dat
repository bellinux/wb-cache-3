6000|$|... "Help us now," [...] {{said the}} Bull. [...] "The tides {{of the day}} are running down. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> very stiff. Sing, if you never sang before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--I fancy {{there is}} {{something}} amiss. I can't move my arms; and I catch my breath. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> all right if I could {{get away from this}} accursed brute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Take a seat. And {{would you}} please to shut the street door first? I can't very well do it myself; because my back's so bad, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> so queer.' ...|$|E
50|$|Clue: That part of <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> English. Initials: B. Artist or Band.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think that}} the boot {{is on the other}} <b>leg.</b> <b>My</b> head <b>is</b> {{exceedingly}} painful and <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> very stiff. For a young man of your build you have a most surprising muscle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A prisoner!" [...] whined the half-breed. [...] "Ain't I {{suffered}} enough already? <b>My</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> somethin' fearful!" [...] and {{he groaned}} again.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis mighty fine lace to be thus hidden away," [...] commented {{an elderly}} harridan. [...] "Now, {{would you believe}} it, my fine madam, but <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> bare {{underneath}} my kirtle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Percy said, [...] "I am warm enough, in the body; but <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> in agony, {{from the}} cold. These gloves are helping us on, though, {{at a great}} rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Could I {{lie on your}} sofa, please, Cis? My head aches, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> SO tired," [...] {{said little}} Button, when her tap had been {{answered}} by a sharp [...] "What do you want, child?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Reason?" [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "Good gracious, no. What reason should I have? <b>My</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> a trifle stiff to-day for stiles, but stillâ€”" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{away from}} me," [...] I cried, half choking. [...] "O please go away, you--you Thug! How dare {{you think that}} when <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> asleep?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh! <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>is</b> short, but I slog along slack at {{the knees}} an' don't worry my muscles none, an' I can sure walk every piker here off the ice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh I'm as bold as bold can be! [...] Sing hoppy-hippy-hippy-hop-o! [...] I'll hie me {{forth the}} world to see! [...] Sing hoppy-hippy-hippy-hop-o! [...] My ears are long, [...] <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> strong, [...] So now good day; [...] I'll hie away! [...] Sing hoppy-hippy-hippy-hop-o!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Goodbye, Ralph. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> all cramped up, and my {{arms are}} numbed. I can't swim another stroke. It is all up with me," [...] he said, faintly. [...] "God bless you. Don't stop with me; {{you can do}} no good, and your only chance is to go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no use--you always could outrun me," [...] panted Tom, {{as he came}} to a {{stop when}} Sam crossed the {{footpath}} ten yards ahead of him. [...] "I can't understand it either. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> just as long as yours, and my lungs just as big, too, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I? <b>My</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> hurting me a bit. Ireland {{is a great}} country, but its by-roads are not {{the best}} in the world, and this jolting shakes me up a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{the little}} villains started around the {{mountain}} I follered, {{as the boy}} an' me had agreed on; but after a two-hour's tramp I fell into a hole, an' reckon <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> broke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no! I'm {{all right}} now. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> cramped--that's all. They'll limber up in a minute. The seats were {{too low for}} a man of my height. I should have stayed in the other carriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The matter {{will keep}} that while. I will {{go and look}} for a lodging for us and get {{something}} to eat, for we have walked some seventeen miles, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> not so accustomed to exercise as my arms. In an hour we will be here again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, legs--legs {{to fight}} with, and legs {{to run away}} with--and therein you see my two callings agreed. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> none of the best just now, and without legs a {{kidnapper}} would carry on a losing trade; but then there are men enough left, better provided than I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|Taking {{her eyes}} off the book, to test her memory of {{something}} in it, Lizzie {{was the first to}} see herself observed. As she rose, Miss Wren likewise became conscious, and said, irreverently addressing the great chief of the premises: 'Whoever you are, I can't get up, because my back's bad and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> queer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{take the}} ramrod {{of one of}} my pistols, put it through the bandage, and then twist it. You need not be afraid of hurting me; <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> quite numbed, at present. That is right.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seventy-six, if I'm a day. My time can't <b>be</b> long, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>is</b> weak, they be. Yes, the Bible says a man's time {{is limited}} pretty much to threescore-and-ten--and I'll never stand out ag'in the Bible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't wear those striped stockings," [...] said Faith stubbornly. [...] "The feel {{of them is}} {{even worse}} than the looks. They make me feel as if <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> as big as barrels and they're so SCRATCHY." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have dared}} to {{nominate}} that dirty Lincoln," [...] he said.--"Do {{you think that}} we will submit to nigger equality rule? Never! never!" [...] he cried. [...] "If they elect him, I will stand and fight them until <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> shot from under me, and then I will shoot down the Yankees from the ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I'm not. Dear God, how we fool ourselves! I pretend I'm 'spiritual.' I pretend <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> graceful. They aren't. They're skinny. Old-maidish. I hate it! I {{hate that}} impertinent young woman! A selfish cat, taking {{his love for}} granted. [...] . No, she's adorable. [...] . I don't think {{she ought to be}} so {{friendly}} with Guy Pollock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't cry, love," [...] he said. [...] "God's will be done. Perhaps {{they have}} given up the hunt by now; at any rate, <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> left, and Bambatse is not more than sixteen miles away. Forward now," [...] and holding to her saddle-strap they went up the long, long slope {{which led to the}} poort in the hills around Bambatse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much, I think. I--I am not sure. I {{feel as if}} I {{had been}} much shaken, and <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> painful. I hope," [...] he added, feeling the limb with both hands, [...] "that it is not--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Only {{the body}} of the car was smashed, {{especially}} around my seat. Carefully I drew <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> out of the steel trap. Bracing myself against the frame of the body, I slowly extricated myself from the seat ... I tried to hurry out of the car. I wanted to show that nothing had happened to me, that I was absolutely unhurt. I stepped to the ground. At that instant the pain flashed through <b>my</b> <b>leg.</b> It <b>was</b> a ferocious pain, as if <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>were</b> being slashed by hot, glowing knives. I collapsed, Chiron catching me in his arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is {{the meaning}} of this?" [...] he cried, as soon as the door was opened. [...] "I was to be set free from all the dangers of life; and here have I been run down by that self-same water-cart, and <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> broken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maids? My dear, I haven't {{another one}} to give you, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> too tottering {{to be of}} any use. I counted on Eliza Parsons, the new girl I hired for the linen room and to do mending; but Eliza {{said she had a}} {{headache}} this morning and couldn't stand the sun, So I let her off. But she didn't seem very sick to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{tried to}} clamber past {{the wall that}} barred the way there by sheer force of stride--you know, <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> long--and I somehow overbalanced myself. But I didn't exactly fall--if I had fallen, I must have been killed; I rolled and slid down, {{clutching}} at the weeds in the crannies as I slipped, and stumbling over the projections, without quite losing my foothold on the ledges, till I found myself brought up short with a bump {{at the end of}} it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Fledgeby nodded, {{and the old}} man led the way up flight after {{flight of}} stairs, till they arrived at the house-top. Seated on a carpet, and leaning against a chimney-stack, were two girls bending over books. Some creepers were trained round the chimney-pots, and evergreens were placed round the roof, and a few more books, a basket of gaily colored scraps, and bits of tinsel, lay near. One of the girls rose on seeing that Riah had brought a visitor, but the other remarked, [...] "I'm the person of the house downstairs, but I can't get up, whoever you are, because my back is bad, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> queer." ...|$|E
5000|$|For his {{injuries}} on that day, Dunham also received the Purple Heart. Shrapnel from {{his injuries}} remained {{in his body}} {{for the rest of}} his life, and Dunham was quoted as saying [...] "The shrapnel in <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> a reminder of the war we fought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sir!' said Popanilla, 'your {{approbation}} is {{the only}} reward which I ever shall desire for my exertions. You will excuse me for not quite keeping up with you; but the fact is, my pockets are so stuffed with cash that the action of <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>is</b> greatly impeded.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not wobbly," [...] the Tin Soldier assured him, [...] "but I'm {{certain that}} one of <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>is</b> shorter than the other. I can't see it, to tell what's gone wrong, but I'll limp on {{with the rest of}} you until we are out of this enchanted territory." ...|$|R
