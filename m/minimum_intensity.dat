In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light for the rear position lamp function.

500|$|In a {{developing}} cyclone, the technique {{takes advantage of}} the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features, and as they strengthen, they tend to change in appearance in a predictable manner. [...] The structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24hours to determine if the storm has weakened, maintained its intensity, or strengthened. [...] Various central cloud and banding features are compared with templates that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity. [...] If infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern, then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity (colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm). In each case a [...] "T-number" [...] (an abbreviation for Tropical Number) and a Current Intensity (CI) value are assigned to the storm. These measurements range between 1 (<b>minimum</b> <b>intensity)</b> and 8 (maximum intensity). The T-number and CI value are the same except for weakening storms, in which case the CI is higher. [...] For weakening systems, the CI is held as the tropical cyclone intensity for 12hours, though research from the National Hurricane Center indicates that six hours is more reasonable. [...] The table at right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given T-number.

2500|$|We {{can find}} the angle at which a first minimum is {{obtained}} in the diffracted light by the following reasoning.

40|$|Agricultural water {{markets can}} {{facilitate}} adjustments to water scarcity and competition and enhance economic efficiency, but markets cannot automatically balance efficiency, equity and environmental sustainability goals. The consequences of water trading on soil salinity in irrigation areas {{are not yet}} fully understood, but recognized as an issue {{that needs to be}} analysed. This paper explores the nexus between water trading and groundwater-induced soil salinity in a selected irrigated area in the Murray-Darling Basin. Results show that <b>minimum</b> irrigation <b>intensities</b> must be met to flush salts out of the root zone especially in shallow water table/high salinity impact areas. Such <b>minimum</b> irrigation <b>intensities</b> are helpful but not necessarily in deep water table/low salinity impact areas. Should water markets lead to permanent water transfers out of mature irrigation areas, <b>minimum</b> irrigation <b>intensity</b> needs might not be met in high salinity impact areas, causing substantial negative impacts on resource quality and agricultural productivity. Water trading that adds to salinity cannot be economically viable in the long run. The tradeoffs between water trading and environmental and equity goals need to be determined.

2500|$|An {{idealised}} grating {{is considered}} here {{which is made}} up of a set of slits of spacing d, that must be wider than the wavelength of interest to cause diffraction. Assuming a plane wave of monochromatic light of wavelength λ with normal incidence (perpendicular to the grating), each slit in the grating acts as a quasi point-source from which light propagates in all directions (although this is typically limited to a hemisphere). After light interacts with the grating, the diffracted light is composed of the sum of interfering wave components emanating from each slit in the grating. At any given point in space through which diffracted light may pass, the path length to each slit in the grating will vary. Since the path length varies, generally, so will the phases of the waves at that point from each of the slits, and thus will add or subtract from one another to create peaks and valleys, through the phenomenon of additive and destructive interference. When the path difference between the light from adjacent slits is equal to half the wavelength, , the waves will all be out of phase, and thus will cancel each other to create points of <b>minimum</b> <b>intensity.</b> Similarly, when the path difference is λ, the phases will add together and maxima will occur. The maxima occur at angles θm, which satisfy the relationship [...] = |m|, where θm is the angle between the diffracted ray and the grating's normal vector, and d is the distance from the center of one slit {{to the center of the}} adjacent slit, and m is an integer representing the propagation-mode of interest.|$|E

Additionally, this review appears to {{support the hypothesis that}} the threshold for global health benefits may occur at low levels of intensity in people who are deconditioned.

40|$|High {{dynamic range}} images are images {{that have a}} ratio between their maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>intensities</b> {{greater than that of}} display or capture devices. One method to create high dynamic range images is to combine a set of {{differently}} exposed shoots into a single image that has to be compressed before visualization. Compressing high dynamic range images is thus based on a so called high dynamic range map (HDR). In this paper we show that {{a solution to the problem}} can be obtained without the need for the calculation of HDR maps. To achieve this we use an image fusion method in the gradient domain. We start by calculating a gradient field which encompasses the details found in the exposure image series. This gradient field is then integrated to result in the final within dynamic range image. The resulting algorithm achieves high image contrast due to a non-linear thresholding of gradients. ...|$|R

40|$|Fringe {{patterns}} are usually analyzed using a predefined window {{due to the}} difficulty associated with finding their edges. This is because, the fringes usually have <b>minimum</b> <b>intensities</b> {{similar to that of}} the background and it is difficult to determine where a fringe starts or ends. The presence of the fringes can therefore lead to error in detecting the edges of the object when using existing edge detection techniques. This paper presents a practical approach towards the automatic detection of the edges of a noisy fringe pattern having different noise levels. The technique uses the dilation and erosion morphological operators combined with a simple neighborhood binary edge detector. The threshold required for the binarization operation is determined from a linear relationship between the threshold value and the standard deviation of Gaussian noise from a simulation study. The proposed technique has been successfully applied to fringe patterns on real objects obtained using the fringe projection method. Some of the limitations of the technique are discussed...|$|R
