40|$|Background: Noise induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) {{is within the}} top five {{occupational}} illnesses in Zimbabwe. Workers at a mining company complained about loss of hearing at the mine clinic. Objective: To determine the prevalence of NIHL among employees at the Mine. Methods: We conducted a descriptive cross sectional study at the mine. Workers were proportionally selected to represent all the <b>mine</b> <b>departments</b> or working areas. We measured noise levels at various mine sites, conducted a walk-through survey to observe noise related worker practices and conducted audiometric testing. Results: Mean age for workers was 34. 8 ± 7. 6 years and the mean duration of exposure to noise was 7. 5 ± 1. 2 years. All workers could define noise. Ninety (53 %) workers attributed NIHL to noisy work environment. Excessive noise levels were in Plant Processing (94 dBA), Underground Mining (102 dBA) and (Underground Workshop (103 dBA). Sixty two (36. 7 %) workers had NIHL. NIHL increased {{as a function of}} age (chi square= 30. 99 df= 3 p< 0. 01) and was associated with work area (chi square= 24. 96 df= 5 p< 0. 01). Observed workers took heed of noise warnings. There was no documented hearing conservation program at the mine. Conclusion: The prevalence of NIHL of 37 % is high. Age and work area were associated with NIHL. Studies reported that age tends to distort the relationship between noise exposure and NIHL. Mine management should institute a hearing conservation program to protect employees against hazardous noise. Management may meanwhile use administrative controls and adhere to permissible exposure limits according to the noise regulations...|$|E
