Each smaller shield holds five white bezants {{displayed in the}} form of a saltire (2+1+2). The red bordure is charged with seven yellow castles: three on the chief portion (one in each corner and one in the middle), two in the middle points of each quadrant of the curved base (rotated 45degrees), and two more on each side of the bordure, over the flag's horizontal <b>middle</b> <b>line.</b> Each castle is composed by a base building, showing a closed (yellow) gate, on top of which stand three battlemented towers. In heraldic terminology, the shield's blazon is described as Argent, five escutcheons in cross azure each charged with five plates in saltire, on a bordure gules seven towers triple-turreted Or, three in chief.|$|E

The conference adopted the <b>middle</b> <b>line</b> proposed by Trotsky. At first opposed, in the end Lenin voted for Trotsky's resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.|$|E

50|$|In 1874 the {{historic}} building of Zemsky prikaz was demolished. In its place the Imperial Historical Museum {{was built in}} pseudo-Russian style. After Bové's lines were demolished, new large buildings were erected between 1888 and 1893, also in the pseudo-Russian style: upper lines (Gum department store) and <b>middle</b> <b>lines.</b> The upper lines were intended for retail sale and together in fact comprised the first department store in Moscow. <b>Middle</b> <b>lines</b> were intended for wholesale trade. At the same time (in 1892) the square was illuminated by electric lanterns. In 1909 a tram appeared on the square for the first time.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{experience}} from the introduction of marking, that at least on narrow roads and in curves, <b>middle</b> <b>lines</b> help make drivers stay on their side when meeting, and therefore reducing meeting accidents. Note that the 2005 experiment was on urban roads. In Sweden, local streets generally have no marking.|$|R
25|$|The {{heart is}} located in the abdomen a short {{distance}} within the <b>middle</b> <b>line</b> of the dorsal body-wall, and above the intestine. Unlike in insects, the heart is not divided into chambers, but consists of a simple tube. The aorta, which supplies haemolymph to the cephalothorax, extends from the anterior end of the heart. Smaller arteries extend from sides and posterior end of the heart. A thin-walled sac, known as the pericardium, completely surrounds the heart.|$|E
25|$|Some {{children}} {{may have a}} slightly raised temperature; high fever and general malaise point to other, more serious conditions. On clinical examination, the child typically holds the hip slightly bent, turned outwards {{and away from the}} <b>middle</b> <b>line</b> (flexion, external rotation and abduction). Active and passive movements may be limited because of pain, especially abduction and internal rotation. The hip can be tender to palpation. The log roll test involves gently rotating the entire lower limb inwards and outwards with the patient on his back, to check when muscle guarding occurs. The unaffected hip and the knees, ankles, feet and spine are found to be normal.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} walls to a squash court. The front wall, on which three {{parallel}} lines are marked, {{has the largest}} playing surface, whilst the back wall, which typically contains {{the entrance to the}} court, has the smallest. The out line runs {{along the top of the}} front wall, descending along the side walls to the back wall. There are no other markings on the side or back walls. Shots struck above or touching the out line, on any wall, are out. The bottom line of the front wall marks the top of the 'tin', a half metre-high metal area which if struck means that the ball is out. In this way the tin can be seen as analogous to the net in other racket sports such as tennis. The <b>middle</b> <b>line</b> of the front wall is the service line and is only relevant during serves.|$|E

25|$|Quintus Fabius fought defensively {{to prolong}} the battle into a test of {{endurance}} {{and wait for the}} enemy to flag. Publius Decius fought more aggressively and ordered a cavalry attack, which drove back the Senone cavalry twice. The second time they reached the enemy infantry, but suffered a chariot attack and were scattered and overthrown. The line of the Decius’ infantry was broken by the chariots and the Senone foot attacked. Publius Decius decided to devote himself. This term referred to a military commander offering prayers to the gods and launching himself into the enemy lines, effectively sacrificing himself, when his troops were in dire straits. This act galvanised the Roman left which was also joined by two reserve contingents which Quintus Fabius had called in to help. On the right, Quintus Fabius told the cavalry to outflank the Samnite wing and attack it in the flank and ordered his infantry to push forward. He then called in the other reserves. The Samnites fled past the Senone line. The Senones formed a testudo (tortoise) formation – where the men aligned their shields in a compact formation covered with shields at the front and top. Quintus Fabius ordered 500 Campanian lancers to attack them at the rear. This was to be combined with push by the <b>middle</b> <b>line</b> of one of the legions and an attack by the cavalry. Meanwhile, Quintus Fabius took the Samnite camp by storm and cut off the Senones in the rear. The Senone Gauls were defeated. The Romans lost 8,700 men and their enemy 20,000.|$|E

2500|$|The Athenian trireme had {{two great}} cables of about 47mm in {{diameter}} and twice the ship's length called hypozomata (undergirding), and carried two spares. They were possibly rigged fore and aft {{from end to end}} along the <b>middle</b> <b>line</b> of the hull just under the main beams and tensioned to 13.5 tonnes force. The hypozomata were considered important and secret: their export from Athens was a capital offense. This cable would act as a stretched tendon straight {{down the middle of the}} hull, and would have prevented hogging. Additionally, hull plank butts would remain in compression in all but the most severe sea conditions, reducing working of joints and consequent leakage. The hypozomata would also have significantly braced the structure of the trireme against the stresses of ramming, giving it an important advantage in combat.|$|E
