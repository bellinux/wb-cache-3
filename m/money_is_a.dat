5|$|Blood <b>Money</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter {{that uses}} 2D computer graphics. Players move through four stages on the planet, {{taking control of}} a different vehicle in each level: a helicopter in the metal world, a submarine in a water world, a spacesuit in an ice world, and a fighter jet in a fire world. Each vehicle features unique weaponry, which players use to attack all advancing enemies. Players can upgrade their vehicle with power-ups, which grant them additional weapons and upgrades, such as support missiles and neutron bombs. The vehicles' energy acts as players' health, and is depleted when the vehicle makes contact with enemies and walls. When all energy is lost, players lose a life; three lives are provided {{at the beginning of}} the game, and additional lives can be collected as players progress through the levels. When all three lives are lost, the game ends and players are sent to the title screen. The first two levels may be selected from the beginning of the game; after one level is complete, players can select any remaining world without restrictions. At the end of each level, players must defeat a boss.|$|E

There are Maundy coins in denominations of one, two, three and four pence. They bear dates from 1822 to the present and are minted in very small quantities. Though they are legal tender in the UK, they are never encountered in circulation. The pre-decimal Maundy pieces have the same legal tender status and value as post-decimal ones, and effectively increased in face value by 140% upon decimalisation. Their numismatic value is much greater.|$|E

25|$|In economics, <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> broad {{term that}} refers to any {{financial}} instrument that can fulfil the functions of money (detailed above). These financial instruments together are collectively {{referred to as the}} money supply of an economy. In other words, the money supply is the number of financial instruments within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or services. Since the money supply consists of various financial instruments (usually currency, demand deposits and various other types of deposits), the amount of money in an economy is measured by adding together these financial instruments creating a monetary aggregate.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} many {{historical}} disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient {{to deal with them}} all. One of these arguments is that the role of money as a medium of exchange is in conflict with its role as a store of value: its role as a store of value requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate. [...] Others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact that <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time. The term [...] "financial capital" [...] is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments, {{whether or not they are}} a uniformly recognized tender.|$|E

2500|$|In {{mainstream}} economics, {{the concept}} of a market is any structure that allows buyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods, services and information. The exchange of goods or services, with or without <b>money,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> transaction. Market participants consist of all the buyers and sellers of a good who influence its price, which is a major topic of study of economics and has given rise to several theories and models concerning the basic market forces of supply and demand. A major topic of debate is how much a given market can be considered to be a [...] "free market", that is free from government intervention. Microeconomics traditionally focuses on the study of market structure and the efficiency of market equilibrium; when the latter (if it exists) is not efficient, then economists say that a market failure has occurred. However it is not always clear how the allocation of resources can be improved since there is always the possibility of government failure.|$|E
