25|$|A {{major threat}} {{was already on}} the horizon, however, as the Rothesay Dock in Clydebank was under construction. It opened in 1907, {{equipped}} with modern <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> for bulk minerals; it was only 20miles (32km) from most of the coalfields, and sea-going ships could be loaded there. Much traffic was immediately diverted from Ardrossan, and use of the expensive new L route declined steeply.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{investment}} {{was made in}} the GWR dock facilities at Swansea, especially in modern <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> and adaptation to the changing pattern of mineral exports. The numerous small-scale marshalling yards at the Burrows (the R section near Jersey Marine) were modernised, and the residual passenger service over this section was diverted to the GWR (former Swansea and Neath) line running parallel, so that the former R lines were dedicated to goods and mineral traffic. The diversion from Riverside freed up the approach of goods traffic at the docks, which had previously conflicted with passenger trains crossing.|$|E
25|$|The new Methil dock {{was entirely}} successful, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> and other modern aids ensured rapid loading of shipping. Nonetheless Wemyss {{did not wish}} to be a long term {{operator}} of harbour facilities, particularly because he foresaw that considerable development would be needed in later years to keep abreast of the expansion of trade. Discussions took place with the North British Railway in 1888 which resulted in the sale of the facilities to that company. This became effective on 1 February 1889 and included the Wemyss and Buckhaven line and the Methil extension, the Methil and Leven docks, and the railways serving them. Wemyss undertook never to construct or allow a railway or dock on his lands that would compete with the transferred lines and harbours. This was a most significant concession, as he was handing monopoly control to the NBR; at the time he had an excellent relationship with the Chairman of the NBR, John Walker, and this may have influenced him. The purchase cost £225,000; the Wemyss Castle station was to be maintained by the NBR for the private use of Wemyss, and Wemyss was given a seat on the NBR board.|$|E
50|$|He {{was also}} the first to develop <b>mechanical</b> {{materials}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> known as automatic transfer machines to facilitate flow production, which some 25 years later would become common in the global automotive industry. Overall, Woollard’s contribution to progressive manufacturing management practices is substantial and comparable to Taiichi Ohno at Toyota. He was a great early 20th century pioneer in progressive management, flow production, and industrial automation.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a number of electric charge sensors. The sensors have been developed specifically to investigate triboelectric charge transfer which takes place between particles and the pipeline wall, when powdered materials are conveyed through a pipeline using air. A number of industrial applications exist for such gas-solids pipelines, including pneumatic conveyors, vacuum cleaners and dust extraction systems. The build-up of electric charge on pipelines and powdered materials can lead to electrostatic discharge and so is of interest from a safety viewpoint. The charging of powders can also adversely affect their <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics and so is of interest to <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> engineers. The paper presents the design of the sensors, the design of the electric charge test rig and electric charge measurement test results...|$|R
40|$|A key {{task in the}} {{material}} handling system design process is the selection and configuration of equipment for material transport and storage in a facility. Material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection is a complex, tedious task, and there are few tools other than checklists to assist engineers {{in the selection of}} appropriate, cost-effective material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> This paper describes the development of an intelligent material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection system called material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection advisor (MHESA). The MHESA is composed of three modules: (1) a database to store equipment types with their specifications; (2) a knowledge-based expert system for assisting material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection; and (3) an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model to choose the most favorable equipment type. The concept proposed in this paper can automate the design of a material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection system, and provides artificial intelligence in the decision-making process. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Large-scale {{handling}} of particulate solids can cause severe wear on bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces. Wear reduces equipment life span and increases maintenance cost. Examples of traditional methods to reduce wear of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> include optimizing transport operations and utilizing resistant materials. To our knowledge, the so-called bionic design {{has not been}} utilized. Bionic design is the application of biological models, systems, or elements to modern engineering. Bionic design has promoted significant progress {{on the development of}} engineering products and systems. In order to use bionic design for wear reduction of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces, this paper introduces bionic design to bulk solids handling on the basis of analogies between biology and bulk solids handling. In addition, a bionic design methodology for the wear reduction of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces is formulated. Based on the bionic design methodology, two bionic models used for abrasive and erosive wear reduction of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces are proposed. </p...|$|R
50|$|The Burgh of Greenock went to {{considerable}} {{expense to}} ensure that its harbour facilities were kept up to date; in 1880 the harbour at Garvel {{on the eastern side}} of Greenock was further extended. It provided three miles (5 km) of quays with the most modern <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> A new connection to dock lines was provided there from the Greenock line at Ladyburn, just west of Bogston station, where an engine shed was also provided.|$|E

50|$|A {{conveyor}} {{system is a}} common piece of <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> that moves materials from one location to another. Conveyors are especially useful in applications involving the transportation of heavy or bulky materials. Conveyor systems allow quick and efficient transportation {{for a wide variety}} of materials, which make them very popular in the material handling and packaging industries. Many kinds of conveying systems are available and are used according to the various needs of different industries. There are chain conveyors (floor and overhead) as well. Chain conveyors consist of enclosed tracks, I-Beam, towline, power & free, and hand pushed trolleys.|$|E
40|$|Container {{terminals}} mainly {{include three}} types of <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> i. e.; quay cranes (QCs), internal trucks (ITs) and yard cranes (YCs). Due to high cost of the <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> container terminals can hardly purchase additional <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> Therefore, the reasonable scheduling of these <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> especially coordinated scheduling of the {{three types of}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{plays an important role in}} the service level and energy-saving of container terminal. This paper addresses the problem of integrated QC scheduling, IT scheduling and YC scheduling. Firstly, this problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model (MIP), where the objective is to minimize the total departure delay of all vessels and the total transportation energy consumption of all tasks. Furthermore, an integrated simulation-based optimization method is developed for solving the problem, where the simulation is designed for evaluation and optimization algorithm is designed for searching solution space. The optimization algorithm integrates genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, where the GA is used for global search and the PSO is used for local search. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can coordinate the scheduling of {{the three types of}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> and can realize the optimal trade-off between time-saving and energy-saving...|$|R
