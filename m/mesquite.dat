As it meanders through Wilson and Karnes Counties, passing Zuehl, New Berlin, La Vernia, Sutherland Springs, and Cestohowa, Cibolo Creek meets with the San Antonio River near the ghost town of Helena.|$|E
5|$|The {{shores of}} Lake Cahuilla {{developed}} arrowweed, tules and willowweed, with <b>mesquite</b> at {{distance to the}} shoreline. Land plants identified in Lake Cahuilla sediments include evening primroses, pine, Polypodiaceae, ragweed, saltbushes, Selaginella sinuites and sunflower. Many of these are represented by pollen. The Pleistocene lake and adjacent lagoons featured charophytes of the genus Chara.|$|E
5|$|On average, the Aransas Bay {{system is}} 3 meters deep, and covers {{approximately}} 539 square kilometers. The system {{is made up}} of the bay itself and its extensions. The main extensions include: Saint Charles Bay, to the east of the Lamar peninsula; Copano Bay, to the west of both the Live Oak and Lamar peninsulas, <b>Mesquite</b> Bay to the bay's northeast, and Redfish Bay to the southwest. Redfish Bay is sometimes considered an extension of Corpus Christi Bay.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish left a deep mark on Texas. Their European {{livestock}} caused <b>mesquite</b> {{to spread}} inland while farmers tilled and irrigated the land, changing the landscape forever. The Spanish language provided the names {{for many of}} the rivers, towns, and counties that currently exist, and Spanish architectural concepts still flourish. Although Texas eventually adopted much of the Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal practices were retained, including the concept of a homestead exemption and community property.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of Texian soldiers, under Collinsworth, became disoriented {{in the dark and}} wandered from the road. They were soon tangled in a <b>mesquite</b> thicket. While working their way back towards the road, the Texians met Ben Milam, a Texas colonist who had {{recently}} escaped from prison in Monterrey. Milam joined the militia as a private, and the group soon rejoined the vanguard.|$|E
5|$|Four Native American {{cultures}} {{are known to}} have lived in the area during the last 10,000years. The first known group, the Nevares Spring People, were hunters and gatherers who arrived in the area perhaps 9,000years ago (7000BC) when there were still small lakes in Death Valley and neighboring Panamint Valley. A much milder climate persisted at that time, and large game animals were still plentiful. By 5,000years ago (3000BC) the <b>Mesquite</b> Flat People displaced the Nevares Spring People. Around 2,000years ago the Saratoga Spring People moved into the area, which by then was probably already a hot, dry desert. This culture was more advanced at hunting and gathering and was skillful at handcrafts. They also left mysterious stone patterns in the valley.|$|E

5|$|Moisture {{derived from}} John also {{produced}} rainfall across southern New Mexico, peaking at 5.25inches (133mm) at Ruidoso. The rainfall overflowed rivers, forcing people to evacuate along the Rio Ruidoso. The rainfall also caused isolated road flooding. Rainfall in New Mexico canceled an annual wine festival in Las Cruces and caused muddy {{conditions at the}} All American Futurity at the Ruidoso Downs, the biggest day of horse racing in New Mexico. Flooding was severe in <b>Mesquite,</b> Hatch, and Rincon, where many homes experienced 4feet (1.5m) of flooding and mud. Some homeowners lost all they owned. Tropical moisture from the storm also produced rainfall in Arizona and Southern California. In California, the rainfall produced eight separate mudslides, trapping 19vehicles, but caused no injuries.|$|E
5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} <b>mesquite</b> beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them {{at the very top of}} the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed {{breeding}} season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings {{have been recorded}} as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from <b>mesquite,</b> prickly pear or yucca to the occasional oak and pine trees. The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, rootlets or hair.|$|E
50|$|Nabkhas {{are common}} {{features}} in landscapes that are undergoing desertification. In North America, a characteristic sign of desertification is {{the spread of}} <b>mesquites</b> (Prosopis spp.) into the habitat. <b>Mesquites</b> rapidly accumulate windblown sand, forming nabkhas. In northern China, nabkhas were present on grasslands before they were converted to agriculture, but this conversion accelerated their development {{and they are a}} common feature of abandoned farm fields in the region. They are indicators of soil erosion there.|$|R

5|$|The {{golden jackal}} {{is both a}} {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with a diet that varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of <b>mesquite</b> (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden rain tree Cassia fistula.|$|E
5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, <b>mesquite,</b> {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck {{may play a role in}} their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} of Texas was changed {{as a result}} of some Spanish policies. As early as the 1690s, Spaniards brought European livestock, including cattle, horses, and mules, with them on their expeditions throughout the province. Some of the livestock strayed or stayed behind when the Spanish retreated from the territory in 1693, allowing the Indian tribes to begin loosely managing herds of the animals. These herds grazed heavily on the native grasses, allowing <b>mesquite,</b> which was native to the lower Texas coast, to spread inland. Although the introduced livestock were able to adapt to the changing conditions, the buffalo had a more difficult time grazing among the new vegetation, beginning the decline in their numbers. Spanish farmers also introduced tilling and irrigation to the land, further changing the landscape. Spanish architectural concepts were also adopted by those in Texas, including the addition of patios, tile floors and roofs, arched windows and doorways, carved wooden doors, and wrought iron grillwork.|$|E

5|$|While {{living in}} Vidal, Wyatt and Josie were visited by Billy Breakenridge, the former Tombstone deputy under John Behan. He pressed Wyatt for details about {{his time in}} Tombstone to add to his book Helldorado: Bringing Law to the <b>Mesquite.</b> Breakenridge was {{assisted}} by Western novelist William MacLeod Raine, who since 1904 had published more than 25 novels about Western history. The book was published in 1928 before Wyatt died. It depicted Wyatt as a thief, pimp, crooked gambler, and murderer. Breakenridge wrote that the Earps and Doc Holliday aggressively mistreated the guiltless cowboys until they were forced into a fatal confrontation. His description of the 1881 O.K. Corral gun fight stated that the Clanton and McLaury brothers were merely cowboys who had been unarmed and surrendered but the Earp brothers had shot them in cold blood. Wyatt and Josie protested that the book's contents was biased and more fiction than fact. Earp complained about the book {{until his death in}} 1929, and his wife continued in the same vein afterward.|$|E
5|$|As {{development}} continued, id Software hired {{their former}} Softdisk liaison Kevin Cloud {{as an assistant}} artist, and moved the company out to <b>Mesquite,</b> Texas, near where Apogee was located. Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their royalty rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ScubaVenture, so that id could focus on Wolfenstein. The game {{was intended to be}} released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode. Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day, using {{a modified version of the}} Commander Keen 2D map editor, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs. Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.|$|E
60|$|Two {{miles away}} {{they saw a}} faint cloud dimming the green ripples of the <b>mesquites.</b> In twenty minutes they heard the clatter of the horses' hoofs: in five minutes more the grey plugs dashed out of the thicket, whickering for oats and drawing the light wagon behind them like a toy.|$|R
50|$|The {{seeds are}} disseminated by {{livestock}} that graze on the sweet pods, and the shrubs can invade grasslands, with cattlemen regarding <b>mesquites</b> as range weeds to be eradicated. Due to latent buds underground, only coppicing them makes permanent removal difficult. A single-trunked tree that is cut down {{will soon be}} replaced by a multi-trunked version.|$|R
60|$|With that he spurred {{his horse}} and rode out of the <b>mesquites</b> toward the town.

Duane saw a sheep-herder driving in a meager flock.|$|R
5|$|Because its {{coloration}} {{is similar}} to Bendire's thrasher, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. The bill of the curve-billed is all black, while that of Bendire's is paler down to the lower mandible, showing a dark grey with a basal area that does not feature a stark contrast. The upper and lower mandibles of the curve-billed are curved, while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires'. Although geographic variances for the curve-billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult, the curve-billed {{has a tendency to}} display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast, in contrast to the Bendires' smaller, more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads. However, curve-billed thrashers can also present this feature. Bendires' typically have yellow eyes while curve-billed eyes are typically orange, but Bendires' can have variations that appear yellow-orange while some curve-billed eyes are red-orange, yellow-orange, or yellow. The curve-billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions; Bendires' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as <b>mesquite</b> and prefers open grassland with scattered yucca or around hedgegrows in agricultural areas. The song call of Bendire's is said to be more melodic and continuous with a chuck, while the curve-billed is known for its whit-wheet calls.|$|E
25|$|Many facilitative {{interactions}} {{directly affect}} {{the distribution of}} species. As discussed above, transport of plant propagules by animal dispersers can increase colonization rates of more distant sites, which may impact the distribution and population dynamics of the plant species. Facilitation most often affects distribution by simply {{making it possible for}} a species to occur in a site where some environmental stress would otherwise prohibit growth of that species. This is apparent in whole-community facilitation by a foundation species, such as sediment stabilization in cobble beach plant communities by smooth cordgrass. A facilitating species may also help drive the progression from one ecosystem type to another, as <b>mesquite</b> apparently does in the grasslands of the Rio Grande Plains. As a nitrogen-fixing tree, <b>mesquite</b> establishes more readily than other species on nutrient-poor soils, and following establishment, <b>mesquite</b> acts as a nurse plant for seedlings of other species. Thus, <b>mesquite</b> facilitates the dynamic spatial shift from grassland to savanna to woodland across the habitat.|$|E

60|$|Her horse, Majesty, {{tossed his}} head and flung his mane and {{switched}} his tail at the flies. He would rather have been cutting the wind down the valley slope. Madeline sat with her back against a tree, and took off her sombrero. The soft breeze, fanning her hot face, blowing strands of her hair, was refreshingly cool. She heard the slow tramp of cattle going in to drink. That sound ceased, and the grove of <b>mesquites</b> appeared to be lifeless, except {{for her and her}} horse. It was, however, only after moments of attention that she found the place was far from being dead. Keen eyes and ears brought reward. Desert quail, as gray as the bare earth, were dusting themselves in a shady spot. A bee, swift as light, hummed by. She saw a horned toad, the color of stone, squatting low, hiding fearfully in the sand within reach of her whip. She extended the point of the whip, and the toad quivered and swelled and hissed. It was instinct with fight. The wind faintly stirred the thin foliage of the <b>mesquites,</b> making a mournful sigh. From far up in the foothills, barely distinguishable, came the scream of an eagle. The bray of a burro brought a brief, discordant break. Then a brown bird darted down from an unseen perch and made a swift, irregular flight after a fluttering winged insect. Madeline heard the sharp snapping of a merciless beak. Indeed, there was more than life {{in the shade of the}} <b>mesquites.</b>|$|R
