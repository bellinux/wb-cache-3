The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, gases like carbon dioxide and ozone can form, which can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Some of the latest welding <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> fitted with an electric powered fan to help disperse harmful fumes.|$|E

For example, the Great Fairy's Mask helps retrieve stray fairies {{scattered throughout}} the four temples, the Bunny Hood allows Link to run faster, and the Stone Mask renders Link invisible to most non-playable characters and enemies. Less valuable <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> usually involved only in optional side-quests or specialized situations. Examples include the Postman's Hat, which grants Link access to items in mailboxes, and Kafei's Mask, which initiates a long side-quest to receive the Couple's Mask.|$|E

After defeating the vampire Latasha, the PC travels through a portal to reach the chamber of the Night Masks' leader, Orbakh. Orbakh gives the PC the choice to either become a vampire or keep the cursed mask.|$|E

The most ancient mask is supposedly kept as a hidden treasure by the oldest school, the Konparu. According to the current head of the Konparu school, the mask was carved by the legendary regent Prince Shōtoku (572-622) over a thousand years ago. While the historical accuracy of the legend of Prince Shōtoku's mask may be contested, the legend itself is ancient as it is first recorded in Zeami's Style and the Flower written in the 14th century.|$|E

Behind the goat lies fruit and a table, most likely an anclabris with five ceremonial vessels on top. On the left side of the table stands a small female figure, whose lit torches represent the festivities and the orgies associated with the cult's rites. Frédéric de Clarac argued that the statues could very well symbolize either Telete or Ceres, two deities often associated with Dionysus. Above the table is a tapestry and two bacchante masks. To the right, in an apple tree, another mask of Pan can be seen. Two more bacchante <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> present on the bottom, in front of the table.|$|E
5|$|The main Monpa festivals held in {{the monastery}} are the Choksar, Losar, Ajilamu, and Torgya. Choksar is the festival when the Lamas recite {{religious}} scriptures in the monasteries. Following the religious recitations, the villagers carry the scriptures on their back and circumambulate their agricultural land seeking blessings for good yield of crops without any infestations by pests and to protect against attack by wild animals. In the Losar festival, which {{marks the beginning of}} the Tibetan New Year, people visit the monastery and offer prayers. Torgya, also known as Tawang-Torgya, is an annual festival that is exclusively {{held in the}} monastery. It is held according to the Buddhist calendar days of 28th to 30th of Dawachukchipa, which corresponds to 10 to 12 January of the Gregorian calendar, and is a Monpa celebration. The objective of the festival is to ward off evil spirits and ushering all round prosperity and happiness {{to the people in the}} ensuing year. During the three-day festival, dances performed by artists in colorful costumes and <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> held in the courtyard, including the Pha Chan and the Losjker Chungiye, the latter of which is performed by the monks of the monastery. Each dance represents a myth and costumes and masks represent animal forms such as cows, tigers, sheep, monkeys and so forth.|$|E

40|$|The {{abnormal}} {{visual masking}} {{in those with}} schizophrenia, it has been proposed, arises from a deficiency in their magnocellular system. Two kinds of masking exist: Type-A and Type-B. Type-A <b>masking</b> <b>is</b> characterized by the masking being strongest when target and <b>mask</b> <b>are</b> presented simultaneously. Type-B <b>masking</b> <b>is</b> characterized by a non-monotonic masking curve, i. e. the <b>masking</b> <b>is</b> largest when the <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> presented at some time after the target. The proposed link between masking and magnocellular activity applies mainly to Type-B masking. Thus, a magnocellular deficiency, if it exists, should effect Type-B masking more prominently than Type-A masking. Here we review the relevant literature. The majority of studies of masking in those with schizophrenia, it is found, have examined only Type-A masking. These find substantial evidence for abnormal masking. Where Type-B <b>masking</b> has <b>been</b> obtained, evidence also exists for abnormalities. However, the abnormal masking in these cases is largely unrelated to the defining characteristic of Type-B masking (i. e. to the non-monotonic <b>masking</b> function). It <b>is</b> concluded that the evidence for linking masking abnormalities in schizophrenia specifically to Type-B <b>masking</b> <b>is</b> weak. This undermines the proposal that masking abnormalities in schizophrenia have a magnocellular origin...|$|R

25|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of masks used in Africa. In West Africa, <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> used in masquerades that form part of {{religious}} ceremonies enacted to communicate with spirits and ancestors. Examples are the masquerades of the Yoruba, Igbo, and Edo cultures, including Egungun Masquerades and Northern Edo Masquerades. The <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> usually carved with an extraordinary skill and variety by artists who will usually have received their training as an apprentice to a master carver - frequently it is a tradition that has been passed down within a family through many generations. Such an artist holds a respected position in tribal society because of the work that he or she creates, embodying not only complex craft techniques but also spiritual/social and symbolic knowledge.

25|$|Traditional <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> most {{commonly}} carved from wood, with various types used. The harvesting of this wood often falls under certain customs related to {{when and how}} the trees may be cut. The most common traditional wood is “zompantle” also called “palo bofo” or “colorín” (Erythrina coralloides) a plant of the legume family which yields a soft white wood often use for more artistic objects and {{has been associated with}} ritual since pre Hispanic times. It is never used to utilitarian items. Other common woods include red cedar and “ayacahuite” (Pinus ayacahuite), both favored for their ability to resist insect infestation. Red cedar <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> {{most commonly}} found in the Sierra de Puebla, Papantla area, Chiapa de Corzo and among the Zoques in Chiapas. Poplar wood is commonly used because it can be worked thin and does not splinter. Masks of this wood are most commonly found for the pascola dances of the Mayos and Yaquis. The hardest woods used for <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> mesquite and avocado. Mezquite <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> found in Hidalgo, Zacatecas and the northwest of the country, with avocado wood ones found in the State of Mexico.

These emblems are used by graffiti taggers because the mask protects them from the paint canister's toxic fumes, and by urban explorers venturing into environments where hazardous materials, such as asbestos, may be present.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the realism of Roman portraits may be, {{according}} to some scholars, because they evolved from wax death masks.
