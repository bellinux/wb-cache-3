5|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} states of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn2+ often competes with Mg2+ in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly {{restricted to the}} unstable oxide <b>Mn2O7,</b> compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO4−, and a few oxyhalides (MnO3F and MnO3Cl), are powerful oxidizing agents. Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportionation.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} {{effects of}} this increase in electronegativity can be seen both in the structures of oxides and halides and in the acidity of oxides and oxoacids. Hence CrO3 and <b>Mn2O7</b> are acidic oxides with low melting points, while Cr2O3 is amphoteric and Mn2O3 is a completely basic oxide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mn2O7</b> arises as a {{dark green}} oil by the {{addition}} of concentrated H2SO4 to KMnO4. The reaction initially produces permanganic acid, HMnO4 (structurally, HOMnO3), which is dehydrated by cold sulfuric acid to form its anhydride, <b>Mn2O7.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mn2O7</b> {{can react}} further with sulfuric acid {{to give the}} {{remarkable}} manganyl(VII) cation , which is isoelectronic with CrO3 ...|$|E
50|$|Pyrosulfate, pyrophosphate, and {{dichromate}} adopt structures {{similar to}} that of <b>Mn2O7.</b> Probably the most similar main group species is Cl2O7. Focusing on comparisons within the transition metal series, Tc2O7 and <b>Mn2O7</b> are structurally similar but the Tc−O−Tc angle is 180°. Solid Re2O7 is not molecular but consists of crosslinked Re centers with both tetrahedral and octahedral sites; in the vapour phase it is molecular with a similar structure to Tc2O7.|$|E
50|$|Manganese(VII) oxide (manganese heptoxide) is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula <b>Mn2O7.</b> This volatile liquid is highly reactive {{and more often}} discussed than intentionally prepared. It is a dangerous oxidizer and was first described in 1860. It is the acid anhydride of permanganic acid.|$|E

50|$|Technetium(VII) oxide is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula Tc2O7. This yellow volatile solid {{is a rare}} example of a molecular binary metal oxide, the other examples being RuO4, OsO4, and the unstable <b>Mn2O7.</b> It adopts a centrosymmetric corner-shared bi-tetrahedral structure in which the terminal and bridging Tc-O bonds are 167pm and 184 pm respectively and the Tc-O-Tc angle is 180°.|$|E
50|$|A curious {{reaction}} occurs upon {{addition of}} concentrated sulfuric acid to potassium permanganate. Although no reaction may be apparent, the vapor over the mixture will ignite paper impregnated with alcohol. Potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid react to produce some ozone, {{which has a}} high oxidising power and rapidly oxidises the alcohol, causing it to combust. As the reaction also produces explosive <b>Mn2O7,</b> this should only be attempted with great care.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mn2O7</b> {{decomposes}} near room temperature, explosively so above 55 °C. The explosion can {{be initiated}} by striking the sample or by its exposure to oxidizable organic compounds. The products are MnO2 and O2. Ozone is also produced, giving a strong smell to the substance. The ozone can spontaneously ignite {{a piece of}} paper impregnated with an alcohol solution. The production of manganese heptoxide is an undesirable byproduct in many situations.|$|E

50|$|Concentrated {{sulfuric acid}} reacts with KMnO4 to give <b>Mn2O7,</b> {{which can be}} explosive. The {{reaction}} of permanganate with concentrated hydrochloric acid gives chlorine. The Mn-containing products from redox reactions depend on the pH. Acidic solutions of permanganate are reduced to the faintly pink manganese(II) ion (Mn2+) and water. In neutral solution, permanganate is only reduced by three electrons to give MnO2, wherein Mn is in a +4 oxidation state. This is the material that stains one's skin when handling KMnO4. KMnO4 spontaneously reduces in an alkaline solution to green K2MnO4, wherein manganese is in the +6 oxidation state.|$|E
50|$|The {{transition}} metals (such as iron, copper, zinc, and nickel) are slower to oxidize because {{they form a}} passivating layer of oxide that protects the interior. Others, like palladium, platinum and gold, do not react with the atmosphere at all. Some metals form a barrier layer of oxide on their surface which cannot be penetrated by further oxygen molecules and thus retain their shiny appearance and good conductivity for many decades (like aluminium, magnesium, some steels, and titanium). The oxides of metals are generally basic, {{as opposed to those}} of nonmetals, which are acidic. Exceptions are largely oxides with very high oxidation states such as CrO3, <b>Mn2O7,</b> and OsO4, which have strictly acidic reactions.|$|E
