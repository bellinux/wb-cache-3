25|$|The {{arrival of}} Teutonic in 1889 and the {{announcement}} of SS Majestic made the Republic unnecessary, and it was put up for sale. It was purchased in June 1889 by the Holland America Line, which paid £35,000 to acquire it. Renamed <b>Maasdam,</b> it was immediately sent to G. Forrester & Co. in Liverpool for an overhaul of machinery (for more economical and effective machines) and a reorganisation of its facilities. Once this overhaul was completed, the <b>Maasdam</b> was able to carry 150 first class passengers, 60 second class passengers, and 800 steerage/third class passengers. From 15 March 1890, it served on a route between Rotterdam and New York, and was not damaged during its service with the Holland America Line, which satisfied the company. In 1902, a brief stopover at Boulogne-sur-Mer {{was added to the}} route to New York.|$|E

25|$|Republic {{was sold}} in 1889 to Holland America Line and was renamed <b>Maasdam,</b> and served with the company for twelve years. In 1902, it was sold to Italian company La Veloce where it was renamed Vittoria, before being renamed again to Città di Napoli. It was used {{for many years to}} {{transport}} Italian migrants to America. It was retired in 1908, and was lent to the Italian government to house victims of the 1908 Messina earthquake. The ship was scrapped in 1910 in Genoa.|$|E
2500|$|Republic shared many {{characteristics}} {{with those}} of the first liner in the Oceanic series, Oceanic, constructed in 1870. Republic measured [...] and had a gross register tonnage of 3708. It could be powered by sail, with four masts, but also had smokestacks painted the colours of White Star Line, brown and black. Its machines came from G. Forrester & Co. of Liverpool and were two reciprocating engines (able to accommodate two cylinders), {{similar to those of the}} RMS Atlantic. Although it could theoretically reach speeds of 14.5 knots, it never managed to reach that speed. When the ship was renamed to <b>Maasdam,</b> its propulsion system was redesigned and was equipped with alternative machines, and could support three cylinders.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Maasdam</b> {{was founded}} nearby a {{substantial}} castle {{on the banks}} of the river [...] Maas, the remaining foundations of which were discovered in 1958 in a parcel of land near the road in <b>Maasdam</b> known as [...] "Kromme Elleboog". For a long time, it was assumed that the ruins in <b>Maasdam</b> were those of the castle Duivestein. However, it has more recently been suggested that the ruins could instead be those of a castle that belonged to the Lords of Weede. The area with castle ruins in <b>Maasdam</b> is officially protected as a Rijksmonument.|$|E
5000|$|Successful {{restoration}} was {{hindered by}} further floods {{as well as}} the Hook and Cod Wars but eventually <b>Maasdam</b> was restored to its former size soon after Philip the Good allowed his treasurer Jan Nemery, who had been the vassal of <b>Maasdam</b> for almost two decades, in 1435 to reclaim the polders next to the surviving dyke in <b>Maasdam</b> from the sea.|$|E

50|$|The Grote Waard or Zuid-Hollandse Waard was a farming region between Zuid-Holland and Brabant, that {{disappeared}} in the Sint-Elisabethsvloed (1421). Parts of this polder are now separated by water: Hoekse Waard, Eiland van Dordrecht, the Biesbosch, and parts of Noord-Brabant.

The next day the German army invaded the Low Countries. The ship and crew were immediately militarized and <b>Maasdam</b> was chartered to the Ministry of War Transport in London. <b>Maasdam</b> left New York for Halifax on 11 June 1941 with a crew of forty-eight, plus thirty-two passengers, including eleven US Marine Corps personnel and seventeen American Red Cross volunteer nurses. The marines were destined for duty at the US Embassy in London and the nurses were scheduled to serve at the Harvard Hospital. Halifax was a common port from which eastbound convoys formed. <b>Maasdam</b> arrived the evening of 13 June 1941. Assigned to Convoy HX 133, she left 16 June amidst incredibly dense fog that lasted four days, causing several ship collisions.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Maasdam</b> cheese (...) is a Swiss-style Dutch cheese. Made from cow's milk, it is aged for {{at least}} 4 weeks. It ripens faster than other Dutch cheeses. <b>Maasdam</b> has {{internal}} holes from the ripening process, and a smooth, yellow rind. Sometimes, it is waxed like Gouda. The cheese was created {{to compete with the}} popular Swiss Emmental by being less expensive and quicker to produce. In the process of making a cheese with the same general components as Swiss cheeses, the Dutch ended up with a cheese that is nutty and sweet, but softer than Emmental due to a higher moisture content.|$|E
