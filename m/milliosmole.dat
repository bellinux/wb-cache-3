40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} effects of first and second {{generation}} silicone hydrogel (SiH) contact lens wear on tear film osmolarity. METHODS: The healthy subjects who have never used contact lenses before {{were enrolled in the}} study. Tear film osmolarity values of 16 eyes (group 1) who wore first generation SiH contact lenses were compared with those of 18 eyes (group 2) who wore second generation SiH contact lenses after three months follow-up. RESULTS: Before contact lens wear, tear film osmolarity of groups 1 and 2 were 305. 02 ± 49. 08 <b>milliosmole</b> (mOsm) and 284. 66 ± 30. 18 mOsm, respectively. After three months of contact lens wear, osmolarity values were found 317. 74 ± 60. 23 mOsm in group 1 and 298. 40 ± 37. 77 mOsm in group 2. Although osmolarity values for both groups of SiH contact lens wear after three months periods were slightly higher than before the contact lens wear, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Contact lens wear may cause evaporation from the tear film and can increase tear film osmolarity leading to symptoms of dry eye disease. In the current study, {{there is a tendency to}} increase tear film osmolarity for both groups of SiH contact lens wear, but the difference is not statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|Diffusion {{functional}} MRI (DfMRI) reveals neuronal activation {{even when}} neurovascular coupling is abolished, contrary to blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI). Here, {{we show that}} the water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from DfMRI increased in specific rat brain regions under anesthetic conditions, reflecting the decreased neuronal activity observed with local field potentials (LFPs), especially in regions involved in wakefulness. In contrast, BOLD signals showed nonspecific changes, reflecting systemic effects of the anesthesia on overall brain hemodynamics status. Electrical stimulation of the central medial thalamus nucleus (CM) exhibiting this anesthesia-induced ADC increase led the animals to transiently wake up. Infusion in the CM of furosemide, a specific neuronal swelling blocker, led the ADC to increase further locally, although LFP activity remained unchanged, and increased the current threshold awakening the animals under CM electrical stimulation. Oppositely, induction of cell swelling in the CM through infusion of a hypotonic solution (- 80 <b>milliosmole</b> [mOsm] artificial cerebrospinal fluid [aCSF]) led to a local ADC decrease and a lower current threshold to wake up the animals. Strikingly, the local ADC changes produced by blocking or enhancing cell swelling in the CM were also mirrored remotely in areas functionally connected to the CM, such as the cingulate and somatosensory cortex. Together, those results strongly suggest that neuronal swelling is a significant mechanism underlying DfMRI...|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} between osmolarity and molarity {{can be easily}} explained by an example. A physiological saline solution {{can be made by}} 9 g of sodium chloride dissolved in 1 liter of water, or 50 grams of glucose in 1 liter. Salt has a molar mass of 58.44 g/mol, glucose of 180.15 g/mol. 50 grams of glucose results in 278 millimoles of glucose. 9 g of sodium chloride correspond to 154 millimoles of sodium chloride. The osmolarity of the solution of sodium chloride, however, is 308 <b>milliosmoles</b> / liter. This difference is due to the number of particles after solvation: one molecule of sodium chloride in water splits into two ions. Glucose, however, remains one molecule after dissolvation. As a result, the osmolarity of 50 g of glucose in 1 liter of water is approximately equal to 9 g of sodium chloride in 1 liter of water.|$|R
40|$|Sucrose uptake was {{studied in}} isolated, {{immature}} pea cotyledons (Pisum sativum L. cv Marzia) {{in relation to}} their developmental stage. During the developmental period examined the water content of the cotyledons decreased from ≈ 80 % “stage 1 ” to ≈ 55 % “stage 2 ”. When assayed in an isotonic medium (400 osmoles per cubic meter) the influx capacity per gram fresh weight for sucrose was almost constant during this developmental period. The influx could be analyzed into a saturable component (Km ≈ 9 moles per cubic meter; Vmax ≈ 150 nanomoles per minute per gram fresh weight) and an unsaturable component (ki ≈ 0. 5 nanomoles per minute per gram fresh weight [per mole per cubic meter]). Incubation in a hypotonic medium reduced the sucrose influx in stage 1 cotyledons, up to 80 % reduction at 0 <b>milliosmole</b> (medium without mannitol), but had no effect on sucrose uptake by stage 2 cotyledons. Reduced uptake in a hypotonic medium (100 osmoles per cubic meter) could be attributed to a lowering of the Vmax from 150 to 36 nanomoles per minute per gram fresh weight. During incubation of stage 1 cotyledons and stage 2 -cotyledons in a hypotonic medium (200 osmoles per cubic meter) their volume increased by 16 % and 5. 6 %, respectively, while the calculated turgor pressure increased from 0. 2 to 0. 6 megapascal for cotyledons of both developmental stages. Reduced sucrose influx in hypotonic medium, therefore, seems to be related to cell swelling (membrane stretching) rather than to increased turgor pressure...|$|E

The method allows the study of the factors effecting normal maturation and is applicable to other organisms. Three media are described: MM 100 contains only salts in the concentra-tions found in Acheta hemolymph; MMIOI contains in addition, amino acids; MMIO 2 contains sugars, vitamins and peptone as well. In the first medium (MMIOO) diplotene primary spermatocytes developed to metaphase II and spermatocytes in metaphase I completed meiosis II, but not consistently. Develop-ment to metaphase II was more consistent in the second medium (MMIO 1).

When the intercellular air spaces of etiolated pea (Pisum sativum L.) internodes were perfused with distilled H 2 O, the resulting solution contained a solute {{concentration of}} about 70 <b>milliosmoles</b> per kilogram. A second procedure involving vacuum infiltration of segments followed by centrifugation to collect the free space solution gave similar results. Apical stem segments yielded free space extracts about twice as concentrated as those from basal portions of the stem. After correcting for dilution of the free space solution by the infiltrated water, the osmotic pressure of the undiluted free space in pea stem tissue was estimated to be 2. 9 bars for apical segments, 1. 8 bars for basal regions. These values may be somewhat overestimated due to solute efflux from intracellular pools during the extraction procedure.

40|$|The time {{course of}} turgor {{regulation}} of the euryhaline giant-celled alga, Chara buckellii, is presented. Isolated intermodal cells were challenged by increasing or decreasing the external osmotic pressure by 150 <b>milliosmoles</b> per kilogram with all ions in the media or by dilution, respectively. Regulation following hypotonic stress was complete within 48 hours whereas regulation following hypertonic stress required between 96 and 144 hours. The change in internal osmotic pressure could be entirely accounted for by changes in vacuolar KCl in response to hypotonic stress, but this ion pair only accounted for 45 % {{of the change in}} response to hypertonic stress. The membrane potential of C. buckellii is normally hyperpolarized with respect to the equilibrium potential for K+ (EK). The membrane depolarized to a level close to EK in response to hypotonic treatment and this was accompanied by a transient increase in membrane conductance. In response to hypertonic stress, the membrane hyperpolarized transiently, then repolarized to a level close to the control. This was accompanied by a temporary decrease in membrane conductance. The data are discussed with respect to the ecological significance of the time course and ion transport mechanisms during turgor regulation...|$|R
40|$|Cryopreservation {{of swine}} embryos is inefficient. Our {{goal was to}} develop a {{non-invasive}} method for "relatively" high-throughput cryopreservation of in vivo-produced swine embryos. Since removal of the lipid droplets within early swine embryos improves cryosurvival we wanted to apply a technique of high osmolality treatment followed by centrifugation that was first developed for in vitro-produced swine embryos to in vivo-produced swine embryos. The first aim was to determine how sensitive the in vivo-produced zygote and 2 -cell stage embryo was to various high osmolality conditions for a short duration. Culture for 6, 12 or 18 min at 300, 400 or 500 <b>milliosmoles</b> (mOsm) had no detectable affect on the resulting blastocyst stage embryos (number of inner cell mass nuclei, trophectoderm nuclei, total number of nuclei, ratio of the trophectoderm to inner cell mass nuclei or percent blastocyst). However there was an effect of gilt on each of these parameters. For the second aim we focused on 300 mOsm for 6 min, 400 mOsm for 12 min, 500 mOsm for 12 min, and 500 mOsm for 18 min. The embryos were centrifuged for the duration of high osmolality treatment, then cultured to the blastocyst stage and vitrified. After vitrification and thawing the 500 mOsm for 18 min had the highest percent re-expansion with no difference in the total number of nuclei. While requiring a different base culture medium than in vitro-produced embryos, in vivo-derived embryos also survive cryopreservation without damage to their zona pellucida...|$|R

The cellular volume and aqueous {{space of the}} alga, measured by [14 C] mannitol and 3 H 2 O tracer analyses of centrifuged cell pellets, ranged between 2. 3 and 3. 1 picoliters and between 1. 5 and 2. 1 picoliters, respectively. The nonaqueous space determined in those analyses (28 - 35 %) {{was consistent with the}} cell composition of the alga. The glycerol content of the alga increased almost linearly with increasing salinity; its contribution to intracellular osmolality at 200 % ASW was about 57 %. The contribution of amino acids and soluble carbohydrates to the cell osmotic balance was small. Intracellular ion concentrations determined by analyzing centrifuged cell pellets of known [14 C]mannitol space by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and by neutron activation analyses of washed cells were similar. At 10 % ASW, potassium and magnesium were the major cations, and chloride and phosphate were the major anions. The sodium and chloride content of the alga increased with increasing salinity; at 200 % ASW the intracellular concentration of both sodium and chloride was about 400 millimolar.

We concluded that the 18 L peptide destabilizes membranes, leading to a transient formation of large defects that result in contents leakage and, {{in the presence of}} bilayer-bilayer contact, could lead to vesicle fusion. Here we report that this defect formation is strongly enhanced by the membrane tension induced by osmotic swelling of vesicles. Even below standard leakage-inducing peptide/lipid ratios, membrane resistance to osmotic tension drops from hundreds to tens of <b>milliosmoles.</b> The actual decrease is dependent on the peptide/lipid ratio and on the type of lipid. We propose that under membrane tension a peptidic pore serves as a nucleation site for the transient formation of a lipidic pore.

This tension modulation of leakage was observed for other class L peptides (mastoparan, K 18 L) and thus may be of general applicability for the action of membrane active lytic peptides...|$|R

We examined the ionic mediators of the osmosensitive response. An increase in osmolality to 550 <b>milliosmoles</b> per kg of water (mosmol/kgH 2 O) for 48 h by replacement of NaCl with choline chloride did not prevent the up-regulation of the γ subunit. Neither Na+ ionophores nor inhibitors of cellular Na+ uptake altered the up-regulation of the γ subunit or JNK activation. Changes in cell cation concentrations driven by incubation in low-K+ medium were effective in up-regulating the α 1 subunit of Na/K-ATPase but {{did not have any}} effect on the γ subunit. The replacement of NaCl with choline chloride did not down-regulate γ-subunit expression in cells adapted to hypertonicity. In contrast, the replacement of NaCl with sodium acetate, or pretreatment of cells with the Cl- channel inhibitor 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -phenylpropyl-amino) benzoic acid (NPPB) completely blocked γ-subunit up-regulation, inhibited JNK activation, and caused a significant decrement in cell survival in hypertonic but not isotonic conditions. In adapted cells, replacement of 300 mosmol/kgH 2 O NaCl with sodium acetate resulted in down-regulation of the γ subunit. In conclusion, we describe a Na+-independent, Cl [...] dependent mechanism for hypertonicity-mediated activation of the JNK and the subsequent synthesis of the γ subunit of Na/K-ATPase, which are necessary for cellular survival in these anisotonic conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{conditions that}} swell mammalian neurons are clinically important but contentious. Distinguishing the neuronal component of brain swelling requires viewing intact neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and axons and measuring their changing volume in real time. Cultured or dissociated neuronal somata swell within minutes under acutely overhydrated conditions and shrink when strongly dehydrated. But paradoxically, most {{central nervous system}} (CNS) neurons do not express aquaporins, the membrane channels that conduct osmotically driven water. Using 2 -photon laser scanning microscopy (2 PLSM), we monitored neuronal volume under osmotic stress in real time. Specifically, the volume of pyramidal neurons in cerebral cortex and axon terminals comprising cerebellar mossy fibers was measured deep within live brain slices. The expected swelling or shrinking of the gray matter was confirmed by recording altered light transmittance and by indirectly measur-ing extracellular resistance over a wide osmotic range of 280 to 180 <b>milliOsmoles</b> (mOsm). Neurons expressing green fluorescent protein were then imaged with 2 PLSM between 240 and 180 mOsm over 20 min. Surprisingly, pyramidal somata, dendrites, and spines steadfastly maintained their volume, as did the cerebellar axon terminals. This precluded a need for the neurons to acutely regulate volume, preserved their intrinsic electrophysiological stability, and confirmed that these CNS nerve cells lack functional aquaporins. Thus, whereas water easily permeates the aquaporin-rich endothelia and glia driving osmotic brain swelling, neurons tenatiously maintain their volume. However, these same neurons then swell dramatically upon oxygen/glucose deprivation or [K 1] 0 elevation, so prolonged depolarization (as during stroke or seizure) apparently swells neurons by opening nonaquaporin channels to water...|$|R

40|$|Central hyperosmotic {{stimulation}} (HS) evokes {{increases in}} sympathetic nerve activity mediated by activation of angiotensin type 1 receptors in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Macrophage inhibitory migration factor (MIF) is an intracellular inhibitory regulator of angiotensin type 1 receptor-mediated actions of angiotensin II within neurons of the PVN. MIF mediates its actions via its intrinsic thiol-protein oxidoreductase activity. We demonstrate that intracerebroventricular injection of hypertonic saline into Sprague-Dawley rats elicits a significant (approximate to 112 %) increase in MIF mRNA {{expression in the}} PVN. Next, we evaluated the effect of viral-mediated expression of either MIF or [C 60 S]-MIF (which lacks thiol-protein oxidoreductase activity) in the PVN on the sympathoexcitation evoked by HS. We used a decorticate, arterially perfused in situ preparation of male Wistar rats (60 to 80 g). HS was induced by raising perfusate osmolality from 290 to 380 <b>milliosmoles</b> for 40 seconds. Seven to 10 days before experiments, rats were injected bilaterally (500 nL per side) with 0. 9 % saline (control) or with adenoassociated virus to express MIF, [C 60 S]-MIF, or enhanced green fluorescent protein in the PVN. HS produced sympathoexcitation in both the 0. 9 % saline and enhanced green fluorescent protein groups (sympathetic nerve activity increase of + 27 +/- 4 % and + 25 +/- 4 %, respectively; P< 0. 05), an effect that was not observed in the MIF group (+ 4 +/- 5 %). Conversely, the HS-induced increase in sympathetic nerve activity was potentiated in the [C 60 S]-MIF group (+ 45 +/- 6 %; P< 0. 05). We propose that MIF acting within the PVN is a major counterregulator of HS-induced sympathoexcitation, an effect that depends on thiol-protein oxidoreductase activity.

Ten additional animals underwent subretinal injection of 0. 02 ml of 0. 046 % ICG (251 mOsm), 0. 13 % trypan blue (260 mOsm), 4. 6 % GL (253 mOsm), or BSS (300 mOsm). Animals were examined 6, 12, and 24 hours and 14 days after the procedure by fluorescein angiography and fundus evaluation; histologic studies were performed by light and transmission electron microscopy. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical outcome, fluorescein angiography, and histopathologic results. Results: All subretinal blebs were flat 24 hours after the procedure. Fluorescein angiography showed window defects where ICG and trypan blue had been injected. Subretinal BSS and GL resulted in minimal abnormalities of the photoreceptor outer segments (POS) during follow-up. Hypo-osmolar GL caused edema in all retinal layers; pyknosis of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) was observed 24 hours after injection. Subretinal injection of trypan blue resulted in histologic abnormalities 24 hours and 14 days after surgery. Hypo-osmolar trypan blue caused edema of the POS and the photoreceptor inner segments and pyknosis of the ONL 6 and 12 hours after surgery; the retinal pigment epithelium also was affected 24 hours and 14 days after surgery. Subretinal injection of iso-osmolar and hypo-osmolar ICG caused severe damage of all retinal layers during the entire follow-up. Conclusions: Subretinal injection of 0. 05 % ICG results in more substantial retinal damage than that associated with the 0. 15 % trypan blue subretinal injection. the damage induced by hypo-osmolar solutions {{was more important than}} that caused by the iso-osmolar solutions.

40|$|The neurohormonal {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} regulation of extracellular osmolality are of critical physiological importance. These mechanisms act to maintain the osmolality of human plasma close to a “set-point” of about 290 <b>milliosmoles</b> per litre. The magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) of the supraoptic nucleus (SON), synthesize and secrete the neurohypophysial hormones vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT). The primary hormonal regulator of osmolality is VP, which is released by the MNCs {{as a function of}} plasma osmolality and acts by controlling water reabsorption at the kidneys. MNCs decrease their volume and thus plasma membrane tension in response to acute increases in external osmolality and lack the compensatory mechanisms that limit volume changes in most cell types. This enables them to transduce changes in osmolality into changes in excitability via a mechanosensitive cation channel. It has been shown in vivo that sustained increases in plasma osmolality, however, cause marked hypertrophy of the MNCs that is part of a structural and functional adaptation that is thought to enable the MNCs to secrete large quantities of VP for prolonged periods. The mechanism of this important structural and functional adaptation of MNCs is difficult to address in an in vivo preparation and so an in vitro model of acutely isolated MNCs was used to pharmacologically assess the hypertrophy. It was observed that MNCs exposed to sustained hypertonic solutions, underwent an immediate shrinkage followed by a hypertrophy over 90 minutes and quickly recovered when reintroduced to isotonic conditions. This effect was found to depend {{on the size of the}} increase in osmolality, as smaller increases in osmolality resulted in smaller shrinkage and hypertrophy of the MNCs. Hypertrophy was shown to be independent of cell volume regulatory processes as inhibitors of the Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter did not affect hypertrophy. Hypertrophy was also shown to be dependent on activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC), as adding inhibitors of these enzymes to the hypertonic solution prevented hypertrophy. Hypertrophy could occur in isotonic conditions by inducing cell depolarization, increasing intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) and by activating PKC, thus showing each of these processes are involved in hypertrophy. Recovery from hypertrophy depends upon dynamin-mediated endocytosis as blocking dynamin function prevented recovery. In addition, exposing the MNCs to hypotonic solution resulted in an immediate enlargement followed by a sustained decrease in cell size. Finally, exposing acutely isolated MNCs to hypertonic solution for two hours resulted in a 37 % increase in the immunolabeling of the L-type Ca 2 + channel CaV 1. 2 subunit. This increase in CaV 1. 2 immunolabeling does not depend on action potential firing as adding tetrodotoxin (TTX) to the hypertonic solution failed to prevent the increase.
