5|$|The Liberty Head nickel was {{replaced}} after 1912, and initially {{there was no}} indication that 1913-dated pieces with that design existed. In December 1919, a coin dealer, Samuel W. Brown, placed advertisements in coin publications, offering to buy 1913 Liberty Head nickels. The following August, Brown appeared at the annual American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention bearing such a piece. Brown claimed that a <b>master</b> <b>die</b> had been prepared for 1913 and that these pieces had been run off to test it. As it turned out, Brown possessed five coins, which he eventually sold. After spending fifteen years {{in the hands of the}} eccentric Col. E.H.R. Green, the famous Fort Worth, Texas, area collector, the coins were finally dispersed in 1943. Since then, they have had several owners each. Today, two are on public display—at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the ANA's Money Museum in Colorado Springs, while three are owned privately. The most recent sale of a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was in January 2010, when one sold for $3,737,500 in an auction.|$|E
5|$|Two {{prototype}} dollars {{were struck}} at the Philadelphia Mint on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed. Striking such {{large pieces of}} tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier reducing lathe to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting <b>master</b> <b>die</b> directly to restore {{at least some of}} the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief. This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail. Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date. The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the San Francisco Mint) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to David Eisenhower (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.|$|E
25|$|India Government Mint, Hyderabad was {{established}} in 503 AD by Mir Akbar Ali Khan Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III as a private mint and along with other private mints in the country. The mint produced Indian coins {{in the name of}} Emperor of India. Initially the mint was situated at Sultan Sahi in Moghalpura suburb of the Hyderabad city. The dies were made of steel but the private mints did not have a <b>master</b> <b>die.</b> The dies hence differed in size, production of coins was crude with only partial inscription appearing on coins frequently.|$|E

25|$|The Mint's largest {{facility}} is the Philadelphia Mint. The current facility at Philadelphia, {{which opened in}} 1969, is the fourth Philadelphia Mint. The first was built in 1792, when Philadelphia was still the U.S. capital, and began operation in 1793. Until 1980, coins minted at Philadelphia bore no mint mark, with the exceptions of the Susan B. Anthony dollar and the wartime Jefferson nickel. In 1980, the P mint mark was added to all U.S. coinage except the cent. Until 1968, the Philadelphia Mint was responsible for nearly all official proof coinage. Philadelphia is also the site of <b>master</b> <b>die</b> production for U.S. coinage, and the engraving and design departments of the Mint are also located there.|$|E
500|$|There are few {{varieties}} in the series, {{and they}} are relatively minor. [...] They principally involve the mint mark: several repunchings, one overpunching of a D over an S in 1942, and some changes in size. [...] One oddity is the 1943/1942, {{which is not a}} true overdate but was formed by a working die struck once from a 1942-dated <b>master</b> <b>die,</b> and once from one dated 1943. [...] Some 1946 half dollars show a doubled die on the reverse.|$|E

500|$|There {{are only}} 35different dates and mintmarks in the series, {{making it a}} {{relatively}} inexpensive collecting project. [...] A widely known variety is the 1955 [...] "Bugs Bunny" [...] half. [...] This variety {{was caused by a}} die clash between an obverse die and a reverse die. [...] The impact of the eagle's wings on the other die caused a marking outside of Franklin's mouth which, according to some, resembles buck teeth. [...] The quality of half dollars struck by the Mint decreased in the late 1950s, caused by deterioration of the <b>master</b> <b>die</b> from which working dies were made for coinage.|$|E
500|$|On November 11, Barber sent Ellsworth {{cardboard}} {{impressions of}} the latest versions of the coin; Ellsworth expressed pleasure at their appearance. The chief engraver made final adjustments directly to the <b>master</b> <b>die,</b> rather than modifying a larger model {{to be placed in}} a reducing lathe. This diework was the technique which his father and predecessor as chief engraver had used; it was also the way in which Charles Barber preferred to work. Barber added his monogram [...] "B" [...] to the design; it is on the cut-off of the bust above the letter B in [...] "Columbian", while Morgan's [...] "M" [...] is hidden in the rigging of the ship on the reverse.|$|E
500|$|In {{an initial}} attempt {{to improve the}} quality of the pieces, the Mint made slight {{modifications}} to the designs, though both the old (Type I) and new (Type II) were struck in 1958 and 1959. [...] One obvious difference between the types is the number of long tail feathers on the eagle—Type I half dollars have four tail feathers, Type II only three. [...] Approximately 20% of the 1958 Philadelphia coinage is Type II, struck from dies which were first used to strike the 1958 proofs. [...] About 70% of the 1959 half dollars struck at Philadelphia are Type II; all 1958-D and 1959-D half dollars are Type I. The Mint recut the <b>master</b> <b>die</b> before beginning the 1960 coinage, improving quality.|$|E

500|$|The U.S. only minted the Morgan dollar {{again during}} 1921, the only {{year in which}} Morgan dollars were struck at the Denver mint. Since the Treasury had {{destroyed}} the obsolete Morgan dollar dies in 1910, Morgan had to create an entirely new <b>master</b> <b>die.</b> [...] Another provision of the Pittman Act authorized the U.S. to mint a replacement coin for every silver dollar melted. During the same year, the Peace dollar was first issued to commemorate the end of World War I.

500|$|On March 4, 1909, the day {{on which}} Roosevelt left office, {{replaced}} by William Howard Taft, Brenner met with Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber in Philadelphia. [...] Barber had written to Leach, suggesting that Brenner's designs {{would have to be}} modified to be suitable for coinage. [...] On , Brenner wrote to Leach stating that Barber seemed in no hurry to have the new coins produced. [...] Brenner also complained that the Mint was losing detail as it reduced the large models to coin-sized hubs. [...] Barber had been stung by criticism that he had lost detail in this way with the new gold coins, and he raised no objection to having the reductions done by an outside silversmith. [...] After several hubs were prepared by the Medallic Art Company of New York, Barber sank a <b>master</b> <b>die</b> and sent it to Brenner for retouching.|$|E

6000|$|The tourists--may their <b>master</b> <b>die</b> an evil {{death at}} {{the hand of a}} mad locomotive!--poured into that place with a joyful whoop, and, scarce washing the dust from themselves, began to {{celebrate}} the 4th of July. They called it [...] "patriotic exercises"; elected a clergyman of their own faith as president, and, sitting on the landing of the first floor, began to make speeches and read the Declaration of Independence. The clergyman rose up and told them they were the greatest, freest, sublimest, most chivalrous, and richest people {{on the face of the}} earth, and they all said Amen. Another clergyman asserted in the words of the Declaration that all men were created equal, and equally entitled to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. I should like to know whether the wild and woolly West recognises this first right as freely as the grantors intended. The clergyman then bade the world note that the tourists included representatives of seven of the New England States; whereat I felt deeply sorry for the New England States in their latter days. He opined that this running to and fro upon the earth, under the auspices of the excellent Rayment, would draw America more closely together, especially when the Westerners remembered the perils that they of the East had surmounted by rail and river. At duly appointed intervals the congregation sang [...] "My country, 'tis of thee" [...] to the tune of [...] "God save the Queen" [...] (here they did not stand up) and the [...] "Star-Spangled Banner" [...] (here they did), winding up the exercise with some doggrel of their own composition to the tune of [...] "John Brown's Body," [...] movingly setting forth the perils before alluded to.
