40|$|Dissolved {{substances}} released during {{decomposition of}} the white water lily (Nymphaea odorata) can alter {{the growth rate of}} Okefenokee Swamp bacterioplankton. In microcosm experiments dissolved compounds released from senescent Nymphaea leaves caused a transient reduction in the abundance and activity of water column bacterioplankton, followed by a period of intense bacterial growth. Rates of [3 H]thymidine incorporation and turnover of dissolved d-glucose were depressed by over 85 %, 3 h after the addition of Nymphaea leachates to microcosms containing Okefenokee Swamp water. Bacterial activity subsequently recovered; after 20 h [3 H]thymidine incorporation in leachate-treated microcosms was 10 -fold greater than that in control microcosms. The recovery of activity was due to a shift in the composition of the bacterial population toward resistance to the inhibitory compounds present in Nymphaea leachates. Inhibitory compounds released during the decomposition of aquatic macrophytes thus act as selective agents which alter the community structure of the bacterial population with respect to leachate resistance. Soluble compounds derived from macrophyte decomposition influence the rate of bacterial secondary production and the availability of microbial biomass to <b>microconsumers...</b>|$|E
40|$|Rates of {{bacterial}} secondary production by free-living bacterioplankton in the Okefenokee Swamp {{are high and}} comparable to reported values {{for a wide variety}} of marine and freshwater ecosystems. Bacterial production in the water column of five aquatic habitats of the Okefenokee Swamp was substantial despite the acidic (pH 3. 7), low-nutrient, peat-accumulating character of the environment. Incorporation of [3 H]thymidine into cold-trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material ranged from 0. 03 to 2. 93 nmol liter− 1 day− 1) and corresponded to rates {{of bacterial}} secondary production of 3. 4 to 342. 2 μg of carbon liter− 1 day− 1 (mean, 87. 8 μg of carbon liter− 1 day− 1). Bacterial production was strongly seasonal and appeared to be coupled to annual changes in temperature and primary production. Bacterial doubling times ranged from 5 h to 15 days and were fastest during the warm months of the year, when the biomass of aquatic macrophytes was high, and slowest during the winter, when the plant biomass was reduced. The high rates of bacterial turnover in Okefenokee waters suggest that bacterial growth is an important mechanism in the transformation of dissolved organic carbon into the nutrient-rich bacterial biomass which is utilized by <b>microconsumers...</b>|$|E
40|$|As western markets stagnate, {{companies}} {{are looking to}} the emerging world for growth, and have begun to experiment with offerings that target the four billion <b>microconsumers</b> {{at the base of}} the pyramid. To successfully engage these emerging consumers, firms must innovate around their product offerings and business models. This report sought to better understand innovation in a low-income market context. It explored what drives companies to enter low-income markets, the triggers for innovation in these markets, and the characteristics of that innovation, drawing particularly on Clayton Christensen’s theory of disruptive innovation. Nineteen interviews with executives at 11 companies operating in South Africa were interviewed in order to test propositions derived from the literature. The findings showed that companies enter low-income markets largely in pursuit of growth, but that a variety of secondary factors also play a role. The data indicated that innovation in low-income markets is often triggered by negative factors such as lack of infrastructure or limited buying power, rather than the positive factors cited in much of the existing innovation literature. Finally, it illustrated that companies often exhibit the elements of disruptive innovation when they engage with emerging consumers. The report then offered two models [...] Innovation in low-income contexts: a descriptive model, and the Emerging Consumer Innovation Web [...] to help companies frame the innovation process in a low-income context. It concluded that companies need to adopt a new philosophy of innovation when engaging emerging consumers, one which embraces the challenge of low-income markets as a springboard for innovation and a catalyst for creativity.
