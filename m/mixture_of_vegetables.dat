Adjacent to the castle are the Queen Mother's Garden and the kitchen garden and glasshouses. The Queen Mother's Garden was built by English Heritage as a 95th birthday gift for the then Lord Warden in 1997, the site having been originally part of the wider kitchen gardens, before being turned into a tennis court in the 1920s. Designed by Penelope Hobhouse, the garden incorporates classical and Islamic themes, with a 92-foot-long (28 m) pool, a viewing mound and a classical pavilion.

Following a clue from Astrid, Amy and Dan go to the National Museum of Natural History, which houses the largest collection of Lewis and Clark items. On the train, Vesper One sends them a video of the hostages. Atticus realizes that Ted is blinking Morse code and decodes the message: Riley McGrath is Vesper One. At the museum, they find out that Isabel wanted to see Lewis and Clark's compass. Dan sees numbers and letters scratched onto the back of the compass. Evan and Ian receive a call from Phoenix from a motel in Washington state and head there with Hamilton and Jonah, whom Sandy, Casper, and Cheyenne follow. Disguised as a waitress, Cheyenne forces them into a van, taking them to the Rocky Mountains. Dan decides to take a train to the Cascade Mountain Range, where they believe the hostages and the Machina Fini Mundi are. Atticus grows suspicious of Dave and finds out that Dave Speminer is an anagram of Damien Vesper, the founder of the Vespers. Dan learns that Isabel had been posing as his father and sending the text messages. Isabel kidnaps Atticus, steals the serum in Dan's bag, and escapes. Amy discovers that Isabel modified the coordinates etched on the compass's reverse. The location of the hostages and the Machina Fini Mundi turns out to be on the Rocky Mountains.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} {{vegetable}} preference and leisure-time physical activity (LPA) on cancer have been inconsistent. We {{examined the effects}} of dietary preference and physical activity, as well as their combined effect on cancer risk. Methods This prospective cohort study included 444, 963 men, older than 40 years, who participated in a national health examination program begun in 1996. Based on {{the answer to the question}} "What kind of dietary preference do you have?" we categorized dietary preference as (1) vegetables, (2) <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> and meat, and (3) meats. We categorized LPA as low (Results During the 6 -year follow-up period, we identified 14, 109 cancer cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that a preference for vegetables or a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> and meat as opposed to a preference for meat played a significant protective role against lung cancer incidence (aRR, 0. 81; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 68 – 0. 98). Compared with the low LPA group, subjects with moderate-high LPA had a significantly lower risk for stomach (aRR, 0. 91; 95 %CI, 0. 86 – 0. 98), lung (aRR, 0. 83; 95 %CI, 0. 75 – 0. 92), and liver (aRR, 0. 88; 95 %CI, 0. 81 – 0. 95) cancer. Among current smokers, the combined moderate-high LPA and vegetable or <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> and meat preference group showed a 40 % reduced risk of lung cancer (aRR, 0. 60; 95 %CI, 0. 47 – 0. 76) compared with the combined low LPA and meat preference group. Among never/former smokers, subjects with moderate-high LPA and a preference for vegetables or a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> and meat showed reduced stomach cancer risk (aRR, 0. 72; 95 %CI, 0. 54 – 0. 95). Conclusion Our findings add to the evidence of the beneficial effects of vegetable preference on lung cancer risk and of physical activity on lung, stomach, and liver cancer risk. Additionally, vegetable preference combined with LPA might significantly reduce lung and stomach cancer risk. </p...|$|E
