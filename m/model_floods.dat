40|$|Abstract: The {{number of}} flood {{disasters}} has increased worldwide in recent decades. Identifying the optimal resolution or scale at which to represent digital terrain models DTMs {{is critical in}} order to improve our ability to accurately and efficiently <b>model</b> <b>floods.</b> Few studies have attempted to compare flood modeling results using different resolutions of DTMs in divergent environments. In this study flooding on the Tar River in the coastal plains and the Watauga River in the mountains of North Carolina were modeled using hydrologic information obtained following Hurricanes Floyd and Ivan. The effectiveness of DTMs derived from light detection and ranging and United States Geological Survey elevation data at commonly available resolutions in North Carolina were assessed. A quantitative diagnostic method based on measuring the distance flooded along transects was applied for evaluating the horizontal extent and internal pattern of flooding. The use of additional diagnostic metrics area, volume, and shape along with a visual graphic assessment enhanced the evaluation of flood modeling results. The extent and internal pattern of flooding in the low-relief coastal plains was found to be especially sensitive to the representation of terrain, and in the mountains 3030 -m data regardless of source were found to be dramati-cally unsuitable for flood modeling...|$|E

40|$|Floods {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} occurring natural disasters with severe impacts on a global level. This has led to an increased attention for global flood risk assessments, which require global hydrological models to make an analysis of future scenarios possible. However, global models operate on scales much larger than those required to accurately <b>model</b> <b>floods.</b> Downscaling techniques have been used to fix this issue, but these cannot account for dynamic feedback effects to hydrological processes. Therefore, a new approach has been investigated in which a global hydrological model (PCR-GLOBWB) is coupled to a high-resolution hydrodynamical model (D-Flow Flexible Mesh) that operates on the fine scales required for flood modelling and allows the inclusion of dynamic feedback effects. An automated grid creation procedure, based on the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) algorithm, is used for the hydrodynamical model to ensure that the coupled setup could be applied on a global scale. The coupling between models is facilitated with the Basic Modeling Interface (BMI). Several coupled model setups are tested for the Niger River and its Inner Delta; a large seasonality inundated wetland where floods are known to have a large impact on hydrological processes. Results indicate an improvement over the stand-alone models and identify remaining issues which will need to be dealt with before the coupled model can be applied on a global scale...|$|E
40|$|Lors des crues extrêmes en ville, une forte part des écoulements reste en surface. Pour simuler ces inondations, deux modèles sont présentés : le {{logiciel}} REM 2 U unidimensionnel a pour objectif de simuler la propagation des débits de crue dans l'ensemble d'un réseau de rues {{alors que}} le logiciel Rubar 20 bidimensionnel vise à fournir plus d'information sur ces écoulements. Des calculs avec ces deux logiciels ont été menés sur la crue d'octobre 1988 dans un quartier de Nîmes. Lors de cet événement, les hauteurs d'eau maximales ont dépassé deux mètres en certains points et les vitesses 2 m/s ce qui entraînait des passages en régime torrentiel. A partir des données rassemblées sur les sections en travers des rues, des maillages de calcul limités au réseau de rues ont été construits pour les deux logiciels afin de permettre un calcul détaillé. La comparaison des résultats avec les laisses de crue montre des situations très contrastées d'un point à un autre pour une hauteur d'eau maximale moyenne sur l'ensemble de la zone inondée correctement simulée. L'écart sur cette hauteur est, en moyenne, de 1 m ce qui provient des incertitudes sur les observations, sur la topographie et sur les conditions aux limites, des approximations lors de la modélisation et de particularités locales non décrites. Entre les deux logiciels, l'évolution des hauteurs et des vitesses est généralement très proche bien que, comme pour la comparaison avec les laisses de crue, des différences locales importantes sont observées. The hydraulic models {{that are used}} to simulate floods in rural areas are not adapted to <b>model</b> <b>floods</b> through urban areas, because of details that may deviate flows and create strong discontinuities in the water levels, and because of the possible water flow running in the sewage network. However, such modelling is strongly required because damage is often concentrated in urban areas. Thus, it is necessary to develop models specifically dedicated to such floods. In the southern part of France, rains may have a high intensity but floods generally last a few hours. During extreme events such as the October 1988 flood in the city of Nîmes, most of the flow remained on the ground with high water depths and high velocities, and the role of sewage network can be neglected. A 1 -D model and a 2 -D model were used to calculate such flows, which may become supercritical. On the catchments of the streams which cross the city of Nîmes, the rainfall was estimated as 80 mm in one hour and 250 mm in six hours in October 1988, although some uncertainties remain. The return period can be estimated between 150 and 250 years. The zone selected to test the models was an area 1. 2 km long and less than 1 km wide in the north-eastern part of the city. It includes a southern part with a high density of houses. The slope from the North (upstream) to the South (downstream) was more than 1 % on average and was decreasing from North to South. Various topographical and hydrological data were obtained from the local Authorities. The basic data were composed of 258 cross sections of 69 streets with 11 to 19 points for each cross section. Observations of the limits of the flooded areas and of the peak water levels at more than 80 points can be used to validate the calculation results. The inputs consisted of two discharge hydrographs, estimated from a rainfall-discharge model from rains with a return period of 100 years, which may result in an underestimate of these inputs. These two hydrographs correspond to the two main structures that cross the railway embankment, which constitutes an impervious upstream boundary of the modelled area. Whereas the western and eastern boundaries are well delimitated by hills above maximum water levels, the downstream southern boundary is somewhat more questionable because of possibilities of backwater and inflows from neighbouring areas. The 1 -D software REM 2 U solved the Saint Venant equations on a meshed network. At crossroads, continuities of discharge and of water heads were set. The hydraulic jump was modelled by a numerical diffusion applied wherever high water levels were found. The Lax Wendroff numerical scheme was implemented. It included a prediction step and a correction step, which implied precise solving of these very unsteady and hyperbolic problems. The software was validated on numerous test cases (Al Mikdad, 2000) which proved the adaptation to problems of calculations in a network of streets. The 2 -D software Rubar 20 solves 2 -D shallow water equations by an explicit second-order Van Leer type finite volume scheme on a computational grid made from triangles and quadrilaterals (Paquier, 1998). The discontinuities (hydraulic jumps for instance) are treated as ordinary points through the solving of Riemann problems. For the Nîmes case, the grid was built from the cross sections of the streets. Four grids were built with respectively 4, 5, 7 or 11 points for every cross section and these points correspond to the main characteristics of the cross section: the walls of the buildings, the sidewalks, the gutters and the middle point. The simplest crossroads were described from the crossings of the lines corresponding to these points, which provide respectively 16, 25, 49 or 121 computational cells. The space step was about 25 metres along the streets but went as low as 0. 1 m in the crossroads; due to the explicit scheme, which implies that the Courant number was limited to 1, the time step was very small and a long computational time was required. The computations were performed with a uniform Strickler coefficient of 40 m 1 / 3 /s. Both 1 -D and 2 -D models provided results that agreed well with observed water levels. The limits of the flooded area were also quite well simulated. However, locally, the differences between calculated and observed maximum water depths were high, resulting in an average deviation of about 1 metre. The reasons for such deviations could come from three main causes. First, the uncertainty of topographical data is relatively high, because of the interpolation between measured cross sections without a detailed complementary DEM (digital elevation model). Second, the observed levels were also uncertain and reveal local situations that are not reconstructed by the hydraulic models which provided maximum water levels averaged on one cell which may not coincide with the exact location of the observations. Finally, modelling means a simplification of the processes, which implies cancelling the level variations due to some obstacles, such as cars, which are not simple to identify. In conclusion, both software packages can model a flood, even a flash flood, in an urbanised area. Research is still necessary to develop methods to fully use urban databases in order to define details more precisely. The improvements to the 1 -D software should include a better modelling of storage and of crossroads with an integration of adapted relations for the head losses. 2 -D software has a greater potential but the difficulty to build an optimal computational grid means a long computational time, which limits the use of such software to small areas. For both software packages, methods still need to be developed in order to represent exchanges with the sewage network, storage inside buildings and inputs directly coming from rainfall...|$|E

40|$|A {{basic data}} {{requirement}} {{of a river}} <b>flood</b> inundation <b>model</b> is a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of the reach being studied. The scale at which modeling is required determines the accuracy required of the DTM. For <b>modeling</b> <b>floods</b> in urban areas, a high resolution DTM such as that produced by airborne LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is most useful, and large parts of many developed countries have now been mapped using LiDAR. In remoter areas, {{it is possible to}} <b>model</b> <b>flooding</b> on a larger scale using a lower resolution DTM, and in the near future the DTM of choice is likely to be that derived from the TanDEM-X Digital Elevation Model (DEM). A variable-resolution global DTM obtained by combining existing high and low resolution data sets would be useful for <b>modeling</b> <b>flood</b> water dynamics globally, at high resolution wherever possible and at lower resolution over larger rivers in remote areas. A further important data resource used in <b>flood</b> <b>modeling</b> is the <b>flood</b> extent, commonly derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Flood extents become more useful if they are intersected with the DTM, when water level observations (WLOs) at the flood boundary can be estimated at various points along the river reach. To illustrate the utility of such a global DTM, two examples of recent research involving WLOs at opposite ends of the spatial scale are discussed. The first requires high resolution spatial data, and involves the assimilation of WLOs from a real sequence of high resolution SAR images into a <b>flood</b> <b>model</b> to update the model state with observations over time, and to estimate river discharge and model parameters, including river bathymetry and friction. The results indicate the feasibility of such an Earth Observation-based flood forecasting system. The second example is at a larger scale, and uses SAR-derived WLOs to improve the lower-resolution TanDEM-X DEM in the area covered by the flood extents. The resulting reduction in random height error is significant...|$|R

Currently, {{there are several}} options {{that can be used}} for <b>modelling</b> <b>floods</b> in urban areas and the present work attempts to investigate effectiveness of different model formulations in modelling supercritical and transcritical flow conditions. In our work, we use the following three methods for modelling one-dimensional (1 D) flows: the MIKE 11 flow model, Kutija’s method, and the Roe scheme. We use two methods for modelling two-dimensional (2 D) flows: the MIKE 21 flow model and a non-inertia 2 D model. Apart from the MIKE 11 and MIKE 21 models, the code for all other models was developed and used for the purposes of the present work. The performance of the models was evaluated using hypothetical case studies with the intention of representing some configurations that can be found in urban floodplains. The present work does not go into the assessment of these models in modelling various topographical features that may be found on urban floodplains, but rather focuses on how they perform in simulating supercritical and transcritical flows.

Local governments, state and federal emergency management agencies and private consultants all play some role in their development. Similarly, numerous stakeholders have {{a keen interest in}} accessing these models to support their risk management. However, a significant impediment to improved risk reduction is access to <b>flood</b> <b>model</b> results in a structured and user-friendly framework. The advent of the Internet and its associated technologies creates excellent opportunities for improving access to hazard data. This research describes the development of an Internet architecture called FloodBank, which provides a structured depository for <b>flood</b> <b>model</b> results making them rapidly available to multiple stakeholders. In addition to an user authentication manager, a <b>flood</b> <b>model</b> metadata manager and a relational database management system, FloodBank also incorporates an online GIS. <b>Flood</b> <b>model</b> custodians can readily deploy FloodBank as it is constructed using very affordable software components.
