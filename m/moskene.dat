40|$|Musk ambrette, {{a contact}} and photocontact allergen, is a {{synthetic}} fragrance present in aftershave lotions and many toiletries. Thirty-four patients with contact and photocontact allergy to musk ambrette were studied. All had a facial eczema. Four distinctive clinical pictures were seen. These were plaques of eczema, jawline (mandibular) dermatitis, acute contact dermatitis and chronic actinic dermatitis. Twenty-six patients were light sensitive by history and 10 were diagnosed by clinical criteria as having chronic actinic dermatitis. Patch and photopatch testing to musk ambrette showed that seven patients had pure photocontact dermatitis to musk ambrette. Eight patients had contact dermatitis to musk ambrette {{but this was}} exacerbated by irradiation. Cross reaction with <b>moskene</b> occurred. Scrupulous avoidance of musk ambrette has resulted in clinical resolution in most patients...|$|E
40|$|Nitrosamine {{analyses}} using a {{gas chromatograph}} (GC) interfaced to a thermal energy analyzer (TEA) showed "nitrosamine-like " signals for extracts of shampoo, conditioner, and antiperspirant/deodorant products. In several instances these "nitrosamine-like " responses {{could not be}} distinguished from the re-tention time of N-nitroso-N-methyl dodecylamine (NMDDA); however, the levels appeared unrealistically high (ppm instead of ppb) and the reproducibility was poor. Re-examination of these samples by gas chromatography/mass pectrometry (GC/MS) disproved the presence of NMDDA and identified the com-pound producing the GC/TEA signal (i. e., the false positive) as a nitromusk compound, musk xylol, present in the product fragrances. Other "nitrosamine-like " GC/TEA signals have also been linked to other nitromusk perfume raw materials (PRM) including <b>moskene</b> and musk ketone. Nitromusks are perfume components in numerous cosmetic products and can interfere with the GC/TEA analysis of nitrosamines. Confirmatory experiments uch as GC/MS, wet chemical procedures, or UV-photolysis hould be run in conjunction with any GC/TEA determination of nitrosamines. An example of a false positive in a shampoo extract is presented...|$|E
40|$|Natural musk (muscone) is {{a highly}} prized natural product for use in {{expensive}} consumer fragrances. Inexpensive synthetic substitutes have been commercialized over the last 40 years. Two main chemical classes are used commercially — the nitro musks (which fulfilled the original demand for inexpensive fragrance additives for personal care products such as bath soap, body lotions, perfumes, and washing detergents) and the newer polycyclic musks which have musklike smell. The commercial nitro musks include musk ketone, musk <b>moskene,</b> musk ambrette, musk xylene, and musk tibetene. The polycyclics include trade named compounds such as Galaxolide®, Tonalide®, Celestolide®, Traseolide®, Phantolide®, and Cashmeran®, among others. These consumer chemicals are manufactured and consumed in very large quantities worldwide. They are volatile, not amenable to normal environmental transformations, and lipophilic-all traits that should ordinarily lead to their being characterized as persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic chemicals (PBTs). 16 Their use leads to their entry into the city sewage systems (presumably from bathing and other washing activities), {{and then into the}} aquatic ecosystem, where they can bioconcentrate and bioaccumulate in the tissues of aquatic organisms. Given their lipophilic bioaccumulative nature and possibly worldwide environmental distribution, they have the potential to be regarded as ubiquitous environmental contaminants...|$|E

40|$|Musk xylene (MX), {{musk ketone}} (MK) and musk <b>moskene</b> (MM) are {{synthetic}} nitro-containing fragrances. Due to their inherent lipophilicity and environmental persistence, they are frequently detected in environmental samples {{and especially in}} aquatic ecosystems. Despite this, the current environmental toxicity database of nitromusks is limited. Although nitromusks {{have been shown to}} accumulate in aquatic organisms, little is known about their potential developmental effects in the respective aquatic species. To investigate the developmental toxicity of these compounds to amphibians and fish, early lifestages of xenopus (Xenopus lae 6 is) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to three nitromusks for 96 h to examine the developmental effects of these compounds in the two species. Nitromusk body concentration measurements were carried out in parallel for correlation with potential developmen-tal effects. No increased mortality, malformation or growth inhibition was observed in either species following 96 -h exposure to 400 mg:l MX, MK and MM. However, an approximately 20 % reduced viability was observed in xenopus larvae when exposed to 400 mg:l MX, MK and MM for 11 days. Xenopus and zebrafish exposed to 10, 153, 871 and 1637 mg:l 14 C-MX for 96 h resulted in whole-body concentrations of 0. 790. 1, 11. 191. 1, 38. 791. 9 and 76. 3918. 3 mg:g, and 4. 390. 6, 73. 3911. 8, 440. 0972. 7 and 664. 0947. 7 mg:g wet body weight, respectively.
