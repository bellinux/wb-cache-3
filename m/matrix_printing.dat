50|$|Dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printing</b> or impact <b>matrix</b> <b>printing</b> {{is a type}} of {{computer}} printing which uses a print head that moves back-and-forth, or in an up-and-down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.|$|E
50|$|Brother Industries {{manufactured}} the Twinriter 5 (1985) and 6 (1987) printers which {{tried to}} overcome the limitation of the missing graphics capabilities of daisy wheel printers by adding a dot <b>matrix</b> <b>print</b> head to the existing daisy wheel print head, with the former being used for letter quality printing and the latter for drafts and for printing symbols which were not present in the daisy wheel character set.|$|R

5000|$|A dot <b>matrix</b> <b>print</b> head {{consists}} {{of a series of}} metal pins arranged in a vertical row. Each pin is attached to some sort of actuator, a solenoid in the case of Centronics, which can pull the pin forward to strike a ribbon and the paper. The entire print head is moved horizontally in order to print a line of text, striking the paper several times to produce a matrix for each character. Character sets on early printers normally used 7 by 5 [...] "pixels" [...] to produce 80-column text.|$|R

50|$|The DECwriter LA30 was a 30 character/second dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printing</b> {{terminal}} {{introduced in}} 1970 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of Maynard, Massachusetts. It printed 80 columns of uppercase-only 7×5 dot matrix characters across a unique-sized paper. The printhead {{was driven by}} a stepper motor and the paper was advanced by a noisy solenoid ratchet drive. The LA30 was available with both a parallel interface (LA30-P) and a serial interface (LA30-S); however, the serial LA30 required the use of fill characters during the carriage-return. In 1972, a receive-only variation named LA30A became available as well.|$|E
50|$|Printers {{attached}} {{directly to}} computers {{allowed them to}} print documents directly, in multiple copies or as an original which could be copied on a ditto machine or photocopier. WYSIWYG word processors {{made it possible for}} general office users and consumers to make more sophisticated page layouts, use text justification, and use more fonts than were possible with typewriters. Early dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printing</b> was sufficient for office documents, but was of too low a quality for professional typesetting. Inkjet printing and laser printing did produce sufficient quality type, and so computers with these types of printers quickly replaced phototypesetting machines.|$|E

50|$|Comb printers, {{also called}} line matrix printers, {{represent}} the fifth major design. These printers are {{a hybrid of}} dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printing</b> and line printing. In these printers, a comb of hammers prints {{a portion of a}} row of pixels at one time, such as every eighth pixel. By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row can be printed, continuing the example, in just eight cycles. The paper then advances and the next pixel row is printed. Because far less motion is involved than in a conventional dot matrix printer, these printers are very fast compared to dot matrix printers and are competitive in speed with formed-character line printers while also being able to print dot matrix graphics. The Printronix P7000 series of line matrix printers are still manufactured as of 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The Diablo 630 was so {{successful}} that virtually all later daisy wheel printers, {{as well as many}} dot matrix printers and even the original Apple Laserwriter either copied its command set or could emulate one. Daisy wheel printers from Diablo and Lee's 1973 company Qume were the dominant high-end output technology for computer and office automation applications by 1980, though high speed non-impact techniques were already entering the market (e.g. IBM 6640 inkjet, Xerox 2700 and IBM 6670 laser). From 1981 onwards the IBM PC's introduction of [...] "Code page 437" [...] with 254 printable glyphs (including 40 shapes specifically for drawing forms), and development of Xerox Star-influenced environments such as the Macintosh, GEM and Windows made bit-mapped approaches more desirable, driving cost reductions for laser printing and higher resolution for impact dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dr. An Wang, Robert Howard and Prentice Robinson began {{development}} of a low-cost printer at Centronics, a subsidiary of Wang Laboratories that produced specialty computer terminals. The printer used the dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printing</b> principle, with a print head consisting of a vertical row of seven metal pins connected to solenoids. When power {{was applied to the}} solenoids, the pin was pulled forward to strike the paper and leave a dot. To make a complete character glyph, the print head would receive power to specified pins to create a single vertical pattern, then the print head would move to the right by a small amount, and the process repeated. On their original design, a typical glyph was printed as a matrix seven high and five wide, while the [...] "A" [...] models used a print head with 9 pins and formed glyphs that were 9 by 7.|$|E

50|$|Emigre {{was founded}} in 1984 as an {{independent}} foundry, developing typefaces without an association to a typesetting equipment manufacturer. Coinciding {{with the advent of}} the Macintosh computer, Emigre took advantage of the new medium to design digital typefaces, as such they did not require the manufacturing infrastructure of a traditional type foundry. Licko began designing fonts that, rather than trying to imitate letterpress technology, capitalized on the idiosyncrasies of bitmap design and dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printing,</b> and later, vector-based design. The company is credited with being the first type foundry to design original fonts made on and for a computer. Through a good part of the late 1980s and most of the 1990s, some of the most cutting-edge typefaces were developed or released by Emigre. Its magazine, in the meantime, provided an outlet showcasing the potential of its typeface designs, and was well known for its graphical experimentation, criticism and essays on contemporary design. Many Emigre fonts belonged to what would later be described as the grunge typography movement, though others such as Licko's Mrs Eaves did not clearly fit into this style.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of paper color (white, off-white) and print type (typeset, high quality typewriter, dot matrix printer) on resume {{desirability}} were investigated. The results indicated that resumes should be written on white paper and that typeset resumes are evaluated the same as resumes printed with a high quality typewriter. Don <b>matrix</b> <b>printing</b> was rated as least desirable When looked at closely, {{there are a number}} of variables relating to a resume that may influence its overall perceived desirability as a selection tool. Some of these variables include paper length, paper width, paper quality, content of the resume, format, resume length, type of print, and color of paper. This paper investigates two of these variables: type of print and color of paper.

50|$|While {{working at}} Atelier 17, Krishna Reddy was {{instrumental}} in developing a new printing process to produce multi-colored prints from a single <b>printing</b> <b>matrix</b> by exploiting the viscosity and tackiness of the inks, subsequently named viscosity printing. Sticky and thick ink does not roll {{down on top of}} oily, runny ink, but oily and runny ink does roll down on top of sticky and thick. Inks of different tack and viscosity are employed to edition multi-colored prints off of deeply etched and carved metal printing plates. This process reveals the three dimensionality of the <b>printing</b> <b>matrix</b> to a significant degree. In the case of a <b>printing</b> <b>matrix</b> with three distinct areas; textured, original surface, and areas that have been smoothly etched to a lower level, each area will print in a different color. The matrix is inked and wiped as an intaglio using etching ink for the first color. A hard roller with slightly runny ink is used to put a layer of ink onto the original surface for the second color. Etching ink is often fairly viscous, but has very low tack so the second color does not adhere to the textured areas. A soft roller with stiff ink is rolled over the entire plate for the third color. The <b>matrix</b> is <b>printed</b> just like any intaglio. When this is carefully done each color is distinct and the process is repeatable. Each step in this process is sensitive to the point that most printmakers employ it for producing monotypes and monoprints rather than editions.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{popularity}} of dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printing</b> technologies has {{renewed interest in}} developing color halftoning techniques for these systems. A color reproduction scheme based on colorimetric principles would provide accurate color rendition, and can be configured to different hardware implementations. Additionally, where there are demands for multiple copies, color reproduction accuracy is assured to the nth generation. A binary dot matrix halftoning algorithm previously used for black-and-white reproduction (error diffusion) and a new algorithm to be described (EZ method) were investigated {{in terms of their}} color reproduction capabilities, with the objective to achieve colorimetric color reproduction. The error diffusion technique made poor system color selections when used in XYZ tristimulus space. As a result, large hue, saturation, and ΔE*ab errors were experienced. The EZ Color Algorithm provided better color accuracy, with an average color difference of less than three for a 4 x 4 cell size. A uniform color space, such as CIELAB, is considered a minimum requirement in order for the error diffusion algorithm to provide colorimetric color reproduction. Hue, saturation, and ΔE*ab errors were minimized when this color space was used. The EZ Color Algorithm provides several important features including the incorporation of the black colorant explicity in the color formulation, selection of system colors prior to quantizing, and quantization of system color areas instead of reflectance values...|$|E
