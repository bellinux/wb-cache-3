50|$|Ryan’s Law {{applies to}} people with a {{condition}} on the autism spectrum: either autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, or PDD-NOS. It mandates that insurance companies provide up to $50,000 a year of coverage for behavioral therapy {{until the age of}} 16. The child must be diagnosed at age eight or before, and the $50,000 maximum on behavioral therapy is to be adjusted every year on January 1 based on the Consumer Price Index. It further prohibits insurance companies from refusing autistic children other medical treatment or attention {{on the basis of their}} condition. Autism cannot be used as a basis for refusing care for other <b>medically</b> reasonable or <b>necessary</b> treatment or procedures. The bill does not cover individuals who are insured through employers that have self-funded plans. Such plans are not subject to state regulation and are governed by federal ERISA law. In 2009, federal legislation was introduced in both chambers of the United States Congress to require self-funded plans to offer autism benefits.|$|R
5000|$|In jurisdictions where {{abortion}} is legal, certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a safe, legal abortion (an abortion performed without the woman's consent is considered feticide). These requirements usually {{depend on the}} age of the fetus, often using a trimester-based system to regulate the window of legality, or as in the U.S., on a doctor's evaluation of the fetus' viability. Some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development, or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion. Other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus' father before aborting the fetus, that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including [...] "risks" [...] not supported by the medical literature—and that multiple medical authorities certify that the {{abortion is}} either <b>medically</b> or socially <b>necessary.</b> Many restrictions are waived in emergency situations.

During a transient period, some modifications in teaching Biochemistry may be beneficial to the medical students. In the last fifteen years we have introduced some modifications on biochemistry teaching for medical students at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). We reduced the factual content, retaining only the <b>medically</b> relevant material <b>necessary</b> to understand the molecular approach to the most prevalent diseases, mainly those leading to failure of organs and systems. The laboratory experiments are substituted by the interpretation of biochemical data of patients found at the Hospital das Clínicas de Porto Alegre. Basic Biochemistry is learned indirectly by answering the questions arised from the clinical and biochemical data of the patients. Students show permanent interest in learning biochemistry in such way and their evaluation has been highly stimulant. We think that this approach can be adapted to other fields of basic science. </p...|$|R

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to study the}} Intersex phenomenon in South Africa, meaning the interplay between the dual sex and gender norms in society. Hence, the treatment by some medical institutions and the view of some non-medical institutions upon this ‘treatment’, have been studied {{in relation to the}} Intersex infant’s human rights and citizenship rights. The thesis has moreover also investigated how young Intersex children are included/excluded and mentioned/not mentioned within South Africa’s legal system and within UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child. Furthermore, because Intersex children are viewed as ‘different’ on two accounts – their status as infants and born with an atypical congenital physical sexual differentiation, the thesis’ theoretical framework looks at the phenomenon from three perspectives – ‘the politics of difference’, human rights, and citizenship rights directed towards infants. The theoretical frameworks have been used to ask questions in relation to the empirical data, i. e. look at how the Intersex infants are ‘treated’ in relation to their status as ‘different’; and also in relation to the concept of being recognized, respected and allowed to partake in deciding whether to impose surgery or not. Moreover, what ‘treatment’ serves {{the best interest of the}} Intersex child? This has been done through semi structured interviews. In conclusion, some of the dissertation’s most important features are that since the South African society, like many other societies, strongly live by the belief that there are only two sexes and genders, this implies that Intersex infants do not fit in and become walking pathologies who must be ‘fixed’ to become ‘normal’. Moreover, since most genital corrective surgeries are imposed without being <b>medically</b> or surgically <b>necessary,</b> and are generally imposed before the age of consent (18), the children concerned, are generally not asked for their opinion regarding the surgery. Lastly because early corrective surgery can have devastating life lasting consequences, this ultimately means that the child’s human rights and citizenship rights are of a concern. These conclusions do however not ignore the consequences one has to endure for the price of being ‘different’...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to gather {{information}} about the influence of different vaccination schedules on clinics, growth- and slaughter achievements, lung score, and development of immunity in pigs. 3 groups were compared. The first group was vaccinated with a Two- Shot vaccine on day 7 and 28 after birth, the second group was vaccinated with a One- Shot vaccine on day 7 after birth. The third group received 0, 9 % NaCl as a placebo and served as a control. The study took place between August 2004 and March 2005. In this time period animals were surveyed and if <b>necessary</b> <b>medically</b> treated. Blood was taken regularily from a sample of animals for immunological research. At slaughter the lungs were evaluated with a lung score system and samples were taken for microbiological examination. Weights were taken at birth, after weaning, when moving to the fattening stable and after slaughter. The proportion of lean meat was determined at slaughter. 1. Clinical and economical results - The One- Shot vaccine gained better results than the Two- Shot vaccine and the placebo concerning weight gain in the farrowing period. Especially animals with a questionable health status could take profit out of the One- Shot vaccine. - In the fattening period the animals vaccinated once were coughing more frequently than the animals vaccinated twice or the controls. Coughing at the end of the fattening period could be associated with position of the farrowing pen in the stable implicating the influence of climatic conditions and bad health of the lungs and low weight at slaughter. - At slaughter neither the One- Shot- nor the Two- Shot vaccine had delivered an economical advantage. 2. Immunological results - In the present study the One- Shot vaccine did not lead to an increased production of antibodies against M. hyo, whilst the conventional vaccination increased the antibody- titer 4 weeks after booster in some of the animals. This rise in antibodies did not show any correlation with clinical- economical parameters. - A field infection with M. hyo probably occurred around 3 to 7 weeks before slaughter. - The high titer at the end of the fattening period was negatively associated with lung health and carcass weight - The proportion of B- cells was low at 8 and 12 weeks of age in all groups - The vaccinated animals showed a course of CD 4 +/CD 8 + T-cell-ratio different from the control group, there was no variation between the two vaccinated groups. The difference of the control group originated in a lower proportion of CD 8 + T- cells as well as a higher proportion of CD 4 + T- cells at an age of 12 and 25 weeks. Here as well, there were no correlations with clinical- economical parameters. In this herd the One- Shot vaccine could not lead to economical improvements compared to the Two- Shot vaccine. The Two- Shot vaccine could also not surpass the control. The possible reasons for a vaccine failure in this herd were discussed. The results of the immunological tests show that seroconversion after vaccination is missing. The high antibody- titers at the end of the farrowing period rather support the idea of an acute infection with a M. hyo field strain approximately 3 - 7 weeks before slaughter. A small effect on proportions of cell populations could be observed at the time of infection...|$|R

Therapeutic means which induce infertility are allowed (e.g., hysterectomy), {{if they are not}} specifically intended to cause infertility (e.g., the uterus is cancerous, so the preservation of life is intended). If there are well grounded reasons (arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances), Natural family planning methods (abstaining from intercourse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle) are allowed, since they take advantage of a faculty provided by nature.|$|E

2500|$|Reasons for {{procuring}} induced abortions {{are typically}} characterized as either therapeutic or elective.

2500|$|EMS {{services}} in Canada are generally funded, {{at least in}} part, and to varying degrees, by the Ministry of Health or Health Department of the province or territory in which they operate. Paramedics and ambulance services are {{not mentioned in the}} Canada Health Act, and are therefore not an insured service. [...] Provinces may choose to subsidize some of the cost, usually just for patients with valid provincial health cards. Health insurance in Canada is universal and publicly funded, so the cost of emergency ambulance services is covered to some degree. The degree to which individual use of EMS is subsidized by provincial health insurance varies by province, and may be supplemented either by partial fees for service, or by the property tax revenues of municipalities operating such services. In some jurisdictions, funding is at 100 per cent, and occurs without the patient being aware of its existence. Other jurisdictions fund at varying levels, but may require payment up front. In most cases this is later reimbursed. [...] This may be particularly true of out of jurisdiction services, with an individual from one province who requires EMS service in another province being required to pay for that service and then submit the receipt to their own provincial health insurance scheme for reimbursement. In some jurisdictions, such as Ontario, a deterrent fee scheme is used to discourage the medically unnecessary use of EMS by the public. In such cases, the provincial health insurance scheme pays the majority of the cost of EMS service (around 80 per cent) for <b>medically</b> <b>necessary</b> EMS service, but when a physician decides that the service was not <b>medically</b> <b>necessary,</b> they can cause the patient to pay the full, uninsured amount of the charge, with the patient receiving a bill for the additional deterrent fee at some point after the emergency is over. [...] Within Ontario, for example, such deterrent billing occurs through the receiving hospital, {{despite the fact that the}} hospital neither provides nor oversees EMS in most cases.|$|E

The volume of criticism led many states to pass laws mandating managed-care standards. Meanwhile, insurers responded to public demands and political pressure by beginning to offer other plan options with more comprehensive care networks—according to one analysis, between the years 1970 and 2005 the share of personal health expenditures paid directly out-of-pocket by U.S. consumers fell from about 40 percent to 15 percent. So although consumers faced rising health insurance premiums over the period, lower out-of-pocket costs likely [...] encouraged consumers to use more health care.
