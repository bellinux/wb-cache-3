25|$|It {{is unclear}} why several nations with few female workers {{have such a}} high {{percentage}} of salaried women. One possible explanation is that so few women are active in the labor market because the demand for female employment is restricted to a few higher-paying, low-labor-intensive industries. If only a few women are needed but they need to have above-average skills, then these laborers' <b>marginal</b> <b>value</b> may necessitate salary as opposed to simple wages.

25|$|The <b>marginal</b> <b>value</b> theorem {{is a type}} of {{optimality}} {{model that}} is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food in a patch must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the law of diminishing returns, where it becomes harder and harder to find prey as time goes on. This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches. This law of diminishing returns can be shown as a curve of energy gain per time spent in a patch (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes harder to find. Another important cost to consider is the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{systematic}} method called "Marginal Values Analysis" (MVA) to calculate <b>marginal</b> <b>values</b> of streams and process sections in a chemical production site. In the MVA, the <b>marginal</b> <b>values</b> are defined into three types {{to represent the}} marginal profit, production cost and product value of a stream. With these precise definitions, the <b>marginal</b> <b>values</b> {{can be used for}} locating process bottlenecks, pricing utilities, intermediate materials and energy flows. They can also be applied on developing site-wide management strategies, assisting business decisions. A general linear programming model, site-model, that includes all the heat and mass balances and interactions of a chemical production site is adopted for generating the <b>marginal</b> <b>values.</b> By proper formulations in the site-model, all the three <b>marginal</b> <b>values</b> of a stream can be obtained simultaneously.

25|$|This {{could be}} a reason why {{environmental}} Kuznets curves {{have been found to}} be applicable to only certain types of pollutants. Yandle et al. argue that the EKC has not been found to apply to carbon because most pollutants create localized problems like lead and sulfur, so there is a greater urgency and response to cleaning up such pollutants. As a country develops, the <b>marginal</b> <b>value</b> of cleaning up such pollutants makes a large direct improvement to the quality of citizens' lives. Conversely, reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not have a dramatic impact at a local level, so the impetus to clean them up is only for the altruistic reason of improving the global environment. This becomes a tragedy of the commons where it is most efficient for everyone to pollute and for no one to clean up, and everyone is worse as a result (Hardin, 1968). Thus, even in a country like the US with a high level of income, carbon emissions are not decreasing in accordance with the EKC.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} a site-model to {{generate}} <b>marginal</b> <b>values</b> of intermediate materials and utilities. Taking into account the mass and energy balances and interconnections of all production and utility plants, a site-model can accurately calculate <b>marginal</b> <b>values</b> of intermediate materials and utilities by reflecting their actual values on profits. In order {{to generate}} <b>marginal</b> <b>values</b> for all required streams by solving the site model, dummy streams with narrow and small bounds are added to and/or taken away from the evaluated streams. The <b>marginal</b> <b>values</b> of adding and taking away a small part of a stream could be different and are strongly affected by where site bottlenecks are located. The locations of site bottlenecks are determined by the capacities of production and utility generation as well as the market values, supply and demand of raw materials, and final products.

2500|$|The {{foraging}} {{behavior of}} the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, {{provides an example of}} how <b>marginal</b> <b>value</b> theorem is used to model optimal foraging. [...] Starlings leave their nests and travel to food patches in search for larval leatherjackets to bring back to their young. The starlings must determine the optimal number of prey items to take back in one trip (i.e. the optimal load size). While the starlings forage within a patch, they experience diminishing returns: the starling is only able to hold so many leatherjackets in their bill, so the speed with which the parent picks up larvae decreases with the number of larvae that it already has in its bill. Thus, the constraints are the shape of the curve of diminishing returns and the travel time (the time it takes to make a round trip from the nest to a patch and back). In addition, the currency is hypothesized to be net energy gain per unit time. Using this currency and the constraints, the optimal load can be predicted by drawing a line tangent to the curve of diminishing returns, as discussed previously (Figure 3).|$|E

[...] After weighing these factors, the Court concluded that Ohio afforded its inmates the requisite procedures.

[...] Furthermore, Ohio's requirement that it explain the factual basis for the classification review and offer the inmate an opportunity for rebuttal [...] "safeguards against the inmate being mistaken for another or being singled out for insufficient reason". [...] At each of the three levels, the reviewing administrator can decline to recommend OSP placement, at which point the process terminates. [...] The Court found this arrangement preferable to Ohio's former system, under which inmates were sometimes placed in OSP without any explanation at all. [...] Because the inmate will always have an explanation of the reasons for recommended OSP placement, he will always have something to argue against when he proceeds to the next level of review or comes up for his next suitability hearing.|$|E
