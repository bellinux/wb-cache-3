5|$|The <b>Minnesota</b> <b>Orchestra</b> {{dates back}} to 1903 when it was founded as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. It was renamed the <b>Minnesota</b> <b>Orchestra</b> in 1968 and moved into its own building, Orchestra Hall, in {{downtown}} Minneapolis in 1974. The building has a modern look with a brick, glass, and steel exterior, {{in contrast to the}} old-world look of traditional concert halls. The interior of the building features more than 100 large cubes that deflect sound and provide excellent acoustics. Later the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra became the second full-time professional orchestral ensemble in the cities.|$|E
5|$|New {{industry}} {{came from}} iron ore, {{discovered in the}} north, mined relatively easily from open pits, and shipped to Great Lakes steel mills from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The Great Depression brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but New Deal programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies Sperry Rand, Control Data and Cray. The Twin Cities also became a regional center for the arts with cultural {{institutions such as the}} Guthrie Theater, <b>Minnesota</b> <b>Orchestra,</b> and the Walker Art Center.|$|E

5|$|Cannon sounds have {{sometimes}} {{been used in}} classical pieces with a military theme. One {{of the best known}} examples of such a piece is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. The overture is to be performed using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in noise levels high enough that musicians are required to wear ear protection. The cannon fire simulates Russian artillery bombardments of the Battle of Borodino, a critical battle in Napoleon's invasion of Russia, whose defeat the piece celebrates. When the overture was first performed, the cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor. However, the overture was not recorded with real cannon fire until Mercury Records and conductor Antal Doráti's 1958 recording of the <b>Minnesota</b> <b>Orchestra.</b> Cannon fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of the 1812 on the American Independence Day, a tradition started by Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops in 1974.|$|E
