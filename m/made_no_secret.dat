5|$|The {{original}} investigations levelled accusations at Silverio Nungo (who {{was later}} executed) and Lazaro Kavandame, FRELIMO leader in Cabo Delgado. The latter had <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> of his distrust of Mondlane, seeing him as too conservative a leader, and the Tanzanian police also {{accused him of}} working with PIDE (Portugal's secret police) to assassinate Mondlane. Kavandame himself surrendered to the Portuguese in April of that year.|$|E
5|$|Although Bo was {{initially}} unhappy about his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved {{to use his}} new position as a staging ground {{for a return to}} higher national office. Bo <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> of his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, as all but two of the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire. The transition would be an opportunity for Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the Central Political and Legislative Committee, serving {{as the head of the}} party's security apparatus.|$|E

5|$|Driberg <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> of his homosexuality, {{which he}} practised {{throughout}} his life despite its being a criminal offence in Britain until 1967; his ability to avoid any consequences for his risky and often brazen behaviour baffled his friends and colleagues. Always in search of bizarre experiences, Driberg befriended at various times the occultist Aleister Crowley and the Kray twins, along with honoured and respected figures in the worlds of literature and politics. He combined this lifestyle with an unwavering devotion to Anglo-Catholicism. After his death, allegations were published about his role over many years as an MI5 informant, a KGB agent, or both. The extent and nature of Driberg's involvement with these agencies remain uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a year of}} Albert Wise's death, Martha Wise, {{though not}} {{considered}} a particularly good or attractive catch, found new male companionship {{in the form of}} Walter Johns, who worked as a farmhand on property adjacent to her farm. The relationship was frowned upon by Wise's family, and both Wise's mother, Sophie Hasel, and her aunt, Lily Gienke, <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> of their desire for Wise to end the relationship. By the end of 1924, Wise had acquiesced, and the relationship ended. Johns moved to Cleveland and the couple lost contact.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him {{at least part of}} the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E

40|$|As a {{political}} economy scholar, Francis Fukuyama {{will always be}} remembered for “the end of history” thesis. He has <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secrets</b> regarding his affiliation to neoconservatism and his close involvement {{in the implementation of}} the Pax Americana agenda through the Project for the New American Century. However, post-September 11, 2001 or widely known as 9 / 11, has led Fukuyuma to believe that the neoconservative approaches {{in the war against terrorism}} are flawed. This article tries to demonstrate the extent of Fukuyama’s disillusionments and his proposals to reinvigorate United States’ foreign policy in his new book, After the Neocons (2006). What seems clear is that Fukuyama still defends neoconservatism as a good approach. Should the idea of democratisation be perceived as effectively practised, the neoconservatives should pay more attention to the aspect of political developmen...|$|R

5|$|Sledd {{played a}} key role in the {{formation}} and ultimate success of the new university, but his time as its president was a relatively short four years. His political backing ended with the retirement of Governor Broward, and the inauguration of his successor Albert Gilchrist in January 1909. The Florida Board of Education, which then consisted of the governor and the state's elected cabinet members, oversaw the Board of Control and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> of its desire to remove Sledd, in part because members of the Board of Education believed that Sledd's admissions standards were too high and that the university was not growing quickly enough. Nevertheless, the Board of Control continued to back Sledd, and its members threatened to resign in protest. Seeking to avoid an unwinnable political controversy, Sledd resigned, and the Board of Control replaced him with Albert Murphree, the political favorite of several legislative leaders and the Board of Education.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} neared completion, Miller began {{to market the}} game to players. Strongly {{encouraged}} by the updates the team was sending him, he began heavily advertising the game {{in all of the}} bulletin board systems (BBS) and game magazines he had access to. The game was completed in early December 1990, and on the afternoon of December 14 Miller began uploading the completed first episode to BBSs, with the other two episodes listed as available for purchase as a mailed plastic bag with floppy disks for US$30. After the arrival of the first royalty check from Apogee, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss and owner of Softdisk Al Vekovius confronted them on their plans, as well as their use of company resources to develop the game, the team <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> of their intentions. Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and after a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months.|$|E
5|$|In October–December 1990, {{a team of}} {{employees}} from programming studio Softdisk calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three-part video game Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the first game in the Commander Keen series. The group, who worked at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana developing games for the Gamer's Edge video game subscription service and disk magazine, was composed of programmers John Romero and John Carmack, designer Tom Hall, artist Adrian Carmack, and manager Jay Wilbur. After {{the release of the}} game in December through shareware publisher Apogee Software, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game—the team had created it on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends—the team <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> of their intentions. After a few weeks of negotiation, the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months.|$|E

Until the money had been secured he had kept this a secret from her, and had sent Jim Welton on special business to Gravesend in order that he might be out of the way for a time, but, the motive being past, he <b>made</b> <b>no</b> more <b>secret</b> of the matter.|$|R
50|$|Biron {{came out}} to his parents as a {{teenager}} and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> big <b>secret</b> of his homosexuality, but Russia is very socially conservative on LGBT rights, with hostility towards legal recognition of same-sex marriage and support for laws discriminating against LGBT people. The United States Department of State repeatedly raised concerns around LGBT civil rights in their 2014 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. His character on Interns was raised by two gay fathers, though {{the treatment of the}} issue of sexuality on the show has been described as reinforcing the Soviet idea that homosexuality is a product of Western moral decay, rather than being used to promote more liberal values.|$|R
6000|$|Lucius' {{attitude}} towards her {{was more than}} respectful--it was paternal; for she <b>made</b> <b>no</b> more <b>secret</b> of her early condition than Haney, and the colored man enjoyed serving them. He seemed perfectly happy in advising, cautioning, directing them, and was deeply impressed with their powers of adaptability--was, in truth, developing a genuine affection for them both. He was a lonely little man, Bertha had learned, with no near kin in the States, {{and the fact that}} he came from an Island in the sea made him less of a [...] "nigger" [...] to the Captain, who had the usual amount of prejudice against both black and red men.|$|R
5|$|When the University of Berlin awarded {{an honorary}} degree in 1934 to American legal scholar and Dean of Harvard Law School Roscoe Pound, who had toured Germany earlier {{that year and}} <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> of his admiration for the Nazi regime, Conant refused to order Pound not to accept it, and {{attended}} the informal award ceremony at Harvard where Pound was presented with the degree by Hans Luther, the German ambassador to the United States. While Conant declined {{to participate in the}} Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars, Harvard awarded honorary degrees to two notable displaced scholars, Thomas Mann and Albert Einstein, in 1935. What Conant feared most was disruption to Harvard's tercentennial celebrations in 1936, but there was no trouble, despite the presence of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and a Harvard graduate of the class of 1904, whom many Harvard graduates regarded as a socialist and a class traitor. It was only with difficulty that Lowell was persuaded to be presiding officer at an event at which Roosevelt spoke.|$|E

Ideas from the Deep, now founded as id Software, used some of these games to prototype ideas for their own releases, such as Catacomb 3-D. In late spring of 1991 they worked on a new Keen game in order to develop new systems for their next major release in the Commander Keen series. They did not initially want to do a Keen game for Softdisk, but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping improve the next full set of games for Apogee.|$|E

Mrs. Wakefield undertook the task imposed upon her, and the wedding was to be grand enough to challenge attention, and not be liable to the accusation of being done in a corner. It might be called hasty, for only a month would have passed since Elvira's arrival, before her wedding-day; but this was by her own earnest wish. She <b>made</b> it <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that she should never cease to be nervous till she was Allen Brownlow's wife, even though a letter to her cousins at River Hollow had removed all fear of pursuit by Mrs. Gould; she seemed bent on remaining at New York, and complained loudly of [...] "the ungrateful girl," [...] whose personal belongings she retained by way of compensation.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1930s, Van den Bergh {{took the}} view that a Europe under German {{leadership}} was [...] "not a bad idea" [...] which caused bad blood among his colleagues. Also in August 1942 he {{took part in the}} NSB a meeting about Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Sports journalists gathered in Valkenburg and praised this meeting in the magazine [...] "De Nederlandsche Journalist" [...] (The Dutch Journalist) as a [...] "historic moment". His enthusiasm was based on a speech by the Secretary of State for education and arts, Tobie Goedewaagen, which had highlighted the importance of sports journalism. In 1944 however he published the brochure [...] "De post in de vloeiweide" [...] (The post in the rolling meadow). In it he described the attack by [...] "rogue of the SS" [...] on a radio station for Dutch resistance near Breda, where nine Dutch people including one child were killed, and eight more people were executed the next day.

25|$|Cipollini <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> {{that he did}} {{not like}} {{climbing}} stages, and while he completed all stages of the Giro on many occasions, he infuriated purists by not attempting mountain stages at the Tour or Vuelta.

5000|$|In late 1939, {{immediately}} after the Polish invasion, the Germans slowed down, quietly turning their attentions to Scandinavia, giving much of Europe the {{false sense of security}} known as the [...] "Drole Guerre" [...] (Phony War). In Paris, soldiers were on every corner, and young men stood in long lines to enlist. Most American entertainers fled back to the United States. However, Jackson was having success in Romania, despite the war just across the border. Unlike in Paris, the swastika flew beside the Romanian flag. King Carol <b>made</b> it <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that he supported the Nazis. As the war continued, she kept busy, performing every night at the La Zissu cabaret. In the summer of 1940, King Carol soon handed over Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, causing uproar across Romania, especially as fleeing Bessarabian refugees crowded the streets of Bucharest. To get away from the occasionally crowded city, Jackson often departed to their countryside estate in Craiova, where Barbu spent much of his time running his business, probably more now since the Ford-Romania Company began providing military-grade vehicles for the Germans.|$|R
60|$|Maggie <b>made</b> <b>no</b> reply.

Whenever she had gone far enough with Ned, and saw that he was not to be trifled with, she found that she possessed not only power to control her temper, but the sense, now and then, to do so! On the present occasion she at once busied herself in preparing tea, while Ned sat down opposite his brother-in-law, and, taking Fred, his only child, a handsome boy of about five years of age, on his knee, began to run his fingers through his jet black curly hair.|$|R

The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels 5–1 for the club's first victory. After the season Ted Williams retired as manager; he had <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> of his displeasure with the franchise's new location.

In the end, this policy would seriously hurt companies in the new federal states. Together with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Kohl was able to resolve talks with the former Allies of World War II to allow German reunification. He received assurances from Gorbachev that a reunified Germany {{would be able to}} choose which international alliance it wanted to join, although Kohl <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that he wanted the reunified Germany to inherit West Germany's seats at NATO and the EC.|$|E

His father, an army officer, wanted Ion to follow in his footsteps and thus sent him to attend the Infantry and Cavalry School in Craiova. During his childhood, his father divorced his mother to marry a woman who was a Jewish convert to Orthodoxy.

Reeves <b>made</b> it <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that he would have selected Salaam over Wheatley in the draft. [...] Wheatley's introduction to the Giants was a contract squabble that kept him from getting to training camp on time. [...] Then, in rookie season training camp, he had the misfortune of pulling a hamstring while running sprints on the first day. [...] Speculation had been that the injury had occurred in a stumble in a June track meet. [...] Reeves held the prompt injury against the running back he never wanted. [...] Wheatley later fell asleep in a meeting which drew a fine from Reeves. [...] Although he only actually fell asleep in one meeting, he also had mental concentration issues in practice. [...] He was not known for living erratically so his falling asleep and loss of concentration was enough of a problem that the Giants had Wheatley evaluated. [...] On top of this, Wheatley was fined several times for tardiness to team meetings.|$|R
