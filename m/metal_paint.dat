50|$|In 1797 a French {{scientist}} Louis Vauquelin {{discovered the}} mineral crocoite, or lead chromate, which led in 1809 to {{the invention of}} the synthetic pigment chrome orange. Other synthetic pigments, cobalt red, cobalt yellow, and cobalt orange, the last made from cadmium sulfide plus cadmium selenide, soon followed. These new pigments, plus {{the invention of the}} <b>metal</b> <b>paint</b> tube in 1841, made it possible for artists to paint outdoors and to capture the colours of natural light.|$|E

50|$|Inventive {{tools of}} the artist's trade also {{produced}} advances in creativity. Impressionist painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible, resealable <b>metal</b> <b>paint</b> tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors. Inventions originally created {{in the form of}} artwork can also develop other uses, i.e., Alexander Calder's mobile, which is now commonly used over babies' cribs. Funds generated from patents on inventions in art, design and architecture can support the realization of the invention or other creative work. Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi's 1879 design patent on the Statue of Liberty helped fund the famous statue because it covered small replicas, including those sold as souvenirs.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the oil is}} extracted, {{additives}} {{are sometimes}} used to modify its chemical properties. In this way, the paint {{can be made to}} dry more quickly (if that is desired), or to have varying levels of gloss, like Liquin. Modern oils paints can, therefore, have complex chemical structures; for example, affecting resistance to UV. By hand, the process involves first mixing the paint pigment with the linseed oil to a crumbly mass on a glass or marble slab. Then, a small amount at a time is ground between the slab and a glass Muller (a round, flat-bottomed glass instrument with a hand grip). Pigment and oil are ground together 'with patience' until a smooth, ultra-fine paste is achieved. This paste is then placed into jars or <b>metal</b> <b>paint</b> tubes and labelled.|$|E
5000|$|The {{popularity}} of watercolors stimulated many innovations, including heavier and more sized wove papers, and brushes (called [...] "pencils") manufactured expressly for watercolor. Watercolor tutorials were {{first published in}} this period by Varley, Cox, and others, establishing the step-by-step painting instructions that still characterize the genre today; The Elements of Drawing, a watercolor tutorial by English art critic John Ruskin, {{has been out of}} print only once since it was first published in 1857. Commercial brands of watercolor were marketed and paints were packaged in metal tubes or as dry cakes that could be [...] "rubbed out" [...] (dissolved) in studio porcelain or used in portable <b>metal</b> <b>paint</b> boxes in the field. Contemporary breakthroughs in chemistry have made many new pigments available, including prussian blue, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, viridian, cobalt violet, cadmium yellow, aureolin (potassium cobaltinitrite), zinc white, and a wide range of carmine and madder lakes. These pigments, in turn, stimulated a greater use of color with all painting media, but in English watercolors, particularly by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.|$|E

[...] "If I have become a painter," [...] Monet said, [...] "I owe it to Boudin."The landscape paintings of Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind (1819 - 1891) influenced both Boudin and Monet and contributed to the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in Sainte-Adresse in 1862, Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for local color. [...] "Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master," [...] Monet later reminisced. [...] "It was he who completed the education of my eye". This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's Haystacks (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif.|$|E
40|$|Properties like easy formability, {{light weight}} and {{corrosion}} resistance constitute natural advantage of plastic over metal. However, {{there are many}} areas in which metallic properties are required or demanded due to decorative or technological considerations. It is in these applications {{that the possibility of}} metallizing plastics has opened the door to new use for these materials. Metallization is a process in which a non-conductive material such as plastic is made conductive by providing a conductive layer on it. Due to this, possibility of utilizing the advantages of both metal and plastic in combination has been increased. As a result metallized plastic is widely used in fields like oil and gas, automotive industry, electronic industry, chemical processing, textile, aerospace, providing finishes on fashion items such as shoes, name badges, as well as on consumer electronics products including laptop cases and cell phones etc. Plastics such as polysulfone, polypropylene, polythene, teflon and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) can be metalized with different metals like copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), gold (Au), chromium (Cr) and silver (Ag) using variety of processes like brushing a <b>metal</b> <b>paint,</b> spray metal technique, dipping in a <b>metal</b> <b>paint,</b> sputtering, electroplating, electroless plating and vacuum metallization. Among these processes, electroplating is widely used because of its simplicity and economy. In this method, metal ions in aqueous solutions are deposited on the activated plastic surface by an electro-chemical reaction with the aid of an electric potential, forming a thin metallic layer. In this work, possibility of metallization on RP parts through electroplating route has been explored for preserving artefacts...|$|E

40|$|Biofouling, the {{undesired}} {{accumulation of}} biological organisms on a surface, {{is a problem}} that plagues a wide spectrum of materials. Because of the ban of heavy <b>metal</b> <b>paint</b> formulations, there has been a rapid movement towards the development of novel anti-biofouling coatings based upon various polymeric networks. The main focus of this dissertation is to design and develop unique polymeric networks that display unique heterogeneities in regards to topography, topology and chemical composition on the micro- and nano-scales that can be explored as non-toxic coatings for the deterrence of organisms in the marine environment. These materials also have potential to serve as anti-biofouling coatings for biomedical and other applications. A two dimensional array of terpolymer networks based on the crosslinking of hyperbranched fluoropolymers (HBFP) with varying concentrations of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were generated. Crosslinking coincides with and is followed by degrees of thermodynamically-driven phase separation within the bound network and results in a complex surface that displays dynamically-reorganizing heterogeneity in its topography, topology and chemical composition on both the nano- and the micro-scales. The coatings were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), surface force spectroscopy, and static water contact angle to probe their surface properties. Because of the performance displayed in anti-biofouling testing for the terpolymer networks, a more industrially-relevant method for applying the networks was sought. Through the use of a spray coating application method, the terpolymer network could be laid down onto a Naval-approved epoxy barrier coating. The epoxy barrier coating provides functional handles to covalently bond the terpolymer network to the substrate without further modification. The coatings were then tested, through collaborations with the University of Newcastle, Florida Institute of Technology, the University of Hawaii at Manoa and California Polytechnic State University against various marine organisms and in static water immersion testing to test their viability as anti-biofouling coatings. Additionally, the ability to expand the concept the of the terpolymer networks was investigated. These studies included the use of different components {{for each of the three}} components of the system. Specifically, the use of silsesquioxanes as a hydrophobic component, zwitterions as a hydrophilic component and a bis-functional fluorinated molecule was explored using AFM, IR, static water contact angle and an anti-biofouling study against Ulva zoospores. In summary, both systems studied displayed potential as next-generation anti-biofouling coatings...|$|E
