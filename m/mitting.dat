25|$|DBJRG {{launched}} an appeal, under Section 288 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, to the High Court, which was heard in March 2008 by Justice <b>Mitting.</b> A key issue was {{the refusal of}} RES to release the background noise data to Mr Hulme, to allow independent analysis. Although he criticised the approach taken by RES, Justice <b>Mitting</b> refused to overturn {{the result of the}} inquiry, since the planning inspector had not made a legal error in coming to his decision. In May, RES released the noise data, and errors were subsequently discovered by DBJRG, although RES denied that they were significant. DBJRG then took their case to the Court of Appeal, and permission to appeal was granted in June 2008. To avoid the need for another court hearing a consent order was agreed between DBJRG and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (the defendant in the case), which had the effect of overturning the planning inquiry, and returning the matter to the Planning Inspectorate.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 December 2007, the Video Appeals Committee {{overruled}} the BBFC by four {{votes to}} three. However, On 17 December, the BBFC challenged the VAC {{decision in the}} High Court at the Royal Courts of Justice, claiming that the VAC had overruled them based on a [...] "misinterpretation of the law" [...] as {{laid out in the}} Video Recordings Act of 1984. This challenge superseded the VAC decision that the game could be classified, and halted any possibility of it going on sale. On 24 January 2008, the BBFC won their case in the High Court. Presiding Justice <b>Mitting</b> agreed with the BBFC's argument that the VAC had erred when considering whether the game could be considered harmful to minors. Whereas the VAC interpreted this as [...] "actual harm", the BBFC and <b>Mitting</b> believed it referred to [...] "potential harm and risk of harm". The BBFC also argued that the VAC based its decision on whether or not the game would have a [...] "devastating effect on society", and argued that this [...] "harm threshold" [...] was too high. <b>Mitting</b> ordered that the same seven member panel review their findings, and whatever decision they reach the second time would stand. The VAC did so, but they returned with exactly the same result as the first time - four votes to three in favor of classifying the game. The game was ultimately released on PS2, PSP and Wii on 31 October 2008 with an 18 certificate, a year after the US release.|$|E

5000|$|In January 2010 Mr Justice <b>Mitting</b> granted McKinnon {{a further}} {{judicial}} review of the decision of Home Secretary Alan Johnson to allow McKinnon’s extradition. <b>Mitting</b> distinguished two issues which were arguable, the first being whether Professor Turk's opinion that McKinnon would certainly commit suicide if extradited means that the Home Secretary must refuse extradition under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (which prevents a public authority from acting in a way incompatible with convention rights). The second was whether Professor Turk's opinion was a fundamental change to the circumstances that the courts had previously considered and ruled upon. <b>Mitting</b> ruled that if the answer to both questions was [...] "Yes", then it was arguable {{that it would be}} unlawful to allow the extradition.|$|E

Although there were other studies prior to this 1998 study associating various vaccines with the onset of autism spectrum disorders and gastrointestinal disease, this study is generally regarded as sparking the MMR vaccine controversy. In 2010, Walker-Smith was found guilty by the General Medical Council of professional misconduct who recommended erasure subject to appeal. On appeal the case heard by Mr. Justice <b>Mitting</b> in the High Court stated that the GMC determinations were superficial and inadequate and so were quashed.|$|E
50|$|In October 2011 DECC {{announced}} dramatic cuts {{of around}} 55% to tariff rates, with additional reductions for community or group schemes. The cuts {{were to be}} effective from 12 December 2011, with a consultation exercise to end on 23 December 2011. This was successfully challenged in the high court by an application for judicial review, jointly made by environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth (FoE) and two solar companies - Solarcentury and HomeSun. The judgment, made by Mr Justice <b>Mitting</b> after a two-day court hearing, was hailed as a major victory by green campaigners and the solar industry. Lawyers for the Department of Energy and Climate Change immediately moved to appeal the ruling.

In consequence, Mitchell lost the libel cases against both the Sun and PC Rowland and became liable for both parties' costs, which were estimated at £2m. Mitchell said he was [...] "bitterly disappointed". On 30 January 2015, court papers revealed that News Group newspapers offered a deal on 19 September 2014 which would have allowed Mitchell to avoid liability for the legal costs incurred by the media organisation up to that date. However, the offer did not include any apology from the publisher and Mitchell turned it down. The media organisation’s legal costs subsequently increased by at least £500,000.|$|E
