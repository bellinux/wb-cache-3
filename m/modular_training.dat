40|$|M. Ed. (Curriculum Studies) The future {{economic}} development of South Africa largely depends on the training of a career-skilled corps of workers. The current conventional educational system cannot provide in the demand for a career-skilled corps of workers on a large scale. Distance education in its different variations is gaining ground in increasing measure and {{can be regarded as}} a possible solution for the educational problem. Because of the distance between the lecturer and the student intensive attention needs to be given to the study material - especially the arrangement of the learning content to make the learning experience more effective. The design of a <b>modular</b> <b>training</b> program is a possible method to ensure effective self-study material. <b>Modular</b> <b>training</b> is aimed at accompa- nying the student meaningfully through objective-directed learning content.

40|$|In {{order to}} bring a {{realistic}} transformation in Ethiopian agriculture, farmers need to improve their knowledge, skill and attitude & have access to information and technologies, markets etc. Currently, Farmers Training Centres are designed to provide services of extension, trainings, demonstration, information, advice, etc at grassroots level. <b>Modular</b> <b>training</b> {{is one of the}} main functions of the centers. In the study area, <b>modular</b> <b>training</b> has been offered since 2007. However, evaluation was not made to determine effectiveness in terms of changes in farmers. knowledge, attitude and practice levels, & relevance to the needs and priorities of rural households to make improvements. On the other hand farmers seem to have been reluctant to participate in the <b>modular</b> <b>training.</b> There is poor communication between research, extension and farmers. Thus, this study focused on effectiveness of the <b>modular</b> <b>training</b> and exploration of institutional and organizational dimensions of Farmers. Training Centers. A multi-stage sampling strategy was used to select sample peasant associations. 140 sample households were selected randomly from four peasant associations. Semi-structured interview schedule and checklist were managed to collect both qualitative & quantitative data. Descriptive statistics and tests of significance (chisquare & t-test) were adopted for analysis of quantitative data. Thematic transcriptions, narrations and Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Knowledge Systems (RAAKS) tools were used for qualitative data analysis. The findings revealed training needs assessment was not conducted in the study area before the training. However, the content of training topics was relevant, need-based & harmonious with the farming practices. The results also demonstrated that, the <b>modular</b> <b>training</b> offered has improved knowledge, attitude and practice levels to enhance performance. Significant differences were observed between mean scores of knowledge, attitude and practice tests of trained and untrained sample households. The technologies included in the trainings were market-oriented and have higher demand. Institutional support service, such as inputs supply, credit, product marketing and cooperatives are poorly functioning. Moreover, poor communication and weak linkages exist between relevant institutions presumed to work with Farmers. Training Centres at local level. Women participation was very low in the <b>modular</b> <b>training.</b> Adaptation and dissemination of improved technologies, fairs, video show, accessing market information for rural households & literacy programme are the positive deviances accomplished in the study area.

The aim of {{the article}} is to review the main {{principles}} of <b>modular</b> <b>training</b> structure. The module structure {{is based on the}} National Qualification Framework as well as political, administrative and programme dimensions. Qualitative research helped to determine the aspects and problematic points of module structure. Methodology is based on the liberalistic and pragmatic ideas which help to combine modular vocational training system. The objectives of the article are the following: • to discuss the place of vocational training module in the National Qualification Framework; • to define the criteria for composing structure of <b>modular</b> <b>training</b> programme/module composition; • {{on the basis of the}} results of the qualitative research to set out the dimensions of the modular vocational training structure. 1. Vocational training module, a learning component developed for acquiring a certain part (unit) of qualification, determines the explicit learning path for acquiring qualification or part of it, that is reflected in the National Qualification Framework. The <b>modular</b> <b>training</b> is based on the clear split of qualification into the separate units upon which modules are developed. Qualification unit is realized through the module. It allows acquiring the set of competencies that is a constituent part of qualification and that helps to integrate and remain in the labour market. Each module is a structurized learning component of qualification activity partial competency. 2. The module structure criteria presuppose the presumable description of the module structure that determines the clear learning structure and is required for the curriculum development. 3. The empirical research helps to distinguish the following dimensions of <b>modular</b> <b>training</b> learning structure: political, administrative and programme.
