40|$|WEBGOP is a {{programming}} architecture for collaborative Web services using graph-oriented programming. The {{motivation for}} the project comes from {{the realization that the}} integration of collaborative Web services lacks support. The aim of WEBGOP is to extend the Web from a client-server system to a structured multipoint system. A graph abstraction of the network provides the structure for the integration of Web services and facilitates their configuration and programming. Using WEBGOP, a logical graph representing a virtual-overlay network over the Internet is created to link up collaborative Web services. Web services are individually or jointly invoked through either unicast or multicast messages within the overlay network. All messages are based on the simple-object access protocol (SOAP).

40|$|Abstract-A <b>multipoint</b> <b>network</b> was {{constructed}} in the Tokyo area for earthquake prediction using seismogenic electromagnetic emissions. The network consists of eight observation points within 50 km of each other. Each point has a digital direction-finding detector with two loop sensors tuned to 82 kHz. The output signals of the receivers are added into a digital vector composition circuit to obtain the direction angle of the source point, and this signal is telemetered to the central computer. To protect from false alarms caused by local man-made noise interfer-ence, the warning is announced only {{when there is a}} high cross-correlation between almost all detectors pointing to one small area. The mechanism of these earthquake precursors can be explained as electromagnetic emissions from the rocks around the focus when they are crushed completely by the distortion pressure. These emissions propagate along the fault plane as an EM surface wave mode and radiate from the slit antenna formed by the intersection of the fault plane and ground surface. In the last five years, we have detected impulsive noise bursts of seismo-genic emissions at 82 kHz, 1. 525 kHz, and 36 Hz using our multipoint detection network around the Tokyo region and Izu peninsula.

40|$|We {{consider}} a network {{composed of a}} finite set of communicating nodes that send individual particles to each other, and each particle can carry binary information.

Since {{it is difficult for}} a particle to carry an identifier that conveys the identity of the “source” or “destination”, each node receives particles whose source cannot be ascertained since physical imperfections may result in particles being directed to the wrong destination in a manner that interferes with the correctly directed particles, and particles that should arrive at a node may be received by some other node. In addition, noise may randomly switch the polarity of particles, {{and in the case of}} magnetic spin we can also have the effect of entanglement.

40|$|We address {{three main}} {{problems}} {{regarding the use}} of the traditional dataflow language (TDL) for modelling large and dynamic networks: (1) The problem of scalability. The concepts and notations of TDL do not scale well. Thus TDL specifications may get large (space consuming) and chaotic. (2) The problem of generality. TDL does not have the expressibility for specifying networks consisting of n (a general number) components. We distinguish between five different network topologies consisting n components that can not be specified in TDL. For point-to-point networks these are the star, ring and tree topologies, for <b>multipoint</b> <b>networks</b> the ring and the bus topologies. (3) The problem of expressing dynamic reconfiguration. TDL is not well suited for the specification of dynamic networks. We distinguish between three kinds of dynamic networks: object-oriented networks, ad hoc networks, and mobile code networks. Based on an examination of three state-of-the-art modelling languages (FOCUS, SDL- 2000 and UML 2. 0), we propose a language, MEADOW (ModElling lAnguage for DataflOW) that essentially is an extension of TDL. Our hypothesis is that MEADOW successfully solves the problems mentioned above, and we argument by small examples and case studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} a novel delta-star architecture for large-scale <b>multipoint</b> fiber sensor <b>networks</b> with enhanced recon-figurable functionality. Unlike conventional star networks, the pro-posed network {{is divided into}} several delta regions, each containing only one feeder fiber. This delta-star structure significantly reduces the complexity and implementation cost of conventional star net-works. A concatenated dual-ring structure with the self-healing function is designed to overcome the star’s weakness in reliability. Numerous sensor ring subnets (SRSNs) are utilized to serve {{a large number of}} fiber Bragg grating sensors. Delta regions are parti-tioned upon the criterion of inter-region traffic uniformization; this simplifies the interrogation process and time slot assignment. The reconfigurable function for this <b>multipoint</b> sensor <b>network,</b> which is based on the optical switching technique, is utilized to en-sure service continuity when fibers fail.

40|$|Network Measurements play an {{essential}} role in operating and developing todays Internet. A variety of measurement applications demand for <b>multipoint</b> <b>network</b> measurements, e. g. service providers need to validate their delay guarantees from Service Level Agreements and network engineers have incentives to track where packets are changed, reordered, lost or delayed. Multipoint measurements create an immense amount of measurement data which demands for high resource measurement infrastructure. Data selection techniques, like sampling and filtering, provide efficient solutions for reducing resource consumption while still maintaining sufficient information about the metrics of interest. But not all selection techniques are suitable for multipoint measurements; only deterministic filtering allows a synchronized selection of packets at multiple observation points. Nevertheless a filter bases its selection decision on the packet content and hence is suspect to bias, i. e. the selected subset is not representative for the whole population. Hash-based selection is a filtering method that tries to emulate random selection in order to obtain a representative sample for accurate estimations of traffic characteristics. The subject of the thesis is to assess which hash function and which packet content should be used for hash-based selection to obtain a seemingly random and unbiased selection of packets. This thesis empirically analyzes 25 hash functions and different packet content combinations on their suitability for hash-based selection. Experiments are based on a collection of 7 real traffic groups from different networks...|$|E
30|$|We have {{developed}} new Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs) {{that are designed}} to measure thermospheric winds and temperatures as well as mesospheric winds through the airglow/aurora emissions at wavelengths of 630.0 nm and 557.7 nm, respectively. One FPI (FP 01), possessing a large aperture etalon (diameter: 116 mm), was installed at the EISCAT Tromsø site in 2009. The other FPIs, using 70 -mm diameter etalons, were installed in Thailand, Indonesia, and Australia in 2010 – 2011 (FP 02 –FP 04) by the Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory, and in Peru (Nazca and Jicamarca) and Alaska (Poker Flat) by Clemson University. The FPIs with 70 -mm etalons are low-cost compact instruments, suitable for <b>multipoint</b> <b>network</b> observations. All of these FPIs use low-noise cooled-CCD detectors with 1024 × 1024 pixels combined with a 4 -stage thermoelectric cooling system that can cool the CCD temperature down to − 80 °C. The large incident angle (maximum: 1.3 °– 1.4 °) to the etalon achieved by the use of multiple orders increases the throughput of the FPIs. The airglow and aurora observations at Tromsø by FP 01 show wind velocities with typical random errors ranging from 2 to 13 m s− 1 and from 4 to 27 m s− 1 for mesosphere (557.7 nm) and thermosphere (630.0 nm) measurements, respectively. The 630.0 -nm airglow observations at Shigaraki, Japan, by FP 02 –FP 04 and by the American FPI instruments give thermospheric wind velocities with typical random errors that vary from 2 m s− 1 to more than 50 m s− 1 depending on airglow intensity.|$|E

In general lines, the document starts by presenting the main architectural options and components of the architecture, with a special emphasis on a protection device called the CRUTIAL Information Switch (CIS). Given the various criticality levels of the equipments {{that have to be}} protected, and the cost of using a replicated device, we define a hierarchy of CIS designs incrementally more resilient. The different CIS designs offer various trade offs in terms of capabilities to prevent and tolerate intrusions, both in the device itself and in the information infrastructure.

The CRUTIAL middleware comprises several building blocks that are organized on a set of layers. The <b>Multipoint</b> <b>Network</b> layer is the lowest layer of the middleware, and features an abstraction of basic communication services, such as provided by standard protocols, like IP, IPsec, UDP, TCP and SSL/TLS.

40|$|Designing an {{optimised}} telemetry {{control system}} {{will improve the}} quality of service for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems implemented by CSE-W. Arthur Fisher and enable system expansion thus minimising revenue for their future system designs. The telemetry control system ensures a high degree of data reliability and integrity to meet SCADA operational requirements. This thesis presents the design and development of an optimised telemetry control system using Kingfisher Remote Terminal Units (RTU’s) with Kingfisher Series 2 protocol. To determine the system response for data transmission over the bandwidth, quantitative research methods were undertaken to evaluate communication blocks within the Kingfisher protocol. There are usually different techniques used to collect data from remote stations. The Kingfisher S 2 protocol implements two techniques namely “Exception Reporting” and the “Polling” technique for data acquisition. The polling technique was the most efficient in terms of bandwidth utilization for transferring data therefore the system was designed using a pure polling system approach. It also enabled the communication links for remote stations to be monitored and enabled a deterministic system design approach to be implemented. Research focused on polling system optimization whereby efficient polling frequencies were calculated based on theory presented by (O. J. Boxma, Levy, & Weststrate, 1991). The aim was to efficiently allocate the limited bandwidth resource to a number of remote stations thus optimising the system performance. The proposed theory was implemented for system optimisation. It enables efficient polling frequencies to be calculated for a polling cycle hence optimising the bandwidth utilisation and eliminating fairness problems for the medium access control. Bandwidth optimisation enables system expansion thus reducing the networks need for additional resources. A pure polling telemetry communication system was implemented in this design using point to <b>multipoint</b> <b>network</b> topology over half duplex radio channel. Empirical data modelling enabled the design of the service duration period to allow for time sharing between the remote stations to share the bandwidth. The bandwidth was designed to share real time data and event log for SCADA systems monitoring and control. Queuing analysis was performed to establish system parameters and enable system optimisation. From the literature review the implemented design methodology uses the “mean delay approximation” method which was used to calculate efficient visit frequencies and enabled the optimisation of the bandwidth to the remote stations based on the workload of each remote site. The software for the telemetry control system was developed and tested using ladder logic. The results prove that the bandwidth utilisation can be efficiently controlled thus optimising the telemetry control system. The implemented design improves the quality of service for the SCADA system by providing regular real time system status poll requests for control purposes and was given the highest priority for medium access. It also performs a polling of individual sites according to the “mean delay approximation method” to efficiently allocate bandwidth amongst the remote stations depending on their workload thus optimising the system. The system was designed to be responsive to high priority event log data thus enabling system flexibility...|$|E
40|$|The boom in data {{communications}} {{that started in}} the 1960 s {{is a long way}} from abating. The early and mid 1980 s will see a new generation of digital data transmission services come into operation that could change the ways business is conducted. "Information management and exploitation will change the fabric of society", according to Nicolas Mokhoff, Associate Editor of IEEE Spectrum Magazine. Manipulated by microelectronic, computer, radio and other electronic disciplines, information has become a vital commodity at the trade exchange. But unlike the prices of most commodities today, the price for exchange of information is decreasing because of electronics. One of the principal contributors to this decrease has been the geosynchronous telecommunications satellite, due to rapid advances in space and communications technology and the resulting cost-effectiveness achieved in applying that technology. Advances in IC technology have made digital telephony an equal partner with analogue. The inherent advantages of digital reliability, low cost and smaller packaging are prompting Telecom to phase out present equipment and expand new services with a digital hierarchy, such as the Digital Data Service being introduced in late 1982. Services employing advanced satellite and microwave technology, and also the existing and upgraded telephone systems, will have at least two things in common: they will transmit and switch data digitally, including coded speech, and the data will be transmitted in bursts. The technology that may expand fastest is the second generation of commercial communications satellites. Pier Bargellini, a senior scientist at Comsat Laboratories, says that "without the use of satellites as reflectors for source and data channels, television signals could not be shared by remote areas, long-distance telephone services would be constricted and the data exchange for the business world would be hampered. " Changes in the communications industry have been so dramatic (particularly with regard to satellites) that government bodies (including the Australian Federal Government) have been forced to reexamine long-standing communications practices. In October 1979 the Minister for Post and Telecommunications announced the Governments decision that it would be in the national interest to establish a communications satellite system for Australia. At that time, the Minister also announced that, a Satellite Project Office would be established within the Postal and Telecommunications Department to set in train the planning activities necessary for the introduction of the system. The SPO has been operational within the Department since late 1979, and 2. consultation of system service requirements in particular has involved liaison with a broad spectrum of interests including Commonwealth departments. Figure 1 of Appendix A testifies to the Australian Government's policy of supplying outback communities with improved communications services (including television) by using satellite facilities. Very little is known about the benefits and needs (in Australia) that a {{data communications}} satellite system might be able to fulfil, including those needs of the Department of Social Security. This is mainly due to the lack of specific details about the final configurations and costs of the separate satellite services, which wont be known until late 1981. This paper is, therefore, an initial but detailed examination of the hardware and software subsystems which constitute a domestic telecommunications satellite system. More specifically, the paper considers the on-board equipment of a communications satellite (the space segment - including satellite launch and orbit characteristics, and signal propagation delay and attenuation), and the earth stations (the ground segment - including signal modulation, multiple access and computer application considerations); all as dictated by Australian geographical, economic and communications traffic density characteristics. The paper then considers some of the possible methods Australian corporations and government departments may adopt to utilise satellite communications links, particularly for data communications. A second paper will re-examine the situation by applying the specific facilities and costs, when they are known (these will be announced by the Satellite Project Office after contracts for the space and ground segments have been let), to a large, low-traffic, interactive <b>multipoint</b> <b>network</b> such as that of the Department of Social Security...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive study {{on how to}} use Profibus networks to support real-time communications, that is, ensuring the transmission of the real-time messages before their deadlines. Profibus is based on a simplified Timed Token (TT) protocol, which is a well-proved solution for real-time communication systems. However, Profibus differences to the TT protocol prevent the application of the usual TT analysis. The main reason is that, conversely to the TT protocol, in the worst case, only one high-priority message is processed per token visit. The major contribution {{of this paper is to}} prove that, despite this shortcoming, it is possible to guarantee communication real-time behaviour with the Profibus protocol. 1. INTRODUCTION A recent trend in distributed process control systems is to interconnect the distributed elements by means of a <b>multipoint</b> broadcast <b>network,</b> instead of using the traditional point-to-point links.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{mechanism}} of multipoint relays (MPRs) to efficiently do the flooding of broadcast messages in the mobile wireless <b>networks.</b> <b>Multipoint</b> relaying is a technique {{to reduce the number}} of redundant re-transmissions while diffusing a broadcast message in the network. We discuss the principle and the functioning of MPRs, and propose a heuristic to select these MPRs in a mobile wireless environment. We also analyze the complexity of this heuristic and prove that the computation of a multipoin- t relay set with minimal size is NP-complete. Finally, we present some simulation results to show the efficiency of multipoint relays...|$|R
30|$|In {{the last}} few years, the problem of {{scheduling}} for cooperative cognitive networks has been addressed by several authors. In [3], the authors considered a point to <b>multipoint</b> cognitive <b>network</b> in which they maximize the total throughput of the network while maintaining a required signal to interference plus noise ratio for the primary users. They investigated the uplink and downlink power control and channel assignment problem. The problem of power allocation was also investigated in [4] from a game theoretic point of view. The problem was formulated as a Nash Bargaining Solution problem and a closed form analytical solution was found for the proposed scheduler. The proposed scheduling algorithm maximizes the overall rate while guaranteeing the proportional fairness and efficient power distribution among cognitive radio users. In [5], a cognitive radio network for which a joint cooperative spectrum sensing and resource scheduling scheme is designed. Soft sensing is used instead of hard sensing, and a distributive scheduling algorithm based on duality theory is proposed to find {{the solution of the}} non-convex scheduling problem.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} joint {{transmission}} (JT) in coordinated <b>multipoint</b> (CoMP) <b>networks</b> from a new point of view where the system performance is optimized via frequency allocation for 5 G small cells. Moreover, we investigate the implementation of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), as an efficient scheme facing the feedback load problem in CoMP setups. The results are obtained for the cases with slow and fast fading conditions. Considering the channel state information (CSI) only at the receiver, we show that at low and medium signal to noise ratios (SNRs) sharing the frequency resources between users outperforms the case when the frequency resources are dedicated under non-coherent JT-CoMP setting. We find that the maximum long term throughput is achieved by either sharing the entire frequency resources between the users or allocating each user in a disjoint dedicated frequency resource. These extreme cases show the best performance in the SNR region of interest. Finally, as demonstrated analytically and numerically, HARQ feedback increases the long term throughput and reduces the outage probability substantially, with an affordable average delay...|$|R
