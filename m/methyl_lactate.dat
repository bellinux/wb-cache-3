Rat hearts previously depleted of myocardial glycogen were perfused with 5. 5  mm [U- 13 C]glucose plus 50  mU/mL insulin until newly synthesized glycogen recovered to new steady-state levels (sim 60 % of pre-depleted values). After a short wash-out period, the perfusate glucose was then switched to [1 - 13 C]glucose, and glycolysis and glycogenolysis were stimulated by addition of glucagon (1  mug/ml). A 13 C NMR multiplet analysis of the <b>methyl</b> resonance of <b>lactate</b> provided an estimate of pyruvate derived from glucose vs glycogen while a multiplet analysis of the C 4 resonance of glutamate provided an estimate of acetyl-CoA derived from glycolytic pyruvate vs glycogenolytic pyruvate.

The intracellular environment of the enzymes involved in this exchange has been investigated by comparing the exchange properties of the enzymes in the intact cell with the properties they display in vitro. A study of the exchange of the lactate C- 2 substituent with solvent, which is catalysed by a coupled system of four glycolytic enzymes, has teen used to examine the kinetic properties of the individual enzymes in vitro. Measurements of the exchange in the intact cell have been used to investigate the in situ kinetic properties of one of these enzymes, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase. Contrary to the conclusions of previous studies with the isolated enzyme in vitro, these measurements have shown that the enzyme is not rate determining for glycolytic flux in the human erythrocyte and that it is unlikely that it is bound to the cell membrane in situ. A study of 1 H/ 2 H exchange between the C- 2 positions of <b>methyl</b> labelled <b>lactate</b> molecules, catalysed by lactate dehydrogenase, has been used to investigate the in situ kinetic properties of this enzyme. Comparison of these properties with those it displays in vitro indicate that the free intracellular NAD(H) concentration in the erythrocyte is only approximately 10 % of the total extractable concentration. A considerable fraction of the coenzyme must be bound, therefore, in the intact cell. This type of experiment should be widely applicable to a variety of tissues and possibly to different dehydrogenases. Theoretical aspects of bulk isotope exchange kinetics in multi-enzyme systems are examined and the effects of chemical flux, and of isotope effects, on the measurement of isotopic flux are considered.

40|$|Introduction. The {{birth of}} most mammals {{features}} {{a dramatic increase}} of oxygen while placenta-derived hormones such as ß-estradiol and progesterone plummet.

C 8 -D 1 A astrocytes were exposed to oxygen levels of 21 % and 80 %, both with and without progesterone (P 10 - 5 M, 10 - 7 M, 10 - 9 M) and RU 486 (10 µM) for 24 to 72 hours. <b>Methyl</b> tetrazolium metabolism, <b>lactate</b> dehydrogenase release and Cell Death Detection ELISA were used to assess cell survival and damaging mechanisms.

Hyperoxia decreased metabolism of MTT by 35 %, increased significantly the release of LDH, reduced CFSE-assessed cell proliferation by 55 % and downregulated Cyclin D 2 expression. Progesterone at concentrations ranging from 10 - 9 M to P 10 - 5 M did not affect any of these hyperoxia-mediated indicators of cell death or malfunctioning.

40|$|Placental {{insufficiency}} is a {{major cause}} of antepartum stillbirth and fetal growth restriction (FGR). In affected pregnancies, delivery is expedited when the risks of ongoing pregnancy outweigh those of prematurity. Current tests are unable to assess placental function and determine optimal timing for delivery. An accurate, non-invasive test that clearly defines the failing placenta would address a major unmet clinical need. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H MRS) can be used to assess the metabolic profile of tissue in-vivo. In FGR pregnancies, a reduction in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) /choline ratio and detection of <b>lactate</b> <b>methyl</b> are emerging as biomarkers of impaired neuronal metabolism and fetal hypoxia, respectively. However, fetal brain hypoxia is a late and sometimes fatal event in placental compromise, limiting clinical utility of brain (1) H MRS to prevent stillbirth. We hypothesised that abnormal placental (1) H MRS may be an earlier biomarker of intrauterine hypoxia, affording the opportunity to optimise timing of delivery in at-risk fetuses. We recruited three women with severe placental insufficiency/FGR and three matched controls. Using a 3 T MR system and a combination of phased-array coils, a 20 × 20 × 40 mm(1) H MRS voxel was selected along the 'long-axis' of the placenta with saturation bands placed around the voxel to prevent contaminant signals. A significant choline peak (choline/lipid ratio 1. 35 - 1. 79) was detected in all healthy placentae. In contrast, in pregnancies complicated by FGR, the choline/lipid ratio was ≤ 0. 02 in all placentae, despite preservation of the lipid peak (p< 0. 001). This novel proof-of-concept study suggests that in severe placental insufficiency/FGR, the observed 60 -fold reduction in the choline/lipid ratio by (1) H MRS may represent an early biomarker of critical placental insufficiency. Further studies will determine performance of this test and the potential role of 1 H-MRS in the in-vivo assessment of placental function to inform timing of delivery...|$|R

EricksonChlorinated {{solvents}} are {{the second}} most ubiquitous contaminants, next to petroleum hydrocarbons, and many are carcinogens. Tetrachloroethylene or perchloroethene (PCE) has been employed extensively in the dry cleaning industry and carbon tetrachloride (CT) {{has been used as}} a fumigant in grain storage facilities. In this work, remediation feasibility studies were conducted by mesocosm experiments; a chamber was divided into six channels and filled with soil, and plants were grown on top. Each channel was fed with contaminated water near the bottom and collected at the outlet, simulating groundwater flow conditions. The contaminants were introduced starting from March 12, 2004. PCE was introduced at a concentration of about 2 mg/L ([similar to] 12 [Mu]moles/L) in three channels, two of them with alfalfa plants and the other with grass. CT was introduced at a concentration of about 2 mg/L ([similar to] 13 [Mu]moles/L) in the other three channels, two of them with alfalfa plants and the other with grass. After the system had attained steady state, the concentrations of PCE and CT at inlet and outlet were monitored and the amount of PCE and CT disappearing in the saturated zone was studied. Since no degradation products were found at the outlet after about 100 days, one channel-each for PCE and CT (with alfalfa) was made anaerobic by adding one liter of 0. 2 % glucose solution. The glucose solution was fed once every month starting from July 1, 2004 and continued until February 2005. From October 1, 2004, one liter of 0. 1 % emulsified soy oil methyl esters (SOME) was fed to two other channels (with alfalfa), one exposed to PCE and another exposed to CT. The SOME addition dates were the same as that for glucose. The outlet liquid of the channel fed with PCE and SOME started to contain some of the degradation compounds of PCE; however, the extent of degradation was not as great as that of the glucose fed channel. No degradation compounds were observed in the outlet solution of the channel (grass grown on top) in which no carbon and energy supplements were added. Similar trend was observed in the CT fed channels also. KB- 1, a commercially available microbial culture (a consortium of dehalococcoides) that degrades dichloroethene (DCE), was added through the inlet of the PCE fed channels, but this did not lead to sufficient conversion of DCE. Addition of KB- 1 at well 3, located approximately in the middle of the channel, had a greater impact in the degradation of DCE, in both glucose and SOME amended channels, compared to addition at the inlet. KB- 1 culture added to the channel was active even 155 days later, suggesting that there is sustainable growth of KB- 1 when provided with suitable conditions and substrates. A pilot field study was conducted for remediation of a tetrachloroethylene (PCE) contaminated site at Manhattan, KS. The aquifer in the pilot study area has two distinct zones, termed shallow zone and deep zone, with groundwater velocities of about 0. 3 m/day and 0. 1 m/day. Prior to the pilot study, PCE concentration in groundwater at the pilot study area was about 15 mg/L (ppm) in the deep zone and 1 mg/L in the shallow zone. Nutrient solution comprising soy oil <b>methyl</b> esters (SOME), <b>lactate,</b> yeast extract and glucose was added in the pilot study area for biostimulation, on August 18, 2005. Potassium bromide (KBr) was added to the nutrient solution as a tracer. PCE was converted to DCE under these conditions. To carry out complete degradation of PCE, KB- 1, a consortium of Dehalococcoides, and a second dose of nutrient solution were added on October 13, 2005. After addition of KB- 1, both PCE and DCE concentrations decreased. Nutrients were again injected on March 3, 2006 (with KBr) and on August 1, 2006. The total chlorinated ethenes (CEs) have decreased by about 80 % in the pilot study area due to bioremediation. Biodegradation of CEs continued for a long time (several months) after the addition of nutrients. The insoluble SOME may be retained at the feeding area and provide a long time source of electron donors. Biostimulation and bioaugmentation of PCE contaminated soil and groundwater was evaluated in the laboratory and this technique was implemented successfully in the pilot field study. Modeling of the tracer study was performed using an advection-dispersion equation (ADE) and traditional residence time distribution (RTD) methods. The dispersion coefficient, groundwater velocity and hydraulic conductivity were estimated from the experimental data. The groundwater velocities vary from 1. 5 cm/d to 10 cm/d in the deep zone and 15 cm/d to 40 cm/d in the shallow zone. The velocities estimated from the 2004 tracer study and 2005 tracer study were higher compared to the velocity estimated from the 2006 tracer study, most likely because of microbial growth and product formation that reduced the hydraulic conductivity. Based on data collected from several wells the hydrologic parameter values obtained from tracer studies appear to vary spatially...|$|R

It involves insertion of the hydroxyl group of methyl mandelate within the intramolecular hydrogen bond of <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate</b> or methyl glycolate, resulting in a five-membered ring. This contrasts with <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate</b> clusters previously studied by FTIR spectroscopy in a filet jet...|$|E

40|$|Background]: The {{production}} of value-added products from biomass has acquired increasing importance {{due to the}} high worldwide demand for chemicals and energy, uncertain petroleum availability {{and the necessity of}} finding environmentally friendly processes. This paper reports work on the synthesis of several catalysts for the conversion of glucose to <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate.</b> [Results]: A MCM- 41 type mesoporous material containing tin (Si/Sn= 55) was developed with a uniform ordered mesoporous structure, high specific surface area and high pore volume. Sn-MCM- 41 was tested in three consecutive catalytic cycles to evaluate its reusability giving <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate</b> yields of 43 %, 41 % and 39 %, in each cycle. The slightly reduction in activity could be explained by the reduction in the accessibility of active centers due to the adsorption of reaction products and structural changes. Microporous titanosilicates and MFI-type zeolite ZSM- 5 showed a lower catalytic performance, but exfoliated materials gave higher yields of <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate</b> and pyruvaldehyde dimethyl acetal than their respective layered precursors. [Conclusions]: Sn-MCM- 41 material showed good results in the conversion of glucose to <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate</b> over three catalytic cycles and exfoliated materials facilitated the access of glucose to the catalytic sites and fast desorption of products. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

30|$|In this process, {{reactive}} distillation is {{the most}} crucial operation on which the entire process is dependent. A reactive distillation operation consists of simultaneous reaction and separation processes [14, 15]. In this case, methanol reacts with crude lactic acid to produce <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate.</b> As per the patented process, water and methanol are being simultaneously separated in the same column. However, while simulating this process {{it was observed that}} an additional separation column (Separat 4) was more effective for carrying out the separation of methanol and water than having a side-draw from the RadFrac column. It can therefore be said that the Bubble Column Reactor and Separat 4 together represent the Reactive Distillation Column. However, {{it should be noted that}} the more significant separation of <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate</b> and water[*]+[*]methanol is still occurring in the Bubble Column Reactor.|$|E

The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Ar physisorption, NMR, UV/Vis, and FTIR spectroscopy. These well-defined Lewis acid zeolites exhibit good catalytic activity and selectivity in the conversion of 1, 3 -dihydroxyacetone to <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate.</b> Their performance {{is similar to a}} reference Sn-Beta zeolite prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. Sn-BEA zeolites that contain EFSn species exhibit lower catalytic activity; the EFSn species also catalyze formation of byproducts.

40|$|Separation and {{purification}} of {{lactic acid}} from the fermentation broth are {{difficult because of}} its nonvolatile nature {{and the presence of}} other organic acids. Esterification of lactic acid with methanol followed by hydrolysis of the separated <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate</b> is an effective technique for this purpose. A continuous process for recovery is proposed and various aspects are evaluated through simulation and experiments. In the proposed route, a vapor stream containing <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate</b> is removed from a two-phase CSTR, used for esterification, operated under boiling conditions. The ester thus separated from the aqueous solution is further hydrolyzed in a reactive distillation column. Continuous removal of the volatile component (i. e. methanol) from the reaction zone increases conversion, thus pure lactic acid is obtained from the bottom of reactive distillation column. The results obtained in the experiments are compared with the simulation results. Further simulation studies were performed to obtain the suitable operating conditions for higher conversion and concentration of lactic acid. (c) 2006 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E

These spectra are used to analyse the FT-IR and VCD spectra of methyl lactates in presence of sodium bis(2 - ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) in CCl 4, where the surfactant molecules are known to form reverse micelles. Some tendency of <b>methyl</b> <b>lactate</b> to interact with AOT micellar aggregates is observed, but not as well defined as previously observed for dimethyl tartrate in analogous circumstances.
