Thus the scientists could witness the equilibrium of the gas in contact with its solid state, even by observing transient migration and phase transition of individual benzene molecules.Other experimenters observed large molecular adsorbates on a Au(111) surface under UHV conditions and found a molecular 2D gas at room temperature and low coverages. If the surface coverage of adsorbates is increased, a 2D liquid is formed, followed by a 2D solid.|$|E

40|$|Lignosulfonate {{is a type}} {{of natural}} polymer surfactant. Its {{capability}} to reduce the surface tension of aqueous solution depends on its adsorption configuration at the air/liquid interface. The dynamic surface tension, the air/liquid interfacial film properties of lignosulfonate at different solution concentrations, pH values and ionic strengths had been measured in the present work. The results showed that the adsorption equilibrium of lignosulfonate at the air/liquid cannot be achieved in a short period; the diffusion coefficient of lignosulfonate from the liquid to the air/liquid interface decreased with the increasing of pH value, while it increased with the increasing of ionic strength. Lignosulfonate could form soluble <b>monomolecular</b> <b>film</b> at the air/liquid interface, whereas the film was unstable. The stability of lignosulfonate <b>monomolecular</b> <b>film</b> became poor with the increasing of solution concentration, ionic strength and decreasing of pH value.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that <b>monomolecular</b> surface <b>films</b> of {{biological}} origin are often encountered on the ocean surface, especially in coastal regions. The thicknesses of the <b>monomolecular</b> <b>films</b> are {{of the order of}} 3 x 10 to the - 9 th m. Huehnerfuss et al.

Other effects caused by films are related to the reduction of the gas exchange at the air-sea interface and the decrease of the wind stress. The present investigation is concerned with experiments which reveal an unexpectedly large response of the microwave brightness temperature to a monomolecular oleyl alcohol slick at 1. 43 GHz.

We have synthesized the double chain diacetylenic ammonium lipid N-bis-(10, 12 -pentacosadiinoyl) -oxyethyl) -N-methyl-amine (ONCO). We have characterized <b>monomolecular</b> <b>films</b> at the air/water interface by means of microfluorescence filmbalance techniques and by atomic force microscopy (AFM). ONCO forms stable <b>monomolecular</b> <b>films</b> that exhibit a fluid-solid phase transition with a transition enthalpy of 90 kJ/mol at 10 degrees C and neutral pH. The coexistence pressure was found to decrease with decreasing protonation, which is in contrast to the commonly found Coulomb mechanism. A change in the chain packing due to a different nitrogen bond angle is discussed as a possible mechanism. This model is corroborated by the finding that crystals at high and at low pH differ in their polymerization properties as measured by microfluorescence. [References: 23...|$|R

The cell equilibrium is {{a direct consequence of}} the pro-/antioxidant balance. In order to understand the physiological processes involved in oxidative stress, we followed oxidation of unsaturated lipids using a biomimetic system: Langmuir monolayers. The oxidation mode chosen was UV-irradiation and the lipid model was a polyunsaturated phospholipid: 1, 2 -dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DLPC). The <b>monomolecular</b> <b>film</b> technique was used to measure membrane rheology before and after UV-irradiation. We showed that the UV-irradiation of a DLPC <b>monomolecular</b> <b>film</b> led to a molecular area and surface elasticity modulus decrease that attests to the apparition of new molecular species at the air–water interface. The antioxidant effect of a synthetic plasmalogen (1 -O-(1 ′-(Z) -hexadecenyl) - 2 -O-oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine or PPLMOPE) was tested on the oxidation of DLPC. Indeed, for about 25 % mol PPLMOPE in mixed DLPC/PPLMOPE monolayers, a complete inhibition of the molecular area and the surface elasticity modulus decreases was observed in our experimental conditions. Lower PPLMOPE quantities delayed but did not prevent the DLPC oxidation in mixed monolayers...|$|E

40|$|Using the {{classical}} emulsified {{system and the}} <b>monomolecular</b> <b>film</b> technique, the substrate specificity of recombinant Gibberella zeae lipase (rGZEL) that originates from Gibberella zeae was characterized in detail. Under the emulsified reaction system, both phospholipase and glycolipid hydrolytic activities were observed, except for the predominant lipase activity. The optimum conditions for different activity exhibition were also determined. Compared with its lipase activity, a little higher ratio of glycolipid hydrolytic activity (0. 06) than phospholipase activity (0. 02) was found. rGZEL preferred medium chain-length triglycerides, while lower activity was found for the longer-chain triglyceride. Using the <b>monomolecular</b> <b>film</b> technique, {{we found that the}} preference order of rGZEL to different phospholipids was 1, 2 -diacyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phospho-l-serine (PS) > 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phospho-rac-(1 -glycerol) sodium salt (PG) > 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DOPC) > l-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI) > cardiolipin (CL) > 3 -sn-phosphatidic acid sodium salt (PA) > l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), while no hydrolytic activity was detected for sphingomyelin (SM). Moreover, rGZEL showed higher galactolipase activity on 1, 2 -distearoyimonoglactosylglyceride (MGDG). A kinetic study on the stereo- and regioselectivity of rGZEL was also performed by using three pairs of pseudodiglyceride enantiomers (DDGs). rGZEL presented higher preference for distal DDG enantiomers than adjacent ester groups, however, no hydrolytic activity to the sn- 2 position of diglyceride analogs was found. Furthermore, rGZEL preferred the R configuration of DDG enantiomers. Molecular docking results were in concordance with in vitro tests...|$|E

The lipid, β-Mal 3 O(C 16 + 4) 2, contained phytanyl chains attached via two ether bonds to the sn- 2 carbon of the glycerol backbone. The preliminary studies showed that monolayers formed with the pure lipid have a liquid-like character; here, a hypothesis that admixing cholesterol to β-Mal 3 O(C 16 + 4) 2 could confer a higher rigidity on the films was tested.
