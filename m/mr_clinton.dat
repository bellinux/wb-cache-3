500|$|An inaugural celebration {{was held}} for US President-elect Bill Clinton in January 1993. The event was staged by Clinton's Hollywood friends at the Lincoln Memorial and drew {{hundreds}} of thousands of people. Aretha Franklin, LL Cool J, Michael Bolton and Tony Bennett were among some of the musicians in attendance. Said Jones, [...] "I've never seen so many great performers come together with so much love and selflessness." [...] The celebration included a performance of [...] "We Are the World", which involved Clinton, his daughter Chelsea, and his wife Hillary singing the song along with USA for Africa's Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. The New York Times Edward Rothstein commented on the event, stating, [...] "The most enduring image may be of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> singing along in 'We Are the World', the first President to aspire, however futilely, to hipness." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{arrived at}} the mortuary, a gay red and white building, which had been newly erected and consecrated by a duke with much festivity and rejoicing. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was sworn with the other jurymen, and with them {{repaired}} to see the bodies on which they were to sit.

6000|$|... 'Well, my man,' he said, as <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> at last came in, 'what are you {{complaining}} of?... One moment,' he added, as <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{was about}} to reply.

5000|$|She adds: [...] "Sexism is insidious, {{unconscious}} and affects {{women as well}} as men.

The fact so many women in America voted for Mr Trump over <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> is a get-out-of-jail-free card: female voters weren't bothered, so it can't be sexist. It can, and it is." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{month later}} a small party were {{assembled}} in Captain Clinton's bungalow.

60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{reached his}} office at a quarter to ten, except when the train, by some mistake, arrived up to time, {{when he arrived at}} nine-thirty precisely.

60|$|The {{weather was}} cold and grey, and a drizzling rain was falling. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> did not take a 'bus, since by walking he could put in his pocket the threepence which he meant to charge the firm for his fare. The streets were wet and muddy, and people walked close against the houses to avoid the splash of passing vehicles. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> thought of the jocose {{solicitor}} {{who was in the}} habit of taking an articled clerk with him on muddy days, to walk {{on the outside of the}} street and protect his master from the flying mud. The story particularly appealed to Mr Clinton; that solicitor must have been a fine man of business.
