We tested whether three videolaryngoscopes (VLS), McGrath (R) series 5 (Aircraft Medical Ltd, Edinburgh, UK), C-MAC (R) (Karl Storz, Tutdingen, Germany) and Glide-Scope (R) Cobalt (Verathon <b>Medical,</b> Bothell, <b>WA,</b> USA) exert reduced forces on maxillary incisors and lower teeth, and compared them with a classic Macintosh MAC 3 laryngoscope blade during laryngoscopy. Methods. In this randomized crossover trial, we included 141 patients (ASA I-III) with non-anticipated difficult airways. They were randomly allocated to undergo direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy performed with one of three VLS. Primary outcome was the magnitude of forces applied to the maxillary incisors during laryngoscopy. Secondary outcomes were the frequency with which forces were applied, and the magnitude of forces applied to the lower teeth. Results. Forces applied to the maxillary incisors during direct classic laryngoscopy were on average higher than forces applied during videolaryngoscopy. Among the VLS the average force applied was significantly lower for the C-MAC (R) as compared to the McGrath and the GlideScope (R) VLS. The frequency with which a force was applied to the maxillary incisors was significantly lower for the C-MAC (R), compared to the other VLS and classic Macintosh laryngoscope. The number of cases in which force was applied to the lower teeth was smallest for the McGrath VLS. Conclusion. Forces exerted on maxillary incisors are lower using video-assisted Macintosh blade laryngoscopy compared to classic direct laryngoscopy.

The Cool Cap (Olympic <b>Medical,</b> Seattle, <b>WA)</b> 1 Trial is a step along this path. The role of this technology is as-yet uncertain, its long-term benefits are unclear, and its safety profile is still incompletely defined. However, given the frequency of adverse outcomes in this group (> 60 % in the whole cohort), the promising outcomes of the original randomized trials strongly suggest that cooling will be an important part of our armamentarium in the years ahead. The latest article 2 from the group presents an exploratory posthoc analysis of the data from the Cool-Cap Trial for the purpose of hypothesis generation to inform additional studies of factors that may influence the outcome of treatment. The original study (and, therefore, the conclusions drawn from it) was, to some extent, held hostage by the difficulties inherent in the prospective diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).

40|$|Lyle D BroemelingBroemeling &amp; Associates Inc, <b>Medical</b> Lake, <b>WA,</b> USAAbstract: Determining the {{accuracy}} of a medical test is quite difficult because accuracy is an elusive parameter to estimate. A common scenario is estimating the true and false positive fractions from different studies and arriving at a common value of {{the accuracy}} of the test. The accuracy is expressed with an estimate similar to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Under the assumption that the ROC area is the same across all tests, the true and false positive fractions can be plotted on the same graph to obtain an experimental ROC curve, called the summary ROC curve (SROC) curve. The estimate of {{the accuracy of}} the curve is the ordinate of the point of intersection, where the SROC curve intersects the line with equation true positive rate + false positive rate = 1. Using a Bayesian approach, the presentation begins with summarizing information about test accuracy for tests with ordinal and continuous scores, where it is assumed the tests share a common ROC curve, but the tests may differ in the threshold used to declare a positive test. The true and false positive rates are transformed so that one may use bilogistic regression to determine {{the accuracy of the}} combined tests where the posterior distribution of the parameters of the model are determined. Bayesian inferences are based on the posterior distribution of the SROC curve and the computations are executed with the WinBUGS software package, and several examples from various areas of medicine illustrate the methodology.

40|$|An {{observational}} study of prepatient illness behavior was terminated because {{it failed to}} yield comprehensive data on illness experience in a large, municipally run lodging house. However, the data collected during pilot work provide some insights on illness behavior likely to be underemphasized in retrospective interview studies. Observations confirmed Zola’s findings on the extensiveness of accommodation to long-term symptoms and {{on the role of}} triggers in breaking that accommodation. Yet in specifying Zola’s conclusions, symptoms were accommodated selectively, and work-related concerns, a frequent trigger in Zola’s study, were found to promote as well as terminate accommodation to symptoms. Finally and most critically, triggers did not work automatically; the intention to seek a medical consultation had a provisional character, as help-seeking was always open to disruption and premature discontinuation due to the intrusion of new topical relevances. IN A STUDY that has become a minor classic, Zola (1966, 1973) asked a sample of outpatient clinic attenders, not the simple question of why they sought medical aid, but the more subtle question of why they sought it at that time. As various screening programs had established that most of the population suffers some untreated symptoms most of the time (the so-called &dquo;iceberg&dquo; principle), and as his own study (among others) established that many patients had suffered severe symptoms for a long period prior to pre-sentation, Zola argued that the decision to seek care could not be explained by the occurrence or the severity of symptoms. Instead, he suggested that in the majority of cases he studied the patient had accommodated to his or her symptoms and that the decision to seek <b>medical</b> aid <b>wa...</b>|$|R

It is {{typically associated with}} autoantibodies to mitochondrial antigens and results in immune-mediated destruction of small and medium-sized intrahepatic bile ducts leading to cholestasis, hepatic fibrosis and may progress to cirrhosis or hepatic failure and, in some cases, hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical presentation and {{the natural history of}} PBC have improved over the years due to recognition of earlier widespread use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA); about one-third of patients show suboptimal biochemical response to UDCA with poor prognosis. Until recently, UDCA was the only US Food and Drug Administration approved agent for this disease for more than two decades; obeticholic acid was approved in 2016 for treatment of patients with PBC with a suboptimal response or intolerance to UDCA. Currently, liver transplantation is the most effective treatment modality for PBC patients with end-stage liver disease.

30|$|Simulation {{program and}} manikin studies are now {{essential}} for operator’s skill acquisition of life-saving procedures like ETI in the ICU environment [29 – 31]. Anyway, clinical studies are obviously needed. A recent meta-analysis, involving nine clinical ICU studies, demonstrated that VDL-ETI in ICU {{could be useful}} to decrease difficult ETI, esophageal intubation, Cormack 3 / 4 grades, and increase first-attempt success, but did not reduce severe complications [16]. However, these results should {{be interpreted with caution}} due to the between study heterogeneity depending on the outcome analyzed, operator experience and different VDL devices used. In fact, these ICU studies primarily assessed the GlideScope (GVL®; Verathon <b>Medical,</b> Bothell, <b>WA,</b> USA) [16], a VDL with a different conception and operating mode, mainly due to a deported screen and the use of a separate preformed metal stylet inserted into the ETT. In contrast, two prospective randomized clinical cohort studies performed by inexperienced providers outside the ICU found better performances for the AWS [22, 23]. Furthermore, due to their technical conception, the best glottis view provided by different VDL may not always match ETI outcomes [9, 13]. AWS advantages result from its integrated monitor and ETT side channel into the handle and blade, respectively, allowing to facilitate the ETT insertion and to visualize its entire progression [24]. These features are useful to avoid the difficulties due to the necessary coordination between a separate monitor and/or the use of an additional stylet. In addition, other VDL may partially blind the ETT progression and result in serious complications [32]. It must be underlined that our experimental manikin study has been conducted with a non-difficult airway head, and results cannot be expanded in cases of difficult ETI. Experimental and clinical studies have previously shown, however, that AWS-ETI could be a reliable technique in different difficult airways such as pharyngeal obstruction, cervical spine rigidity, tongue edema [26, 33] and limited mouth opening (≈ 20  mm) [34]. AWS can also be used according to a multimodal approach combining a flexible stylet or a fiberoptic bronchoscope, particularly if nasal ETI is required [35].|$|R

Recent meta-analyses have generated mixed results about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of health psychology interventions. There have been few studies of health psychology interventions in real-world treatment settings. Several key challenges exist: determining the degree of penetration of health psychology into primary care settings; clarifying the specific roles of health psychologists in integrated care; resolving reimbursement issues; and adapting to the increased prescription of psychotropic medications. Identifying and exploring these issues can help health psychologists and primary care providers to develop the most effective ways of applying psychological principles in primary care settings. In a changing health care landscape, health psychologists must continue to articulate the theories and techniques of health psychology and integrated care, to put their beliefs into practice, and to measure the outcomes of their work.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAtrial {{fibrillation}} {{is commonly}} associated with impaired reservoir and booster functions of the left atrium (LA). Recent advances in two-dimensional speckle tracking technique (2 DST) enabled automatic analysis of the time-LA volume curve representing these functions. Our objective was to evaluate LA function in patients with or without paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) using 2 DST. MethodsWe studied 111 patients (68 men, age 62 ± 16 years) with (n= 53) or without (n= 58) PAF. After constructing time-LA volume curves from the apical four and two chamber views (iE 33, Philips with QLAB 6. 0, Philips <b>Medical</b> Systems, Bothell, <b>WA,</b> USA), maximal LA volume (LAVmax), preatrial contraction LA volume (LAVpreA), and minimum LA volume (LAVmin) were obtained. Then, LA reservoir volume (ARV=LAVmax−LAVmin) and active emptying volume (AEV=LAVpreA−LAVmin) were calculated to determine ARV/LAVmax as reservoir function and AEV/LAVpreA as booster pump function. ResultsPAF was associated with greater LAVmax than that in controls (80 ± 21 ml versus 65 ± 16 ml, p< 0. 001) and with reduced reservoir and booster functions (ARV/LAVmax 46 ± 9 % versus 52 ± 7 %; AEV/LAVpreA 29 ± 10 % versus 36 ± 6 %, p< 0. 001). Multivariate logistic analysis demonstrated that ARV/LAVmax and AEV/LAVpreA were {{closely associated with the}} existence of PAF. ConclusionThese results demonstrate that the present 2 DST enables determining LA reservoir and booster functions, providing insights into the diagnosis of PAF...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{accuracy}} of parametric analysis of transvaginal contrast-enhanced ultrasound (TV-CEUS) for distinguishing benign versus malignant ovarian masses. A total of 48 ovarian masses (37 benign and 11 borderline/malignant) were examined with TV-CEUS (Definity; Lantheus, North Billerica, MA; Philips iU 22; Philips <b>Medical</b> Systems, Bothell, <b>WA).</b> Parametric images were created offline with a quantification software (Bracco Suisse SA, Geneva, Switzerland) with map color scales adjusted such that abnormal hemodynamics were represented by the color red and the presence of any red color could be used to differentiate benign and malignant tumors. Using these map color scales, low values of the perfusion parameter were coded in blue, and intermediate values of the perfusion parameter were coded in yellow. Additionally, for each individual color (red, blue, or yellow), a darker shade of that color indicated a higher intensity value. Our study found that the parametric mapping method was considerably more sensitive than standard region of interest (ROI) analysis for the detection of malignant tumors but was also less specific than standard ROI analysis. Parametric mapping allows for stricter cutoff criteria, as hemodynamics are visualized on a finer scale than ROI analyses, and as such, parametric maps are a useful addition to TV-CEUS analysis by allowing ROIs to be limited to areas of the highest malignant potential...|$|R
40|$|Xueyan Chen, Lorinda A Soma, Jonathan R FrommDepartment of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington <b>Medical</b> Center, Seattle, <b>WA,</b> USAAbstract: Despite the {{relative}} success of chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), novel therapeutic agents {{are needed for}} refractory or relapsed patients. Targeted immunotherapy {{has emerged as a}} novel treatment option for these patients. Although unconjugated anti-cluster of differentiation (CD) 30 antibodies showed minimal antitumor activity in early clinical trials, development of antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) appears promising. Brentuximab vedotin is an ADC composed of an anti-CD 30 antibody linked to a potent microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). It has the ability to target CD 30 -positive tumor cells and, once bound to CD 30, brentuximab vedotin is internalized and MMAE is released to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In two phase II trials, objective response was reported in 75 % and 86 % of patients with refractory or relapsed HL and systemic ALCL, respectively, with an acceptable toxicity profile. Based on these studies, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval of brentuximab vedotin in August 2011 for the treatment of refractory and relapsed HL and ALCL. We review the key characteristics of brentuximab vedotin, clinical data supporting its therapeutic efficacy, and current ongoing trials to explore its utility in other CD 30 -positive malignancies.
