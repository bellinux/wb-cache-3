500|$|Hannah Levin of the Seattle {{publication}} The Stranger {{analyzed the}} lyrics to the track [...] "Mrs. Jones", calling it a [...] "particularly rattling sketch of {{what appears to be}} a rape scene, with Love seamlessly handling three perspectives: the ugly attacker ("Look into the bloodrot, you suicide bitch / It takes an hour with you to make me want to live"), the vengeful victim ("The abortion left an abscess / Don't ever talk to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> again"), and the supportive narrator ("Just like a pro, she takes off her dress / And she kicks you down in her snow white pumps")." [...] The song also makes direct references to The Ballad of East and West, a poem by Rudyard Kipling, with the line: [...] "East is east and west is west, and mine was you and mine was best", which is a partial quote from the poem.|$|E
500|$|Lauren is {{the most}} famous {{basketball}} player in Australia, a position she reached by 2003. [...] Prior to this, Australia's most famous player was Michelle Timms, Australia's first player of either gender to play internationally. [...] She was recognised {{as one of the}} world's best basketball players {{by the time she was}} 21. [...] She has been described as Australia's answer to Michael Jordan or Shaquille O'Neal, and the best female basketball player in the world. [...] She has said regarding being the best female basketball player in the world: [...] "I don't really think about it. Nobody really talks to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> It's not something I'm conscious of. My family and people who have known me all my life, they see me for who I am, and crack open a beer or a bottle of wine with me. They know I have to train, but the rest of it is really laid-back." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Rude Boy" [...] was {{produced}} by Rob Swire and StarGate who co-wrote the song with Rihanna, Ester Dean, and Makeba Riddick. During an interview on the television show, [...] in February 2010, Carr asked Rihanna about the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line [...] "Come here Rude Boy, Boy, can you get it up?/Come here Rude Boy, Boy, is you big enough?" [...] Rihanna explained: [...] "When we wrote the song, {{it was kind of}} a freestyle...I liked the West Indian influence that the music had, and, I just went in the booth, they were already jotting down some ideas and, that came to me, I just ran in there with the, one of the writers and started coming up with this in the studio and now when people read it back to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> 'Come here Rude Boy, is you big enough'?, it does sound so disgusting!" [...] She also explained the development of the song, and said that those lyrics were originally going to be the introduction, but because of the song's infectious beat, Rihanna decided to make it the hook instead.|$|E

2500|$|In December, popular US teen website Pop Dust called [...] "Want U Back" [...] the 25th Best Song of 2012. They {{wrote about}} it saying [...] "An entire {{timeline}} of Stockholm Syndrome in three-and-a-half minutes: Who is this manic muppet, and why is she grunting? Does she know he doesn’t want her back? At least she’s honest about her brattiness though, that’s refreshing. Do you think she’s in on the joke? Huh, it’s over already? OK, maybe just one more listen. Wait, why can’t I get her voice out of my head? Rimembah ol {{the things that you}} an’ oi did fuhst? No, stop looking at <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I’m just doing my Cher Lloyd impression".|$|E
2500|$|On May 18, 2007, Migden crashed her SUV into a sedan {{which was}} {{stopped at a}} red light, {{injuring}} Ellen Butawan and her 3-year-old daughter, who {{were sent to the}} emergency room. [...] Migden claims that she may have suffered from an adverse response to her leukemia treatment that led her to drive erratically. 911 tapes released in August show other drivers who saw her during her 30-mile trip along I-80 were panicking as they reported seeing her hit the center divider, and repeatedly come close to hitting other cars, before finally hitting one. One motorist claimed Migden told her, [...] "You can't talk to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I'm a senator." [...] Migden voluntarily ceased driving as she continued to undergo treatment and as medical tests were pursued. Migden claimed that her [...] "wild ride" [...] occurred during state business, so that the Department of General Services paid $335,000 to Butawan in July 2009.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Sheila and Lauren's [...] "cat fights", Brown said: [...] "People like cat fights because we {{can get away with}} what you can't get away with in {{everyday}} life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Billy Grifter from Den of Geek {{said that}} the show managed to {{surprise}} him this week {{and he did not}} know if he was happy or really infuriated. [...] "Part of <b>me</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> I’d got it wrong last week when I’d concluded that the masked assailant was Niles, because I’d forgotten about another missing character. But what was transplanted into its place made very little sense at times, and was as close as the show has come to a true shark-jumping moment." ...|$|R
