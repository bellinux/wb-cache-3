25|$|During {{his stay}} in Berlin, his {{father-in-law}} {{encouraged him to}} {{become more of a}} public figure, yet Schneerson described himself as an introvert, and was known to plead with acquaintances not to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> over {{the fact that he was}} the son-in-law of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn.|$|E
2500|$|According to one Pakistani report, {{her mother}} {{claimed to have}} been warned by an {{unidentified}} man [...] "not to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about her daughter's disappearance, if she wants safe recovery of her daughter," [...] suggesting that either government intelligence services or [...] "nexus of Pakistani and Arab jihadis" [...] had hidden Siddiqui.|$|E
2500|$|Members of Dirty Pretty Things were {{reported}} to have attacked MTV presenter Zane Lowe when he tried to stop them smoking backstage at Oxegen 2006. [...] "The band were on a bender and lit up in a no-smoking area. When Zane asked them to stop, guitarist Dids punched him and the others joined in." [...] An MTV spokesman said: [...] "Luckily Zane was OK and didn't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about it." [...] This was proved to be an incorrect report as proved in the MTV footage.|$|E

6000|$|... "Those eggs will taste {{very good}} for breakfast," [...] he thought. [...] "I'll go at once and get them; and if old Mammy Oriole <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss,</b> I'll eat her, too." ...|$|R
50|$|A little later, Augusta Cutler, another suburban, {{goes to the}} rescued child's {{house and}} <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> as she, too, {{was in love with}} Adam. She decides to leave her husband Owen, since he never seems to pay {{attention}} to her.|$|R
2500|$|In addition, Khrushchev's {{impression}} of Kennedy's weaknesses {{was confirmed by}} the President's response during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, particularly to {{the building of the}} Berlin Wall. Speaking to Soviet officials {{in the aftermath of the}} crisis, Khrushchev asserted, [...] "I know for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge." [...] He also told his son Sergei that on Cuba, Kennedy [...] "would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss,</b> make more of a fuss, and then agree." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another approach, instrumentalism, colloquially termed [...] "shut up and multiply," [...] {{emphasizes}} {{the utility of}} theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena. It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed {{to be something that}} should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.|$|E
2500|$|French took on {{responsibility}} for air defence, although {{he agreed with}} Repington that it was [...] "a damnosa hereditas". He was frequently lobbied by local groups for better air defences. In January 1917 anti-aircraft guns were reallocated to anti-submarine warfare. [...] After the Gotha raids in July 1917 French was able to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> at the War Cabinet (Robertson complained {{he could not get}} a word in edgeways) and show letters he had written urging greater priority for air defence. [...] A War Cabinet sub-committee was set up, nominally chaired by the Prime Minister but effectively run by J. C. Smuts, and French urged that air be treated as a separate department going forward (which eventually became the RAF). [...] More guns and fighter squadrons were provided, and Brigadier E.B. Ashmore was appointed to command London's air defence, reporting to French.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} cat, [...] "a rat who {{knows he has}} but {{a few minutes to}} live, never <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about <b>a</b> little agony. I don't think, my fine fellow, you have taken poison enough to hurt either you or me." ...|$|R
50|$|And {{then she}} turn and slap my face, and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> mighty <b>fuss.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{never saw}} any one <b>make</b> such <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about so {{insignificant}} a detail as a proposal of marriage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about this. In 'ninety-five {{when there}} were {{troubles}} white men were killed, and the fleet came and shelled the villages. A {{lot of people were}} killed who'd {{had nothing to do with}} it. They're damned fools at Apia. If they <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> they'll only punish the wrong people. I don't want anyone punished." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had a bit}} of luck, that's all. It's {{nothing to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about.|$|E
60|$|Let me see him. You don't {{want him}} to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> at the inquest.|$|E
50|$|Hugh (Macdonald Carey) and Miriam Halsworth (Claudette Colbert) are in {{the final}} stages of their divorce procedure. Miriam wants to {{separate}} because he's addicted to gambling - although he often wins. She's living with her daughter Barbara (Barbara Bates), her son-in-law Jerry Denham (Robert Wagner) and her little grandchild. Hugh, who's living at the hotel where he works, <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> with the gardener about his rosebushes.|$|R

60|$|On {{the other}} hand--if you won't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> at the inquest, I'll give you fifty pounds.|$|E
60|$|It's {{nice of you}} not to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about it. I'm {{very much}} obliged but I'm afraid I can't.|$|E
60|$|LADY BROCKLEHURST. To be sure. There's {{nothing to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about, and we're a family party. (To CRICHTON.) Now, truthfully, my man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I tell you, I wouldn't pay no {{attention}} to what she said, and I wouldn't <b>make</b> such <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> over <b>an</b> old cow-bell, anyway." ...|$|R
60|$|And Miss Parsons, when impressively told, evidently {{thought it}} was the family fashion to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> great <b>fuss</b> about him.|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh! you women, you <b>make</b> such <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> over everything,” Uncle Podger would reply, picking himself up. “Why, I {{like doing}} a little job of this sort.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm content, Addy, I'm content," [...] said Seth cheerfully. [...] "I'll {{be an old}} bachelor, belike, and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> wi' thy children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And then,' said Logan, 'the {{offspring}} {{of the deceased}} marchionesses <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss.</b> In fact marriage is always the signal for a family row.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's of no consequence,' said Frank. 'The plaster was hanging, {{and must}} have fallen in any case. Don't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about a trifle.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you <b>make</b> such <b>a</b> <b>FUSS</b> for?" [...] cried Paul, all in {{suffering}} {{because of}} her extreme emotion. [...] "Why can't you be ordinary with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' {{interrupted}} Maurice, 'if you <b>make</b> such <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> {{about killing}} it, I will stick a pin through {{it into a}} cork, and let it shift for itself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to do}} that. <b>A</b> {{telegraph}} message <b>makes</b> such <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> in the country, frightening people's wives, {{and setting}} all the horses about the place galloping." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use {{making a}} fuss. There {{are plenty of}} brutes {{in the world that}} one has to talk to. People with any savoir vivre don't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about such things. Some {{business}} must be done. You can't expect agreeable people to do it.

6000|$|... 'Well, anyway,' resumed Pringle. 'I can't see why you're so keen on the business. Put down anything. The beaks never <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> {{about these}} special exams.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear old Daddy," [...] she said, [...] "he'll <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fearful <b>fuss.</b> Well, it had {{to happen}} somewhen.... Somehow. I wonder what he'll say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she said--it {{would have}} been hard to say whether with relief or disappointment. [...] "Whatever did you <b>make</b> such <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> for? Why did you want to be so mysterious?" ...|$|R
