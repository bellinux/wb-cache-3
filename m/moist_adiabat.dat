40|$|Observations in {{subtropical}} regions {{show that}} stratiform low cloud cover is well {{correlated with the}} lower-troposphere stability (LTS), defined as the difference in potential temperature � between the 700 -hPa level and the surface. The LTS {{can be regarded as}} a measure of the strength of the inversion that caps the planetary boundary layer (PBL). A stronger inversion is more effective at trapping moisture within the marine boundary layer (MBL), permitting greater cloud cover. This paper presents a new formulation, called the estimated inversion strength (EIS), to estimate the strength of the PBL inversion given the temperatures at 700 hPa and at the surface. The EIS accounts for the general observation that the free-tropospheric temperature profile is often close to a <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat</b> and its lapse rate is strongly temperature dependent. Therefore, for a given LTS, the EIS is greater at colder temperatures. It is demonstrated that while the seasonal cycles of LTS and low cloud cover fraction (CF) are strongly correlated in many regions, no single relationship between LTS and CF can be found that encompasses the wide range of temperatures occurring in the Tropics, subtropics, and midlatitudes. However, a single linear relationship between CF and EIS explains 83 % of the regional/seasonal variance in stratus cloud amount, suggesting that EIS is a more regimeindependent predictor of stratus cloud amount than is LTS under a wide range of climatological conditions. The result has some potentially important implications for how low clouds might behave in a changed climate. In contrast to Miller’s thermostat hypothesis that a reduction in the lapse rate (Clausius– Clapeyron) will lead to increased LTS and increased tropical low cloud cover in a warmer climate, the results here suggest that low clouds may be much less sensitive to changes in the temperature profile if the vertical profile of tropospheric warming follows a <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat.</b> 1...|$|E

The spatial scales analyzed extend from the entire Tropics down to a single reanalysis grid point or radiosonde station, with monthly to daily time scales. There is very high vertical coherence of free-tropospheric temperature perturbations.

The convective cold top is found for observations and reanalysis at many temporal and spatial scales. Given this prevalence, the literature is reviewed for previous examples of what is likely a single phenomenon. One simple explanation is proposed: hydrostatic pressure gradients from tropospheric warming extend above the heating, forcing ascent and adiabatic cooling.

40|$|The authors {{report a}} {{significant}} increase in Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) –like variability in a superparameterized version of the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model run with high sea surface temperatures (SSTs). A series of aquaplanet simulations exhibit a tripling of intraseasonal outgoing longwave radiation variance as equatorial SST is increased from 268 to 358 C. The simulated intraseasonal variability also transitions from an episodic phenomenon to one with a semiregular period of 25 days. Moist static energy (MSE) budgets of composite MJO events are used to diagnose the physical processes responsible for the relationship with SST. This analysis points to an increasingly positive contribution from vertical advection, associated in part with a steepening of the mean vertical MSE profile in the lower troposphere. The change in MSE profile is a natural consequence of increasing SST while maintaining a <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat</b> with a fixed profile of relative humidity.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that the {{magnitude}} of global surface warming greatly depends on the meridional distribution of surface thermal forcing. An atmospheric model coupled to an aquaplanet slab mixed layer ocean is perturbed by prescribing heating to the ocean mixed layer. The heating is distributed uniformly globally or confined to narrow tropical or polar bands, and the amplitude is adjusted {{to ensure that the}} global mean remains the same for all cases. Since the tropical temperature is close to a <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat,</b> the prescribed heating leads to a maximized warming near the tropopause, whereas the polar warming is trapped near the surface because of strong atmospheric stability. Hence, the surface warming is more effectively damped by radiation in the tropics than in the polar region. As a result, the global surface temperature increase is weak (strong) when the given amount of heating is confined to the tropical (polar) band. The degree of this contrast is shown to depend on water vapor-and cloud-radiative feedbacks that alter the effective strength of prescribed thermal forcing. open 0...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of convective quasi-equilibrium states that moist convection reacts almost instantly {{to drive the}} atmospheric temperature profile throughout the troposphere to one of a special subset of possible profiles.

These calculations involve both a simple, physically based parameterization {{of the effects of}} convection on its environment and a complex cloud-resolving model. In both cases we show that imposed temperature perturbations in the lower troposphere are rapidly eliminated, while those in the upper troposphere are not. The rapid temperature relaxation in the lower troposphere is due to the near-instantaneous change in the precipitation rate and latent heat release provoked by the temperature anomaly.

40|$|The zonal and meridional {{components}} of the atmospheric general circulation are used to define a global thermodynamic stream function in dry static energy versus latent heat coordinates. Diabatic motions in the tropical circulations and fluxes driven by midlatitude eddies are found to form a single, global thermodynamic cycle. Calculations based on the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset indicate that the cycle has a peak transport of 428 Sv (Sv = 109  kg s− 1). The thermodynamic cycle encapsulates a globally interconnected heat and water cycle comprising ascent of moist air where latent heat is converted into dry static energy, radiative cooling where dry air loses dry static energy, and a moistening branch where air is warmed and moistened. It approximately follows a tropical <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat</b> and is bounded by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship for near-surface air. The variability of the atmospheric general circulation is related to ENSO events using reanalysis data from recent years (1979 - 2009) and historical simulations from the EC-Earth coupled climate model (1850 - 2005). The thermodynamic cycle in both EC-Earth and ERA-Interim widens and weakens with positive ENSO phases and narrows and strengthens during negative ENSO phases with a high correlation coefficient.

Using extensive new data sets for the region, we demonstrate that mean environmental lapse rates are steeper than moist adiabatic during the recent and glacial. We reconstruct glacial sea surface temperatures 4 to 5 C cooler than modern. We include modern and glacial sea surface temperatures in calculations of atmospheric convection that account for mixing between rising air and ambient air, and derive tropical glacier snowlines with altitudes consistent with twentieth-century and Last Glacial Maximum reconstructions. Sea surface temperature changes ≤ 3 C are excluded unless glacial relative humidity values were outside the range associated with deep convection in the modern. We conclude that the entrainment of ambient air into rising air masses significantly alters the vertical temperature structure of the troposphere in modern and ancient regions of deep convection. Furthermore, if all glacial tropical temperatures were cooler than previously estimated, it would imply a higher equilibrium climate sensitivity than included in present models. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited...|$|E
40|$|In {{the core}} {{accretion}} model, gas-giant planets first form a solid core, which then accretes gas from a protoplanetary disk when the core exceeds a critical mass. Here, we model {{the atmosphere of}} a core that grows by accreting ice-rich pebbles. The ice fraction of pebbles evaporates in warm regions of the atmosphere, saturating it with water vapor. Excess water precipitates to lower altitudes. Beneath an outer radiative region, the atmosphere is convective, following a <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat</b> in saturated regions due to water condensation and precipitation. Atmospheric mass, density and temperature increase with core mass. For nominal model parameters, planets with core masses (ice + rock) between 0. 08 and 0. 16 Earth masses have surface temperatures between 273 K and 647 K and form an ocean. In more massive planets, water exists as a super-critical convecting fluid mixed with gas from the disk. Typically, the core mass reaches a maximum (the critical mass) {{as a function of}} the total mass when the core is 2 - 5 Earth masses. The critical mass depends in a complicated way on pebble size, mass flux, and dust opacity due to the occasional appearance of multiple core-mass maxima. The core mass for an atmosphere of 50 percent hydrogen and helium may be a more robust indicator of the onset of gas accretion. This mass is typically 1 - 3 Earth masses for pebbles that are 50 percent ice by mass, increasing with opacity and pebble flux, and decreasing with pebble ice/rock ratio.

40|$|Earth’s storm {{tracks are}} {{instrumental}} for transporting heat, momentum, and moisture and thus strongly influence the surface climate. Climate models, {{supported by a}} growing body of observational data, have demonstrated that storm tracks shift poleward as the climate warms. But the dynamical mechanisms responsible for this shift remain unclear. To isolate what portion of the storm track shift may be accounted for by large-scale dry dynamics alone, disregarding the latent heat released in phase changes of water, this study investigates the storm track shift under various kinds of climate change in an idealized dry general circulation model (GCM) with an adjustable but constant convective stability. It is found that increasing the mean surface temperature or the convective stability leads to poleward shifts of storm tracks, even if the convective stability is increased only in a narrow band around the equator. Under warming and convective stability changes roughly corresponding to a doubling of CO_ 2 concentrations from a present-day Earthlike climate, storm tracks shift about 0. 8 ° poleward, somewhat less than but in qualitative agreement with studies using moist GCMs. About 63 % (0. 5 °) of the poleward shift is shown to be caused by tropical convective stability variations. This demonstrates that tropical processes alone (the increased dry static stability of a warmer <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat)</b> can account for part of the poleward shift of storm tracks under global warming. This poleward shift generally occurs in tandem with a poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation; however, the Hadley circulation expansion does not always parallel the storm track shift...|$|E

The MASC and SST-pattern effects are on the same order of magnitude in our LBM simulations.

40|$|Aptly named, ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune contain {{significant}} amounts of water. While this water cannot be present near the cloud tops, it must be abundant in the deep interior. We investigate {{the likelihood of a}} liquid water ocean existing in the hydrogen-rich region between the cloud tops and deep interior. Starting from an assumed temperature at a given upper tropospheric pressure (the photosphere), we follow a <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat</b> downward. The mixing ratio of water to hydrogen in the gas phase is small in the photosphere and increases with depth. The mixing ratio in the condensed phase is near unity in the photosphere and decreases with depth; this gives two possible outcomes. If at some pressure level the mixing ratio of water in the gas phase is equal to that in the deep interior, then that level is the cloud base. Alternately, if the mixing ratio of water in the condensed phase reaches that in the deep interior, then the surface of a liquid ocean will occur. We find that Neptune is both too warm (photospheric temperature too high) and too dry (mixing ratio of water in the deep interior too low) for liquid oceans to exist at present. To have a liquid ocean, Neptune's deep interior water to gas ratio would have to be higher than current models allow, and the density at 19 kbar would have to be ~ 0. 8 g/cm^ 3. Such a high density is inconsistent with gravitational data obtained during the Voyager flyby. As Neptune cools, the probability of a liquid ocean increases. Extrasolar "hot Neptunes," which presumably migrate inward toward their parent stars, cannot harbor liquid water oceans unless they have lost almost all of the hydrogen and helium from their deep interiors.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. Precipitation and {{atmospheric}} circulation changes {{in response to}} global warming have profound impacts on the environment for life but are highly uncertain. This study investigates fundamental mechanisms controlling these changes and relates them {{to the effects of}} sea surface temperature (SST) change, using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project simulations. The SST warming is decomposed into a spatially uniform SST increase (SUSI) and deviations from it. The SST pattern effect is found important in explaining both the multi-model ensemble mean distribution and inter-model variability of rainfall change over tropical oceans. In ensemble mean, the annual rainfall change follows a "warmer-getwetter" pattern, increasing where the SST warming exceeds the tropical mean, and vice versa. Two SST patterns stand out: an equatorial peak that anchors a local precipitation increase, and a meridional dipole mode with increased rainfall and weakened trade winds over the warmer hemisphere. These two modes of inter-model variability in SST account for up to one third of inter-model spread in rainfall projection. Tropospheric warming follows the <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat</b> in the tropics, and static stability increases globally. A diagnostic framework is developed based on a linear baroclinic model (LBM) of the atmosphere. The mean advection of stratification change (MASC) by climatological vertical motion, often neglected in interannual variability, is an important thermodynamic term for global warming. MASC and SST pattern effects are on the same order of magnitude in LBM simulations. Once MASC effect is included, LBM shows skills in reproducing general circulation model (GCM) results by prescribing latent heating diagnosed from the GCMs. Common to all GCMs, MASC causes both the Hadley and Walker circulation to slow down as articulated by previous studies. The weakening of the Walker circulation is robust across models as the SST pattern effect is weak. The Hadley circulation change, by contrast, is significantly affected by SST warming patterns. As a result, near and south of the equator, the Hadley circulation change is weak in the multi-model ensemble mean and subject to large inter-model variability due to the differences in SST warming patterns, explaining up to four fifth of the inter-model variability in changes of the overturning circulation...|$|E
40|$|In intense {{tropical}} cyclones, {{sea level}} pressures {{at the center}} are 50 – 100 hPa lower than outside the vortex, but only 10 – 30 hPa of the total pressure fall occurs inside the eye between the eyewall and the center. Warming by dry subsidence accounts for this {{fraction of the total}} hydrostatic pressure fall. Convection in the eyewall causes the warming by doing work on the eye to force the thermally indirect subsidence. Soundings inside hurricane eyes show warm and dry air aloft, separated by an inversion from cloudy air below. Dewpoint depressions at the inversion level, typically 850 – 500 hPa, are 10 – 30 K rather than the; 100 K that would occur if the air descended from tropopause level without dilution by the surrounding cloud. The observed temperature and dewpoint distribution above the inversion can, however, be derived by; 100 hPa of undilute dry subsidence from an initial sounding that is somewhat more stable than a <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat.</b> It is hypothesized that the air above the inversion has remained in the eye since it was enclosed when the eyewall formed and that it has subsided at most a few kilometers. The cause of the subsidence is the enclosed air’s being drawn downward toward the inversion level as the air below it flows outward into the eyewall. Shrinkage of the eye’s volume is more than adequate to supply the volume lost as dry air is incorporated into the eyewall or converted to moist air by turbulent mixing across the eye boundary. The moist air below the inversion is in thermodynamic contact with the sea surface. Its moisture derives from evaporation of seawater inside the eye, frictional inflow of moist air under the eyewall, and from moist downdrafts induced as condensate mixes into the eye. The moist air’s residence time in the eye is much shorter than that of the dry air above the inversion. The height of the inversion is determined by the balance between evaporation, inflow, and inward mixing on one hand and loss to the eyewall updrafts on the other. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of clouds dramatically alters the opacity and radiative transfer within Earth's atmosphere at both {{short and long}} wavelengths. Knowledge of cloud top and base is needed to estimate the Outgoing Long wave Radiation (OLR) to space and the net radiation at the surface from a given atmospheric profile. Satellite observations are required to provide the global perspective needed for climate. Cloud top pressure can be determined to some accuracy from spaceborne radiance measurements when cloud opacities are sufficiently large and cloud top temperatures are sufficiently low to readily them from the surface. Cloud base is particularly difficult to determine from space. The relatively small sensitivity of long wavelengths must be used to penetrate the clouds {{while at the same}} time providing sufficient sensitivity to detect the cloud base. We are studying the indirect sensitivity of radio occultation observations to clouds through their impact on the refractivity structure. The tradewind inversion is an excellent example where a very sharp refractivity structure coincides with the top of the tradewind cumulus and stratus clouds. In general, any cloud with sufficient IR opacity will have large transmissivity gradient at cloud top (base) which will result in large cooling (heating) which will create a thermal inversion at cloud top (base). Both liquid and ice clouds can reach this critical opacity. The thermal inversion and sharp change in specific humidity will cause a sharp change in the refractivity gradient which can be identified in the radio occultation results, particularly the signal amplitude. The occultations yield very accurate information on the height of such features. The heating at cloud base drives convection causing the air to follow a <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat</b> within the Cloud which further helps constrain the interpretation of the observations. The upward expansion of such opaque clouds due to convection may be an important mechanism supplying moisture into the upper troposphere.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} equable climates. The underlying physics of two mechanisms by which weak meridional temperature gradients might be maintained are studied. First, I examine the evolution of stratospheric dynamics and winter temperatures when the surface temperature gradient and tropospheric eddy energy decrease {{in order to assess}} whether large-scale conditions are more favorable for polar stratospheric cloud formation. Second, I examine whether the combination of high carbon dioxide and interactive, tropical cyclone dependent ocean mixing is sufficient to maintain a weak temperature gradient. I examine planetary wave generation, the energetics of the general circulation, and vertical wave propagation in a general circulation model with a resolved stratosphere forced with a weak surface temperature gradient. Compared to the present climate, transient eddy energy decreases, but stationary eddy energy does not. The polar tropopause rises, which supports a weaker temperature gradient in the lower stratosphere, a weaker stratospheric jet, and an increase in the wave activity vertically propagating into the stratosphere. (cont.) As a result, the residual mean circulation strengthens and temperatures in the polar stratosphere change little even when the surface temperature gradient is quite weak. Temperatures in the Arctic polar vortex remain much warmer than radiative equilibrium, inhibiting large-scale polar stratospheric cloud formation. The height of the extratropical tropopause rises and the tropospheric lapse rate follows a <b>moist</b> <b>adiabat</b> when surface temperatures are warm, suggesting convection plays a significant role in setting extratropical tropospheric stratification during warm climates. The second part of the thesis addresses the role of tropical cyclone induced mixing in the oceans' general circulation. I examine the sensitivity of the oceans' meridional overturning circulation and heat flux to the locations at which mixing occurs. When confined to the tropical Atlantic, a robust single-basin circulation can be maintained, but the Indian and Pacific become quiescent, cut off from the dynamics occurring in the Atlantic. Mixing isolated in the tropical Pacific, however, can support a global circulation by mechanically lifting deep fluid parcels formed in the Atlantic, raising their potential energy. (cont.) The oceans' total heat flux is found to be sensitive to mixing in the tropics, in both the Atlantic and the Pacific, and in the upper 400 meters of the ocean. Coupling mixing with a measure of tropical cyclone intensity and frequency creates a positive feedback between climate and the poleward energy flux. When combined with a parameterization of the background mixing that evolves with stratification, a warmer, less stratified ocean can support a stronger diapycnal mixing during warm climates with high loads of carbon dioxide. In these simulations, tropical cyclones are stronger and more frequent, providing an increased energy source for more vigorous mixing in the tropical oceans. Combined with a stratification-dependent mixing scheme, such mixing provides a sufficiently strong heat flux that is able to maintain weak sea surface temperature gradients. by Robert Lindsay Korty.
