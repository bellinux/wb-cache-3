There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He {{took one of the}} small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set {{it in front of the}} fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the alert.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} alloy type and casting procedure on the fracture strength (FS) of <b>metallic</b> <b>frameworks</b> for implant-supported fixed prostheses. Study design: Thirty three-unit structures for lower posterior bridges were waxed-up and randomly assigned to two groups (n= 15) according to alloy type and casting technique: Group 1 (C) : cobalt-chromium cast in a centrifugal machine (TS 1, Degussa-Hüls); Group 2 (T) : titanium cast in a pressure-differential device (Cyclarc II, Morita). Each structure was cemented onto two prefabricated abutments under a constant seating pressure. After 6 months of water aging, samples were loaded in a static universal testing machine (EFH/ 5 /FR, Microtest) until fracture. Axial compressive loads were applied at the central fossa of the pontics. FS data were recorded and surface topography of the fractured connectors was SEM-analyzed. A Chi-Square test was performed to assess the dependence of pores on the alloy type and casting procedure. ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) tests were run for FS comparisons (p< 0. 05). Results: One third of the C structures showed pores inside the fractured connectors. T frameworks demonstrated higher FS than that of C specimens exhibiting pores (p= 0. 025). C samples containing no pores recorded the greatest mean FS (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Fracture strength of <b>metallic</b> <b>frameworks</b> depended on the alloy type and casting procedure. Cobalt-chromium casts often registered pores inside the connectors, which strongly decreased the fracture resistance. An accurate casting of titanium with a pressure-differential system may result in the most predictable technique under the tested experimental conditions. © Medicina Oral S. L...|$|R

Perhaps {{the most}} {{fruitful}} source {{of these kinds}} of corruption which we have to guard against in recent times, is one which, nevertheless, comes in a [...] "questionable shape," [...] and of which {{it is not easy to}} determine the proper laws and limits; I mean the use of iron. The definition of the art of architecture, given in the first chapter, is independent of its materials: nevertheless, that art having been, up to the beginning of the present century, practised for the most part in clay, stone, or wood, it has resulted that the sense of proportion and the laws of structure have been based, the one altogether, the other in great part, on the necessities consequent on the employment of those materials; and that the entire or principal employment of <b>metallic</b> <b>framework</b> would, therefore, be generally felt as a departure from the first principles of the art. Abstractedly there appears no reason why iron should not be used as well as wood; and the time is probably near when a new system of architectural laws will be developed, adapted entirely to metallic construction. But I believe that the tendency of all present sympathy and association is to limit the idea of architecture to non-metallic work; and that not without reason. For architecture being in its perfection the earliest, as in its elements it is necessarily the first, of arts, will always precede, in any barbarous nation, the possession of the science necessary either for the obtaining or the management of iron. Its first existence and its earliest laws must, therefore, depend upon the use of materials accessible in quantity, and on the surface of the earth; that is to say, clay, wood, or stone: and as I think it cannot but be generally felt that one of the chief dignities of architecture is its historical use; and since the latter is partly dependent on consistency of style, it will be felt right to retain as far as may be, even in periods of more advanced science, the materials and principles of earlier ages.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of thermal and mechanical cycling alone or in combination, on the flexural strength of ceramic and <b>metallic</b> <b>frameworks</b> cast in gold alloy or titanium. Methods. <b>Metallic</b> <b>frameworks</b> (25 mm x 3 mm x 0. 5 mm) (N = 96) cast in gold alloy or commercial pure titanium (Ti cp) were obtained using acrylic templates. They were airborne particle-abraded with 150 mu m aluminum oxide at the central area of the frameworks (8 mm x 3 mm). Bonding agent and opaque were applied on the particle-abraded surfaces and the corresponding ceramic for each metal was fired onto them. The thickness of the ceramic layer was standardized by positioning the <b>frameworks</b> in a <b>metallic</b> template (height: I mm). The specimens from each ceramic-metal combination (N = 96, n = 12 per group) were randomly assigned into four experimental fatigue conditions, namely water storage at 37 degrees C for 24 h (control group), thermal cycling (3000 cycles, between 4 and 55 degrees C, dwell time: 10 s), mechanical cycling (20, 000 cycles under 10 N load, immersion in distilled water at 37 degrees C) and, thermal and mechanical cycling. A flexural strength test was performed in a universal testing machine (crosshead speed: 1. 5 mm/min). Data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey`s test (alpha = 0. 05). Results. The mean flexural strength values for the ceramic-gold alloy combination (55 +/- 7. 2 MPa) were significantly higher than those of the ceramic-Ti cp combination (32 +/- 6. 7 MPa) regardless of the fatigue conditions performed (p < 0. 05). Mechanical and thermo-mechanical fatigue decreased the flexural strength results significantly for both ceramic-gold alloy (52 +/- 6. 6 and 53 +/- 5. 6 MPa, respectively) and ceramic-Ti cp combinations (29 +/- 6. 8 and 29 +/- 6. 8 MPa, respectively) compared to the control group (58 +/- 7. 8 and 39 SA MPa, for gold and Ti cp, respectively) (p < 0. 05) (Tukey`s test). While ceramic-Ti cp combinations failed adhesively at the metal-opaque interface, gold alloy frameworks exhibited a residue of ceramic material on the surface in all experimental groups. Significance. Mechanical and thermo-mechanical fatigue conditions decreased the flexural strength values for both ceramic-gold alloy and ceramic-Ti cp combinations with the results being significantly lower for the latter in all experimental conditions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the bending moments, and compressive and tensile forces in implant-supported prostheses with three, four or five abutments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten Pd-Ag frameworks were tested over two master models with: 1) parallel vertical implants, and 2) tilted distal implants. Strain gauges were fixed on the abutments of each master model to measure the deformation when a static load of 50 N was applied on the cantilever (15 mm). The deformation values were measured when the <b>metallic</b> <b>frameworks</b> were tested over three, four or five abutments, and transformed into force and bending moment values. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons at 5 % level of significance. RESULTS: Abutment # 1 (adjacent to the cantilever) had the highest values of force and sagittal bending moment for all tests with three, four or five abutments. Independently {{from the number of}} abutments, axial force in abutment # 1 was higher in the vertical model than in the tilted model. Total moment was higher with three abutments than with four or five abutments.

In this work eight parent alloys, four pre-solder alloys and four post-solder alloys were subjected to differential thermal analysis in order to know the real solidus and liquidus temperatures. Some of the alloys obviously solidify in one time (the single –phased alloys and the alloys containing a major phase) and other in two times (the bi-phased alloys with similar fractions for the two constituents). In all cases the temperatures of fusion’s start and end, and the temperatures of solidification’s start and end, were successfully determined. This led to several refractoriness classes (post-solder < pre-solder < parent alloys), an order in good agreement with the conditions of soldering needed all along the prosthesis fabrication. A simple criterion based on the separation of the contents in elements more refractory than the base element and the contents in elements less refractory than the base element, has been established for the prevision of the solidus temperatures and of the liquidus temperatures of the alloys based on gold and containing, with not too far contents, the same elements as the alloys studied in this work...|$|R

30|$|Generally, stents are tubular {{implants}} to {{give the}} stenotic arteries or other non-vascular conduits a mechanical strength until the risk of fully closure be removed. There are two groups of stents, as stated earlier, self-expanding and balloon-expandable stents. Early stents were mostly fabricated from metals (until very recently); hence the first-generation of stents are called bare-metal stents. These permanent <b>metallic</b> <b>frameworks</b> are made of stainless steel and cobalt-chromium (CoCr) alloys for balloon-expandable, and nickel-titanium alloys (nitinol) for self-expanding stents (Grabow et al. 2010; Hanawa 2009). Although the revolution was considered as {{a turning point in}} the field of surgery, it had its own disadvantages of increased risk of thrombosis and restenosis. During stenting procedures, it is very likely for intravascular injuries to happen which lead to in-stent restenosis (ISR). ISR is the leading cause of artery blockage over time, and the loss of artery patency subsequently causes stent failure. Cascade events lead to the loss of the artery patency which are as follows: Dysfunctional vascular endothelium directly causes ISR, and this starts to happen when there is the lack of antithrombic and antiatherogenic properties. The artery dysfunction in suppressing vascular smooth muscle cells’ (VSMCs) proliferation makes VSMCs overgrow inward the blood vessel. This results in the blockage of the vessel overtime (Nuhn et al. 2017; Guildford et al. 2010). As early reports suggested (Fischman et al. 1994), in about 15 – 20 % of all implanted stents patients required re-intervention within 6 – 12  months after the first BMS implantation due to ISR. Generally, all kinds of stents have still been dealing with this problem. The rate of in-stent restenosis has been reduced after the arrival of new generations of stent family through recent advancement in this technology. However, the problem is still active. This review discusses different techniques for the stent design.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the opaque layer firing temperature and mechanical and thermal cycling on the flexural strength of a ceramic fused to commercial cobalt-chromium alloy (Co-Cr). The hypotheses were that higher opaque layer temperatures increase the metal/ceramic bond strength and that aging reduces the bond strength. Materials and Methods: <b>Metallic</b> <b>frameworks</b> (25 x 3 x 0. 5 mm(3); ISO 9693) (N = 60) were cast in Co-Cr and airborne-particle abraded (Al(2) O(3) : 150 mu m) at the central area of the frameworks (8 x 3 mm(2)) and divided into three groups (N = 20), according to the opaque layer firing temperature: Gr 1 (control) - 900 degrees C; Gr 2 - 950 degrees C; Gr 3 - 1000 degrees C. The opaque ceramic (Opaque, Vita Zahnfabrick, Bad Sackingen, Germany) was applied, and the glass ceramic (Vita Omega 900, Vita Zahnfabrick) was fired onto it (thickness: 1 mm). While half the specimens from each group were randomly tested without aging (water storage: 37 degrees C/ 24 hours), the other half were mechanically loaded (20, 000 cycles; 50 N load; distilled water at 37 degrees C) and thermocycled (3000 cycles; 5 degrees C to 55 degrees C, dwell time: 30 seconds). After the flexural strength test, failure types were noted. The data were analyzed using 2 -way ANOVA and Tukey`s test (alpha = 0. 05).

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in developing porous metals or metallic foams for functional and structural applications. The study of the physical and mechanical properties of porous metals is very important and helpful for their application. In this paper, a novel sintered multilayer wire mesh porous plate material (WMPPs) with a thickness of 0. 5 mm– 3 mm and a porosity of 10 – 35 % was prepared by winding, pressing, rolling, and subsequently vacuum sintering them. The pore size and total size distribution in the as-prepared samples were investigated using the bubble point method. The uniaxial tensile behavior of the WMPPs was investigated {{in terms of the}} sintering temperature, porosity, wire diameter, and manufacturing technology. The deformation process and the failure mechanism under the tensile press was also discussed based on the appearance of the fractures (SEM figures). The results indicated that the pore size and total size distribution were closely related to the raw material used and the sintering temperature. For the WMPPs prepared by the wire mesh, the pore structures were inerratic {{and the vast majority of}} pore size was less than 10 μm. On the other hand, for the WMPPs that were prepared by wire mesh and powder, the pore structures were irregular and the pore size ranged from 0 μm– 50 μm. The experimental data showed that the tensile strength of WMPPs is much higher than any other porous metals or metallic foams. Higher sintering temperatures led to coarser joints between wires and resulted in higher tensile strength. The sintering temperature decreased from 1330 °C to 1130 °C and the tensile strength decreased from 296 MPa to 164 MPa. Lower porosity means that there are more metallurgical joints and <b>metallic</b> <b>frameworks</b> resisting deformation per unit volume. Therefore, lower porosities exhibit higher tensile strength. An increase of porosity from 17. 14 % to 32. 5 % led to the decrease of the tensile strength by 90 MPa. The coarser wires led to a bigger contact area between the interconnecting wires, resulting in a stronger sintering neck that exhibited higher tensile strength. The wire diameter increased from 81 μm to 122 μm and the tensile strength increased from 296 MPa to 362 MPa. The fracture morphology showed that the wires experience necking deformation and ductile fracture...|$|R

This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} thermal- and mechanical-cycling on the shear bond strength of three low-fusing glassy matrix dental ceramics to commercial pure titanium (cpTi) when compared to conventional feldspathic ceramic fused to gold alloy. Methods. <b>Metallic</b> <b>frameworks</b> (diameter: 5 min, thickness: 4 mm) (N = 96, n = 12 per group) were cast in cpTi and gold alloy, airborne particle abraded with 150 mu m aluminum oxide.

Four experimental groups were formed; Gr 1 (control group) : Vita Omega 900 -Au-Pd alloy; Gr 2 : Ticeram-cpTi; Gr 3 : Super Porcelain Ti- 22 -cpTi and G 4 : Vita Titankeramik-cpTi. While half of the specimens from each ceramic-metal combination were randomly tested without aging (water storage at 37 C for 24 h only), the other half were first thermocycled (6000 cycles, between 5 and 55 C, dwell time: 13 s) and then mechanically loaded (20, 000 cycles under SON load, immersion in distilled water at 37 C). The ceramic-alloy interfaces were loaded under shear in a universal test machine (cross-head speed: 0. 5 mm/min) until failure occur-red. Failure types were noted and the interfaces of the representative fractured specimens from each group were examined with stereo microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). in an additional study (N = 16, n = 2 per group), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed from ceramic-alloy interfaces.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} thermal- and mechanical-cycling on the shear bond strength of three low-fusing glassy matrix dental ceramics to commercial pure titanium (cpTi) when compared to conventional feldspathic ceramic fused to gold alloy. METHODS: <b>Metallic</b> <b>frameworks</b> (diameter: 5 mm, thickness: 4 mm) (N= 96, n= 12 per group) were cast in cpTi and gold alloy, airborne particle abraded with 150 microm aluminum oxide. Low-fusing glassy matrix ceramics and a conventional feldspathic ceramic were fired onto the alloys (thickness: 4 mm). Four experimental groups were formed; Gr 1 (control group) : Vita Omega 900 -Au-Pd alloy; Gr 2 : Triceram-cpTi; Gr 3 : Super Porcelain Ti- 22 -cpTi and G 4 : Vita Titankeramik-cpTi. While half of the specimens from each ceramic-metal combination were randomly tested without aging (water storage at 37 degrees C for 24 h only), the other half were first thermocycled (6000 cycles, between 5 and 55 degrees C, dwell time: 13 s) and then mechanically loaded (20, 000 cycles under 50 N load, immersion in distilled water at 37 degrees C). The ceramic-alloy interfaces were loaded under shear in a universal test machine (crosshead speed: 0. 5 mm/min) until failure occurred. Failure types were noted and the interfaces of the representative fractured specimens from each group were examined with stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). In an additional study (N= 16, n= 2 per group), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed from ceramic-alloy interfaces. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test. RESULTS: Both ceramic-metal combinations (p 0. 05). Stereomicroscope images showed exclusively adhesive failure types at the opaque ceramic-cpTi interfacial zone with no presence of ceramic on the substrate surface but with a visible dark titanium oxide layer in Groups 2 - 4 except Gr 1 where remnants of bonder ceramic was visible. EDS analysis from the interfacial zone for cpTi-ceramic groups showed predominantly 34. 5 - 85. 1 % O(2) followed by 1. 1 - 36. 7 % Al and 0 - 36. 3 % Si except for Super Porcelain Ti- 22 where a small quantity of Ba (1. 4 - 8. 3 %), S (0. 7 %) and Sn (35. 3 %) was found.

40|$|Field-Assisted Solid-State Ion-Exchange (FASSIE) {{technique}} for doping silicate glasses with either transition metals or rare earths has been attracting much attention for its potential application in light waveguides, luminescent materials {{and for the}} possibility to realize systems in which formation of metal nanoclusters is controlled by suitable post-exchange techniques. In this <b>framework,</b> <b>metallic</b> films of either silver or gold are deposited onto soda-lime and borosilicate glasses by the rf-sputtering technique. Owing to an external electric field, metal ions diffuse into the glass replacing its alkali content at different values of processing temperature and electric field. The nanocomposites are then characterized by secondary ion mass and m-line spectrometries, optical absorption and transmission electron microscopy, indicating that the migration not only depends on the experimental conditions {{but also on the}} matrix and the chemical phenomena occurring at the metal/glass interface. For both transition metals, dark m-lines detection suggests that the samples may actually support guided modes, although the quality of the surface creates some problems for the prism coupling used in the measurements. In particular, the yet broaden lines seem to indicate two modes in the visible and one in the IR...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to deposit a thin layer of TiO 2 on a Co-Cr substrate, serving as a {{deactivation}} film protecting the metallic fitting surface. The crystalline structure and surface morphology of the film were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A scratch tester was used to examine the adhesion strength between the TiO 2 film and the Co-Cr substrate. The water contact angles and antifungal efficacy against C. albicans of the TiO 2 -deposited Co-Cr samples were investigated and further compared with those of uncoated Co-Cr substrates. The results indicated that a pure anatase microstructure and dense and smooth surface texture as well as strong binding to the underlying metallic surface were obtained. The originally hydrophobic Co-Cr alloy surface turned hydrophilic after TiO 2 film coating. Most importantly, the TiO 2 -coated surface showed a superior antifungal capability under UV-irradiation compared to those without TiO 2 coating. This work contains meaningful results for the development of a new <b>metallic</b> <b>framework</b> coating with improved hydrophilicity and antifungal properties...|$|E
40|$|Optical tomographic {{techniques}} {{are of particular}} importance in the medical imaging field, because these techniques can provide non-invasive diagnostic images. Using an en-face version of OCT, we have recently demonstrated real time thorough evaluation of quality of dental restorations. The microleakage at the interface between the metal infrastructure and the veneering part of the fixed partial prostheses (FPP's) are a common problem of aesthetic dentistry. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the capability of en-face optical coherence tomography (efOCT) to detect and analyze the possible defects at the interface of several FPP's. For validation, we used the method of laser microspectral analysis. The laser microspectral analysis is a punctual method of analysis, which allows to investigate small quantities of materials of around 0. 1 ng. This method allows to establish the content of atoms and molecules and to perform semi-quantitative and quantitative analysis. By this method it is possible to establish trace elements, i. e. with concentration of ppm (parts per million). The advantages of the OCT method consist in non-invasiveness and high resolution. En-face OCT investigations permit to visualize a more complex stratificated structure at the interface <b>metallic</b> <b>framework</b> /veneering material...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we report}} {{a simple and}} {{versatile}} technique for the preparation of novel macroporous three-dimensional gold and platinum films with regular submicron spherical holes arranged in a close-packed structure. Gold and platinum films were prepared by electrochemical reduction of gold or platinum complex ions dissolved in aqueous solution within the interstitial spaces between polystyrene latex spheres (500 or 750 nm in diameter) assembled on gold surfaces. The latex sphere templates were subsequently removed by dissolving in toluene to leave the structured metal films. Scanning electron microscopy of the gold and platinum films shows a well-formed regular three-dimensional, porous structure consisting of spherical voids arranged in a highly ordered face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. The spherical voids have the same diameter as the latex spheres used to form the template. Within the metal film the spherical voids are interconnected {{through a series of}} smaller pores. The <b>metallic</b> <b>framework</b> is dense, self-supporting, and free from defects. X-ray studies show the metal to be polycrystalline with a grain size smaller than 100 nm. The optical reflectivity of the macroporous gold and platinum films shows strong diffractive optical properties, which are potentially useful in many existing and emerging applications...|$|E
40|$|As excelentes propriedades mecânicas da zircônia fazem com que ela seja o {{material}} cerâmico de eleição para as coroas e próteses fixas posteriores. Porém, os problemas relacionados à fratura ainda persistem. A falta de suporte das infraestruturas às cerâmicas de revestimento é indicada como uma possível causa. O presente estudo visou avaliar através de testes laboratoriais se as infraestruturas metálicas e cerâmicas com o desenho convencional ou modificado apresentam diferença estatisticamente significante quanto à redução de complicações mecânicas, como fraturas e trincas na cerâmica de revestimento ao receberem cargas axiais nas cristas marginais de coroas de um primeiro molar inferior, por meio das seguintes hipóteses nulas: 1) a resposta à fadiga nas cristas marginais não aumentará a presença de danos nas coroas; 2) o desenho da I. E. não modificará a presença de danos nas coroas, independente do material utilizado. Quarenta coroas unitárias foram confeccionadas sobre preparos padronizados e divididos em 4 grupos: grupo I (infraestrutura convencional de Cobalto-Cromo); grupo II (infraestrutura modificada de Cobalto-Cromo); grupo III (infraestrutura convencional de Zircônia - IPS Emax ZirCAD); grupo IV (infraestrutura modificada de Zircônia - IPS Emax ZirCAD). Estas coroas foram submetidas ao teste de resistência à fadiga por meio da ciclagem dinâmica em água (106 ciclos ou até a fratura com carga variando de 30 - 300 N). Aplicou-se a carga inicial com o endentador cerâmico de dissilicato de lítio (IPS Emax Press) na crista marginal mesial, e após o término do ciclo, na distal, alternativamente. A ciclagem foi interrompida em intervalos de 125 mil ciclos a procura de danos com auxílio de estereomicroscopia. Ao final, as coroas fraturadas foram submetidas à microscopia eletrônica de varredura e as não fraturadas foram incluídas em resina epóxi e polidas sequencialmente para a análise dos danos. Cada corpo de prova recebeu escores de acordo com o tipo de falha apresentado. Utilizou-se o teste Kruskal-Wallis para verificar diferença estatística entre os grupos e o teste de Dunn para comparações múltiplas entre os grupos. Os resultados mostraram que há diferença estatisticamente significante entre os grupos, entretanto não houve diferença entre os grupos do mesmo sistema cerâmico. Concluiu-se que a hipótese 1 foi aceita e a 2 rejeitada. The excellent {{mechanical properties}} of zirconia {{make it to}} be the material of choice for ceramic crowns and posterior fixed prostheses. However, problems still exist related to the chippings. The lack of framework support to ceramic veneer is indicated as a possible cause. This study aimed to evaluate through laboratory tests if <b>metallic</b> and ceramic <b>framework</b> with conventional or modified design show statistical difference in reducing mechanical complications, such as chipping or fracture of the ceramic veneer on receiving axial loads in marginal ridges of the first molar inferior crowns through the following null hypotheses: 1) the response to fatigue in marginal ridges will not increase the presence of damage to the crowns; 2) framework`s design will not modify the presence of damage to the crowns, regardless of the material used. Forty crowns were manufactured on standardized preparations and divided into four groups: group I (conventional framework Cobalt-Chromium), group II (modified framework Cobalt-chromium), group III (conventional framework Zirconia - ZirCAD IPS Emax) and group IV (modified framework Zirconia - IPS Emax ZirCAD). These crowns were subjected to cyclic loading in a fatigue machine and submerged in water (1. 000. 000 cycles or until the fracture - load range at 30 - 300 N). The initial load was applied on the mesial marginal ridge with indenter ceramic Lithium disilicate (IPS Emax Press), and {{after the end of the}} cycle, the distal alternatively. The cycling was interrupted at a prescribed number of loading cycles (125. 000) and crowns were inspected for damage accumulation under a stereomicroscope. In the end, fractured crowns were submitted to scanning electron microscopy and crowns without fractures were embedded in epoxy resin and sequentially polished for the analysis of the damage. Each sample received scores according to the type of failure presented. Statistical analysis was carried out with Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple conparisons between groups were carried out with Dunn wed significant differences between groups, however there was no difference between the groups of the same ceramic systems. It was concluded that the first hypothesis was accepted and the second hypothesis was rejected...|$|R
