50|$|<b>Motesanib</b> (AMG 706) is an {{experimental}} drug candidate originally developed by Amgen but later {{investigated by the}} Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. It is an orally administered small molecule belonging to angiokinase inhibitor class which acts as an antagonist of VEGF receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and stem cell factor receptors. It is used as the phosphate salt <b>motesanib</b> diphosphate. After clinical trials in thyroid cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal stromal cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer, the drug was not found to show sufficient efficacy for further development, and development was abandoned by Takeda.|$|E
50|$|Some VEGFR antagonists (inhibitors) (for example lenvatinib, <b>motesanib)</b> {{are under}} {{investigation}} for treating various cancers. Pazopanib was approved for renal cell carcinoma in 2009. Regorafenib was approved for colorectal cancer in Sept 2012.|$|E
50|$|Angiokinase inhibitors {{are a new}} {{therapeutic}} {{target for}} the management of cancer. They inhibit tumour angiogenesis, one of the key processes leading to invasion and metastasis of solid tumours, by targeting receptor tyrosine kinases. Examples include nintedanib (BIBF 1120), afatinib (BIBW 2992) and <b>motesanib</b> (AMG 706).|$|E
50|$|<b>Motesanib</b> was {{originally}} investigated for effectiveness against advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with Phase II trials indicating an effectiveness comparable to bevacizumab {{when they were}} both used in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin. However a later and more detailed Phase III trial failed to show any benefit for the treatment of NSCLC. A second Phase III trial was started in 2012, which focused on patients from Asian backgrounds (performed on the bases of subgroup analysis) however this also failed to meet its primary endpoint.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Motesanib</b> is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and Kit receptors. In this report we examine the interaction between <b>motesanib</b> and radiation in vitro and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) xenograft models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro assays were done {{to assess the impact}} of <b>motesanib</b> on VEGFR 2 signaling pathways in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HNSCC lines grown as tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice were utilized to assess the in vivo activity of <b>motesanib</b> alone and in combination with radiation. RESULTS: <b>Motesanib</b> inhibited VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation in vitro, as well as VEGFR 2 kinase activity. Additionally, <b>motesanib</b> and fractionated radiation showed additive inhibitory effects on HUVEC proliferation. In vivo combination therapy with <b>motesanib</b> and radiation showed increased response compared with drug or radiation alone in UM-SCC 1 (P < 0. 002) and SCC- 1483 xenografts (P = 0. 001); however, the combination was not significantly more efficacious than radiation alone in UM-SCC 6 xenografts. Xenografts treated with <b>motesanib</b> showed a reduction of vessel penetration into tumor parenchyma, compared with control tumors. Furthermore, triple immunohistochemical staining for vasculature, proliferation, and hypoxia showed well-defined spatial relationships among these parameters in HNSCC xenografts. <b>Motesanib</b> significantly enhanced intratumoral hypoxia in the presence and absence of fractionated radiation. CONCLUSIONS: These studies identify a favorable interaction when combining radiation and <b>motesanib</b> in HNSCC models. The data presented suggest that <b>motesanib</b> reduces blood vessel penetration into tumors and thereby increases intratumoral hypoxia. These findings suggest that clinical investigations examining combinations of radiation and <b>motesanib</b> are warranted in HNSCC...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of <b>motesanib</b> when combined with docetaxel or paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In this open-label, dose-finding, phase 1 b study, patients received <b>motesanib</b> 50 or 125 -mg orally once daily (QD), beginning day 3 of cycle 1 of chemotherapy, continuously in combination with either paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 -day cycle (Arm A) or docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 21 -day cycle (Arm B). Dose escalation to <b>motesanib</b> 125 mg QD occurred if the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs, primary endpoint) was ≤ 33 %. If the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of <b>motesanib</b> was established in Arm B, additional patients could receive <b>motesanib</b> at the MTD plus docetaxel 75 mg/m(2). Forty-six patients were enrolled and 45 received ≥ 1 dose of <b>motesanib.</b> The incidence of DLTs was < 33 % in all cohorts; thus, <b>motesanib</b> 125 mg QD was established as the MTD. Seven patients (16 %) had grade 3 motesanib-related adverse events including cholecystitis (2 patients) and hypertension (2 patients). Pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>motesanib</b> were similar to those reported in previous studies. The objective response rate was 56 % among patients with measurable disease at baseline who received <b>motesanib</b> in combination with taxane-based chemotherapy. The addition of <b>motesanib</b> to either paclitaxel or docetaxel was generally tolerable up to the 125 -mg QD dose of <b>motesanib.</b> The objective response rate of 56 % suggests a potential benefit of <b>motesanib</b> in combination with taxane-based chemotherapy.

40|$|Background: Activating {{mutations}} in Kit {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} or the related platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Methods: This study investigated the activity of <b>motesanib,</b> an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3; PDGFR; and Kit, against primary activating Kit mutants and mutants associated with secondary resistance to imatinib.

METHODS: Patients with advanced GIST who failed imatinib mesylate after ≥ 8  weeks of treatment with ≥ 600  mg daily received <b>motesanib</b> 125  mg orally once daily continuously for 48  weeks or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression occurred. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective tumor response per RECIST and independent review. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP); objective response by (18) FDG-PET and by changes in tumor size and/or density (Choi criteria); pharmacokinetics and safety. RESULTS: In the patients evaluable for response (N =  102), the objective response rate was 3 %; 59 % of patients achieved stable disease, with 14 % achieving durable stable disease ≥ 24  weeks; 38 % had disease progression. Higher objective response rates were observed per (18) FDG-PET (N =  91) (30 %) and Choi criteria (41 %).

Treatment and enrollment {{of patients with}} squamous histology were permanently discontinued following higher early mortality and gross hemoptysis in those with squamous NSCLC who received <b>motesanib.</b> Enrollment of patients with nonsquamous histology was temporarily halted, but resumed following a protocol amendment (Scagliotti et al. J Clin Oncol. 2012; 30 : 2829 – 2836). Herein, we report data from the squamous cohort. MethodsPatients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent squamous NSCLC (without prior systemic therapy for advanced disease) received up to six 3 -week cycles of chemotherapy (carboplatin, area under the curve 6 mg/mL•min/paclitaxel, 200 mg/m 2) and were randomized 1 : 1 to receive <b>motesanib</b> 125 mg (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) once daily. The primary end point was overall survival. ResultsThree-hundred and sixty patients with squamous NSCLC were randomized (Arm A, n = 182; Arm B, n = 178) between July 2007 and November 2008. Twenty-three patients (13 %) in Arm A and 10 (6 %) in Arm B had fatal adverse events within the first 60 days of treatment.

Experimental Design: Placental growth factor was evaluated at baseline and study week 4 (after 3 weeks treatment) in an exploratory analysis of data from a randomized phase 2 study of <b>motesanib</b> 125 mg once daily plus carboplatin/paclitaxel and in a prespecified analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind phase 3 study of <b>motesanib</b> 125 mg once daily plus carboplatin/paclitaxel vs placebo plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (MONET 1). Associations between fold-change from baseline in placental growth factor and overall survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: In the phase 2 study, serum placental growth factor increased from baseline a mean 2. 8 -fold at study week 4. Patients with $ 2. 2 -fold change from baseline in placental growth factor (n = 18) had significantly longer overall survival than those with, 2. 2 -fold change (n = 19; 22. 9 vs 7. 9 months; hazard ratio, 0. 30; 95 % CI, 0. 12 – 0. 74; P = 0. 009). Consequently, placental growth factor was investigated as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in the phase 3 MONET 1 study.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{expression}} of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{is characteristic of}} differentiated thyroid cancer and is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and a poor clinical outcome. <b>Motesanib</b> diphosphate (AMG 706) is a novel oral inhibitor of VEGF receptors, platelet-derived growth-factor receptor, and KIT. METHODS: In an open-label, single-group, phase 2 study, we treated 93 patients who had progressive, locally advanced or metastatic, radioiodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer with 125 mg of <b>motesanib</b> diphosphate, administered orally once daily. The primary end point was an objective response as assessed by an independent radiographic review. Additional end points included {{the duration of the}} response, progression-free survival, safety, and changes in serum thyroglobulin concentration. RESULTS: Of the 93 patients, 57 (61 %) had papillary thyroid carcinoma. The objective response rate was 14 %. Stable disease was achieved in 67 % of the patients, and stable disease was maintained for 24 weeks or longer in 35 %; 8 % had progressive disease as the best response. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median duration of the response was 32 weeks (the lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval [CI] was 24; the upper limit could not be estimated because of an insufficient number of events); the estimate of median progression-free survival was 40 weeks (95 % CI, 32 to 50). Among the 75 patients in whom thyroglobulin analysis was performed, 81 % had decreased serum thyroglobulin concentrations during treatment, as compared with baseline levels. The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (in 59 % of the patients), hypertension (56 %), fatigue (46 %), and weight loss (40 %). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Motesanib</b> diphosphate can induce partial responses in patients with advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer that is progressive.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of multidrug resistance (MDR) has attenuated {{the efficacy of}} anticancer drugs {{and the possibility of}} successful cancer chemotherapy. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play an essential role in mediating MDR in cancer cells by increasing efflux of drugs from cancer cells, hence reducing the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs. Interestingly, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as AST 1306, lapatinib, linsitinib, masitinib, <b>motesanib,</b> nilotinib, telatinib and WHI-P 154, have been found to have the capability to overcome anticancer drug resistance by inhibiting ABC transporters in recent years.

40|$|A key goal of early-phase {{studies of}} investigational can-cer {{therapeutics}} is {{an assessment of}} the treatment’s tox-icity [1].

40|$|Neovascularization is {{a crucial}} {{component}} of cancer cell growth and progression. Cancer cells are dependent on blood vessels for growth and metastases. Angiogenesis is finely balanced by pro- and anti-angiogenetic factors. Under normal conditions, the balance leans toward the anti-angiogenetic phenotype. Hypoxia is the major element of the angiogenetic switch, which leads to overexpression of angiogenetic factors, mostly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), favoring new vessel formation. VEGF appears {{to be one of}} the key players, and therefore current anti-angiogenetic strategies are mainly aimed at targeting the VEGF pathway. A variety of approaches to targeting VEGF and its signaling system have been developed: anti-VEGF antibodies such as bevacizumab (for metastatic colorectal, breast, lung and renal cancers) and small molecules like sunitinib (for renal cancers and gastrointestinal stromal tumors), sorafenib (for hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma), pazopanib and <b>motesanib</b> (for metastatic breast cancer) ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Recently, {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitors (TKIs) {{have emerged as}} {{a new class of}} anticancer therapy. Although generally considered less toxic than cytotoxic chemotherapy, TKIs do cause significant side effects including fatigue and hypertension. In addition, thyroid dysfunction is a well-known adverse effect of TKI. AREAS COVERED: This review provides a comprehensive assessment of TKI-induced thyroid dysfunctions by sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, vandetanib, axitinib, <b>motesanib</b> and tivozanib. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms that result in this toxicity, the clinical impact of thyroid dysfunction in these patients and the controversies regarding treatment with thyroid hormone (TH) therapy are evaluated. EXPERT OPINION: Detection of TKI-induced thyroid dysfunction requires routine monitoring of thyroid function and may necessitate treatment. Potential benefits in developing thyroid dysfunction and potential harm in treating it necessitate controlled studies. Finally, if treatment is pursued, appropriate dosing and timing of TH replacement will require prospective clinical evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Resistance {{mechanisms}} against antiangiogenic {{drugs are}} unclear. Here, we correlated the antitumor and antivascular properties of five different antiangiogenic {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} inhibitors (RTKIs) (<b>motesanib,</b> pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, vatalanib) with their intratumoral distribution data obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). In the first mouse model, only sunitinib exhibited broad-spectrum antivascular and antitumor activities by simultaneously suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 (VEGFR 2) and desmin expression, and by increasing intratumoral hypoxia and inhibiting both tumor growth and vascularisation significantly. Importantly, the highest and most homogeneous intratumoral drug concentrations {{have been found in}} sunitinib-treated animals. In another animal model, where - in contrast to the first model - vatalanib was detectable at homogeneously high intratumoral concentrations, the drug significantly reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis. In conclusion, the tumor tissue penetration and thus the antiangiogenic and antitumor potential of antiangiogenic RTKIs vary among the tumor models and our study demonstrates the potential of MALDI-MSI to predict the efficacy of unlabelled small molecule antiangiogenic drugs in malignant tissue. Our approach is thus a major technical and preclinical advance demonstrating that primary resistance to angiogenesis inhibitors involves limited tumor tissue drug penetration. We also conclude that MALDI-MSI may significantly contribute to the improvement of antivascular cancer therapies...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades {{significant}} progresses {{have been made in}} the field of cancer therapy, among all the so-called targeted therapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are example of these new strategy and they have been used in many solid and hematologic tumors. TKIs are small molecules that inhibit tyrosine kinases, enzymes responsible for the activation of signal transduction cascades, through phosphorylation of various proteins. TKIs have been used in advanced thyroid cancer refractory to conventional treatment. So far, in MTC patients TKIs (<b>motesanib,</b> sunitinib, vandetanib, sorafenib, cabozantinib, axitinib) have determined an overall objective response (stable disease and partial response) ranging 45 - 92 % while in DTC patients between 49 - 82 %. From 2005 to 2010 we participated in 5 international randomized trials, double-blind or in a single arm, using 5 different TKIs. We enrolled 21 patients with MTC patients and 10 with DTC. Among patients with MTC, taking the drug and not the placebo, we observed 38 % of stable disease and 22 % of partial response. In DTC patients we had nearly 50 % of objective response. In general, limitations using TKIs are represented by adverse reactions, principally dermatological, and resistance. In conclusion, TKIs seem to be a promising class of drugs to treat advanced thyroid cancer, refractory to conventional treatment with quite manageable side effects...|$|E

The need for effective systemic therapies combined with high incidence of driver mutations and overexpression of molecular pathways make refractory thyroid cancer an ideal candidate for treatment with novel agents. Multikinase inhibitors have caused a paradigm shift {{in the treatment of}} patients with advanced iodine-refractory thyroid cancer. These agents have shown to be the most effective systemic therapy for this disease not only causing prolonged responses but also improving survival. The activity of these agents inhibiting several pathways simultaneously, such as rearranged during transfection protooncogene, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and angiogenesis, can probably explain the effectiveness in controlling the progression of this malignancy. Several of these agents are currently on clinical studies in patients with differentiated and medullary thyroid cancer {{and most of them are}} showing promising clinical activity. With the approval of vandetanib for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer, a new era in the management of this disease has begun. The molecular rationale for the use of these drugs for thyroid cancer is discussed as well as their promising clinical results.

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factors}} (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) are {{involved}} in key cellular functions and cancerogenesis. Nowadays FGFR and their ligands {{are one of the}} most investigated markers in oncology and targets for specific therapy. There are a lot of clinical trials in on- cology include drugs with anti-FGFR activities. The most of these drugs are tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. When we say about therapeutic effects on the FGFR signaling pathway, we say about opportunity not only block the ligands and FGFRs, but the under- lying molecular and signaling pathways activated by FGFRs. Nowadays the number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors selectively blocking FGFRs is extremely small. Typically, tyrosine kinase inhibitors can block a wide range of targets. Some of these inhibitors have entered in clinical practice in the treatment of metastatic tumors of different localizations, others are in clinical trials. On August 2014, 74 studies investigating inhibitors of FGFRs are registered on clinicaltrials. gov. A number of marketed drugs at high concentrations also has the ability to inhibit FGFR – sorafenib, vandetanib, <b>motesanib,</b> however, increasing the concentration of these drugs is associated with severe toxicity of treat- ment. In the recommended therapeutic concentrations, adequate blocking FGFR tyrosine kinase domain is doubtful. The review paid atten- tion to such drugs as pazopanib, nintedanib, cediranib, brivanib, dovitinib, ponatinib. We showed the results of treatment with inhibitors of FGFR in different cancers such as breast cancer, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, gastric cancer, thyroid cancer, lung cancer, ovarian  cancer. Despite the fact that anti-FGFR therapy are at an early stage of clinical investigation, some difficulties in implementing this thera- peutic approach have been seen, such as high toxicity, not validated targets, the need for patient selection, depending on the activity of FGF– FGFR pathway, as well as mutations in genes of downstream molecular signaling pathways. In summary in the article we reviewed relevant literature to identify current status, difficulties and future perspectives in development of anti- FGFR drugs. In this article, we review FGFR signaling and describe the therapeutic intervention in patients with solid tumors.   </div...|$|E
