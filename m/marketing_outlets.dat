Primary data were collected from 120 farmers and 37 wheat traders using structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and Econometrics models were used to analyze the collected data. Results show that the main wheat value chain actors in the study area are input suppliers, farmers/producers, assemblers, wholesalers, processors, retailers, commission agents and cooperatives. Market concentration ratio at district level was 88. 7 % which indicated oligopolistic market structure. The result of 2 SLS indicated that size of landholding, livestock ownership, family size and quantity of wheat produced influences amount of wheat supplied to market significantly. The multinomial logit model result indicated that the likelihood to choose wholesalers <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was significantly influenced by frequency of extension contact, distance from market place, own price of the commodity and membership to cooperative compared to accessing assemblers wheat <b>market</b> <b>outlet.</b> The likelihood of accessing cooperative wheat <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was significantly influenced by price given to the commodity and distance from market place compared to accessing assembler <b>market</b> <b>outlet.</b> The likelihood of accessing processors <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was significantly influenced by price of commodity, ownership of transportation facilities and distance of processors from production place.

Own elasticities and cross-price elasticities are used to obtain insights into the effectiveness and implications of new policy measures.

Four separate product-specific models where also estimated and represent consumers’ choice of a retail <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> to purchase a particular tobacco product. In contrast to the joint product-outlet choice model, the two stage budgeting model rests {{on the assumption that}} consumers first choose a tobacco product, and then choose where to purchase it. In addition to estimating overall demand for the four tobacco products, models are estimated for tobacco products from three specific outlets: grocery stores, drug stores, and convenience stores.
