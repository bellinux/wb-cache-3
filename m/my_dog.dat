Matthew began creating the melody and track, and I started working on the lyrics. I remember staying in bed for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric.

25|$|Sometimes, the {{structure}} of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem of sentiment analysis is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and stop-word substitution (compare THEY would not let <b>my</b> <b>dog</b> stay in this hotel vs I would not let <b>my</b> <b>dog</b> stay in this hotel). To address this issue a number of rule-based and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to sentiment analysis, including defeasible logic programming. Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality of sentiment in open domain setting.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{contains}} many intentional {{references to the}} 1939 musical film The Wizard of Oz. The ship's captain is named after the film's lyricist Yip Harburg, and the ballroom singer, Almira Gulch, after The Wizard of Oz character who is the analog for the Wicked Witch of the West. Her band is The Lollipop Guild, {{a reference to a}} section of the song [...] "Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead", while Mulder's wrecked ship is called the Lady Garland, after Judy Garland. The final scene of [...] "Triangle", which features Mulder in bed telling his friends and co-workers that he saw them in his reverie, bears a striking resemblance to the closing scene of Oz. Because of this, the scene was called [...] "obviously derivative" [...] by one reviewer. Further, when Mulder mentions that Skinner was with him in 1939, which is the year The Wizard of Oz was released, Skinner replies [...] "with <b>my</b> <b>dog</b> Toto", and Scully tells him [...] "there's no place like home".|$|E

[...] In his 1962 book, Six Crises (the Fund crisis being one of the six), he would object to the term, [...] "as though the mention of <b>my</b> <b>dog</b> {{was the only thing that}} saved my political career." [...] Nixon preferred to call the address [...] "the Fund speech," [...] and made it required reading for his speechwriters. As time passed, the Checkers speech became denigrated, and Nixon biographer Earl Mazo suggested that much of the attitude of [...] "I don't like Nixon, but I don't know why," [...] which contributed to the failure of his 1960 presidential run, can be traced to the Checkers speech. Other commentators suggested that had he not made the Checkers speech, Nixon might have won in 1960. Nixon retorted that without the Checkers speech, he would not have been around to run in 1960.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Stop or <b>My</b> <b>Dog</b> Will Shoot" [...] (season 18, 2007), Santa's Little Helper {{becomes a}} local hero after finding a lost Homer, and the Simpsons decide to enroll {{him in the}} Animal Police Academy. However, his new crime-fighting job makes him jaded and one day at home he bites Bart. The Simpsons must {{therefore}} send the dog away to live with officer Lou. However, he gets to return after saving Bart from a toxic smoke cloud at school and then leaving the police force. In [...] "How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?" [...] (season 22, 2010), after Santa's Little Helper devours a pigeon with a broken leg that Bart was nursing, Bart gets mad at the dog and is unable to forgive him. The Simpsons therefore give him away to an ostrich farm. There, Bart says goodbye to him and explains that he should never, ever devour a bird. Bart then gets into a fight with an angry ostrich. After remembering that {{he was told that}} it's wrong to kill birds, he ceases to aid Bart in the fight, confused at his own loyalty (for Bart's sake or his orders) leaving Bart to strangle the ostrich to death. Bart then realizes that he could not help killing the pigeon and apologizes. Afterwards, the family goes back home with the dog.|$|E
500|$|Willie Dixon's [...] "The Red Rooster"/"Little Red Rooster" [...] uses {{elements}} from several earlier blues songs. [...] The theme reflects {{early twentieth century}} folk beliefs in the American South that a rooster contributes to peace in the barnyard. The image of the rooster appears in several blues songs from the 1920s and 1930s, with two particular songs identified as precursors. [...] Influential Delta blues musician Charlie Patton's 1929 [...] "Banty Rooster Blues" [...] contains the verses [...] "What you want with a rooster, he won't crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "I know <b>my</b> <b>dog</b> anywhere I hear him bark", which are analogous to Dixon's [...] "I have a little red rooster, too lazy to crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "Oh the dogs begin to bark". Some of the lyrics to Memphis Minnie's 1936 acoustic combo blues [...] "If You See My Rooster (Please Run Him Home)" [...] are also similar. [...] For example, she sings [...] "If you see my rooster, please run 'im on back home", while Dixon uses [...] "If you see my little red rooster, please drive 'im home". [...] Additionally, similar melody lines are found in both songs. [...] For her recording, Memphis Minnie does a full-throated imitation of a rooster's crow. Mimicking animal sounds later became a feature of several recordings of [...] "Little Red Rooster".|$|E

500|$|Tony Blair {{recorded}} his {{part for the}} episode in April 2003, in ten minutes at Downing Street. Blair was sent the script {{early on in the}} writing process, and it took eight months of negotiation between Fox and Blair's director of communications Alastair Campbell before Blair could appear as a guest star. In the original script, Blair was supposed to welcome the Simpsons to the United Kingdom [...] "with a garland of 'genuine Newcastle coal' and hand [...] a complimentary Corgi", but Campbell had them changed, as Blair [...] "made it very clear that he was only interested in doing the show if he could promote tourism in Britain". The show's staff did not know whether Blair would actually record his lines until showrunner Al Jean and his wife were in London promoting the 300th episode of The Simpsons. They received a call stating: [...] "If you go over to Downing Street tomorrow and can promise to get the recording done in 15 minutes, then the Prime Minister will do it". Jean was [...] "so nervous, it was ridiculous" [...] when he met Blair, an event he has cited as [...] "one of the most fantastic moments of his life". Blair was the top choice to guest star in the episode, but the staff did not think they {{had a chance to get}} him to appear. Blair is the only head of government to guest star in the show, with Rudy Giuliani (who played himself in the episode [...] "Stop! Or <b>My</b> <b>Dog</b> Will Shoot") the only other politician to guest star.|$|E
500|$|Jason {{has also}} been {{referenced}} by several television shows. The stop motion animated television show Robot Chicken features Jason in three of its comedy sketches. In episode seventeen, [...] "", the mystery-solving teenagers from Scooby-Doo arrive at Camp Crystal Lake to investigate the Jason Voorhees murders, and are killed off one by one. Velma is the only survivor, and in typical Scooby-Doo fashion, she rips off Jason's mask to reveal his true identity: Old Man Phillips. In episode nineteen, [...] "That Hurts Me", Jason reappears, this time as a housemate of [...] "Horror Movie Big Brother", alongside other famous slasher movie killers such as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, Pinhead, and Ghostface. Three years later, in episode sixty-two, Jason is shown on the days before and after a typical Friday the 13th. Jason is spoofed in the season five episode of Family Guy entitled [...] "It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One". The so-called [...] "Mr. Voorhees" [...] explains to Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa how happy he is to see local wildlife return following the cleanup and rejuvenation of Lake Quahog. He reappears later in the episode as {{the manager of the}} [...] "Britches and Hose" [...] clothing store. As opposed to his monstrous personality in the films, Jason is depicted here as polite and articulate, albeit still a psychopath; he murders random swimmers and threatens to kill his employee if she screws up. In an episode of The Simpsons, Jason appears in a Halloween episode sitting on the couch with Freddy Krueger waiting for the family to arrive. When Freddy asks where the family is, Jason responds, [...] "Ehh, whaddya gonna do?" [...] and turns the TV on. He also appears in The Simpsons episode [...] "Stop, or <b>My</b> <b>Dog</b> Will Shoot!", alongside Pinhead, menacing Bart in a fantasy sequence. The South Park episodes [...] "Imaginationland EpisodeII" [...] and [...] "III" [...] feature Jason among an assortment of other villains and monsters as an inhabitant of the [...] "bad side" [...] of Imaginationland, a world populated by fictional characters. This version of Jason has an effeminate voice and describes the removal of Strawberry Shortcake's eyeball as [...] "super hardcore". Experimental pop artist Eric Millikin created a large mosaic portrait of Jason Voorhees out of Halloween candy and spiders as part of his [...] "Totally Sweet" [...] series in 2013.|$|E
