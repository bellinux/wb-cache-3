50|$|The renamed Litton's Weekend Adventure {{launched}} on September 3, 2011 with six series: Jack Hanna's Wild Countdown, Ocean Mysteries with Jeff Corwin, Born to Explore with Richard Wiese, Culture Click, Everyday Health and Food for Thought with Claire Thomas (originally titled The Delicious Adventures of Claire Thomas {{prior to its}} debut). Two other series were also initially announced to be in development: the environment-focused Agents of Change (from producer Mark Koops) and Earth: Angry Planet; however, neither show was picked up to series. When the block debuted, Litton's Weekend Adventure became the first Saturday <b>morning</b> block <b>to</b> present <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its programs in high definition. On May 2, 2012, ABC and Litton reached an agreement to broadcast Weekend Adventure worldwide on the American Forces Network, beginning that June.|$|R
50|$|Thousands {{packed the}} church in Vancouver, British Columbia on the Wednesday evening of January 17, 2001, and again on the next <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> mourn. <b>All</b> four <b>of</b> Michael's 2ge+her band/cast members were in {{attendance}} for both services. Also in attendance was David Hasselhoff, who gave the eulogy and dedicated a song at the Wednesday services. Both services included a 75-member choir from Michael's high school, Notre Dame Regional Secondary School. Among the items displayed were pictures of Michael being blessed by the Pope, a giant poster of Michael with a teddy bear, and a massive set of wreaths and flowers. During the Thursday services, a huge procession of limousines, cars, and firetrucks accompanied Michael's casket {{through the streets of}} Greater Vancouver. He was buried at Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby Greater Vancouver Regional District British Columbia, Canada.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{attitude}} of Comrade Waller,' said Psmith, on being {{informed of the}} change, 'is reassuring. I may now think of my own troubles. Comrade Bristow has blown into the office today in patent leather boots with white kid uppers, as I believe the technical term is. Add to {{that the fact that}} he is still wearing the satin tie, the waistcoat, and the ring, and you will understand why I have definitely decided this <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> abandon <b>all</b> hope <b>of</b> his reform. Henceforth my services, for what they are worth, are at the disposal of Comrade Bickersdyke. My time from now onward is his. He shall have the full educative value of my exclusive attention. I give Comrade Bristow up. Made straight for the corner flag, you understand,' he added, as Mr Rossiter emerged from his lair, 'and centred, and Sandy Turnbull headed a beautiful goal. I was just telling Jackson about the match against Blackburn Rovers,' he said to Mr Rossiter.|$|R
5000|$|Pilots in {{the early}} days of {{aviation}} relied on dead reckoning to find out where they were flying, which proved difficult or impossible at night or in bad weather. [...] A 1925 United States Post Office study found that 76% of its forced landings were due to weather, which highlighted the early need for a system to facilitate blind landings. Early suggestions at addressing the problem ranged from using primitive radio signals [...] to placing emergency landing strips periodically near major highways. Experiences from the Second World War called more attention to the problem. Bombers based in Britain would sometimes return to their home bases {{in the early}} <b>morning</b> hours <b>to</b> find <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their landing sites completely fogged in, which resulted in the senseless loss of airframes and aircrews. In the post-war period, aviation experts knew that there would be benefits to both military and civilian flyers, as military missions would be made possible in all conditions and airlines could avoid the wasteful and expensive practice of diverting away from fogged in airports.|$|R
