Considerations include existing condition, rarity, and evidentiary and market values. With non-paper formats, the availability of equipment to access the information will be a factor (for example, playback equipment for audio-visual materials, or <b>microform</b> <b>readers).</b> An institution should determine how many, if any, other repositories hold the material, and consider coordinating efforts with those that do.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{practical}} {{experience of the}} author at ISRO Satellite Centre Library the paper highlights the predominant features and specifications for <b>microform</b> <b>readers</b> and reader-printers, pitfalls in acquiring micrographics equipment. Provides a checklist for choosing appropriate user aid. Enumerates procedure to buy suitable equipment for small and medium size libraries. Finally suggests unified professional efforts in setting up of micrographics facilities to make microforms more popular among user community...|$|E

It also summarizes how feaeral funds have been used to help the states meet user needs through the strengthening of MURLs and metropolitan public libraries which serve as national or regional resource centers. Analyses of the FY 1987 annual reports show that the MURLs continued to strengthen library collections and provide interlibrary loan services. The use of various technologies in providing public library service continued to grow with the purchase of compact disk recordings and videotapes, and with the use of computers, <b>microform</b> <b>readers</b> and printers, videotap...|$|E

The material for the course was made available in hardcopy and was also reduced 150 x onto a 4 x 6 inch microfiche. Four <b>microform</b> <b>readers</b> were made available for on-campus use. The motivation for sustained use of microforms in preference to hardcopy was the perceived value of the complete information. Microform use patterns were compared with hardcopy use patterns over the 10 -week period of the course. The major result was the determination that microforms can be used to support a course which requires that information must be abstracted and retained by the student in order to pass the course, although the additional demands made on some students by the machine presentation were observed to offset the value of the complete information unit...|$|E
