50|$|Brazilian salmon <b>pink</b> <b>tarantulas</b> {{are very}} popular in captivity; this is {{for a number of}} reasons. Their appearance, both in size and color, makes them desirable. Their {{willingness}} to sit out in the open also makes them popular. They are also a cheaper option than a T. blondi; L. parahybana reproduces in large numbers {{to the point that the}} price of spiderlings drops dramatically.|$|R

50|$|<b>Mexican</b> <b>pink</b> {{became known}} as such {{through the efforts of}} the journalist, painter, {{cartoonist}} and designer fashion Ramón Valdiosera. In the mid-1940s, Valdiosera made a long research trip to Mexico where he made contact with different ethnic groups and collected suits and dresses typical of different regions. Interested in traditional Mexican clothing adapt to contemporary fashion, on his return to Mexico City set up a sewing workshop and there devoted himself to move the fabrics, colors and traditional styles to sophisticated forms of fashion at that time.|$|R
50|$|When threatened, the {{tarantula}} {{will raise}} its {{legs in the}} air, {{as well as the}} front of its body, in order to deter predators. If the attacker continues to attack, the tarantula will bite.The Brazilian salmon <b>pink</b> <b>tarantula</b> is capable of delivering a painful bite. They are known to bite only when provoked, and even then, this is a last resort. Bites from an L. parahybana are mechanically dangerous; fangs can be up to an inch long. Some sites claim that a bite from a salmon pink {{is similar to that of}} a cat.However, rather than biting, they choose to flick urticating hairs from a patch on their abdomen; these hairs are covered in barbs which irritate the skin and put off potential predators. These hairs are extremely irritating; in the hobby, they are considered to be one of the more painful hair types. If the hairs are thrown into the eyes, blindness can occur.|$|R
