40|$|International audienceModern mines {{have become}} very stealthy. Sonar systems, {{designed}} to detect them, will now also hand over to the classification process many more small non-mine bottom objects, with <b>mine-like</b> <b>target</b> strength. Hence, the classification process is now called upon much more often {{than it was in}} the past, hereby increasing its share in the overall mine hunting effort. In order to evaluate the global performance of the mine hunting operation, the performance of the classification process and especially the shadow classification process has to be evaluated. This performance is described by COC (Classification Operational Characteristics) curves which give the probability of classification (Pc) and the probability of false classification (Pfc) as functions of sonar characteristics and operational conditions. The paper describes the operational incidence of this new approach for shadow classification performance evaluation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSonar systems, {{designed}} to detect stealthy mines, will now also hand {{over to the}} classification process many more small non-mine bottom objects (NOMBO), with <b>mine-like</b> <b>target</b> strength. In these conditions the global search effort is transferred to the classification function by {{reducing the number of}} pointless false detection alarms, i. e. by classifying a NOMBO as a non mine like contact (NON MILCO). This paper then aims at giving demonstrative results and means to perform automatic classification while keeping low false classification rate. The considered method is divided into two steps : a first coarse long range pre-classification only provides relevant mine like echoes (MILEC) to be then processed by a shorter range classification. The false alarm reduction of the first step is performed with a long range detection sonar by analysing the echo signal structure and its evolution given the sonar motion. Then, the second step is image based classification and needs a high frequency classification sonar to provide a more detailed acoustic image of the object (especially concerning its cast shadow shape) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new subband-based {{classification}} scheme is developed for classifying underwater mines and <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets</b> from the acoustic backscattered signals. The system {{consists of a}} feature extractor using wavelet packets in conjunction with linear predictive coding (LPC), a feature selec-tion scheme, and a backpropagation neural-network classifier. The data set {{used for this study}} consists of the backscattered signals from six different objects: two <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets</b> and four nontargets for several aspect angles. Simulation results on ten different noisy realizations and for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 12 dB are presented. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the classifier generated based on these results demon-strated excellent classification performance of the system. The generalization ability of the trained network was demonstrated by computing the error and classification rate statistics on a large data set. A multiaspect fusion scheme was also adopted in order to further improve the classification performance.

40|$|Abstract—A data-adaptive {{algorithm}} is presented for {{the selection of}} the basis functions and training data used in classifier design with application to sensing <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets</b> with a side-scan sonar. Automatic detection of <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets</b> using side-scan sonar imagery is complicated by the variability of the target, clutter, and background signatures. Specifically, the strong dependence of the data on environmental conditions vitiates the assumption that one may perform a priori algorithm training using separate side-scan sonar data collected previously. In this paper, a novel active-learning {{algorithm is}} developed based on kernel classifiers with the goal of enhancing detection/classification of mines without requiring an a priori training set. It is assumed that divers and/or unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) may be used to determine the binary labels (target/clutter) of a small number of signatures from a given side-scan collection. These sets of signatures and associated labels are then used to train a kernel-based algorithm with which the remaining side-scan signatures are classified. Information-theoretic concepts are used to adaptively construct the form of the kernel classifier and to determine which signatures and associated labels would be most informative in the context of algorithm training. Using measured side-looking sonar data, the authors demonstrate that the number of signatures for which labels are required (via diver/UUV) is often small relative to the total number of potential targets in a given image. This procedure designs the detection/classification algorithm on the observed data itself without requiring a priori training data and also allows adaptation as environmental conditions change.

40|$|AbstractLandmine is an {{explosive}} apparatus hidden in {{or on the}} ground, which blows up when a person or vehicle passes over it. Egypt {{is one of the}} countries suffering due to the unexploded ordnance (UXO). Around 2 million UXO are present in the Egyptian soil especially at Al-Alameen province, north of the western desert. Detection of buried landmines is a problem of military and humanitarian importance. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a powerful and non-destructive geophysical approach {{with a wide range of}} advantages in the field of landmine inspection. In the present paper, we apply different simulation models with Vivaldi antenna and <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets</b> by using the CST Microwave studio program. The field work is carried out by using a GPR device of model SIR 2000 from GSSI (Geophysical Survey Systems Incorporation) connected to 900 MHz antenna where the targets were buried in sand soil. Depending on the fact that the receiving powers (reflected, refracted and scattered) from the different materials are different, we study the spectral power densities for the received power from the different targets. The techniques used in this study are: direct fast Fourier transform, short time Fourier transform (spectrogram), wavelets transform and denoising techniques. Our results ought to be considered as finger prints for different scanned targets during this work. So we can discriminate between landmines and <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} eighties the sonar {{performance}} model ALMOST of TNO Defence, Security and Safety is under development. For active detection performance first a point target with one Target Strength (TS) value dependent on aspect angle was used, based on measurements or other sources. Within the Torpedo Defence System Test Bed (TDSTB), developed at TNO, with ALMOST as the acoustic kernel, {{there is a}} demand for target echo (TS) modelling for ships, wakes, and mine-like targets. Therefore modelling of extended (nonpoint) targets was investigated. The method is based on coherent scattering from a 3 -D surface constituted from dense pixels representing the specific {{size and shape of}} the target. Additionally normal vectors on this surface are included in the pixel file. ALMOST computes the response of the target echo after matched filtering, including the phase. Close range effects are fully taken into account. The ALMOST results are taken as simulator input for the Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) processor, developed at TNO, as a first validity check ofALMOST. The model validity is checked further by comparing SAS results from ALMOST, with SAS results from SIMONA, a simulator for time signals, also developed at TNO. After these successful validity tests, ALMOST results for a <b>mine-like</b> <b>target</b> at close range (0. 5 to 3 m) are compared with measurements, obtained with a so-called “scan frame”. Identical geometry is used in ALMOST and the scan frame data, and both data sets are SAS processed. The SAS processor uses 2500 sonar positions with spacing 2 mm, on a straight line, some decimetres above the target. SAS reconstructs the target shape into a two dimensional picture. Some differences between model and measurements can be explained from assumptions made in the pixel file representing the real target measurements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{mine warfare}} context, {{performances}} of automatic target recognition (ATR) processes {{are known to}} highly depend on the underwater environment. In this study, {{we focus on the}} detection of mine-like-objects (MLO) in sand ripple seafloors. This particular seafloor type degrades detector performance by decreasing the detection probability and increasing the number of false alarms. To tackle this issue, we propose a method based on the monogenic signal and the concept of intrinsic dimensionality to characterize ripple seafloors, and then identifying geometrical anomalies caused by the presence of a MLO. This environmental information about the ripple field is taken into consideration to automatically create a map in which the potential armful object is set clearly visible to facilitate its detection. To validate and assess the performance of the proposed detection algorithm, a study of real synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) images containing various <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets</b> is undertaken...|$|R

A {{better understanding of the}} role of heterogeneities in both scattering and propagation could lead to improvements in sediment characterization using remote sensing techniques as well as in high-frequency detection of mine and <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets</b> resting on or buried within the seafloor. OBJECTIVES The goal of this work is to further develop and test models of volume scattering by utilizing the existing suite of instrumentation previously developed at APL- UW for the study of high-frequency acoustics. These models include perturbation models applied to scattering from the seafloor due to heterogeneities in the sediment properties, recently developed models by Dr. Ivakin [1], which model scattering from inclusions in the sediment such as shells and coarse grains, models which account for the transition layer observed during SAX 99 which could have a strong effect on volume scattering at high frequencies, and perturbation theory for sound propagation through a varying poroelastic sediment.

40|$|Abstract — The {{relationship}} between synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) image resolution and target-detection performance is quantified. It is first demonstrated how a lower-resolution SAS {{system can be}} simulated in a principled manner by band-limiting the image wavenumber spectrum of a full-resolution SAS image. This insight enables a direct comparison of target-detection performance in imagery of different resolutions while all other variables (such as data-collection conditions) remain fixed. The comparison is achieved by degrading a given SAS image {{to a series of}} different along-track resolutions and range resolutions, and then applying the same detection algorithm to the resulting set of images. This is repeated on a large scale for a set of real SAS data collected at sea at eight different geographical locations in various environmental conditions; the data considered comprise over 1500 images collectively span-ning over 8 square-kilometers of seabed and containing over 2000 <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets.</b> The results quantify the dependence of target-detection performance and false alarm rate on along-track resolution and range resolution. This information can be used to determine the minimum processing requirements needed onboard an autonomous underwater vehicle for effective through-the-sensor survey adaptation, and also to inform SAS system design and procurement decisions.

40|$|Current ground {{penetrating}} radars (GPR) {{have been}} tested for land mine detection, but they have generally been costly and have poor performance. Comprehensive modeling and experimentation {{must be done to}} predict the electromagnetic (EM) signatures of mines to access the effect of clutter on the EM signature of the mine, and to understand the merit and limitations of using radar for various mine detection scenarios. This modeling can provide a basis for advanced radar design and detection techniques leading to superior performance. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has developed a radar technology that when combined with comprehensive modeling and detection methodologies could be the basis of an advanced mine detection system. Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) technology exhibits a combination of properties, including wideband operation, extremely low power consumption, extremely small size and low cost, array configurability, and noise encoded pulse generation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} use of random noise radar techniques to detect, localize and identify shallow buried subsurface objects, especially mines and <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets.</b> A novel polarimetric random noise Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) system has been designed, fabricated and tested at UNL. Stokes vector-based polarimetric techniques are applied for data processing. This dissertation presents {{a review of the}} existing GPR systems, their salient features and limitations, fundamentals of electromagnetic theory for GPR applications, the random noise radar technique and its theoretical considerations, and the system test results using random noise polarimetry. ^ This novel polarimetric random noise radar system transmits the wide bandwidth random noise signal in the 1 - 2 GHz frequency range. Detection and localization of buried objects is accomplished by correlating the reflected waveform with a time-delayed replica of the transmitted waveform. Broadband dual-polarized log-periodic antennas are used for transmission and reception. A unique signal processing scheme is used to inject coherence into the system by frequency translation of the ultra-wideband signal by a coherent 160 MHz phase-locked source prior to performing heterodyne correlation. System coherence allows the extraction of the polarimetric amplitude and phase characteristics of a target. The raw data images and Stokes matrix and polarimetric factor images are presented to demonstrate results of the experimental study. ...|$|R
40|$|The Naval Research Laboratory {{is using}} its world-renowned {{structural}} acoustics facilities (originally developed for scaled submarine programs) {{to study the}} broad band (1 - 150 kHz) acoustic scattering from proud and buried underwater mines. The objective is to discover what information is contained in the broad-band properties of the scattered signal which might be exploited for target identification purposes. Current acoustic mine-hunting systems form acoustic images that replicate the rough geometric shape of the target. To obtain sufficient resolution, these systems must operate at frequencies that are too high for anything but time-consuming, close-in looks at the target. Even then, they often confuse mines with <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets</b> such as oil drums. In contrast, structural acoustic clues such as mine resonances, elastic wave propagation, internal structure scattering, etc., are available at lower frequencies (1 - 10 kHz), allowing for much longer ranges of operation {{as well as the}} construction of unique "fmgerprints " by which to identify the target as a mine. Additionally, at lower frequencies the ocean sediment is more readily penetrated by acoustic waves, creating the possibility for buried mine detection. This paper examines the feasibility of exploiting such very low frequency structural acoustic clues for long range identification ofproud and buried mines...|$|R

40|$|Develop Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) {{techniques}} and signal processing algorithms to generate high resolution acoustic images {{of mine and}} non-mine targets using bistatic and multistatic sonar configurations. OBJECTIVES The objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) based bistatic CSAS imaging of bottom mines and <b>mine-like</b> <b>targets,</b> to evaluate and compare the quality of bistatic imaging relative to monostatic imaging, and to determine the practical advantages (or disadvantages) of bistatic imaging with respect to monostatic imaging. APPROACH Most synthetic aperture sonar (and radar) systems operate in a monostatic mode in which the source and receiver are collocated. To generate a monostatic CSAS image, the target region is partially or completely circled by the sonar and echoes are acquired over a large range of target aspects. Detailed images of target outlines can be produced from this data even at relatively low transmit frequencies (tens of kHz) [1, 3]. In the bistatic mode, the source and receiver are separated in space and the geometry considerations are somewhat more complicated [2, 3]. Under this task, bistatic CSAS imaging algorithms have been developed as extensions to the monostatic CSAS imaging algorithms previously developed at ARL:UT. Bistatic CSAS image processing is based upon Fourier Transform reconstruction techniques {{similar to those in}} [4 - 6] with significant modifications to accommodate the bistatic configuration [1, 3]. ...|$|R
