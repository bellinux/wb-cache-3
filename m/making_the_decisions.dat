25|$|In series 10, {{the format}} to Bootcamp was changed: the judges find out their {{categories}} before Bootcamp starts, and each judge will {{make decisions on}} who is performing in the Six-Chair Challenge by eliminating the contestants, this is up to each individual judge. From Series 11 onwards, the judges do not know their categories before the Bootcamp, {{so they have to}} make the decisions together. After the Bootcamp round, the mentor challenges their contestants through the Six-Chair Challenge. Judges make decisions on who to put through to judges' houses straight after each act has performed, with those getting a yes taking a chair in the final six chairs on stage. It is up to the mentor to decide, which act they want to take to judges' houses, but once all six spots are full, if the mentor wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they have to replace one of those who were previously given a yes. This format was very poorly rated by many members of the British public. Bootcamp still took place, but only highlights were shown in the first episode of the Six-chair challenge. In series 12, all of Bootcamp aired on-screen. A more brutal twist to the Six-Chair Challenge was introduced in series 14, where the mentor is to sit at a smaller table {{at the side of the}} arena while <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions,</b> while the other judges remain at a larger table on the other side.|$|E

500|$|After the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe {{announced}} that he was splitting with Frost to train with one of his assistants, Tracey Menzies, who had no prior international experience. Admitting that tension existed between him and Frost, Thorpe asserted that the split was amicable. He cited waning motivation for the split, stating [...] "I decided I either had to make the change or it was {{to walk away from the}} sport". The retired Talbot expressed concerns that Thorpe was making a decision whilst he was physically and emotionally drained, while other coaches felt that the new relationship would end up with Thorpe, rather than Menzies, <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions.</b> Despite a turbulent year, he was again named by Swimming World as its World Swimmer of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Michael Billington {{was charged}} in a Roanoke court with having knowingly {{solicited}} 131 loans {{that would never}} be repaid from 85 people, totaling $1.24million. Represented by a court-appointed lawyer, he rejected a plea bargain that would have limited his prison sentence to the three years he had already served in the federal case. The lawyer, Brian Gettings, doubted Billington's competence and told the court that he believed LaRouche was <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> in the case rather than his client. The court ordered two psychiatric tests. The first physician deemed him competent. Billington refused to cooperate with a second examination {{that was to be}} conducted by an expert on cults. Billington sought to fire Gettings, who had already tried to quit over competency question, but the judge refused to permit Billington to substitute a different attorney. A LaRouche spokesman said that Billington was prepared for trial. [...] Billington was convicted on nine counts of [...] "conspiracy to fail to register as a securities broker". Under Virginia's court system, the jury determines prison terms although a judge may override the jury's recommendation. The jury in this case recommended 77 years (out of a possible 90); the judge refused to lower it because Billington continued to insist upon his innocence (which the judge deemed lack of remorse) and because he had warned that he would accept the jury recommendation if Billington requested a jury trial. Billington served a total of ten years in prison before being released on parole. The lead prosecutor said the case involved [...] "willful and massive fraud that has caused {{a lot of people to}} suffer".|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the modern}} view, “common law” is not {{grounded}} in “custom” or [...] "ancient usage," [...] but rather acquires {{force of law}} instantly (without the delay implied by the term [...] "custom" [...] or [...] "ancient") when pronounced by a higher court, because {{and to the extent}} the proposition is stated in judicial opinion. From the earliest times through the late 19th century, the dominant theory was that the common law was a pre-existent law or system of rules, a social standard of justice that existed in the habits, customs, and thoughts of the people. Under this older view, the legal profession considered it no part of judge's duty to make new or change existing law, but only to expound and apply the old. By the early 20th century, largely at the urging of Oliver Wendell Holmes (as discussed throughout this article), this view had fallen into the minority view: Holmes pointed out that the older view worked undesirable and unjust results, and hampered a proper development of the law. In the century since Holmes, the dominant understanding has been that common law “decisions are themselves law, or rather the rules which the courts lay down in <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> constitute law.” The reality of the modern view can be seen in practical operation: under the old [...] "pre-existing custom" [...] view, (a) jurisdictions could not logically diverge from each other (but nonetheless did), (b) a new decision logically needed to operate retroactively (but did not), and (c) there was no standard to decide which English medieval customs should be [...] "law" [...] and which should not. All three tensions resolve under the modern view: (a) the common law in different jurisdictions may diverge, (b) new decisions need not have retroactive operation, and (c) court decisions are effective immediately as they are issued, not years later, or after they become [...] "custom," [...] and questions of what [...] "custom" [...] might have been at some [...] "ancient" [...] time are simply irrelevant.|$|E
