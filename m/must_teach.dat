5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire <b>must</b> <b>teach</b> him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E

In 2014, Gove's department acceded to the BHA's {{campaign by}} banning creationism from being taught as science in state-funded English schools, including Academies and Free Schools, {{as well as}} introducing a requirement that such schools <b>must</b> <b>teach</b> evolution.|$|E

25|$|With the bet nearing its end, Parnassus reveals Valentina's {{conception}} to her: after ageing from immortality, Parnassus {{made a new}} {{pact with}} Mr. Nick to be youthful again, {{in order to win}} the heart of a woman he loved. In exchange, any child he fathered would become Mr. Nick's property at age 16. Valentina attempts to run away, but Tony enters the Imaginarium to give his soul to Parnassus; in exchange, Parnassus <b>must</b> <b>teach</b> him the trance that powers the dream world. Valentina returns as he tries to enter the mirror, but Anton blocks them, having discovered that Tony is a fraudulent charity scammer.|$|E
25|$|Focus {{turns toward}} {{individual}} achievement, leadership {{and community service}} once First Class is earned. The ranks of Star, Life and Eagle require a set number of merit badges (minimum of 21 for Eagle Scout, with 13 from a compulsory list), {{as well as a}} minimum of time spent in a troop leadership position, and community service requirements, among other things. The rank of Eagle Scout requires the Scout plan, develop and lead their own service project that benefits their community or an organization other than Scouting. In 2010, the Life Scout rank added a specific teaching requirement, where a Star-rank Scout <b>must</b> <b>teach</b> a younger Scout certain requirements for one of the early ranks.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer, {{along with}} Rabbi Hirsch, was insistent that Orthodox Jews {{living in the}} west should not {{segregate}} themselves behind ghetto walls.

Don McLeroy, a dentist and chair of the board, said, [...] "I think the new standards are wonderful ... dogmatism about evolution [...] America's scientific soul." [...] According to Science magazine, [...] "Because Texas is the second-largest textbook market in the United States, publishers have a strong incentive to be certified by the board as 'conforming 100% to the state's standards'."

2500|$|In his {{well-known}} Minute on Indian Education of February 1835, Macaulay urged Lord William Bentinck, the Governor-General {{to reform}} secondary education on utilitarian lines to deliver [...] "useful learning" [...] – {{a phrase that}} to Macaulay was synonymous with Western culture. There was no tradition of secondary education in vernacular languages; the institutions then supported by the East India Company taught either in Sanskrit or Persian. Hence, he argued, [...] "We have to educate a people who cannot at present be educated by means of their mother-tongue. We <b>must</b> <b>teach</b> them some foreign language." [...] Macaulay argued that Sanskrit and Persian were no more accessible than English to the speakers of the Indian vernacular languages and existing Sanskrit and Persian texts were of little use for 'useful learning'.

2500|$|It is {{generally}} considered to be among the least restrictive states in which to home school. Neither TEA nor the local school district has authority to regulate home school activities; state law only requires that the curriculum 1) <b>must</b> <b>teach</b> [...] "reading, spelling, grammar, mathematics and a study of good citizenship" [...] (the latter interpreted to mean a course in civics) and 2) must be taught in a bona fide manner. There are no minimum number of days in a year, or hours in a day, that must be met, and achievement tests are not required for home school graduating seniors. The validity of home schooling was challenged in Texas, but a landmark case, Leeper v. Arlington ISD, ruled that home schooling was legal and that the state had little or no authority to regulate the practice.|$|E
2500|$|In his writings, Griffin himself {{acknowledged}} {{that much of}} his 'modernisation' {{was an attempt to}} hide the BNP's core ideology behind more electorally palatable policies. Like the National Front, the BNP's private discourse was different from its public one, with Griffin stating that [...] "Of course we <b>must</b> <b>teach</b> the truth to the hardcore... when it comes to influencing the public, forget about racial differences, genetics, Zionism, historical revisionism and so on... we must at all times present them with an image of moderate reasonableness". The BNP has eschewed the labels [...] "fascist" [...] and [...] "Nazi", claiming that it is neither. In its 1992 electoral manifesto, it insisted that [...] "Fascism was Italian. Nazism was German. We are British. We will do things our own way; we will not copy foreigners". Griffin has rejected the description of [...] "fascist", claiming that that label is [...] "a smear that comes from the far left" [...] designed to discourage people from voting BNP.|$|E
