25|$|The {{legality}} {{of the decision to}} put Railtrack into railway administration was challenged by the smaller Railtrack Private Shareholders Action Group. Their action against the government alleged that the Secretary of State for Transport at the time – Stephen Byers MP – had, by deciding to cut off funding for Railtrack and asking the High Court to put the company into railway administration, committed the common law tort of <b>misfeasance</b> in public office. It is believed that there was £532 million available to Railtrack comprising £370 million in the bank and £162 million of an existing Department of Transport loan facility still available to be drawn down, but Stephen Byers MP cancelled this facility, causing shareholders to believe that he had broken the loan agreement.|$|E
25|$|As {{the legal}} {{basis of the}} forced {{separation}} of families and children served the Swiss Civil Code (Zivilgesetzbuch) of 1912, by – at <b>misfeasance</b> behavior of parents, permanent risk or, more generally, neglect – the guardianship authorities were empowered, parents {{to take away the}} custody of their children. Although the Civil Code mentioned a supervision over the work of the authorities, it was widely ignored. Although the welfare authorities possessed the right parents to escape custody, such as the supervision in the mass application of the laws of the article, was nowhere determined. Crucial and sufficient was the 'legal fact', that the children were members of a traveling (Yenish) family, and thus a sufficient reason, to take away the children from their parents.|$|E
25|$|Because the <b>misfeasance</b> {{provision}} reflects {{causes of}} action vested in the company, any money recovered under it is held {{so that it}} will go to pay off creditors in their ordinary order of priority. In Re Anglo-Austrian Printing & Publishing Union this meant that a liquidator who had successfully sued directors for £7000 had to give up the funds to a group of debenture holders, who had not yet been paid in full, so there is no discretion to apply the assets in favour of unsecured creditors. A potential benefit is that because the causes of action are vested in the company, they may be assigned to third parties, who may prefer to take the risk and reward of pursuing litigation over the liquidator or administrator. These features are the reverse for money recovered through the statutory based causes of action of fraudulent and wrongful trading.|$|E
25|$|One {{limitation}} of the unlawful trading provisions is {{that the cause of}} action vests solely in the liquidator or administrator, as a matter of statute, unlike for a <b>misfeasance</b> proceeding. While both kinds of action can be pursued concurrently, a fraudulent or wrongful trading case may not be assigned to a third party. In Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd the company's former directors sought to challenge a wrongful trading claim because the liquidator had sold the right to sue them to a specialist litigation firm, London Wall Claims. The Court of Appeal held that such an assignment contravened the old common law prohibition on champertous causes, or ones which involve a party in litigation for payment when they have no interest. The disadvantage of this approach is that liquidators or administrators may be too cautious to bring claims, when a specialist firm could bring them.|$|E
25|$|After his {{accession}} as the tributary {{ruler of}} Upper Assam under British Government, Purandar Singha began well with his accounts of payments of revenue. But within three year, {{he began to}} make default in his payments. He begged for a considerable reduction {{in the amount of}} revenue, as he explained that the country was badly ravaged by the Burmese invaders, affecting all spheres of life of the people, which includes social and economical. Imposing taxation was also difficult because unlike other parts of India, common people in Assam did not use or very rarely use money for any business transaction or in daily business. Captain Jenkins, the new Commissioner and Political Agent, held an enquiry into Purandar Singh’s administration and found it a hot bed of corruption and <b>misfeasance.</b> His subjects were oppressed and misgoverned and his rule is very distasteful to the bulk of the population. Purandar Singha was himself found guilty of gathering personal fortune rather than concentrating on good governance for his people.|$|E

A first mention is a hearing that must be held within 48 hours of a person's arrest. She felt it failed to adequately assure accused people that {{they were allowed to}} complain to magistrates about injuries they had sustained or acts of <b>misfeasance</b> against them by the authorities. In response, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng assured MPs that processes would be in place to ensure that accused people are treated fairly. For example, during a video conference, an accused person will be alone in a room with no police officer, and {{will be able to see}} what is happening in the entire courtroom. Secondly, the screen that will be used by the judge is large enough to enable him or her to clearly see whether the accused is under duress. Finally, accused people who have been mistreated can either complain to the police or to the judge when they are later present in court.|$|E
500|$|During the Second Reading of the NCMP bill, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew {{presented}} to Parliament three main justifications for the NCMP scheme. First, {{he said that}} having a minimum number of opposition members in Parliament through the NCMP scheme would provide younger People's Action Party ("PAP") MPs with sparring partners to [...] "sharpen their debating skills". Secondly, the presence of opposition members in Parliament would educate the younger generation of voters {{about the role of}} a constitutional opposition and the limits of what it can do. He said this was especially important because the younger generation who had not lived and witnessed the conflicts within Parliament in the 1950s and 1960s [...] "harbour myths about the role of an Opposition" [...] and [...] "had no idea how destructive an Opposition could be". Thirdly, the presence of non-PAP MPs in Parliament would act as a check and balance against any governmental impropriety. According to Lee, [...] "some non-PAP MPs will ensure that every suspicion, every rumour of misconduct, will be reported to the non-PAP MPs". The readiness of non-PAP members to bring forth any allegation of <b>misfeasance,</b> or corruption, or nepotism would [...] "dispel suspicions of cover-ups of alleged wrongdoings".|$|E

[...] Where the directors or officers have been guilty of either insolvent trading or <b>misfeasance,</b> this may provide the basis for financial claims against them, which the liquidator can use to swell the assets available for distribution to the creditors.|$|E
2500|$|The NFL {{found that}} Payton and Loomis' <b>misfeasance</b> {{amounted}} to [...] "conduct detrimental" [...] to the league. The NFL found no club money {{had been used}} to fund the bounty pool, and praised Benson for doing what he could to shut down the slush fund. Nonetheless, it found the Saints organization as a whole guilty of conduct detrimental to the league as well due to Williams and the players' maintenance of the bounty pool, as well as Loomis and Payton's failure to act [...] "in a responsible manner" [...] to stop it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{courts were}} {{initially}} reluctant to impose liability for omissions, {{as demonstrated by}} the early case of R v Smith, decided in 1869. The facts were that a watchman employed by a railway company took a break from his duties, and in this time a man was killed by an oncoming train. Lush LJ held that whilst an omission could constitute an act of murder, because there was no statutory duty for the railway to provide a watchman, there could not be any criminal liability. However, thirty years later, in the case of R v Pittwood, the court adopted a different stance to a case of similar facts. In this case, a gatekeeper for a railway service in Somerset negligently forgot to close a gate – allowing access by vehicles (cars/horse-drawn) to a railway line – whilst going to lunch. It was held that despite the fact he was privately employed, he had materially contributed to the following accident, by opening the gate and then failing to close it. The reasoning used by the courts in this case however can be seen as problematic in establishing liability for omissions. Wright LJ's position was that the watchman's <b>misfeasance</b> in itself contributed to the accident, which would suggest that it was his opening of the gate which was criminalised, rather than his failure to shut it. It has been submitted by John Smith that this decision implies the result would have been different if the watchman had come on duty to find an open gate, and had subsequently not shut it, an outcome which Smith describes as [...] "morally offensive". In any case, the decision shows the general reluctance of English courts to outright state that an omission may be criminal, and {{it has been said that}} such attempts to distinguish between acts and omissions are at least unhelpful, and possibly dangerous.|$|E

50|$|In theory, <b>misfeasance</b> is {{distinct}} from nonfeasance. Nonfeasance is a failure to act that results in harm to another party. <b>Misfeasance,</b> by contrast, is some affirmative act that, though legal, causes harm. In practice, the distinction is confusing and uninstructive. Courts often have difficulty determining whether harm resulted from a failure to act or from an act that was improperly performed.|$|E
