The targeted temperature levels depend on the desired application but are generally as high as possible. For applications such as microreactors or gas sensing, at least a few hundred degrees should be reached, but a temperature over 800 °C is desirable. Available <b>microheaters</b> commonly use the hotplate geometry and a platinum filament as a heating element. These heaters are limited to temperatures of about 600 °C. Moreover, platinum is not very compatible with conventional CMOS processes. In this paper, we present a hotplate heater based on monocrystalline silicon that is suitable for reaching at least 800 °C. Furthermore, as silicon is the base material of IC processing technology, CMOS integration is made more straightforward. In order to achieve low power consumption (~ 100 mW) with sufficiently low voltage levels, the silicon is heavily doped, and the heater geometry is optimized.
