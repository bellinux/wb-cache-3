5|$|Coolbrith never resumed {{the work}} of writing the history, as {{she was unable to}} balance its revelatory autobiographical truth with the scandal that would then ensue. In her life, there were rumors that she had {{accepted}} <b>men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Harte, Stoddard, Clemens and Miller as occasional lovers—a book discussing these liaisons was one she considered too controversial.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller became {{well known}} in his later life for the {{practice}} of giving dimes to adults and nickels to children wherever he went. He even gave dimes as a playful gesture to wealthy <b>men,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> tire mogul Harvey Firestone.|$|E
5|$|De Materia Medica was {{circulated}} as illustrated manuscripts, copied by hand, in Greek, Latin and Arabic throughout the mediaeval period. From {{the sixteenth century}} on, Dioscorides' text was translated into Italian, German, Spanish, and French, and in 1655 into English. It {{formed the basis for}} herbals in these languages by <b>men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Leonhart Fuchs, Valerius Cordus, Lobelius, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, John Gerard and William Turner. Gradually such herbals included more and more direct observations, supplementing and eventually supplanting the classical text.|$|E

5|$|The Sugar Act {{provoked}} outrage in Boston, {{where it}} was widely viewed {{as a violation of}} colonial rights. <b>Men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> James Otis and Samuel Adams argued that because the colonists were not represented in Parliament, they could not be taxed by that body; only the colonial assemblies, where the colonists were represented, could levy taxes upon the colonies. Hancock was not yet a political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{complicated by the}} American spoils system. After Andrew Jackson assumed the U.S. presidency in March 1829, many competent Indian agents were replaced by unqualified Jackson loyalists, argues historian John Hall. Men like Thomas Forsyth, John Marsh, and Thomas McKenney were replaced by less qualified <b>men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Felix St. Vrain. In the 19th century, historian Lyman Draper argued that the Black Hawk War {{could have been avoided}} had Forsyth remained as the agent to the Sauks.|$|E
5|$|The wealthy {{families}} {{living on the}} estates of these scholar-officials – as well as rich merchants, princes, and nobles—often maintained a massive entourage of employed servants, technical staffs, and personal favorites. They hired personal artisans such as jewellers, sculptors, and embroiderers, while servants cleaned house, shopped for goods, attended to kitchen duties, and prepared furnishings for banquets, weddings, and funerals. Rich families also hosted literary <b>men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> secretaries, copyists, and hired tutors to educate their sons. They were also the patrons of musicians, painters, poets, chess players, and storytellers.|$|E

5|$|Hispanics in the United States Navy {{can trace}} their {{tradition}} of naval military service to <b>men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Lieutenant Jordi Farragut Mesquida, {{who served in}} the American Revolution. Hispanics, such as Seaman Philip Bazaar and Seaman John Ortega, have distinguished themselves in combat and have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration of the United States. Hispanics have also reached the top ranks of the Navy, serving their country in sensitive leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores. Among those who have reached the highest ranks in the Navy are Commodore Uriah Phillips Levy, of Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jewish descent, who participated in the War of 1812 as an assistant Sailing master; Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, for whom the rank of Admiral in the U.S. Navy was created during the American Civil War; and Admiral Horacio Rivero, who led the Navy during the Cuban Missile Crisis.|$|E
5|$|Kantakouzenos' second {{departure}} {{proved a}} great error. Back in the capital, his enemies moved in his absence. Apokaukos gathered {{a group of}} high-ranking aristocrats around him, including <b>men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the megas droungarios John Gabalas or George Choumnos, whom he tied to himself by marriage alliances. The Patriarch, backed by Apokaukos' group and {{the authority of the}} Empress, dismissed Kantakouzenos from his offices and declared him a public enemy. Kalekas himself was proclaimed regent and Apokaukos named Eparch of Constantinople. Kantakouzenos' relatives and supporters were imprisoned or forced to flee the city, and their properties confiscated. Although Kantakouzenos' wife and children were safe in his headquarters at Demotika (Didymoteicho), the regency placed his mother, Theodora, under house arrest. The privations she suffered during her imprisonment were to cause her eventual death.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{a center}} of the {{movement}} for independence from Great Britain; colonists in Massachusetts had long uneasy relations with the British monarchy, including open rebellion under the Dominion of New England in the 1680s. Protests against British attempts to tax the colonies after the French and Indian War ended in 1763 led to the Boston Massacre in 1770, and the 1773 Boston Tea Party escalated tensions. In 1774, the Intolerable Acts targeted Massachusetts with punishments for the Boston Tea Party and further decreased local autonomy, increasing local dissent. Anti-Parliamentary activity by <b>men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Samuel Adams and John Hancock, followed by reprisals by the British government, were a primary reason for {{the unity of the}} Thirteen Colonies and the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775.|$|E

5|$|The ancient {{historian}} Tacitus describes Domitian's first {{speech in}} the Senate as brief and measured, {{at the same time}} noting his ability to elude awkward questions. Domitian's authority was merely , however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function. Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's , promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and Antonius Primus and replacing them by more reliable <b>men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Arrecinus Clemens.|$|E

5|$|The socio-religious {{movements}} of the previous centuries, such as Lingayatism, provided momentum for flexible social norms to which women were expected to abide. By this time South Indian women had crossed most barriers and were actively involved in matters hitherto considered the monopoly of <b>men,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> administration, business and trade, and involvement in the fine arts. Tirumalamba Devi who wrote Varadambika Parinayam and Gangadevi who wrote Madhuravijayam were among the notable women poets of the era. Early Telugu women poets like Tallapaka Timmakka and Atukuri Molla became popular during this period. The court of the Nayaks of Tanjore {{is known to have}} patronised several women poets. The Devadasi system existed, as well as legalised prostitution relegated to a few streets in each city. The popularity of harems amongst men of the royalty is well known from records.|$|E

40|$|The {{pyrogenic}} {{properties of}} some C- 19 and C- 21 steroids were examined by in vitro incubation of human blood leukocytes with serum-buffer solutions of the steroids and injection of the 18 -hr supernatants into rabbits. In previous studies this method demonstrated release of leukocyte endogenous pyrogen by etiocholanolone. With two exceptions, steroids {{known to cause}} fever in <b>man,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> 11 β-OH etiocholanolone and 3 α-hydroxy- 5 β-pregnane- 20 -one were also pyrogenic in vitro. All steroids tested which are nonpyrogenic in <b>man,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> androsterone, 3 β-OH etiocholanolone, and 3 α, 17 α-dihydroxy- 5 β-pregnan- 20 -one were also nonpyrogenic in vitro. Solubility in aqueous solution did not correlate with pyrogenic capacity...|$|R
5|$|To fund this army, Hamilton wrote {{regularly}} to Oliver Wolcott Jr., his successor at the Treasury William Loughton Smith, of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senator Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts. He directed them {{to pass a}} direct tax to fund the war. Smith resigned in July 1797, as Hamilton scolded him for slowness, and told Wolcott to tax houses instead of land. The eventual program included a Stamp Act {{like that of the}} British before the Revolution and other taxes on land, houses, and slaves, calculated at different rates in different states, and requiring difficult and intricate assessment of houses. This provoked resistance in southeastern Pennsylvania, led primarily by <b>men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> John Fries who had marched with Washington against the Whiskey Rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Amongst the Hispanic {{pioneers in}} the Coast Guard were the Andreu family of Florida; Joseph Ximenez, the first Hispanic-American to command a Coast Guard vessel; and Detlef Frederick Argentine de Otte, the first Hispanic to {{graduate}} from Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction. The Coast Guard can {{be transferred to the}} Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during time of war. During World War I, Hispanics served in the United States Revenue Cutter Service and U.S. Life-Saving Service; and during World War II, Hispanics served aboard ships guarding the shores of the United States and the Atlantic Ocean against enemy submarines. However some <b>men,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Jose R. Zaragoza, served on missions on lonely atolls. Hispanics have served in every major conflict, and continue to do so. Coast guard service is not limited to armed conflicts with other nations; the Coast Guard also plays a vital role in the apprehension of illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a gallant and daring act being {{performed}} by a squadron, ship's company or a detached body of <b>men</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> marines) in which all men are deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross then a ballot is drawn. The officers select one officer, the NCOs select one individual and the private soldiers or seamen select two individuals. In all 46 awards have been awarded by ballot with 29 of the awards during the Indian Mutiny. Four further awards were granted to Q Battery, Royal Horse Artillery at Korn Spruit on 31 March 1900 during the Second Boer War. The final ballot awards for the army were the six awards to the Lancashire Fusiliers at W Beach during the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 although three of the awards were not gazetted until 1917. The final seven ballot awards were the only naval ballot awards with three awards to two Q-Ships in 1917 and four awards for the Zeebrugge Raid in 1918. The provision for awards by ballot is still included in the Victoria Cross warrant but there have been no further such awards since 1918.|$|E

5|$|Military failure abroad, and the {{associated}} fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent at home. The problems {{came to a head}} in the parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the king's closest advisors. Chamberlain William Latimer and Steward of the Household John Neville were dismissed from their positions. Edward's mistress, Alice Perrers, who was seen to hold far too much power over the ageing king, was banished from court. Yet the real adversary of the Commons, supported by powerful <b>men</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Wykeham and Edmund de Mortimer, Earl of March, was John of Gaunt. Both the king and the Black Prince were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt in virtual control of government. Gaunt was forced to give in to the demands of parliament, but at its next convocation, in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June, revolt {{broke out}} in Cambridgeshire, led by {{elements}} of Wrawe's Suffolk rebellion and some local <b>men,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> John Greyston, who {{had been involved in}} the events in London and had returned to his home county to spread the revolt, and Geoffrey Cobbe and John Hanchach, members of the local gentry. The University of Cambridge, staffed by priests and enjoying special royal privileges, was widely hated by the other inhabitants of the town. A revolt backed by the Mayor of Cambridge broke out with the university as its main target. The rebels ransacked Corpus Christi College, which had connections to John of Gaunt, and the University's church, and attempted to execute the University bedel, who escaped. The university's library and archives were burnt in the centre of the town. The next day, the university was forced to negotiate a new charter, giving up its royal privileges. Revolt then spread north from Cambridge toward Ely, where the gaol was opened and the local Justice of the Peace executed.|$|E
