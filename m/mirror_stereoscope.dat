It was shown on an Argentine government chart of 1950, and named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960 for Sir David Brewster, Scottish natural philosopher who in 1844 improved the <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope</b> invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone by substituting prisms.|$|E

40|$|Each of {{our eyes}} {{normally}} sees {{a slightly different}} image {{of the world around}} us. The brain can combine these two images into a single coherent representation. However, when the eyes are presented with images that are sufficiently different from each other, an interesting thing happens: Rather than fusing the two images into a combined conscious percept, what transpires is a pattern of perceptual alternations where one image dominates awareness while the other is suppressed; dominance alternates between the two images, typically every few seconds. This perceptual phenomenon is known as binocular rivalry. Binocular rivalry is considered useful for studying perceptual selection and awareness in both human and animal models, because unchanging visual input to each eye leads to alternations in visual awareness and perception. To create a binocular rivalry stimulus, all that is necessary is to present each eye with a different image at the same perceived location. There are several ways of doing this, but newcomers to the field are often unsure which method would best suit their specific needs. The {{purpose of this article is}} to describe a number of inexpensive and straightforward ways to create and use binocular rivalry. We detail methods that do not require expensive specialized equipment and describe each method's advantages and disadvantages. The methods described include the use of red-blue goggles, <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscopes</b> and prism goggles. Protoco...|$|R

The 1957 aerial photographic images and 1973 Landsat image were the only oldest remote sensing data available for the study area, but there were no any reference images available between 1957 and 1973. Thus, further subdivisions for LULC analysis between 1957 and 1973 were not possible. Eleven 1  m ×  1  m black-and-white scanned photographic images of 1957 by 600 dots per inch (DPI) were obtained from Ethiopian Mapping Agency (EMA). These were used for photogrammetric processing, as well as visual photo-interpretation activities. Materials such as <b>mirror</b> and pocket <b>stereoscopes</b> were employed for stereo viewing during visual interpretations of features on hardcopy pairs of aerial photos. The visual interpretations process using stereoscopes were helpful to substantiate onscreen feature classifications using GIS environment. Subsequently, all photographic images were geometrically corrected based on geo-referenced and 1 : 50, 000 scale topographic map to produce orthorectified images using “Geo Correction Tools” of ArcGIS. Finally, the mosaic image was produced from eleven orthorectified images using “Mosaic Tool” and later “subset image” into the required study area AOI of ERDAS EMAGINE 9.2.|$|R

In this study, we used binocular disparity to induce the size constancy illusion in lexical stimuli. 47 undergraduate and postgraduate students took part in a within-subjects, repeated measures design. Pairs of words were presented dichoptically using a <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope.</b> Results showed a significant interaction between sex, and whether an individual reported perceiving depth. Further analysis showed that in males, the size constancy effect was significantly stronger when the “further” word was presented to the upper visual field, and in females, the effect was significantly stronger when the “further” word was presented to the lower visual field. There was no effect of semantic size, nor of any other semantic variable (concreteness, imageability, semantic category) on the size constancy illusion...|$|E
40|$|When two {{vertical}} {{lines are}} perceived to form the boundaries of a common object, observers underestimate their separation in depth. This disruption in perceived depth depends directly on the perceived grouping via closure of the resultant figure. Here I tested if this effect generalises to motion based grouping cues, specifically common fate. Stimuli were presented on a <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope</b> and an on screen ruler was used to record depth magnitude estimates. It was found that depth estimates were accurate over a range of suprathreshold disparities, for both static and moving stimuli. Attempts to strengthen the grouping cues had no impact on depth magnitude estimates. This was true even when a more complex biological motion stimulus was used. These results show that previously reported reductions in perceived depth are not generalizable to grouping via common motion. It appears that this phenomenon only occurs when the spatial layout suggests a common object...|$|E
40|$|Fisher and Ciuffreda (1988) and Mon-Williams and Tresilian (1999) {{reported}} that, without vergence cue, diopter {{change in}} accommodation induced change in apparent distance. Meanwhile, there is conflicting {{evidence about the}} relative roles of accommodation and vergence in distance perception (Richards & Miller, 1969; von Holst, 1973). In the current study, we investigated interaction between accommodation and vergence on distance perception. The perceived distance from integration of vergence evoked by a fixation target and accommodation {{by a pair of}} concave or convex lenses in front of eyes is measured with a <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope.</b> The stimulus was a white square with a black cross-shaped fixation on a black background. In dark surroundings, subjects were asked to commit the apparent distance of the target to memory, and then without the lenses, re-create the distance by changing distance of another fixation target. The apparent size of the target through lenses were equivalent to the size without lenses. The results showed that not only vergence but accommodation affect the apparent distance, and they were summed linearly...|$|E
40|$|In several psychophysical functions, {{thresholds}} may {{be lower}} when {{the test is}} performed binocularly than when performed monocularly. We evaluated binocular advantage on continuous motion perception at and above threshold. Firstly, thresholds of motion direction were determined under monocular and binocular conditions. Stimuli were briefly presented Gabor patches with translation of a sinusoidal carrier. Subjects observed the stimuli using a <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope.</b> The apparent contrasts of stimuli were equivalent between monocular and binocular conditions. The observer's task was to decide if the stimulus moved rightward or leftward. We found a binocular advantage of approximately 1. 3. Secondly, binocular advantage on motion perception at suprathreshold levels was determined by measuring point of subjective equality (PSE) between monocular and binocular conditions. Monocular condition was the reference and binocular one was the test. Two Gabor patches with carrier translation were presented in succession in random order. The observer's task was to decide if the second stimulus was faster or slower than the first. We found a binocular influence of approximately 1. 5 at three times {{the speed of the}} motion threshold, no influence at ten times the speed of the threshold...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} vision therapy among Korean elementary school children with convergence insufficiency. Methods: A total of 235 elementary schoolchildren, 10. 13 ± 2. 45 years of age, were subjected to thorough eye examination including binocular vision testing. Of them, 32 individuals with symptomatic convergence insufficiency without strabismus, amblyopia, and ocular disease were chosen to receive vision therapy via brock string, barrel card, <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope,</b> prism goggles, and aperture rule for a duration of 8 weeks. Results: The results showed {{that most of the}} participants had severe problems in near point of convergence. After the vision therapy, the average near point of convergence improved by approximately 5. 48 ± 0. 96 cm in all participants. Moreover, vision therapy had an effect on increasing near positive fusional vergence and decreasing exophoria. Negative relative accommodation improved to 2. 54 ± 0. 51 and positive relative accommodation improved to − 3. 10 ± 1. 08 diopters. After treatment, near phoria was 4. 19 ± 1. 66 and distance phoria was 1. 61 ± 0. 71 prism diopters. Conclusion: Among convergence insufficiency symptoms, the following improved in particular: near point of convergence, exophoria, and near positive fusional vergence. These findings suggest that vision therapy is very effective to recover from symptomatic convergence insufficiency...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} detect and {{integrate}} associations between unrelated items that are close {{in space and time}} is a key feature of human learning and memory. Learning sequential associations between non-adjacent visual stimuli (higherorder visuospatial dependencies) can occur either with or without awareness (explicit vs. implicit learning) of the products of learning. Existing behavioural and neurocognitive studies of explicit and implicit sequence learning, however, are based on conscious access to the sequence of target locations and, typically, on conditions where the locations for orienting, or motor, responses coincide with the locations of the target sequence. Methodology/Principal Findings: Dichoptic stimuli were presented on a novel sequence learning task using a <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope</b> to mask the eye-of-origin of visual input from conscious awareness. We demonstrate that conscious access to the sequence of target locations and responses that coincide with structure of the target sequence are dispensable features when learning higher-order visuospatial associations. Sequence knowledge was expressed in the ability of participants to identify the trained higher-order visuospatial sequence on a recognition test, even though the trained and untrained recognition sequences were identical when viewed at a conscious binocular level, and differed only {{at the level of the}} masked sequential associations. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate that unconscious processing can support perceptual learning o...|$|E

The area in study, named "Sítio dos Pin­tos", situated in the neighborhood of UFRPE's campus, in Dois Irmãos - Recife, has a surface of 5. 5 ha. The camera mount was in the floor of a R- 11 monomotor airplane. Using a Yashica 108 camera it was held, in May 17, 1992, the overfly of the area, that has soffered extremely dinamic transformations due to a disordered urban spread. It was taken as initial moment the situation of the area in March 1988, registered by the panchromatic B & W aerial photos, scale 1 : 6, 000. The 35 mm aerial photos, from May 1992, scale 1 : 1, 260, registered the physiognomic changes of the area, allowing to evaluate what happened in a period of 4 years, related to 1988. The informations were ob­tained from the aerial photos by conventional photointer­pretation with a <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope</b> and checked in field. It was verified the destruction of 85 % of the native vege­tation that there existed in the area in 1988 and the disordered building of 300 habitational units (low income people).

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the human visual system has advanced significantly over the past quarter-century. With the availability of modern computers and development of sophisticated algorithms, {{it is now possible}} to efficiently predict human attention patterns for images and video. A saliency map can easily be generated, which provides a measure of how important each portion of a scene is, with respect to the human visual system. A region with a high saliency value {{is more likely to be}} fixated upon by a human than a region with a low saliency value. In this work, we explore the application of saliency to video processing. In our first project, saliency is applied to Frame Rate Up-Conversion. By enforcing motion vector refinement only for salient regions, we reduce processing time while maintaining a high level of visual quality for the up-converted video sequence. In our second project, we propose a new method for saliency detection which considers object scale using a scale-space model. Excellent results are demonstrated, including improved performance of our saliency-based Frame Rate Up-Conversion algorithm. Finally, an experiment is conducted on the salient power of the stereoscopic depth feature using two different datasets. While local contrasts in luminance, color, orientation and motion are known to be highly salient, less is understood about local contrasts in depth. Using a <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope</b> for 3 D display to subjects and an eye-tracking system, we measure human fixations for 2 D (no depth) and 3 D scenes. We determine that contrast in stereoscopic depth repels human fixations for natural scenes, while attracting it for synthetic scenes. This conflict may arise from different stages of human attention (bottom-up vs. top-down), activated by the different scene content in the two dataset...|$|E

More generally, the results pose a challenge to neural models of learning to account for a previously unknown capacity of the human visual system to support the detection, learning and recognition of higher-order sequential associations under conditions where observers are unable to see the target sequence or perform responses that coincide with structure of the target sequence...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the result}} of applied remote sensing  for {{geological}} study the mass wasting in Karangkobar, the district of Banjarnegara, Central Java. The study on the mass wasting use the remote sensing method, by interpreting the blackwhite panhromatic aerial photographs, on the scale 1 : 50, 000. The study is aimed at 1) revealing the capacity of the aerial photograph in supporting the study the mass wasting that an be identified by the aerial photographs; 2) to find out the influence of the physical environment and land-use on the mass wasting processes. The study in performed by using the visual interpretation method of the scale 1 : 50, 000 black-white panchromati aerial photograph taken in 1994, using <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope.</b> The outcome of the aerial photograph interpretation is varis the quality of data and information. The data of interpretation of aerial photograph and the varis outcome in the spot are further tested in terms of its accuracy, particularly in its reltion with the aerial photograph interpretation. The technique of data analysis of the physical environment and the mass wasting is descriptive – comparative. The result of the study shows that the 1 : 50, 000 black-white panchromatic aerial photograph can be used to identify and study both the mass wasting and influence of the physical environment on the mass wasting processes. The degree of identifying the mass wasting based on the aerial photograph interpretation is 75 %. Compared to the previous studies, the present study hows that the mass wasting can be identified more easily by means of the 1 : 50, 000 black – white panchromatic aerial photograph. Identifying the distribution of mass wasting are: a) the geological element (rock, geological structure, and stratigraphy); b) geomorphological elements (landform and the forming processes); the water condition (surface water and groundwater); and landuse (type and distribution). White marl – claystone type is the physical environmentsal element that has the most type is the physical environmentsal element that has the most dominant influence on the occuring of mass wasting in Karangkobar area...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} (adaptation) to {{a gender}} specific face (male or female) will bias {{the perception of}} consequently viewed faces, making them {{appear to be the}} opposite sex of the adaptor. This is known as the face gender aftereffect. It has already been established in the literature that interocular transfer (IOT) can be used to determine where specific aftereffects are processed in the visual hierarchy, due to the arrangement of monocular and binocular neurons. Binocular neurons (neurons that respond to visual information presented in either eye) increase as you progress through the visual hierarchy, with few binocular neurons in V 1. It has previously been established that the tilt aftereffect has an IOT of approximately 40 % (Clifford & Rhodes, 2005). To date, however, no one has directly tested the IOT of faces. This thesis aimed to remedy this by presenting 20 human participants, 14 females and 6 males, with images of faces varying in degrees of masculinity and femininity in experiment 1, to either their same eye as adaptation or different eye to adaptation through a <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope.</b> This aimed to illicit the face gender aftereffect, in both the adapted eye and unadapted eye. Experiment 2 aimed to replicate the IOT of the tilt aftereffect, in a similar fashion. It was hypothesised that the face gender after effect would have a complete IOT due to being processed higher up in the visual hierarchy and that the tilt aftereffect would have a partial IOT as found in previous research. Results of the study supported the hypotheses, in that the gender face aftereffect had an IOT of approximately 82 % and the tilt aftereffect had an approximate IOT of 62 %. Future research should be conducted to determine if other face aftereffects have a similar IOT to the gender face aftereffect and fMRI data should be utilised to support the findings of the current study...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{main goal}} {{of this paper was}} to {{highlight}} the importance of colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs for efficient inventory, monitoring and predicting the health status of forests in changed site conditions. CIR aerial photographs from two aerial surveys conducted in 1989 and 2008 were used to identify and analyze the damage in lowland pedunculated oak (Quercus robur L.) forests during each period, as well as to obtain a dieback trend in the observed period. Material and Methods: The research was conducted in lowland pedunculated oak forests of Josip Kozarac management unit. CIR aerial photographs (1989) of the research area were taken with a classical camera, while aerial images in 2008 were taken with a digital camera and then converted from digital to analogue form (contact copy - photograph) in order to perform photointerpretation with a SOKKIA MS 27 Carl ZEISS Jena <b>mirror</b> <b>stereoscope,</b> magnified by 8 x. The health status of particular trees (crowns) was assessed by means of photointerpretation keys in a stereomodel over a systematic 100 x 100 m sample grid on both 1989 and 2008 aerial photographs. The degree of damage of 4 individual trees was assessed at every grid point in the surveying strips covering the surveyed area. Damage indicators were calculated and thematic maps were constructed {{on the basis of the}} interpretation of data for all the grid points. Results: For the research area a damage index (IO) of 68. 36 % for oak was determined by photointerpreting individual trees (2008); in other words, this percentage of pedunculate oak trees in the surveyed area was found to be in the damage degree of 2. 1 and more. Of 68. 36 % trees classified in the damage degree of 2. 1 or more, mean damage (SO 1) amounted to 52. 16 % and could be classified in the damage degree of 2. 2. In 1989, the mean damage index (IO) for pedunculate oak was 48. 00 %, and pedunculate oak trees with mean damage degree of 2. 1 or more (SO 1) amounted to 36. 03 %. The comparison of photointerpretation results from 1989 and 2008 shows that the damage index (IO) for pedunculate oak increased by more than 20 %, whereas mean damage (SO) rose by almost 15 %. An increase of more than 15 % in mean damage of considerably damaged pedunculate oak trees can also be observed. Conclusions: The obtained results provide not only the current forest condition but also indicate the condition in the field and the purposefulness of aerial surveying, since aerial photographs allow an insight into the condition in the field in a short time period. This in turn enables the efficient application of measures to mitigate the consequences of dieback...|$|E
