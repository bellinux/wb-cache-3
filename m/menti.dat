25|$|Pius XII {{wrote in}} <b>Menti</b> Nostrae that {{the call to}} {{constant}} interior reform and Christian heroism means to be above average, to be a living example of Christian virtue. The strict norms governing their lives are meant to make them models of Christian perfection for lay people. Bishops are encouraged to look at model saints like Boniface, and Pope Pius X. Priests were encouraged to be living examples of the love of Christ and his sacrifice.|$|E

6000|$|To do {{all parties}} justice, the honest {{aboriginal}} Labassecouriennes had an hypocrisy of their own, too; {{but it was}} of a coarse order, such as could deceive few. Whenever a lie was necessary for their occasions, they brought {{it out with a}} careless ease and breadth altogether untroubled by the rebuke of conscience. Not a soul in Madame Beck's house, from the scullion to the directress herself, but was above being ashamed of a lie; they thought nothing of it: to invent might not be precisely a virtue, but it was the most venial of faults. [...] "J'ai <b>menti</b> plusieurs fois," [...] formed an item of every girl's and woman's monthly confession: the priest heard unshocked, and absolved unreluctant. If they had missed going to mass, or read a chapter of a novel, that was another thing: these were crimes whereof rebuke and penance were the unfailing weed.|$|E
60|$|The {{postulate}} {{of philosophy}} {{and at the same}} time the test of philosophic capacity, is no other than the heaven-descended KNOW THYSELF! (E coelo descendit, Gnothi seauton). And this at once practically and speculatively. For as philosophy is neither a science of the reason or understanding only, nor merely a science of morals, but the science of BEING altogether, its primary ground can be neither merely speculative nor merely practical, but both in one. All knowledge rests on the coincidence of an object with a subject. (My readers have been warned in a former chapter that, for their convenience as well as the writer's, the term, subject, is used by me in its scholastic sense as equivalent to mind or sentient being, and as the necessary correlative of object or quicquid objicitur <b>menti.)</b> For we can know that only which is true: and the truth is universally placed in the coincidence of the thought with the thing, of the representation with the object represented.|$|E
