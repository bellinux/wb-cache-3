5|$|Wooden casks {{were still}} in use in the 1960s. The cask beer line was removed in 1976, but {{restored}} in 1984. In 1984 the original brewhouse was converted into a brewery museum. In November 1985 a new £5 million brewhouse opened. Production of Foster's Lager began in 1987. By 1989 the brewery had a production capacity of 1.2 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> annum. Scottish & Newcastle used the John Smith's Brewery to brew many of its ale brands. In 2004, a new £24 million bottling facility was opened in 2004, described as the most modern bottling facility in Europe.|$|E
5|$|A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the {{organization}} had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets {{appeared to be}} oversupplied by at least 2 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.|$|E
25|$|In June 2012, Saudi Arabia reopened the Iraq Pipeline through Saudi Arabia (IPSA), {{which was}} confiscated from Iraq in 2001 and travels from Iraq across Saudi Arabia to a Red Sea port. It {{will have a}} {{capacity}} of 1.65 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day.|$|E

50|$|Global oil {{discovery}} {{peaked in}} 1964, {{and since the}} early 1980s oil production has outpaced new discoveries. The world currently consumes oil {{at the rate of}} 84 <b>million</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>per</b> day (31 billion barrels/year, or 151 m³/s), and consumption is rising, particularly in China.|$|R
50|$|As of 2015, world {{crude oil}} {{production}} had not peaked. Production in 2015 {{was at an}} all-time high of 75.1 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> of oil <b>per</b> day.|$|R
25|$|BP, {{which employs}} about 1,800 people in oil trading and trades over 5 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day {{of oil and}} refined products, is the world's third biggest oil trader after Royal Dutch Shell and Vitol. The {{operation}} {{is estimated to be}} able to generate over $1billion trading profits in a good year.|$|E
25|$|On 29 December 2011, Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) {{announced}} that the country's output of crude oil had risen to over 1 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day (bpd), compared to 1.6 million bpd before the uprising.

25|$|Kerosene {{is widely}} used to power jet engines of {{aircraft}} (jet fuel) and some rocket engines and is also commonly used as a cooking and lighting fuel and for fire toys such as poi. In parts of Asia, kerosene is sometimes used as fuel for small outboard motors or even motorcycles. World total kerosene consumption for all purposes is equivalent to about 1.2 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day.|$|E
50|$|Currently, National Iranian South Oil Company (NISOC) is {{the largest}} Iranian oil company and {{produces}} about 3 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> of oil <b>per</b> day. NISOC output accounts for nearly 83% of total crude production.|$|R

50|$|Oil was {{discovered}} in Wood County in 1941, and the county produced 25 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> of oil <b>per</b> year by 1948. Developed oilfields in Wood County include the Pine Mills Oilfield and the Alba Oilfield.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} calculation {{starts with}} the fact that commercial building lighting consumes in excess of 81.68 terawatts (1999 data) of electricity, according to the U.S. DOE. Thus commercial lighting alone consumes about four to five <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day (equivalent) of petroleum, in line with the alternate rationale above to estimate U.S. lighting energy consumption. Even among developed countries there are large differences in patterns of light use. American cities emit 3–5 times more light to space per capita compared to German cities.|$|E
25|$|Pemex, {{the public}} company {{in charge of}} exploration, extraction, {{transportation}} and marketing of crude oil and natural gas, {{as well as the}} refining and distribution of petroleum products and petrochemicals, {{is one of the largest}} companies in the world by revenue, making US $86 billion in sales a year. Mexico is the sixth-largest oil producer in the world, with 3.7 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day. In 1980 oil exports accounted for 61.6% of total exports; by 2000 it was only 7.3%.|$|E
25|$|The Libyan {{interior}} ministry reported on 3 May 2012 {{that the oil}} fields were operating in a normal fashion and the production was good. He added that the production of oil had reached 1.55 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day the previous week, almost pre-war levels. However, by September 2013, armed groups were blockading oilfields, cutting production to about 100,000 barrels per day, leading to some fuel shortages and blackouts. Many in the armed groups were current and former employees of units set up to secure the oilfields, reacting to corruption and low pay.|$|E
25|$|The {{total cost}} of the project (all paid by U.S. taxpayers) was $134 million, in 1943 U.S. dollars. Total crude {{production}} was 315,000 m³ (2.7 <b>million</b> <b>barrels)</b> of which 7,313 m³ (63,000 barrels) were spilled. The cost of the crude oil was $426 per cubic metre ($67.77 <b>per</b> <b>barrel).</b> Refined petroleum product output was just 138,000 m³ (1.2 <b>million</b> <b>barrels).</b> Cost <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> of refined product was thus $975 per cubic metre, or 97.5 cents per litre ($3.69 a gallon). Adjusted to current dollars using the U.S. consumer price index, in 2000 dollars the oil would have cost $4,214 per cubic metre ($670 a barrel), while the refined product would have been worth an astonishing $9.62 a litre ($36.42 a gallon).|$|R
40|$|Iran possess huge oil {{reservoir}} and occupies {{second place in}} OPEC. Recent investigation has revealed that reservoir capacity in the country amount to 60 billion barrel of oil. Many measures {{has been carried out}} to increase production capacity of oil fields to 4. 2 <b>million</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>per</b> day. Thus any distribution in oil exploration may leave adverse effects on social and economic activities. Unfortunately due to absence of a comprehensive CPM on environmental impact assessment, lots of environmental distribution has been occurred in land and off-shore. It is well known that implementation of EIA can reduce environmental hazards. In the present investigation, all major and minor activities associated with oil exploration is identified and subsequently their effects on physical, chemical and biological environment (aquatic) has been brought out. In this context, economical, social and cultural effects of marine oil exploration is also discussed. Subsequently, all methods of EIA were studied and best mitigation plans were drawn up both for exploitation and exploration phases...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} decade, from 1950-1960 saw Lucky Lager grow to be {{the sales}} leader in the entire West.1 This was coupled with continued distribution expansion {{in an effort to}} saturate the western market. By 1962, Lucky Lager was producing and selling over two <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> of beer <b>per</b> year.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, {{the brewery}} had a {{capacity}} of over 1.5 million hectolitres (over 1 <b>million</b> <b>barrels)</b> <b>per</b> annum. Production in 2012 was 900,000 hectolitres, with around 40,000 hl in own brand sales. The bulk of the brewery's own production is cask conditioned ale but it also sells bottled and keg ales. The company's most famous beer is Strongarm, a 4% abv bitter introduced in 1955, and other regular beers are IPA, Bullion Gold and Trophy Special. Strongarm is made with 18 per cent crystal malt, which contributes significantly to its distinctive ruby red colour and its roasted, malty flavour.|$|E
25|$|In April 1947, new {{producing}} {{oil wells}} were drilled near Iago {{on the southwest}} edge of the Boling salt dome. Soon after, other successful wells were drilled on the north, northeast, and south flanks of the structure. Between 1947 and 1951, the field's production leaped {{to an average of}} 1 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> year. At the end of 1952 there were 180 oil wells. In 1927, a sulphur-rich core sample was retrieved from the caprock and the production of sulphur began. From that year until 1952, about 38 million tons of sulphur were extracted from the Boling salt dome.|$|E
25|$|Iran {{has been}} storing some unsold oil on tankers in the Persian Gulf, {{and it is}} {{building}} new storage tanks on shore. Iran has stored excess oil (21 million barrels, according to Citigroup Global Markets) {{to try to keep}} production levels up—shutting down wells risks harming them and it is costly and time consuming to resume production at a well that has been shut. However, since July 2012, Iran reportedly has been forced to shut down some wells, and overall oil production has fallen to about 2.6 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day from the level of nearly 4.0 mbd at the end of 2011.|$|E
50|$|Today, the United States craft beer {{industry}} employs over 100,000 individuals brewing 15.6 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> of beer <b>per</b> year.

50|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, {{there are}} more than 600 natural oil seeps that leak between one and five <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> of oil <b>per</b> year, {{equivalent}} to roughly 80,000 to 200,000 tonnes. When a petroleum seep forms underwater it may form a peculiar type of volcano known as an asphalt volcano.|$|R
25|$|The EU {{oil embargo}} and the {{restrictions}} on transactions with Iran’s Central Bank have dramatically reduced Iran’s oil sales – a fact acknowledged by Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi to the Majles on 7 January 2013. He indicated sales had fallen 40% from the average of 2.5 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day (mbd) in 2011 (see chart above on Iran oil buyers). This {{is close to the}} estimates of energy analysts, which put Iran’s sales at the end of 2012 in a range of 1 mbd to 1.5 mbd. Reducing Iran’s sales further might depend on whether U.S. officials are able to persuade China, in particular, to further cut buys from Iran—and to sustain those cuts.|$|E
25|$|The {{top three}} oil {{producing}} countries are Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States. About 80 {{percent of the}} world's readily accessible reserves {{are located in the}} Middle East, with 62.5 percent coming from the Arab 5: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Qatar and Kuwait. A large portion of the world's total oil exists as unconventional sources, such as bitumen in Canada and extra heavy oil in Venezuela. While significant volumes of oil are extracted from oil sands, particularly in Canada, logistical and technical hurdles remain, as oil extraction requires large amounts of heat and water, making its net energy content quite low relative to conventional crude oil. Thus, Canada's oil sands are not expected to provide more than a few <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day in the foreseeable future.|$|E
500|$|In 1900, Texas {{suffered}} the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history during the Galveston hurricane. On January 10, 1901, {{the first major}} oil well in Texas, Spindletop, was found south of Beaumont. Other fields were later discovered nearby in East Texas, West Texas, and under the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting [...] "oil boom" [...] transformed Texas. Oil production eventually averaged three <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day at its peak in 1972.|$|E

Refined products were distributed by road, rail, sea and pipeline to the Midlands and Manchester.|$|R
500|$|Then, as OPEC members grew {{weary of}} a multi-year supply contest with {{diminishing}} returns and shrinking financial reserves, the organization finally attempted its first production cut since 2008. Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day was codified {{by a new}} quota agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference. The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered {{the first half of}} 2017 – alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale sector, Libya, Nigeria, spare capacity, and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect. Indonesia announced another [...] "temporary suspension" [...] of its OPEC membership, rather than accepting the organization's requested 5 percent production cut. Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and OPEC in May 2017 decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then. Longtime oil analyst Daniel Yergin [...] "described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides learning to live with prices that are lower than they would like." ...|$|E
