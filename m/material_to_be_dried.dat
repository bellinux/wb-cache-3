50|$|Industrial dryers {{are used}} to {{efficiently}} process large quantities of bulk materials that need reduced moisture levels. Depending on the amount and the makeup of material needing to be dried, industrial dryers come in many different models constructed specifically for the type and quantity of material to be processed. The most common types of industrial dryers are fluidized bed dryers, rotary dryers, rolling bed dryers, conduction dryers, convection dryers, pharmaceutical dryers, suspension/paste dryers, and dispersion dryers. Various factors are considered in determining the correct type of dryer for any given application, including the <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>dried,</b> drying process requirements, production requirements, final product quality requirements and available facility space.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotary dryer}} {{is a type}} of {{industrial}} dryer employed to reduce or minimize the liquid moisture content of the material it is handling by bringing it into direct contact with a heated gas. The dryer is made up of a large, rotating cylindrical tube, usually supported by concrete columns or steel beams. The dryer slopes slightly so that the discharge end is lower than the material feed end in order to convey the material through the dryer under gravity. <b>Material</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>dried</b> enters the dryer, and as the dryer rotates, the material is lifted up by a series of internal fins lining the inner wall of the dryer. When the material gets high enough to roll back off the fins, it falls back {{down to the bottom of}} the dryer, passing through the hot gas stream as it falls. This gas stream can either be moving toward the discharge end from the feed end (known as co-current flow), or toward the feed end from the discharge end (known as counter-current flow). The gas stream can be made up of a mixture of air and combustion gases from a burner, in which case the dryer is called a direct heated dryer. Alternatively, the gas stream may consist of air or another (sometimes inert) gas that is preheated. When the gas stream is preheated by some means where burner combustion gases do not enter the dryer, the dryer known as an indirect-heated type. Often, indirect heated dryers are used when product contamination is a concern. In some cases, a combination of direct-indirect heated rotary dryers are also available to improve the overall efficiency.|$|E

40|$|The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INL) {{has a large}} {{inventory}} of diverse types of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). This legacy is {{in part due to}} the history of the INL as the National Reactor Testing Station, in part to its mission to recover highly enriched uranium from SNF and in part to it’s mission to test and examine SNF after irradiation. The INL also has a large diversity of SNF storage facility, some dating back 50 years in the site history. The success of the INL SNF program is measured by its ability to: 1) achieve safe existing storage, 2) continue to receive SNF from other locations, both foreign and domestic, 3) repackage SNF from wet storage to interim dry storage, and 4) prepare the SNF for dispositioning in a federal repository. Because of the diversity in the SNF and the facilities at the INL, the INL is addressing almost very condition that may exist in the SNF world. Many of solutions developed by the INL <b>are</b> applicable <b>to</b> other SNF storage sites as they develop their management strategy. The SNF being managed by the INL are in a variety of conditions, from intact assemblies to individual rods or plates to powders, rubble, and metallurgical mounts. Some of the fuel has been in wet storage for over forty years. The fuel is stored bare, or in metal cans and either wet under water or dry in vaults, caissons or casks. Inspections have shown varying degrees of corrosion and degradation of the fuel and the storage cans. Some of the fuel has been recanned under water, and the conditions of the fuel inside the second or third can are unknown. The fuel has been stored in one of 10 different facilities: five wet pools and one casks storage pad, one vault, two generations of caisson facilities, and one modular Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI). The wet pools range from forty years old to the most modern pool in the US Department of Energy (DOE) complex. The near-term objective is moving the fuel in the older wet storage facilities to interim dry storage facilities, thus permitting the shutdown and decommission of the older facilities. Two wet pool facilities, one at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center and the other at Test Area North, were targeted for initial SNF movements since {{these were some of the}} oldest at the INL.

The pyrolysis experiment include the dry and fresh cassava rhizome cylinders with 36, 40 and 44 mm. in diameter and the pyrolysis temperature varied from 400 to 500 oC. The experimental result showed that the temperature distribution is caused by heat transfer from the surface to the inner cassava rhizome on both the radial and axial directions. The effect of the wood diameter and pyrolysis temperature affected the mass loss rate and the pyrolysis time. The large wood diameter caused lower mass loss rate and the pyrolysis time was longer.

It has a wide range of uses including pulpwood, poles, firewood, charcoal, flooring, mining, furniture and general carpentry. Conservation of plant genetic resources including those used in agriculture, horticulture and forestry has become an issue of common global concern. Cryopreservation involves the storage of plant material at ultra low temperature (- 196 °C). The techniques for cryopreservation currently in use are varied and include the older classical techniques and the new vitrification-based techniques. Storage of biological material at - 196 °C causes metabolic functions to slow down considerably and minimize biological degradation, thus allowing for long-term preservation. However, there are particular stresses associated with the freezing process, e. g., ice crystal formation and cryo-dehydration, which may severely damage the <b>material.</b> Tolerance <b>to</b> <b>drying</b> <b>is</b> the key <b>to</b> successful cryopreservation and is commonly used in the preparation of in vitro material for cryostorage.

Although both optimisation of the heat production system and the <b>drying</b> chamber can <b>be</b> considered separately, it is useful for the industry <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> globally supervise the production system and reduce the drying time despite the local optimised technical solution already available.

The methods suggested in this paper are based on thermodynamical knowledge on water exchange in order to achieve an online identification of the drying curve mathematical model using a set of known data at the current time.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been focus on {{determining}} the drying behaviour of particulate material at low moisture contents (< 1 %), {{as a result of}} increased energy costs and purity requirements for dried products. As little is known about. the drying behaviour of particulate material at these low moisture levels, driers have been oversized by including large safety factors in the sizing calculations, thus incurring unnecessary capital expenditure. A research programme was formulated in an attempt to provide a greater understanding of the moisture movement processes occurring at these low moisture levels. The results of this work indicate the significant effects that influence the drying behaviour of particulate material, which may be implemented into drier sizing calculations. Most particulate materials require a significant amount of energy to remove residual amounts of moisture, particularly from microporous media or from strongly hydrophilic surfaces. Quantifying the energy required to remove this bound moisture is possible from a knowledge of heats of wetting as a function of moisture content. These can be calculated from isotherms under controlled conditions using the Clausius-Claperyon equation. As part of a research programme to look at this type of drying behaviour, a novel apparatus was designed and constructed. The function of this apparatus was to record drying profiles of particulate material under various drying conditions and sample sizes. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the drying profiles were the overiding parameters in the design of such an apparatus. Moisture movement at low moisture levels in thin layers and single particulate arrangements can be described by two mechanisms. Solute bound to hydrophilic and/or active pore surfaces requires a normally distributed activation energy to be overcome, for surface diffusion to occur. Solute held in "water clusters" by hydrophobic media, such as polymeric, some plastic and generally swelling solids, can be described by Fickian movement similar to the familiar transport processes known to occur at higher moisture contents. Thus, it is possible to extrapolate the drying kinetics at higher moisture contents to lower-moisture contents in this instance, but not for the surface diffusion process which takes place only at lower moisture levels. For the drying of thicker layers and beds of particles, accurate overall diffusion coefficients need to include a gas phase diffusion term for gaseous movement through the particulate bed. The studies here have extended the understanding of the drying kinetics dissimilarities between drying single isolated particles, single particle agglomerates, thin layers and beds of particulate material. In sizing calculations of drying units, preliminary kinetics tests on the <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>dried</b> need to be performed under similar bed geometries to that in the full-scale drying unit. For example, thin-layer experiments appear to provide accurate drying kinetic data for the design of cascade rotary driers. The thickness of the thin layer in the drying kinetic tests is determined by the observed thickness of the falling film of material during operation of the cascade rotary drier. Higher gas velocities in a fluidised bed, or flash driers, may be best modelled by drying kinetics studies on single particles or single particle agglomerates. However, at lower gas velocities, thin-layer tests may be more suitable because the drying material in the fluidised bed may dry in a bubbling motion. The final section of this work looked at selective drying of various isopropyl alcohol/water mixtures at low moisture levels. Selective drying at higher moisture contents is generally well understood, by applying azeotropic principles to describe liquid-phase moisture removal from porous matrices. Two-component bound moisture in a porous particulate resides in a solid phase. It is not possible for a binary mixture bound directly to the solid to form an azeotropic mixture. Modelling the removal of this binary bound moisture was shown to fit a surface diffusion model, in which each of the two solvents was treated as a separate entity. In short, selective drying is prevalent at low moisture contents but can be described by two distinct surface diffusion models working independently on each binary species...|$|E
