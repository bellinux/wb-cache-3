5|$|Atangana lobbied in {{his later}} life for public health causes, such as the {{eradication}} of sleeping sickness. He never supported the expansion of Cameroun's public school system, since he believed that educated subjects <b>might</b> <b>one</b> day challenge his rule. Atangana's health began to fail him beginning in August 1943. On 1 September, he died in Mvolyé, Yaoundé.|$|E
5|$|Atangana's {{appointment}} irritated {{members of}} the Bulu ethnic group. They feared they <b>might</b> <b>one</b> day lose German favour, or worse yet, fall under the dominion of the Ewondo. This culminated in the 1912 Bulu uprising led by Martin-Paul Samba, a German-trained man much like Atangana. The rebellion was crushed and Samba executed.|$|E
5|$|Carter also {{reflects}} on the intriguing possibility, however remote, that a discovery in an unexplored library <b>might</b> <b>one</b> day bring some of this missing music to light. As of 2015 this has not occurred; however, a setting of Rinuccini's libretto by the British composer Alexander Goehr was performed at London's Royal Opera House on 15 September 1995, under the title Arianna. Goehr worked from Rinuccini's original script and, {{as a tribute to}} the historic opera, incorporated sections of Monteverdi's setting of the lament into his score.|$|E

5|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{had opened}} the {{previous}} year, and proved a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from the parallel canal, and indicated that longer distances, not merely feeders to a harbour or from a colliery, could be dealt with, and everywhere business people were considering where a railway might advantageously be built next.

5|$|The {{discovery}} {{was reported in}} September in Courrier de l'Égypte, the official newspaper of the French expedition. The anonymous reporter expressed a hope that the stone <b>might</b> <b>one</b> day {{be the key to}} deciphering hieroglyphs. In 1800, three of the Commission's technical experts devised ways to make copies of the texts on the stone. One of these experts was Jean-Joseph Marcel, a printer and gifted linguist, who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the Egyptian Demotic script, rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time, rather than Syriac as had originally been thought. It was artist and inventor Nicolas-Jacques Conté who found a way to use the stone itself as a printing block to reproduce the inscription. A slightly different method was adopted by Antoine Galland. The prints that resulted were taken to Paris by General Charles Dugua. Scholars in Europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt to read them.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} {{has been}} introduced to suitable locations outside Europe as an attractive tree for park, street or garden. These include the United States, Canada, Australia (Victoria and Tasmania), Chile and New Zealand, Patagonia and the laurel forests of Madeira and the Azores. At {{the time of its}} introduction it was probably not appreciated that its prolific production of seeds <b>might</b> <b>one</b> day cause a problem to the landscape as it spread and out-competed native species. The tree is now considered to be an environmental weed in some parts of Australia (Yarra Ranges, Victoria) and also Mount Macedon, near Daylesford, parts of the Dandenong Ranges, where it is naturalised in the eucalypt forests. The sycamore is also scattered in north-eastern Tasmania and also at Taroona, near the Derwent River, in southern Hobart. It is considered to be an invasive species in New Zealand, Norway, and environmentally sensitive locations in the United Kingdom.|$|E

This led, writes Powell, to a situation in which Bamber felt increasingly alienated from his family and their life in the countryside, as did his sister, who was also sent to boarding school.|$|E

25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case.

Rarabe, through his military prowess, subjugated various tribes he found {{in the region and}} would buy lands from the Khoikhoi to establish his own kingdom.

25|$|Under {{leadership}} of José María Valiente and with consent of Don Javier, the collegial Carlist executive commenced cautious {{collaboration with the}} regime. It is not entirely clear how this major change of policy was related to appearance of prince Hugues. According to one theory, the young entourage decided to introduce him banking on a new strategy and posing to present an offer to Franco. According to another, with new long-term perspectives related to his son opening, Don Javier changed course hoping that the regime <b>might</b> <b>one</b> day crown the young prince. One more reading {{has it that the}} changing political course and the introduction of Hugues coincided as results of two independent processes. One way or another, starting 1957 Don Javier was gradually permitting his son to assume more and more roles within Carlism.|$|E

25|$|However, memory scepticism {{has been}} criticized as being {{applicable}} to public language, also. If one person can misremember, {{it is entirely possible}} that several people can misremember. So memory scepticism could be applied with equal effect to ostensive definitions given in a public language. For example, Jim and Jenny <b>might</b> <b>one</b> day decide to call some particular tree T; but the next day both misremember which tree it was they named. If they were depending entirely on their memory, and had not written down the location of the tree, or told anyone else, then they would appear to be with the same difficulties as the individual who defined S ostensively. And so, if this is the case, the argument presented against private language would apply equally to public language.|$|E
25|$|In February 1957, Kishi become Prime Minister. His main {{concerns}} were with foreign policy, especially with revising the 1952 U.S-Japan Security Treaty, which he felt had turned Japan into a virtual American protectorate. Revising the security treaty was {{understood to be}} the first step towards his ultimate goal of abolishing Article 9. Besides his desire for a more independent foreign policy, Kishi wanted to establish close economic relations with the nations of South-East Asia to create a Japanese economic sphere of influence, which <b>might</b> <b>one</b> day become a political sphere of influence as well. Finally, Kishi wanted the Allies to free all of the Class B and Class C war criminals still in serving their prison sentences, arguing that for Japan to play its role in the Cold War as a Western ally required forgetting about Japan's war crimes in the past.|$|E
25|$|After issuing the {{challenge}} to McKinney, Joe begins to find himself becoming very popular around the office for his bravery. Meg and Natalie, however, do not feel fighting McKinney will solve anything, and both attempt to tell Joe as much, to no avail. Joe seeks out the aid of an ex B movie star-turned-martial arts instructor named Chuck Scarett (Jim Belushi) to teach him to defend himself. Things seem to finally be going right for Joe, as he has begun to see Meg and has even been given a promotion at work he had been hoping for. When Meg realizes Jeremy (Greg Germann), a colleague she works closely with for the company (who {{also happens to be}} attracted to her), only gave Joe a non-existing position at the office to prevent him from suing the company, she resigns in fear that she <b>might</b> <b>one</b> day have to demote or even fire Joe. Meg again tries to persuade Joe not to fight McKinney, and finally gives him an ultimatum: if he does not call off the fight with McKinney, their relationship is over.|$|E
