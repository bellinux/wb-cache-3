5|$|At the {{midpoint}} of the twelfth century, the kingdom was under the overlordship of Diarmait <b>Mac</b> Murchada, King of Leinster (died 1171). The latter's ultimate overking, however, was Muirchertach <b>Mac</b> Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1166). The year after Brodar's death, numerous sources indicate that <b>Mac</b> Murchada, with a force of Dubliners in tow, formally rendered submission to <b>Mac</b> Lochlainn. In 1162, the fifteenth–sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reveals that <b>Mac</b> Murchada gained an almost-unprecedented authority over Dublin. There is reason to suspect that his success stemmed from assistance received from <b>Mac</b> Lochlainn. The latter, for example, is recorded by the same source to have laid siege to the town within the year. In fact, this military campaign may have been undertaken to counter the Dubliners' attempt to install Gofraid <b>mac</b> Amlaíb, King of the Isles (died 1187) to the kingship of Dublin, as recounted by the thirteenth–fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mac</b> Lochlainn was slain in 1166, leaving <b>Mac</b> Murchada to {{fend off}} his own enemies alone. Other than <b>Mac</b> Murchada himself, another man making a bid for the high-kingship was Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht (died 1198). Within {{the same year as}} <b>Mac</b> Lochlainn's demise, Ua Conchobair and his allies expulsed <b>Mac</b> Murchada from not only Dublin, but Ireland altogether; and Ua Conchobair himself was duly {{recognised}} as High King of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mac</b> {{returns to}} work after a month's leave. When Caroline meets him she implies that she is engaged to Guy. <b>Mac</b> and Guy are then drunk in a bar, where <b>Mac</b> tells Guy {{he is going to}} die {{in a couple of weeks}} and makes Guy promise he will not tell Caroline. However, Guy tells Martin, who then {{complains}} to him about his selfishness. However, Caroline walks in and overhears the argument. Meanwhile, <b>Mac</b> suggests to Sue that she finds someone else to love. Caroline confronts <b>Mac</b> about marrying her. <b>Mac</b> defends himself by saying it would be better for her to marry Guy because he will live longer. Guy later decides to do the right thing, and tells <b>Mac</b> to propose to Caroline because they love each other. Caroline and <b>Mac</b> therefore become engaged and later marry, where the majority of the core cast are in attendance. At the wedding, Sue is seen with a new boyfriend. The special ends with Caroline floating away into the sky holding a mass of helium balloons.|$|E
40|$|Korea Univ, CIST, Korea Inst Informat Security & Cryptol, Elect & Telcommun Res Inst, Ellipsis, Korea Univ, LG CNS, Natl Inst Math SciAlmost all current block-cipher-based <b>MACs</b> {{reduce their}} {{security}} to the pseudorandomness of their underlying block ciphers, {{except for a few}} of them to the unpredictability, a strictly weaker security notion than pseudorandomness. However, the latter <b>MACs</b> offer relatively low efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of constructing rate- 1 <b>MACs</b> from related-key unpredictable block ciphers. First, we show all the existing rate- 1 <b>MACs</b> are insecure when instantiated with a special kind of related-key unpredictable block cipher. The attacks on them inspire us to propose an assumption that all the chaining values are available to adversaries for theoretically analyzing such <b>MACs.</b> Under this assumption, we study the security of 64 rate- 1 <b>MACs</b> in keyed PGV model, and find that 1) 15 <b>MACs</b> are meaningless; 2) 25 <b>MACs</b> are vulnerable to three kinds of attacks respectively and 3) 24 <b>MACs</b> are provably secure when their underlying block ciphers are related-key unpredictable. Furthermore, we refine these 24 provably secure rate- 1 <b>MACs</b> in Compact PGV model by removing a useless parameter away, and find that the resulting 6 provably secure <b>MACs</b> are in fact equivalent to each other. In the aspect of efficiency, however, the low rate of these secure <b>MACs</b> does not necessarily mean they can run faster than none rate- 1 one <b>MACs,</b> due to their large number of key schedules...|$|R

40|$|Mammary carcinomas and adenocarcinomas (<b>MACs)</b> are {{relatively}} common tumors in cats. The postexcisional survival period of affected cats is {{inversely proportional to}} tumor size, but the reported median survival periods for different tumor size categories is quite variable. This variability diminishes the prognostic value of reported data. In our study, cats with <b>MACs</b> greater than 3 cm in diameter had a 12 -month median survival period, whereas those with <b>MACs</b> less than 3 cm in diameter had a 21 -month survival period. Survival periods for cats with <b>MACs</b> smaller than 3 cm ranged from 3 to 54 months; therefore, tumor size alone is of limited prognostic value in cats with <b>MACs</b> smaller than 3 cm in diameter. In cats with <b>MACs</b> larger than 3 cm in diameter, tumor size appears to have much higher prognostic relevance, because this study, as well as others, have indicated that cats with <b>MACs</b> greater than 3 cm in diameter have a poor prognosis, with median survival periods ranging from 4 to 12 months...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} novel {{responsive}} materials with a displacement conversion capability was further developed through {{the design of}} new machine-augmented composites (<b>MACs).</b> Embedded converter machines and <b>MACs</b> with improved geometry were designed and fabricated by multi-material 3 D printing. This technique proved to be very effective in fabricating these novel composites with tuneable elastic moduli of the matrix and the embedded machines and excellent bonding between them. Substantial improvement in the displacement conversion efficiency of the new <b>MACs</b> over the existing ones was demonstrated. Also, the new design trebled the energy absorption of the <b>MACs.</b> Applications in energy absorbers as well as mechanical sensors and actuators are thus envisaged. A further type of <b>MACs</b> with conversion ability, viz. conversion of compressive displacements to torsional ones, was also proposed...|$|R

5|$|Control of {{the wealthy}} coastal kingdom was bitterly contested during Ascall's floruit, with members of his {{immediate}} family, as well as Islesmen and Irishmen, all securing power for brief periods of time.
