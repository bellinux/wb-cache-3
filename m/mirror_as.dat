5|$|The {{first step}} was a precise {{characterization}} of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the conic constant of the <b>mirror</b> <b>as</b> built was , instead of the intended âˆ’1.00230. The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the <b>mirror,</b> <b>as</b> well as by analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} on the back wall are recognized as representing Minerva Punishing Arachne and Apollo's Victory Over Marsyas. Both stories involve Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom and patron of the arts. These two legends are both stories of mortals challenging gods and the dreadful consequences. One scholar {{points out that the}} legend dealing with two women, Minerva and Arachne, is {{on the same side of}} the <b>mirror</b> <b>as</b> the queen's reflection while the male legend is on the side of the king.|$|E
5|$|Tsamere {{comes out}} of character, thanks the audience, writers and {{producers}} of the show, and explains that the preceding story is a fiction. He talks about his stage fright and goes off on a tangent about the bulbs around mirrors in dressing rooms; he asks a row of the audience to stand repeatedly to check whether pillars in the theatre are load-bearing. He ends by saying {{that he does not}} need the <b>mirror,</b> <b>as</b> he does not wear make-up.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, an {{intrusive}} {{public works}} inspector (Carter Jahncke) tests {{the air quality}} at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee that everything is fine. The next day, however, Gee goes upstairs and finds a team wearing protective respirator suits removing hazardous asbestos from the wall. Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) for not informing the detectives about the work, and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine and the car he plans to build. Crosetti feigns disinterest, but the next day presents Lewis with a rear-view <b>mirror</b> <b>as</b> a gift.|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York City, Willis reorganized, {{along with}} George Pope Morris, the weekly New York <b>Mirror</b> <b>as</b> the daily Evening Mirror in 1844 with a weekly {{supplement}} called the Weekly Mirror, {{in part due}} to the rising cost of postage. By this time, Willis was a popular writer (a joke was that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was Germany's version of N. P. Willis) {{and one of the first}} commercially successful magazine writers in America. In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book The Opal founded by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per article and $5,000 per year, a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis's salary.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{government}} relented in mid-1915, {{having been}} warned by Theodore Roosevelt that the reporting limitations were affecting {{public opinion in}} the United States, Valentine Williams became the Daily Mail's first accredited war correspondent. No longer in prison, Beach Thomas resumed his war reporting in December of the same year, when Williams enlisted in the Irish Guards. As with the other accredited journalists, he was paid by the War Office rather than by his newspaper {{and they were all}} assured that {{they would be able to}} publish memoirs of their service to offset the differential between an officer's pay and that of a journalist. Beach Thomas filed reports from places such as the Somme in a format matching that of his colleagues, who regularly downplayed the unpleasant aspects of the conflict such as the nature of death. His reports were published in the Daily <b>Mirror</b> <b>as</b> well as the Daily Mail.|$|E

5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the <b>mirror</b> <b>as</b> well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, {{lightning}} {{struck the}} hotel and the lights of both the hallway and elevator flickered out. A ghostly wind blows through a window and the reflection of riders in the elevator became distorted.

25|$|A {{plane mirror}} forms a virtual image {{positioned}} behind the mirror.

25|$|Optical SETI {{supporters}} have conducted paper {{studies of the}} effectiveness of using contemporary high-energy lasers and a ten-meter diameter <b>mirror</b> <b>as</b> an interstellar beacon. The analysis shows that an infrared pulse from a laser, focused into a narrow beam by such a mirror, would appear thousands of times brighter than the Sun to a distant civilization in the beam's line of fire. The Cyclops study proved incorrect in suggesting a laser beam would be inherently hard to see.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} Mami Watanabe {{from the}} comic book Factionalists is the physical manifestation of the spirit entity Mami Wata. The author utilized a number of features to convey this. Her name Mami Watanabe is a play on Mami Wata. Despite being Japanese her skin is darkened in Japanese ganguro style. She also has a tattoo of a snake on her body and receives a watch and a <b>mirror</b> <b>as</b> gifts in the series, two items generally associated with Mami Wata.|$|E
25|$|Collins then quit Sylvania {{and formed}} the Computer Identics Corporation.

25|$|For flat mirrors, {{the law of}} {{reflection}} implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance behind the <b>mirror</b> <b>as</b> the objects are {{in front of the}} mirror. The image size {{is the same as the}} object size. The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which we perceive as a left-right inversion. Images formed from reflection in two (or any even number of) mirrors are not parity inverted. Corner reflectors retroreflect light, producing reflected rays that travel back in the direction from which the incident rays came.|$|E
25|$|Eurasian magpie (Pica pica): The Eurasian magpie is {{the only}} non-mammal to have passed the mirror test. Researchers applied a small red, yellow or black sticker to the throat of five Eurasian magpies, {{where they could be}} seen by the bird only by using a mirror. The birds were then given a mirror. The feel of the sticker on their throats did not seem to alarm the magpies. However, when the birds with {{coloured}} stickers caught a glimpse of themselves in the mirror, they scratched at their throatsâ€”a clear indication that they recognised the image in the <b>mirror</b> <b>as</b> their own. Those that received a black sticker, invisible against the black neck feathers, did not react.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} a curved mirror to form an image may have been known {{since the time of}} Euclid and had been {{extensively}} studied by Alhazen in the 11th century. Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a <b>mirror</b> <b>as</b> the image forming objective. NiccolÃ² Zucchi, an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book Optica philosophia of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking into the mirror with a hand held concave lens but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the mirror, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the image.|$|E
