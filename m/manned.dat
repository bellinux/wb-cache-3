5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending <b>manned</b> missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 {{was the first}} <b>manned</b> spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last <b>manned</b> mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and <b>manned</b> spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E

This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus Apollo Command/Service Module with a Soyuz spacecraft. The mission took place in July 1975. This was the last US <b>manned</b> space flight until the first orbital flight of the Space Shuttle in April 1981.|$|E

5|$|The {{first and}} second lines of Polish defences were <b>manned</b> by regular forces. These {{included}} three Polish infantry divisions: the 11th (from the Bug River to Leśniakowizna), the 8th (Leśniakowizna to Okuniew) and the 15th (Okuniew to the Vistula River). The 1st Army also held the newly arrived 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division in reserve (Marki–Kobyłka), while the Northern Front's headquarters reserves consisted of the 10th Infantry Division and some smaller units. The third line was <b>manned</b> by units of mobilised State Police {{and a variety of}} volunteer units of low combat value. Out of those units, initially only the 11th Division under Colonel Bolesław Jaźwiński took part in the fight. Its 48th Kresy Rifles Regiment (Colonel Łukowski) <b>manned</b> the Bugonarew-Mokre line, the 46th Kaniów Rifles Regiment (Colonel Krzywobłocki) <b>manned</b> the Mokre-Czarna perimeter, and the 47th Kresy Rifles Regiment (Lt.

To the south of the 11th Division were positions around Wołomin <b>manned</b> by the 8th Infantry Division, consisting of the 36th, 21st and 33rd Infantry Regiments, as well as the 13th Infantry Regiment held in reserve, which later took part in the Battle of Ossów.|$|E

5|$|Administrator Webb {{realized}} {{that in order}} to keep Apollo costs under control, he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruited Dr. George E. Mueller for a high management job. Mueller accepted, on the condition that he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of <b>Manned</b> Space Flight (OMSF). On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for <b>Manned</b> Space Flight, to replace then Associate Administrator D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the <b>Manned</b> Spacecraft Center (Gilruth) Marshall Space Flight Center (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.|$|E

5|$|Gemini was a {{step forward}} for NASA's <b>manned</b> space program: the Gemini capsule was larger and more {{advanced}} than Mercury, capable of supporting two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be <b>manned</b> in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four.|$|E
