25|$|<b>My</b> <b>beloved</b> children, I do {{not know}} what you await to shake off the heavy yoke and {{laborious}} servitude in which the subjugation of the Spanish has placed you. I have traveled through all of the province and have inspected all of the villages and, considering carefully the usefulness the Spanish subjugation has brought to us, I have not found a single thing but painful and inexorable servitude.... The demand for tribute is not appeased by the poverty that locks up our comrades as in a jail, nor is the thirst for our blood satisfied by the continuous whippings that bite and tear our bodies to pieces.|$|E

500|$|Scottish {{mezzo-soprano}} Karen Cargill summarized [...] "Maria Radner, <b>my</b> <b>beloved</b> friend" [...] in The Guardian: [...] "She was {{the most}} generous-spirited person I have ever met. Hysterical laughter, an obsession with all things Burberry, unadulterated passion for Bayern Munich and the warmest of hugs were things you could always be guaranteed of when you were with her. Her son and partner were her whole life." [...] Further down Cargill qualified the latter, in that [...] "Music was Maria's entire life until she met her partner and they had their son." ...|$|E
500|$|K. M. Munshi had {{a totally}} {{different}} take on the myth in his Krishnavatara series. Though Putana came with evil intentions, she is portrayed as being happy to see Krishna and her maternal instinct rises, telling her [...] "Take this lovely boy to your breast. You are a wicked and miserable woman. You have never seen joy before, joy which thrills your whole body and mind with mad delight." [...] Overjoyed and forgetful of her poisoned breasts, she took Krishna {{in her lap and}} suckled him. In the process, she surrenders to Krishna saying [...] "I give you all, <b>my</b> <b>beloved</b> child... I am yours." [...] Further, Putana is purified and liberated from her mortal body by Krishna.|$|E
500|$|On May 10, 1843, {{after seven}} years, Longfellow {{received}} a letter from Fanny Appleton agreeing to marry him. He was too restless to take a carriage and walked 90 minutes to meet her at her house. They were soon married; Nathan Appleton bought the Craigie House as a wedding present, and Longfellow lived there {{for the rest of his}} life. His love for Fanny is evident in the following lines from his only love poem, the sonnet [...] "The Evening Star" [...] which he wrote in October 1845: [...] "O <b>my</b> <b>beloved,</b> my sweet Hesperus! My morning and my evening star of love!" [...] He once attended a ball without her and noted, [...] "The lights seemed dimmer, the music sadder, the flowers fewer, and the women less fair." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2010, Sotomayor {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Alfred A. Knopf to publish a memoir about the early part of her life. She received an advance of nearly $1.2 million for the work, which was published in January 2013 and titled <b>My</b> <b>Beloved</b> World (Mi mundo adorado in the simultaneously published Spanish edition). It focuses on her life up to 1992, with recollections of growing up in housing projects in New York and descriptions of the challenges she faced. It received good reviews, with Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times describing it as [...] "a compelling and powerfully written memoir about identity and coming of age. ... It's an eloquent and affecting testament to the triumph of brains and hard work over circumstance, of a childhood dream realized through extraordinary will and dedication." [...] She staged a book tour to promote the work, and it debuted atop the New York Times Best Seller List.|$|E
500|$|As Rosas {{aged and}} his health declined, the {{question}} of who would succeed him became a growing concern among his supporters. His wife Encarnación had died in October 1838 after a long illness. Although devastated by his loss, Rosas exploited her death to raise support for his regime. Not long after, at the age of 47, he began an affair with his fifteen-year-old maid, María Eugenia Castro, with whom he had five illegitimate children. From his marriage to Encarnación, Rosas had two children: Juan Bautista Pedro and Manuela Robustiana. Rosas established a hereditary dictatorship, naming the children from his marriage as his successors, stating that [...] "hey are both worthy children of <b>my</b> <b>beloved</b> Encarnación, and if, God willing, I die, then you will find that they are capable of succeeding me." [...] It is unknown whether Rosas was a closet monarchist. Later during his exile, Rosas would declare that Princess Alice of the United Kingdom would be the ideal ruler for his country. Nonetheless, in public he stated that his regime was republican in nature.|$|E

Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor and Kennedy's opponent in the 1994 senate race, called Kennedy [...] "the kind of man you could like even if he was your adversary" [...] and former First Lady Nancy Reagan said she was [...] "terribly saddened". [...] She went on, [...] "Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy family.... I will miss him." [...] Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the President pro tempore of the Senate, issued a statement on Kennedy's death in which he said [...] "My heart and soul weeps at the loss of my best friend in the Senate, <b>my</b> <b>beloved</b> friend, Ted Kennedy." [...] (Byrd had broken down on the Senate floor and cried uncontrollably when Kennedy's cancer diagnosis was made public the previous year.) Upon his death, his sister Jean is the only one still living of the nine Kennedy siblings.|$|E

500|$|Mephedrone {{is one of}} {{hundreds}} of designer drugs or legal highs that have been reported in recent years, including artificial chemicals such as synthetic cannabis and semisynthetic substances such as methylhexanamine. These drugs are primarily developed to avoid being controlled by laws against illegal drugs, thus giving them the label of designer drugs. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the synthesis of mephedrone was first reported in 1929 by Saem de Burnaga Sanchez in the Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France, under the name [...] "toluyl-alpha-monomethylaminoethylcetone", but the compound remained an obscure product of academia until 2003, when it was [...] "re-discovered" [...] and publicised by an underground chemist on The Hive website, working under the pseudonym [...] "Kinetic". Kinetic posted on the site, [...] "I’ve been bored {{over the last couple of}} days and had a few fun reagents lying around, so I thought I’d try and make some 1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-methylaminopropanone hydrochloride, or 4-methylmethcathinone." [...] before going on to describe that after taking it, the user had a [...] "fantastic sense of well-being that I haven’t got from any drug before except <b>my</b> <b>beloved</b> Ecstasy." [...] In interviews Kinetic was described as [...] "a mathematician who used to design sleeping pills for a major pharmaceutical company" [...] and he stated that he was based in Israel when he rediscovered mephedrone.|$|E
500|$|On 15 August 1915, Tatiana {{wrote her}} mother another letter expressing {{her desire to}} help her bear the burdens {{brought on by the}} war: [...] "I simply can't tell you how awfully sorry I am for you, <b>my</b> <b>beloved</b> ones. I am so sorry I can in no way help you or be useful. In such moments I am sorry I'm not a man." [...] As Tatiana grew into adulthood, she {{undertook}} more public appearances than her sisters and headed committees. Vyrubova recalled that she became better known to the public than her three sisters because of her attention to duty and her ability to engage those she met. In their memoirs, both her mother's friend, Vyrubova, and lady in waiting Lili Dehn recalled that Tatiana, the most social of the sisters, longed for friends her own age but her social life was restricted by her rank and her mother's distaste for society. She also had a more introspective side, known only to her closest friends and family. [...] "With her, as with her mother, shyness and reserve were accounted as pride, but, once you knew her and had gained her affection, this reserve disappeared and the real Tatiana became apparent," [...] Dehn recalled. [...] "She was a poetical creature, always yearning for the ideal, and dreaming of great friendships which might be hers." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Overmind Carissa Pavlica {{commented on}} Tom Pelphrey guest role saying [...] "I adored Guiding Light and {{considering}} the roles Tom Pelphrey (<b>my</b> <b>beloved</b> Jonathan from GL) gets after his run as the bad-boy, I immediately suspected {{he would be}} the killer. Turned out I was wrong, but he was still a class A jerk". Of the episode she said, [...] "The suspects pile up so fast and furious, that it's difficult to figure out the perpetrator until they are ready to tell you. She added that she had [...] "much respect for that method of storytelling". She continued, [...] "There is nothing I enjoy less than watching the crime being committed in the first minutes of a show and then watching the respective squad of police and detectives miss clues we already know. Body of Proof isn't afraid to allow the audience to use their intellect". Pavlica also enjoyed the relationship between Megan and Lacey, calling it [...] "heart wrenching" [...] saying that she had a tear in eye due to the scenes. [...] "I'm enjoying how the writers are piecing together the strained relationship they had, in a realistic, no holds barred way". However, Pavica was afraid to [...] "jinx" [...] the show, as she had [...] "no idea of Body of Proofs place in the ratings", adding that she was [...] "nervous" [...] as it is up against shows such as The Good Wife and Parenthood.|$|E

500|$|Malouma began singing as a child, first {{performed}} on the stage when she was twelve and began appearing in solo concerts with a traditional repertoire by age fifteen. In addition to her father's guidance, she was inspired by other traditional artists including Oum Kalthoum, Abdel Halim Hafez, Fairouz, Dimi and Sabah. As she matured, she increasingly became interested in blues music, which appealed to her as it bore a resemblance to the traditional music she knew. Malouma wrote her first song, [...] "Habibi Habeytou" [...] (<b>My</b> <b>beloved,</b> I loved him) when she was sixteen. It was a song protesting the tradition of men turning their wives {{out of their homes}} to marry younger women. It brought her instant recognition, but created a backlash, causing physical attacks from the established Muslim community. Soon after she wrote it, her family moved to Nouakchott, the capital, to help her launch her music career, but in the strongly traditional society, Malouma was forced to marry, abandoning singing until the late 1980s. She was later accused by her father of ruining his reputation. In addition to the criticisms stemming from her songs, she had disgraced her family by divorcing twice: her first husband had been forced upon her, while the second came from a noble family, who would not allow her to sing. Yet after hearing one of her songs, her father commented: [...] "You have created something new and I find it touching. Unfortunately, I will not live long {{enough to be able to}} protect you." ...|$|E
500|$|Critias and his compatriots, in {{the light}} of these events, decided that Theramenes had become an {{intolerable}} threat to their rule; accordingly, speaking before the assembly of the 3,000, Critias denounced Theramenes as a born traitor, always ready to shift his political allegiances with the expediencies of the moment. Famously, he branded him with the nickname [...] "cothurnus", the name of a boot worn on the stage that could fit either foot; Theramenes, he proclaimed, was ready to serve either the democratic or oligarchic cause, seeking only to further his own personal interest. In an impassioned response, Theramenes denied that his politics had ever been inconsistent. He had always, he insisted, favored a moderate policy, neither extreme democracy nor extreme oligarchy, and held true to the ideal of a government composed of men of hoplite status or higher, who would be able to effectively serve the state. This speech had a substantial effect on the audience, and Critias saw that, if the case were brought to a vote, Theramenes would be acquitted. Accordingly, after conferring with the Thirty, Critias ordered men with daggers to line the stage in front of the audience and then struck Theramenes' name from the roster of the 3,000, denying him his right to a trial. Theramenes, springing to a nearby altar for sanctuary, admonished the assemblage not to permit his murder, but to no avail; the Eleven, keepers of the prison, entered, dragged him away, and forced him to drink a cup of hemlock. Theramenes, imitating a popular drinking game in which the drinker toasted a loved one as he finished his cup, downed the poison and then flung the dregs to the floor, exclaiming [...] "Here's to the health of <b>my</b> <b>beloved</b> Critias!" ...|$|E
