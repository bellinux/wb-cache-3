6000|$|Wait, we say: our {{years are}} long; <b>Men</b> <b>are</b> <b>weak,</b> out Man is strong; Since the stars first curved their rings, We have looked on many things: Great wars come and great wars go, Wolf-tracks light on polar snow; We shall see him come and gone, This {{second-hand}} Napoleon. [...] Spin, spin, Clotho, spin! [...] Lachesis, twist! and, Atropos, sever! [...] In the shadow, year out, year in, [...] The silent headsman waits forever.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{alters the}} case, Captain Gar'ner. Nobody {{is obliged to}} tell of his sealing station. I was aboard {{one of the very}} first craft that found out that the South Shetlands was a famous place for seals, and no one among us thought it {{necessary}} to tell it to all the world. Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>weak</b> enough to put sich discoveries in the newspapers; but, for my part, I think it quite enough to put them in the log." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but they}} will not own that they are infirm. If a <b>man</b> <b>be</b> <b>weak</b> at that age, he thinks that with {{advancing}} years he will resume the strength of his youth. There must, in fact, be a Fixed Period. We have discussed that fifty times, and have always arrived at the same conclusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it wouldn't," [...] she replied. [...] "And, therefore, {{with all}} your cleverness, you are little better than a fool. You have been working hard and living poor these two years back, and what better are you? When that old <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>weak</b> enough {{to give you the}} last of his money, you didn't keep a penny." ...|$|R
6000|$|SHE: [...] "But {{you began}} it. Besides, it's very {{different}} for a <b>man.</b> Women <b>are</b> <b>weak,</b> poor, helpless creatures. They {{have to use}} finesse. But a <b>man</b> should <b>be</b> above it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing {{can ever}} alter it; it's in {{the wheels of}} the universe," [...] went on Inglewood, in a low voice: [...] "some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>weak</b> and some strong, and the only {{thing we can do is}} to know that we are weak. I have been in love lots of times, but I could not do anything, for I remembered my own fickleness. I have formed opinions, but I haven't the cheek to push them, because I've so often changed them. That's the upshot, old fellow. We can't trust ourselves-- and we can't help it." ...|$|E
60|$|How was he {{to marry}} his cousin after that? If he were to do so, would not that wretch at Littlebath declare, through all the provincial and {{metropolitan}} newspapers, that he had compelled the marriage? That letter would {{be published in the}} very column that told of the wedding. But yet he must decide. He must do something. They who read this will probably declare that he was a weak fool to regard anything that such a one as Mr Maguire could say of him. He was not a fool, but he was so far weak and foolish; and in such matters such <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>weak</b> and foolish, and often cowardly.|$|E
60|$|I {{staggered}} {{back from}} them. I looked {{from one to}} the other. For an instant I could not believe my own eyes. They were paying me homage, these, the men who had jeered me! Then I understood it all. I saw the effect that I had made upon them and their desire to make reparation. When a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> he can steel himself against danger, but not against emotion.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{told me that}} <b>men</b> <b>are</b> very <b>weak,</b> {{and very}} foolish, and wicked; and that Manito is very good and patient to let them live." ...|$|R
50|$|At the trial, the {{testimony}} from the Sheriff was that Moore {{was shot in}} the back, and not from Cheney's gun, but probably was shot from one of the Sheriff's own <b>men</b> who <b>was</b> firing toward Cheney from a position behind Moore. The evidence that Clow actually killed the <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>weak.</b> However, this did not sway the jury. In May 1783, a jury convicted him of murder and the judge sentenced him to death. He was sentenced to be hanged by the neck until dead.|$|R
5000|$|About {{a century}} later, Alcaeus {{repeated}} the theme, advising his listeners to [...] "steep your lungs in wine" [...] {{before the arrival}} of the star since [...] "women are at their foulest but <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>weak</b> since they are parched in head and knees". In the 3rd century, Aratus' Phenomena describes the time as Sirius blighting the bark of trees with its heat during the time it rises and sets with the sun.|$|E
5000|$|Fadlallah also {{issued a}} fatwa on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women that {{supports}} {{the right of a}} woman to defend herself against any act of violence whether social or physical. The fatwa reaffirms the rights of women, both at their workplace and at home, and states that Islam forbids men from exercising any form of violence against women and forbids men from depriving women of their legal rights. In his words [...] "physical violence in which women are beaten, proves that these <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>weak,</b> for only the weak are in need of unjust violence". He also issued fatwas forbidding female circumcision and honour killings.|$|E
50|$|In counter {{opinions}} in society against women's rights, Fibiger published two pamphlets; Hvad er Emancipation? (What is Emancipation?) and Et Besøg (A Visit). Her later novels included En Skizze efter det virkelige Liv (A Sketch from Real Life, 1853) and Minona. En Fortaelling (Minona: A Tale, 1854). En Skizze efter det virkelige Liv {{is the story}} of two sisters who were orphaned at an early age, and the men with whom they develop relationships; the older sister rejects her suitor, feeling that <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>weak,</b> while the younger sister falls in love. Minona created new controversy with its complex plot involving unwed mothers and incest; Minona, the chief character, overcomes her incestuous attraction after converting to Christianity.|$|E
50|$|Humbert Nelli, a {{professor}} of history at the University of Kentucky, examines the Hennessy case in a chapter of The Business of Crime (1976). Nelli demonstrates that the evidence against the <b>men</b> <b>was</b> <b>weak,</b> and argues that the murder was too poorly planned and amateurish to have been a Mafia hit. In a chapter on crime in New Orleans, he claims that although crime flourished among the city's southern Italians at the time, it could not accurately be attributed to mafiosi.|$|R
50|$|The {{end of the}} Civil War {{brought some}} relief, {{although}} many of the returning <b>men</b> <b>were</b> too <b>weak</b> to plant the year's crops. The Confederate currency that the remaining residents had saved was now worthless.|$|R

Wiser than wisdom, kind as Galahad <b>is</b> Master <b>Man,</b> {{the wonder}} of the world! As a boy, young Master <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> <b>weak</b> until a wise old doctor gave the youth a magic capsule, full of vitamins, containing every source of energy known to man! The boy becomes the strongest man on earth! Upon the highest mountain peak he built a solid castle made of solid rock! From there he sees all evil {{in the world and}} races to destroy it instantly! ...|$|R
5000|$|The young {{leader of}} the air pirate troupe called Black Ganymede. As the charismatic boss of an outlaw group {{that is the subject}} of an {{international}} police search. He has a sharp mind, strong physical abilities, and is a good man, he described himself as having no weakness since the two things italian <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>weak</b> against are good food and women. His crew is made up of people he saved as children from an abusive orphanage and has gained their trust and friendship. He seems to have a crush on Hazuki, who he calls [...] "Bambina" [...] (Italian for [...] "child"). And has been referred to as a stalker due to following her all the time. He is quite cruel when facing an opponent but has shown kindness and respect numerous times when the sisters were not capable of fighting back. He even lent a helping hand when Hazuki was sick, and has also proposed that he will protect her, where she smiled and gladly accepted his help, making him surprised and blush, not knowing she would answer immediately. Before leaving he promised that next time he will be taking her and the Galileo Tesoro with him.|$|E
5000|$|Japanese {{women might}} be further {{discouraging}} men from entering into romantic relationships. The decision that many herbivore men make to stop working, because marriage {{and work in}} Japan are so inter-related, may have {{made it more difficult}} for these Japanese men to find marriage. Many women refuse men who do not have steady jobs (such as freeters and NEETs). Other women feel that self-proclaimed sōshoku-kei danshi (herbivore <b>men)</b> <b>are</b> <b>weak</b> and not masculine, while some men apparently are not attracted to [...] "independent" [...] women. In a 2011 poll of Japanese boys aged between sixteen and nineteen, 36% said they were not interested in having sex; the figure for girls in the same age group was nearly double, at 59%. Masahiro Morioka argues that Japanese herbivore men are a result of Japan's post-war peace. Since the end of World War II, Japan has not directly participated in any war or conflict, either within its own borders or outside of them. Prior to this time of peace, many Japanese felt that becoming a soldier was the only approach to becoming manly. This social norm has slowly disappeared during the following period of post-war peace. Due to this, Japanese men are less aggressive and this could bleed over into their romantic lives.|$|E
6000|$|... "Without their conquests {{and their}} defeats, thou wert in {{darkness}} still. Yes, their failures, their errors even, {{have a right}} to your respect; for <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>weak.....</b> Weep then, for us obscure travellers--unknown victims, who, by our mortal sufferings and unheard-of labors, have prepared the way before you. Pity me, who have passionately loved justice, and perseveringly sought for truth, only opened my eyes to shut them again for ever, and saw that I had been in vain endeavoring to support a ruin, to take refuge in a vault of which the foundations were worn away."....|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{escaped with}} my life," [...] said Babalatchi, with perfect gravity, [...] "because the white <b>man</b> <b>is</b> very <b>weak</b> and fell as he rushed upon me." [...] Then, after a pause, he added, [...] "She is mad with joy." ...|$|R
5000|$|His own bon mots, such as [...] "Every woman needs {{one man in}} {{her life}} who is strong and responsible. Given this security, she can proceed to do what she really wants to do — fall in love with <b>men</b> who <b>are</b> <b>weak</b> and irresponsible,” won him a {{following}} across Canada.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, we {{will take}} you in the forest, where you shall cut wood, {{and then we will}} bind it up in bundles and sell it in the town.' So their father let them do as they said, and they all made their way into the forest; and as the old <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>weak</b> from lack of food his sons took it in turns to carry him on their backs. Then they built a little hut where they might take shelter, and set to work. Every morning early the father cut his sticks, and the sons bound them in bundles, and carried them to the town, {{bringing}} back the food the old man so much needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{do well to}} pity people," [...] Ignat tells Foma, the boy, [...] "only {{you must}} use {{judgment}} with your pity. First consider the man, {{find out what he}} is like, what use can be made of him; and if you see that he is a strong and capable man, help him if you like. But if a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>weak,</b> not inclined to work--spit upon him and go your way. And you must know that when a man complains about everything, and cries out and groans--he is not worth more than two kopeks, he is not worthy of pity, and will be of no use to you if you do help him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he begged. [...] "At {{such times}} a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> a <b>weak</b> thing--a weak and selfish thing. I am ashamed of myself. I {{should have known}} better than to have doubted you for a moment. I know you so well, Louise. I know what you are." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is to say," [...] cried Harry, who was {{surprised}} and a little nettled {{to hear what he}} called the heads of a sermon from a redskin, [...] "that you, being a <b>man,</b> <b>are</b> very <b>weak,</b> and very foolish, and wicked; and that Manito is very good and patient to let you live?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My {{grandfather}} says," [...] said Rose Garfield, [...] "that {{we shall}} {{never be able}} to stand against old England, because the <b>men</b> <b>are</b> a <b>weaker</b> race than he remembers in his day,--weaker than his father, who came from England,--and the women slighter still; so that we are dwindling away, grandfather thinks; only a little sprightlier, he says sometimes, looking at me." ...|$|R
50|$|Eventually, Buller {{broke through}} the Boer {{positions}} on 27 February. Following their succession of reverses, his troops had developed effective tactics based on close cooperation between the infantry and artillery. After the protracted struggle, the morale of Botha's men at last broke and they and the besiegers retreated, covered by another huge thunderstorm. Buller did not pursue, and White's <b>men</b> <b>were</b> too <b>weak</b> to do so.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, {{nearly a}} decade after he retired, McDonald wrote in his {{autobiography}} of his participation in the escalation of the Vietnam War:Maybe we military <b>men</b> <b>were</b> all <b>weak.</b> Maybe we should have stood up and pounded the table...I {{was part of it}} and I'm sort of ashamed of myself too. At times I wonder, [...] "why did I go along with this stuff?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tut, tut, Eddie,' I answers, {{holding him}} hard; 'let {{an old friend}} gaze on the {{exhibition}} of your curiousness. It's an eminent graft you fell onto, my son. But don't speak of assaults and battery, because you're not fit. The best you've got {{is a lot of}} nerve and a mighty empty stomach.' And so it <b>was.</b> The <b>man</b> <b>was</b> as <b>weak</b> as a vegetarian cat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean that, and I {{mean much}} more. I say that I will make no man wretched. Your brother {{is not the}} only <b>man</b> who <b>is</b> so <b>weak</b> as to <b>be</b> willing to run the hazard." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 2008 article {{published}} in The New Yorker magazine Jeffrey Toobin quotes Roger Stone, [...] "Roy was not gay. He <b>was</b> a <b>man</b> who liked having sex with <b>men.</b> Gays <b>were</b> <b>weak,</b> effeminate. He always seemed to have these young blond boys around. It just wasn't discussed. He was interested in power and access." [...] Stone worked with Cohn beginning with the Reagan campaign during the Republican Party presidential primaries, 1976.|$|R
