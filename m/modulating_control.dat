The actuator options give a choice of thermal, 3-point control, or <b>modulating</b> <b>control.</b> This will work with building management systems and individual room controls, {{in the same way as}} traditional control valves. The actuators can also be used to set the valve by limiting flow. In 3-point control applications this can be done using a run time limitation. For example, for 70% design flow we give the actuator 70% of its total run time. With a modulating actuator, to achieve our 70% example we set the controller to control between 0-7v of the 0-10v signal.|$|E

The intended use of this sensor is to control the heating pattern at desired levels for young animals in enclosed housing applications to desired micro-climate specifications. The sensor developed was sensitive to placement position in the IR heat pattern but once a suitable location was found, representative heating temperatures in the heating pattern were described very well. The first-ordered behaving IR sensor developed had a heat-up time constant of 7. 5 min and a cool-down time constant of 9. 5 min.

40|$|In the {{production}} of beer, good temperature control of the starch mashing phase {{is very important for}} both the final product quality and the process efficiency. A precise tuning of the said control is, however, complicated by the highly non-linear nature of the process, and often also by the actuation scheme. Based on suitably extended literature models, this article shows how object-oriented modelling and simulation (OOMS) can be used to devise a solution to the above problem. A mashing model is first derived along the OOMS approach, and then the said model is coupled to a control representation of scalable detail, including a quasi replica of the control code. Doing so allows one to easily create and maintain hybrid overall models that are suitable for system studies on the design and assessment of both the control strategy and the process instrumentation, with particular reference to the use of on–off actuation in conjunction with <b>modulating</b> <b>control...</b>|$|E

The CHWS supplies the cooling energy requirements of the RTE Television Centre’s Air Handling Units (AHU’s). This paper presents a detailed energy audit of both the current cooling energy load and the CHWS, while outlining a cohesive control strategy that focused on reducing the CHWS load by implementing free cooling methodologies for the building’s AHUs. The paper continues by presenting a descriptive analysis of the CHWS operational characteristics and the resultant energy savings achieved by the development of an innovative control strategy which allowed for demand-led <b>modulating</b> <b>control</b> of the CHWS.

40|$|A {{review of}} current design methods for {{industrial}} process control systems that utilize modulated control valves as their final element is presented. The infornUltion {{that is available}} is then used to find the theoretic potential for energy savings in these systems. Energy savings potentials vary with the application. This paper will concentrate on the application ofvariable speed drives on common three phase AC induction motors as a replacement final element to realize the energy savings, but will also address other possible solutions for partial energy cost recovery. Since the theoretic potential savings {{is not always the}} practical case, a set of guidelines for the application ofthis data is proposed that would allow the user to more easily locate candidates for savings. A feasibility study of retrofitting a pipeline flow control system, currently operating with a constant speed pump and differential producing, <b>modulating</b> <b>control</b> valve, with a variable speed drive is presented.

40|$|From a biomechanical {{point of}} view quiet {{standing}} {{can be described as}} the motion of a human inverted pendulum pivoted at the ankle joints. According to this model the motion is determined by gravity, the physical properties of the pendulum (moment of inertia, mass, center of mass) and the active and passive force-contributions from muscle-tendon systems acting over the ankle joint. The muscle-tendon system of central importance for mantaining erect posture is the “shaft ” muscle gastrocnemius (GA) and its tendon. This is emphasized by measurements which show a close relationship between the GA muscle activity as measured by electromyography (EMG) and the forward-backward motion location of the center-of-pressure (COP). While GA seems {{to be in charge of}} the phasic (<b>modulating)</b> <b>control</b> mode, the soleus (SL) sets the basic tonus. Our hypothesis is that the GA-activity is linked to “dynamic stiffness control ” which is necessary in order to achieve postural stability given the compliant tendon. Thus, the characteristic swayings observed in quiet standing constitute an integral and essential part of the stabilization system and are not just some “disturbance ” or “noise”. Key words: quiet standing, stiffness, center-of-pressure (COP), electromyography (EMG), gastrocnemius, inverted pendulum model. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} quantum process {{tomography}} on a three-qubit {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} quantum information processor are presented, and shown {{to be consistent with}} a detailed model of the system-plus-apparatus used for the experiments. The quantum operation studied was the quantum Fourier transform, which is important in several quantum algorithms and poses a rigorous test for the precision of our recently-developed strongly <b>modulating</b> <b>control</b> fields. The results were analyzed in an attempt to decompose the implementation errors into coherent (overall systematic), incoherent (microscopically deterministic), and decoherent (microscopically random) components. This analysis yielded a superoperator consisting of a unitary part that was strongly correlated with the theoretically expected unitary superoperator of the quantum Fourier transform, an overall attenuation consistent with decoherence, and a residual portion that was not completely positive - although complete positivity is required for any quantum operation. By comparison with the results of computer simulations, the lack of complete positivity was shown to be largely a consequence of the incoherent errors during the quantum process tomography procedure. These simulations further showed that coherent, incoherent, and decoherent errors can often be identified by their distinctive effects on the spectrum of the overall superoperator. The gate fidelity of the experimentally determined superoperator was 0. 64, while the correlation coefficient between experimentally determined superoperator and the simulated superoperator was 0. 79; most of the discrepancies with the simulations could be explained by the cummulative effect of small errors in the single qubit gates.

The algorithm is based on linearization around a previously computed solution. To initialize the algorithm, a first solution needs to be obtained. To do so, the trajectory planning problem is solved using Pulse-Amplitude <b>Modulated</b> (PAM) <b>control</b> signals; these are then converted to PWM signals, which are used as an initial guess. Iterating, the solution is refined until an optimal value is reached. Simulations show that this method converges after a few iterations.

40|$|A {{hierarchy}} of interacting and interdependent approaches {{have been developed}} for calculating internal surface convective heat transfer coefficients within mechanically-ventilated rooms. A 'high-level' computer code is developed for non-bucyant and buoyant flow based on the "elliptic' code of Pun and Spalding (1977), in which 'upwind' finite-difference approximations to the governing partial-differential equations for continuity, momentum and thermal energy are formulated in terms of 'primitive' pressure-velocity variables. Closure of these time-averaged, elliptic equations is obtained via transport equations for both the turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation rate. The high-level code solves the difference equations for a predetermined size, staggered grid in an iterative 'line-by-line' manner using a guess-and-correct procedure. An 'intermediate-level' computer code (the ROOM-CHT program) has also been developed for the above purpose, which employs 'informed" estimates of the flow and thermal field based on the known mean flow properties of wall-jets. The corresponding heat transfer distribution across the room surface is calculated using wall-jet profile analysis or improved data correlations for bucyancy-driven convection as appropriate. Caqputations are presented for a room into which air is injected through a low or high side wall register. The supply of air governed by both cyclic and <b>modulating</b> <b>control</b> was examined. The intermediate-level code is advocated as being the most appropriate for meeting the requirements of dynamic building thermal models. This code was verified by comparison with the high-level code and with experimental measurements. The oomputed heat transfer coefficients from the intermediate-level code were found to be in good agreement with that of the high-level code. Both indicate significantly higher values than those which would be obtained from established design guides. These high values suggest errors in building thermal models based on guide data, including substantial under-estimation of preheat times...|$|E
40|$|Thermal vacuum testing often {{requires}} temperature control of chamber shrouds and heat exchangers within the - 130 C to 75 C range. There are two conventional methods which are normally employed to achieve control through this intermediate temperature range: (1) single-pass flow where control {{is achieved by}} alternately pulsing hot gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) and cold LN 2 into the feed line to yield the setpoint temperature; and (2) closed-loop circulation where control is achieved by either electrically heating or LN 2 cooling the circulating GN 2 to yield the setpoint temperature. A third method, using a mass flow ratio controller along with <b>modulating</b> <b>control</b> valves on GN 2 and LN 2 lines, provides excellent control but equipment for this method is expensive and cost-prohibitive for all but long-term continuous processes. The single-pass method provides marginal control and can result in unexpected overcooling of the test article from even a short pulse of LN 2. The closed-loop circulation method provides excellent control but requires an expensive blower capable of operating at elevated pressures and cryogenic temperatures. Where precise control is needed (plus or minus 2 C), single-pass flow systems typically have not provided the precision required, primarily because of overcooling temperature excursions. Where several individual circuits are to be controlled at different temperatures, the use of expensive cryogenic blowers for each circuit is also cost-prohibitive, especially for short duration of one-of-a-kind tests. At JPL, {{a variant of the}} single-pass method was developed that was shown to provide precise temperature control in the - 130 C to 75 C range while exhibiting minimal setpoint overshoot during temperature transitions. This alternate method uses a commercially available temperature controller along with a GN 2 /LN 2 mixer to dampen the amplitude of cold temperature spikes caused by LN 2 pulsing. The design of the GN 2 /LN 2 mixer, the overall control system configuration, the operational procedure, and the prototype system test results are described...|$|E

When this happens, one can observe a variety of different bifurcation scenarios. One scenario is the continuous transformation of the stable equilibrium into a stable period- 1 focus.

40|$|Numerous {{physical}} {{models of the}} cardiovascular system have been devised for instructional purposes. In {{most or all of}} these models, the system is “open”; i. e., the liquid is exposed to atmospheric pressure {{at some point in the}} circuit, usually in the reservoir which represents the right atrium. The model to be described is a “closed ” system, comprised of four principal components: a pump, an arterial capacitance, a peripheral resistance, and a venous capacitance. The pump is servo-controlled, such that “cardiac output ” is a function of venous pressure (Frank-Starling mechanism). Also, because the model is a closed system, the venous pressure is a function of the cardiac output. The model there-fore assists the student in gaining insight into the interrelationships be-tween cardiac output and venous return. The student is able to construct “cardiac output ” and “venous return’ ” curves, as described by Guyton (1, 2), and to determine how these curves are affected by changes in a variety of circulatory variables, such as peripheral resistance, blood volume, and myocardial contractility. THE MECHANICAL MODEL The physical model is depicted schematically in Figure 1. The analog of the heart is a piston pump (Harvard Apparatus Co., model 1405) in which systole comprises 35 % of the cycle duration, and diastole occupies the remaining 65 %. The pump is equipped with silastic ball valves (Vi and Vo, the inflow and outflow valves). Stroke volume and heart rate are continuously variable (dials A and B).
