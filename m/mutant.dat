40|$|The {{frequency}} of recessive {{male and female}} sterility <b>mutants</b> in Japanese cultivated popUlations of buckwheat was estimated by examining the segregation of such <b>mutants</b> in full-sib families. The average {{frequency of}} male sterility <b>mutants</b> was 9. 5 % per gamete and that of female sterility <b>mutants</b> was 17. 3 %. The frequencies {{of male and female}} sterility <b>mutants</b> varied widely from population to population; the range was 0. 0 - 42. 9 % for male sterility <b>mutants,</b> and 5. 0 - 38. 1 % for female sterility <b>mutants.</b> This contrasts with the frequency of chlorophyll-deficient <b>mutants</b> affecting seedling stage which was rather uniform...|$|R
50|$|In The Gage Team world, <b>mutants</b> are humans {{or other}} known {{species in the}} {{universe}} that, due to some experiment or other accident, have superhuman capabilities. These <b>mutants</b> are not called <b>mutants,</b> however. Unnaturals are <b>mutants</b> with ordinary superhuman powers, such as super-strength and super-speed. Super-Unnaturals are <b>mutants</b> that {{have the ability to}} change their form (Invisibility is considered an Unnatural power). <b>Mutants</b> that have received their powers from a Crystal are called Powerlings. Ultralings are <b>mutants</b> that have been received their powers from two Crystals.|$|R
5|$|An anti-mutant {{politician}} {{who wishes to}} ban <b>mutant</b> children from schools using a <b>Mutant</b> Registration Act. He is kidnapped by Magneto in a test of his mutation machine, which causes his body {{to turn into a}} liquid-like substance. He dies before Jean could save him.|$|E
5|$|Entities {{undergoing}} {{uniparental inheritance}} and {{with little to}} no recombination {{may be expected to}} be subject to Muller's ratchet, the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the mtDNA bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits stochastic processes in the cell to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in <b>mutant</b> load as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of <b>mutant</b> mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different cells have different <b>mutant</b> loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more <b>mutant</b> mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in <b>mutant</b> load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mutant</b> {{founder of}} the X-Men and the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, who hopes for {{peaceful}} coexistence between mutantkind and mankind and is regarded as an authority on genetic mutation. Although restricted to a wheelchair, his <b>mutant</b> powers include vast telepathy, which is amplified by the Cerebro supercomputer that he invented with Magneto's help.|$|E
40|$|Outer {{membrane}} protein e is induced in wild-type cells, just like alkaline phosphatase {{and some other}} periplasmic proteins, by growth under phosphatase limitation. nmpA and nmpB <b>mutants,</b> which synthesize protein e constitutively, are shown also to produce the periplasmic enzyme alkaline phosphatase constitutively. Alternatively, individual phoS, phoT, and phoR <b>mutants</b> as well as pit pst double <b>mutants,</b> {{all of which are}} known to produce alkaline phosphatase constitutively, were found to be constitutive for protein e. Also, the periplasmic space of most nmpA <b>mutants</b> and of all nmpB <b>mutants</b> grown in excess phosphate was found to contain, in addition to alkaline phosphatase, at least two new proteins, a phenomenon known for individual phoT and phoR <b>mutants</b> as well as for pit pst double <b>mutants.</b> The other nmpA <b>mutants</b> as well as phoS <b>mutants</b> lacked one of these extra periplasmic proteins, namely the phosphate-binding protein. From these data and from the known positions of the mentioned genes on the chromosomal map, it is concluded that nmpB <b>mutants</b> are identical to phoR <b>mutants.</b> Moreover, some nmpA <b>mutants</b> were shown to be identical to phoS <b>mutants,</b> whereas other nmpA <b>mutants</b> are likely to contain mutations in one of the genes phoS, phoT, or pst...|$|R
40|$|Eight X-linked recombination-defective meiotic <b>mutants</b> (representing five loci) and 12 X-linked mutagen-sensitive <b>mutants</b> (representing seven loci) of Drosophila melanogaster {{have been}} {{examined}} cytologically in neuroblast metaphases for their effects on the frequencies and types of spontaneous chromosome aberrations. Twelve <b>mutants,</b> representing five loci, significantly increase the frequency of chromosomal aberrations. The <b>mutants</b> at these five loci, however, differ markedly both {{in the types of}} aberrations produced and the localization of their effects along the chromosome. According to these criteria, the <b>mutants</b> can be assigned to four groups: (i) <b>mutants</b> producing almost exclusively chromatid breaks in both euchromatin and heterochromatin; (ii) <b>mutants</b> producing chromatid and isochromatid breaks in both euchromatin and heterochromatin; (iii) <b>mutants</b> producing chromatid <b>mutants</b> producing chromatid and isochromatid breaks clustered in the heterochromatin...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} <b>mutants</b> {{sensitive to}} methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Alleles of rad 1, rad 4, rad 6, rad 52, rad 55 and rad 57 were found among these mms <b>mutants.</b> Twenty-nine of the mms <b>mutants</b> which complement the existing radiation-sensitive (rad and rev) <b>mutants</b> belong to 22 new complementation groups. <b>Mutants</b> from five complementation groups are sensitive only to MMS. <b>Mutants</b> of 11 complementation groups {{are sensitive to}} UV or X rays in addition to MMS, <b>mutants</b> of six complementation groups are sensitive to all three agents.

40|$|A {{histidine}} auxotroph (his−) of Staphylococcus aureus MS 3937 and <b>mutants</b> {{sensitive to}} ultraviolet (UV) irradiation were obtained. The UV-sensitive <b>mutants</b> were found {{also to be}} sensitive to N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and mitomycin C, and their sensitivity was accounted for by a defect in deoxyribonucleic acid repair. Transduction of either chromosomal or plasmid markers to UV-sensitive <b>mutants</b> showed that these staphylococcus <b>mutants</b> are of the recA (reckless) type <b>mutants</b> as reported in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium; therefore the UV-sensitive <b>mutants</b> (uvr−) were renamed recombination-deficient <b>mutants</b> (rec−).

5|$|A <b>mutant</b> with uncharted telepathic powers, {{and founder}} of Xavier's Institute for Gifted Mutants. Xavier is an {{authority}} on genetic mutation and an advocate of peaceful relations between human and <b>mutant</b> kind. Stewart signed to the film without knowing Xavier would die, and not meeting original director Matthew Vaughn – both would meet in Manchester, where Stewart was filming Eleventh Hour, but eventually Brett Ratner called to introduce himself as the new director.|$|E
5|$|A teleporting <b>mutant.</b> This was will.i.am's major live-action film debut. Although he {{initially}} {{did not get}} on with the casting director, he got the role because he wanted to play a <b>mutant</b> with the same power as Nightcrawler. He enrolled in boot camp to get into shape for the part. When filming a fight, he scarred his knuckles after accidentally punching and breaking the camera.|$|E

40|$|About 4 × 10 − 4 r <b>mutants</b> were induced per lethal hit, a {{frequency}} characteristic of weak mutagens.

5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} <b>mutant</b> protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence <b>mutant</b> HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the <b>mutant</b> allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. <b>Mutant</b> huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
40|$|Over 100 histidine-dependent <b>mutants</b> were {{isolated}} from strain 655 of Staphylococcus aureus.

Classes E and G did not accumulate any detectable Pauly-positive imidazoles. <b>Mutants</b> of class A accumulated 5 -amino-l-ribosyl- 4 -imidazolecarboxamide, <b>mutants</b> of class B accumulated imi-dazoleglycerol, and <b>mutants</b> of class C accumulated imidazoleacetol. <b>Mutants</b> of class D accumulated histidinol and were incapable of utilizing exogenous L-histidinol. A comparison of the accumulations obtained from <b>mutants</b> of S. aureus with accumulations obtained from previously characterized <b>mutants</b> of Salmonella typhimurium indicates that a similar, if not identical, pathway for the biosynthesis of L-histidine is used by these two species...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} Klebsiella pneumoniae strains {{to resist the}} {{bactericidal}} activity of serum was quantitated. The K. pneumoniae strains tested included <b>mutants</b> lacking the capsular polysaccharide and <b>mutants</b> having a modified lipopolysaccharide structure. The last <b>mutants</b> were obtained as phage-resistant <b>mutants,</b> and their lipopolysaccharide was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and chemical analysis. Serum-resistant <b>mutants</b> derived from phage-resistant <b>mutants</b> (lipopolysaccharide <b>mutants)</b> were also characterized. Resistance to the bactericidal activity of complement was mediated by the lipopolysaccharide, especially by the O-antigen polysaccharide chains.

5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the <b>mutant</b> allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the <b>mutant</b> allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E

40|$|Biochemical {{characterization}} of 70 temperature-sensitive (ts) <b>mutants</b> of rabies virus {{has been done}} by following the appearance of viral proteins and RNA molecules in infected cells at both permissive and nonpermissive temperature. The presence or absence of the nucleocapsid protein (N) was demonstrated by treating infected cells with anti-N fluorescent antibodies. At 33 degrees C, all the <b>mutants</b> induced a fluorescence comparable to the wild type. At 39. 6 degrees C, the <b>mutants</b> can be classified into three groups. Three <b>mutants</b> induced a fluorescence comparable to the wild type (F+ mutants); 54 <b>mutants</b> induced a faint fluorescence which was proportional to the multiplicity of infection and increased with time (F+- <b>mutants).</b> No fluorescence could be detected for the 13 remaining <b>mutants</b> (F- <b>mutants).</b> The synthesis of all viral proteins was shown to be normal for F+ <b>mutants,</b> indicating that transcription and replication of the virus were normal and that the ts lesion was located in a protein which is not directly required for those functions. The synthesis of all viral proteins was similarly decreased for F+- <b>mutants</b> and undetectable for the F- <b>mutants.</b> This suggests that the ts lesion affects the transcription and/or replication of the virus. By annealing techniques it was demonstrated that the F+- <b>mutants</b> were able to perform some amount of secondary transcription at nonpermissive temperature. No secondary transcription occurred with F- <b>mutants.</b> When detectable (i. e., at higher multiplicity of infection), primary transcription of F- <b>mutants</b> was normal...|$|R
