40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{flexible}} approach to bus media redundancy in Controller Area Network (CAN) fieldbuses, both {{to improve the}} bandwidth by transmitting different traffic in different channels or to promote redundancy by transmitting the same message {{in more than one}} channel. Specifically the proposed solution is discussed in the context of Flexible Time-Triggered protocol over CAN (FTT-CAN) and inherits the online scheduling flexibility of FTT-CAN, enabling on-the-fly modifications of the traffic conveyed in the replicated buses. Flexible bus media redundancy is useful to fulfill application requirements in terms of additional bandwidth or to react to bus failures leading the system to a degraded operational mode, without compromising safety. The arguments for and against flexible bus media redundancy in the context of FTT-CAN are also discussed in detail. 1 FTT-CAN With Multiple Buses Basis FTT-CAN (Flexible Time-Triggered communication protocol on CAN) [1] has been developed with the main purpose of combining a high level of operational flexibility with timeliness guarantees. It uses the dual-phase elementary cycle concept to isolated time and event-triggered communication. The time-triggered traffic is scheduled online in a particular node called a master, facilitating online admission control of requests, thus being managed in a flexible way, under guaranteed timeliness. The protocol relies on a relaxed master-slave medium access control in which the same <b>master</b> <b>message</b> triggers the transmission of messages in several slaves simultaneously (master/multi-slave). Eventual collisions between slave messages are handled by the native distributed arbitration of CAN. FTT-CAN slots the bus time in consecutive Elementary Cycles (ECs) with fixed duration. All nodes are synchronized at the start of each EC by the reception of a particular message known as an EC Trigger Message (TM) ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1889, {{he moved}} to Austria. During this time it is said his ideas on race began taking shape, {{influenced}} by the concept of Teutonic supremacy he believed embodied {{in the works of}} Richard Wagner and the French racist Arthur de Gobineau. In his book Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines, the aristocratic snob Gobineau, who had an obsessive hatred of commoners had developed the theory of an Aryan master race as a way of bolstering his social standing as he believed that French aristocrats like himself were the descendants of the Germanic Franks who had conquered the Roman province of Gaul while ordinary French people were the descendants of racially inferior Latin and Celtic peoples. Wagner had met Gobineau while on vacation in Rome in 1876, and the two had become friends. Wagner was greatly influenced by Gobineau's theories, but could not accept Gobineau's theory of inevitable racial decay amongst {{what was left of the}} [...] "Aryan race", instead preferring the idea of racial regeneration of the Aryans. The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedländer wrote that Wagner was the inventor of a new type of anti-Semitism, namely [...] "redemptive anti-semitism", a type of völkisch anti-semitism that could explain all in the world in regards to Jew-hatred and offer a form of [...] "redemption" [...] for the anti-Semitic. Chamberlain had attended Wagner's Bayreuth Festival in 1882 and struck up a close correspondence with his widow Cosima. In 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner's death, he married Eva von Bülow-Wagner, Franz Liszt's granddaughter and Richard Wagner's daughter (Wagner had started fathering children by Cosima while she was still married to Hans von Bülow-despite her surname, Eva was actually Wagner's daughter). The next year {{he moved to}} Germany and became an important member of the [...] "Bayreuth Circle" [...] of German nationalist intellectuals. As an ardent Wagnerite, Chamberlain saw it as his life's mission to spread the <b>Master's</b> <b>message</b> of racial hatred. Chamberlain explained his work in promoting the Wagner cult as an effort to cure modern society of its spiritual ills that he claimed were caused by capitalism, industrialisation, materialism, and urbanisation. Chamberlain wrote about modern society in the 1890s:Like a wheel that spins faster and faster, the increasing rush of life drives us continually further apart from each other, continually further from the 'firm ground of nature'; soon it must fling us out into empty nothingness. In another letter, Chamberlain stated this about the purpose of the Wagner cult:If we do not soon pay attention to Schiller's thought regarding the transformation from the state of Need into the Aesthetic State, then our condition will degenerate into a boundless chaos of empty talk and arms foundries. If we do not soon heed Wagner's warning-that mankind must awaken to a consciousness of its [...] "pristine holy worth"-then the Babylonian tower of senseless doctrines will collapse on us and suffocate the moral core of our being forever. In Chamberlain's viewpoint, the purpose of the Wagner cult was nothing less than the salvation of humanity. As such, Chamberlain became engulfed in the [...] "redemptive anti-semitism" [...] that was at the core of both Wagner's worldview and of the Wagner cult.|$|R

40|$|Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is {{a planned}} NASA-ESA mission to be {{launched}} around 2012. The Gravitational Wave detection is fundamentally the determination of frequency, source parameters, and waveform amplitude derived in a specific order from the interferometric time-series of the rotating LISA spacecrafts. The LISA Science Team has developed a Mock LISA Data Challenge intended to promote the testing of complicated nested search algorithms to detect the 100 - 1 millihertz frequency signals at amplitudes of 10 E- 21. However, {{it has become clear}} that, sequential search of the parameters is very time consuming and ultra-sensitive; hence, a new strategy has been developed. Parallelization of existing sequential search algorithms of Gravitational Wave signal identification consists of decomposing sequential search loops, beginning with outermost loops and working inward. In this process, the main challenge is to detect interdependencies among loops and partitioning the loops so as to preserve concurrency. Existing parallel programs are based upon either shared memory or distributed memory paradigms. In PVM, master and node programs are used to execute parallelization and process spawning. The PVM can handle process management and process addressing schemes using a virtual machine configuration. The task scheduling and the messaging and signaling can be implemented efficiently for the LISA Gravitational Wave search process using a master and 6 nodes. This approach is accomplished using a server that is available at NASA Ames Research Center, and has been dedicated to the LISA Data Challenge Competition. Historically, gravitational wave and source identification parameters have taken around 7 days in this dedicated single thread Linux based server. Using PVM approach, the parameter extraction problem can be reduced to within a day. The low frequency computation and a proxy signal-to-noise ratio are calculated in separate nodes that are controlled by the <b>master</b> using <b>message</b> and vector of data passing.
