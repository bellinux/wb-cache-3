40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploratory}} examination of identity construction and children’s media, {{with a focus}} on the Palestinian political groups of Fatah and Hamas. It looks at how children’s media are framed {{within the context of the}} Arab-Israeli conflict. It examines how internal and external social factors contribute to identity formation and the interaction among these elements during times of conflict and war. This thesis hypothesizes that both Fatah and Hamas use various myths to differing degrees in order to frame their conception of a Palestinian identity. Specifically, it explores the use <b>of</b> the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Battle, the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Hero, the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Victim, the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Religion, the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Land and the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Other. It seeks to determine which <b>of</b> these <b>myths</b> each group emphasizes through a qualitative and quantitative visual ethnographic content analysis. The quantitative analysis uncovered interesting, albeit not statistically significant, differences between Fatah’s and Hamas’ use of all <b>of</b> the <b>myths</b> in their videos. Specifically it found that both groups made equal and great use <b>of</b> the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Religion; that Hamas produced the videos with the greatest focus on the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Battle and the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Hero; and that neither group greatly emphasized the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Victim, the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Land or the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Other. Finally, the analysis discovered positive correlations between the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Hero and the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Battle as well as between the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Battle and the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> Other...|$|R

5|$|Lyrical poets {{often took}} their {{subjects}} from myth, but their treatment became gradually less narrative and more allusive. Greek lyric poets, including Pindar, Bacchylides and Simonides, and bucolic poets such as Theocritus and Bion, relate individual mythological incidents. Additionally, myth {{was central to}} classical Athenian drama. The tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides took most of their plots from <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> the age of heroes and the Trojan War. Many of the great tragic stories (e.g. Agamemnon and his children, Oedipus, Jason, Medea, etc.) took on their classic form in these tragedies. The comic playwright Aristophanes also used myths, in The Birds and The Frogs.|$|E

5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{importance}} of the sea gave rise to many <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish lurking in the deep. In Northern Europe, kings were sometimes given ship burials when the body was laid in a vessel surrounded by treasure and costly cargo and set adrift on the sea. In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive {{to the bottom of the}} sea and bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess of the sea and marine animals in Inuit mythology.|$|E
5|$|Indo-European {{parallels}} {{have been}} proposed between <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> Fenrir and the Persian demon Ahriman. The Yashts refer to a story where Taxma Urupi rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years. An elaboration of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary. The ruler Taxmoruw (Taxma Urupi) managed to lasso Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day. After thirty years Ahriman outwitted and swallowed Taxmoruw. In a sexual encounter with Ahriman, Jamshid, Taxmoruw's brother, inserted his hand into Ahriman's anus and pulled out his brother's corpse. His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards. The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil being by a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being (Odin and Fenrir), trickery involving the thrusting of a hand into a monster's orifice and the affliction of the inserted limb (Týr and Fenrir).|$|E

5|$|Opera as a {{dramatic}} genre originated {{around the turn}} from the 16th to the 17th centuries, although the word itself was not in use before 1650. Precursors of musical drama included pastoral plays with songs and choruses, and the madrigal comedies of the late 16th century. Monteverdi had already {{established himself as a}} leading composer of madrigals before writing his first full-length operas in the years 1606–08, {{while he was in the}} service of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. These works, L'Orfeo and L'Arianna, deal respectively with the Greek <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> Orpheus and Ariadne. After a disagreement in 1612 with Vincenzo's successor, Duke Francesco Gonzaga, Monteverdi moved to Venice to take up the position of director of music at St Mark's Basilica, where he remained until his death in 1643.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{carried out}} a second {{commission}} from Eusebi Güell between 1884 and 1887, the Güell Pavilions in Pedralbes, now {{on the outskirts of}} Barcelona. Güell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarrià, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuyàs de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 {{to make way for the}} Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Gaudí undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance with an iron gate in the shape of a dragon, with symbology allusive to the <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> Hercules and the Garden of the Hesperides. The buildings consist of a stable, covered longeing ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real Cátedra Gaudí, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Gitera {{visited the}} king at his palace in Nyanza. Although Gitera had {{considerable}} {{respect for the}} monarchy, Rudahigwa treated him contemptuously; {{at one point he}} grabbed Gitera's throat, calling him and his followers inyangarwanda (haters of Rwanda). This humiliation prompted the MSM, APROSOMA and the pro-Hutu Catholic publications to take a firmer stance against the monarchy. Kinyamateka published a detailed report of Rudahigwa's treatment of Gitera, refuting his semi-divine image and accusing him of pro-Tutsi racism. The magazine also published stories citing the origin <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa, calling the king's policies inconsistent with them. The articles did not immediately challenge the king's authority over the Hutu peasants, but their exposure of Rudahigwa's outburst led to a permanent schism between him, the Hutu counter-elite and Belgian authorities. In 1958 the Belgian colonial ministry tried to strip Rudahigwa of his power, reducing him to a figurehead, but his popularity with the regional chiefs and the Tutsi (who feared the growing Hutu movement) sparked a series of strikes and protests.|$|E

5000|$|Mugambi is {{critical}} of Rudolf Bultmann's project of [...] "demythologisation", {{on the ground that}} hermeneutically, myth cannot be abstracted from the Gospel. Any attempt at 'demythologization' results in new <b>myths.</b> Instead <b>of</b> [...] "demythologization", Mugambi urges for [...] "remythologization." [...] He says of Bultmann, [...] "in (his) attempt to satisfy scientific positivism by denouncing myth (he) ends up destroying the reality of religion as a pillar of culture." [...] For Mugambi, as with Jaspers, [...] "myth is indispensable in cultural constructions of reality." [...] To Mugambi, therefore, reconstruction in Africa has to be anchored in a) the formulation <b>of</b> new <b>myths</b> to replace the negative stereotypes used for the indoctrination of Africans under imperialism and missionary tutelage, and b) re-interpreting the old myths, for the survival of the African peoples. He suggests that the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> [...] "a vanishing people must be replaced by the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> a resurgent, or resilient people," [...] while the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "desperate people must be replaced by the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> a people (who are) full <b>of</b> hope.

5|$|The coyote {{plays a role}} {{in various}} mythologies and {{creation}} <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> Native American folklore. It is variously credited for having brought fire to humanity, releasing the bison into the world, and of having slain monsters by petrifying them. The Maidu creation myth has the coyote introducing work, suffering, and death to the world. Zuni folklore has the coyote bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachinas. Some tribes, such as the Chinook, Maidu, Paiute, Pawnee, Tohono O'odham, and Ute portray the coyote as the companion of the creator. In the Paiute creation myth, the coyote was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by piling soil on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham flood myth has the coyote helping Montezuma survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the Great Mystery creates humanity, the coyote and Montezuma teach people how to live. The Crow creation myth portrays Old Man Coyote as the creator. In Navajo mythology, the coyote was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. The Navajo coyote brings death into the world, explaining that without death, too many people would exist, thus no room to plant corn.|$|E
5|$|The local {{language}} Kannada {{was mostly}} used in Western (Kalyani) Chalukya inscriptions and epigraphs. Some historians assert that {{ninety percent of}} their inscriptions are in the Kannada language while the remaining are in Sanskrit language. More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to Vikramaditya VI than any other king prior to the 12th century, {{many of which have}} been deciphered and translated by historians of the Archaeological Survey of India. Inscriptions were generally either on stone (Shilashasana) or copper plates (Tamarashasana). This period saw the growth of Kannada as a language of literature and poetry, impetus to which came from the devotional movement of the Virashaivas (called Lingayatism) who expressed their closeness to their deity in the form of simple lyrics called Vachanas. At an administrative level, the regional language was used to record locations and rights related to land grants. When bilingual inscriptions were written, the section stating the title, genealogy, origin <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without any ambiguity.|$|E
5|$|The {{support of}} the Hoysala rulers for the Kannada {{language}} was strong, and this is seen even in their epigraphs, often written in polished and poetic language, rather than prose, with illustrations of floral designs in the margins. According to historian Sheldon Pollock, the Hoysala era saw the complete displacement of Sanskrit, with Kannada dominating as the courtly language. Temples served as local schools where learned Brahmins taught in Sanskrit, while Jain and Buddhist monasteries educated novice monks. Schools of higher learning were called Ghatikas. The local Kannada language was widely used in the rising number of devotional movements to express the ecstatic experience of closeness to the deity (vachanas and devaranama). Literary works were written in it on palm leaves which were tied together. While in past centuries Jain works had dominated Kannada literature, Shaiva and early Brahminical works became popular during the Hoysala reign. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. Inscriptions on stone (Shilashasana) and copper plates (Tamarashasana) were written mostly in Kannada but some were in Sanskrit or were bilingual. The sections of bilingual inscriptions stating the title, genealogy, origin <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses.

40|$|Oral traditions may {{be found}} in many regions. One of them which enriches the {{treasure}} of local culture is the oral tradition <b>of</b> the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> manguni (owl), which, in Minahasa, North Sulawesi, is purified and constitutes part of the local traditions which may help the local people overcome their problems. The oral tradition <b>of</b> the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> manguni constitutes one of the local cultural products which may be potentially created, {{as can be seen in}} the creative industries currently motivated by the government of Indonesia. This present study was particularly intended to identify the form, ideology, and implication of the reinforcement <b>of</b> the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> manguni in the community of Minahasa, North Sulawesi.    The result of the present study showed that the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> manguni was reinforced by the community in Minahasa, North Sulawesi, not only in the form of the creative industry of souvenirs, which are highly economically valuable, but also in various forms of symbols. The reinforcement <b>of</b> the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> manguni in the community of Minahasa, North Sulawesi, contained the ideology <b>of</b> heroism, the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> the origin of Minahasa, amusement, the communication between human beings and the Creator, conservation, and commodification.
