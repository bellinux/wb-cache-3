Methods. A retrospective medical record review of 254 patients evaluated at the Craniofacial Center of the Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, from 1980 through 1991 was completed. Consenting patient families were interviewed via telelphone to determine what, if any, special <b>medical</b> <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> problems had occurred for the children who had had plagiocephaly in infancy or their siblings with normal head shapes. Results. A total of 181 families from the medical record review could be notified about the study and 63 families agreed to participate in a telephone interview. The sample of participants for the telephone interview was random to and representative of the group as a whole. The families reported that 25 of the 63 children (39. 7 %) with persistent deformational plagiocephaly had received special help in primary school including: special education assistance, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy generally through an Individual Education Plan. Only 7 of 91 siblings (7. 7 %), serving as controls, required similar services (χ 2 = 21. 24).

40|$|Context: During clerkships, {{teaching}} and learning in day-to-day activities occur in many moments of interaction among doctors, patients, peers and other co-workers. How people talk with one another influences their identity, their position {{and what they are}} allowed to do. This paper focuses on the opportunities and challenges of such moments of interaction between doctors and students during a clerkship characterised by short supervisory relationships. Methods: This study was conducted in a 10 -week internal medicine clerkship. Nine students and 10 doctors who worked with these nine students participated by regularly describing moments of interaction, using dictaphones. We performed critical discourse analysis of material sourced from a total of 184 audio diary entries and seven student debriefing interviews to reveal how participants discursively shaped the way they could think, speak and conduct themselves. Results: The ways in which doctors and students posed and answered questions represented a recurrent and influential feature in the diaries. This Question and Answer dynamic revealed six discourses of Basic Learning Need, Care and Attention, Power Game, Exchange of Currency, Distance, and Equality and Reciprocity. These discourses and the interplay among them revealed both students' and doctors' frameworks of needs and expectations in a culturally defined power structure. The interplay among the discourses reflected the ways in which doctor-student interactions afforded meaningful contributions to their <b>medical</b> <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> practice such as in the exchange of authentic professional or personal experience. Conclusions: By purposefully bringing power structures to the surface, we have addressed the complexity of learning and teaching as it occurs in day-to-day moments of interaction in a clerkship with little continuity in supervision. Both doctors and students should be supported to reflect critically on how they contribute to supervisory relationships with reference to, for example, {{the ways in which they}} ask or answer questions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

The question revisited recently [1 &#x 2013; 3] is whether it carries a predictive physical meaning {{in its own right}} beyond being an unquestionably convenient label. For example, whereas the color of compounds physically reflects the relative energetic positions of occupied vs. unoccupied, dipolecoupled energy levels, can the color be explained [4] by the oxidation state of the central ion? Can the different colors of various Mn compounds be predicted or explained in terms of their oxidation numbers [e. g. pink Mn(II) vs. black Mn(IV) vs. purple Mn(VII) ], or does such understanding entail knowledge of the occupancy of the hybridized d bands, a knowledge not provided by the ON (but possibly labeled by it, once such understanding is independently acquired) ? Also, the photoemission core shifts of an atom within a molecule (e. g. relative to a reference of the atom in its elemental form) physically represent the balance of all electrostatic charges in the system as felt by that atomic site. Can this balance be predicted or explained [1] by the oxidation number of the ion, or is the latter only a convenient short-hand notation (often assigned ex post facto) for an otherwise possibly nontrivial electronic structure? In other words, the central question here is whether the Oxidation Number is predictive, in its own right, or does it act functionally as a Social Security Number that conveniently labels a person, but by itself (e. g., without additional access to financial, <b>medical,</b> <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> records, <b>or</b> psychoanalysis) does not lead to understanding of the person...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop an {{understanding}} of how Grahamstown teenagers are affected by the label ʹdyslexiaʹ; by providing a space in which their feelings about being labelled dyslexic and their experiences can be voiced. Historically much international and local research has focussed on causation and remediation of dyslexia and has neglected the social aspects of the diagnosis. Causation and remediation are categories which form part of the <b>medical</b> <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> models. A social model of dyslexia needs to be applied. Due to the paucity of South African literature on the social experiences of dyslexic teenagers, this research thesis aims to add to the body of knowledge and hopefully provide an avenue for more research within the context of Sociology. This is a micro study, situated in Grahamstown Eastern Cape, South Africa, and the author recognizes that responses cannot be generalized to the greater dyslexic population. All human environments consist of objects which are given meaning through social interaction. Meaning is central to human behaviour and therefor explains the ways in which humans conduct their lives based on these meanings. For this reason George Herbert Mead’s (1934) and Herbert Blumers (1969) symbolic interactionist positions have framed the theoretical approach to this research. Qualitative methods of interviewing provide an opportunity for dyslexic individuals to discuss the meaning dyslexia gives to them, from their perspective and in their own words. The following conclusions have been arrived at: Educational psychologists in Grahamstown are reticent to diagnose individuals as dyslexic. This lack of identification hinders early intervention which can be very detrimental to individuals struggling with reading, writing and spelling as well as the associated co-morbid conditions of dyslexia. Teenagers who have had early diagnosis and intervention with support structures in place identify with their dyslexic identity more positively as they are able to make sense of their struggles of a dyslexic nature...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{homeless}} {{individuals in the}} U. S. has continued to increase, with men comprising the majority of this population. These men are at substantial risk for neuropsychological impairment due to several factors, such as substance misuse, severe mental illness, untreated medical conditions (e. g., diabetes, liver disease, HIV/AIDS), poor nutrition, and the increased likelihood of suffering a traumatic brain injury. Impairments in attention, memory, executive functioning, and other neuropsychological domains can result in poor daily functioning and difficulty engaging in psychological, <b>medical,</b> <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> services. Thus, knowledge of the neuropsychological functioning of homeless men is critical for {{those who work with}} this population. Yet data in this area are limited. This study aimed to describe the functioning of men residing in an urban homeless shelter across the domains of attention/concentration, memory, executive functions, language, sensory-motor abilities, general intelligence, and reading ability. Particular areas of impairment included attention, visual memory, cognitive flexibility, balance/coordination, and fine motor control. Correlational analyses found that educational background and ethnicity were linked to test performance, and the results of cluster analysis found two distinct subgroups based on neuropsychological functioning: an 2 ̆ 2 average 2 ̆ 2 group and a 2 ̆ 2 low average/impaired 2 ̆ 2 group. Caveats in interpreting test scores, particularly in the domain of language, are discussed, along with possible explanations for differences between African American and non-African American participants. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that clinicians and other service providers working with men residing in homeless shelters consider the possibility of neuropsychological impairment when developing treatment plans. Specific recommendations for each subgroup are discussed. Future research in this area might also explore the utility of offering skill-enhancing interventions within homeless shelters, such as workshops to improve organizational and planning skills. Further, the development of adequate norms for neuropsychological tests that are to be used with homeless individuals is recommended, given the possibility of low educational attainments and below average reading skills in this population...|$|R
