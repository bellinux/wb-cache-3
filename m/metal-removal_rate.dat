50|$|Many Wire EDM {{machines}} {{have adopted}} the pulse generating circuit using low power for ignition and high power for machining. However, it is not suitable for finishing process since the energy generated by the high voltage sub-circuit is too high to obtain a desired fine surface. Relaxing the surface finish allows the manufacturer to produce the part with fewer passes, at a higher current level and a higher <b>metal-removal</b> <b>rate,</b> enabling lower production time and cost.|$|E
5000|$|A {{substantial}} {{technological advance}} {{occurred in the}} 1890-1910 period, when Frederick Winslow Taylor applied scientific methods {{to the study of}} tool bits and their cutting performance (including their geometry, metallurgy, and heat treatment, and the resulting speeds and feeds, depths of cut, <b>metal-removal</b> <b>rates,</b> and tool life). Along with Maunsel White and various assistants, he developed high speed steels (whose properties come from both their alloying element mixtures and their heat treatment methods). His cutting experiments chewed through tons of workpiece material, consumed thousands of tool bits, and generated mountains of chips. They were sponsored in large part by William Sellers (a principal of Midvale Steel and Cramp's shipyard) and later by Bethlehem Steel. Not only did Taylor develop new materials to make single-point cutters from, but he also determined optimum geometry (rake angles, clearance angles, nose radiuses, etc.). He developed Taylor's Equation for Tool Life Expectancy. After Taylor, it was no longer taken for granted that the black art of individual craftsmen represented the highest level of metalworking technology. This {{was part of a larger}} trend during the 19th and 20th centuries by which science was mixed with art in the material culture of everyday life (applied science).|$|R
