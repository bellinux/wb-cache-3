50|$|An <b>Account</b> <b>Manager</b> is {{a person}} who works for a company and is {{responsible}} for the management of sales and relationships with particular customers. An <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> maintains the company's existing relationships with a client or group of clients, so that they will continue using the company for business. The <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> does not manage the daily running of the account itself. They manage the relationship with the client of the account(s) they are assigned to. Generally, a client will remain with one <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> throughout the duration of hiring the company. <b>Account</b> <b>managers</b> serve as the interface between the customer service and the sales team in a company. They are assigned a company's existing client accounts. The purpose of being assigned particular clients is to create long term relationships with the portfolio of assigned clients. The <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> serves to understand the customer's demands, plan how to meet these demands, and generate sales for the company as a result.|$|R

40|$|Acting in a {{boundary}} spanning role within their organisations, the key <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> in representing their customers’ needs internally {{is required to}} manage {{a wide range of}} complex internal relationships. This can often lead to incidents of conflict between the key <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> and other individuals or groups of individuals within the organisation in non-sales functions. Using the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), (Flanagan, 1954) together with an interpretive framework for data coding (Spiggle, 1994), this research investigates conflict and the key <b>account</b> <b>manager’s</b> internal selling role. This research also explores how the key <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> perceives intraorganisational, interpersonal conflicts and investigates the complex behavioural sequences adopted to manage them. In doing so this research addresses some of the shortcomings of the traditional view of the nature of organisational conflict and how it is managed while extending our understanding of the key <b>account</b> <b>manager’s</b> internal selling role. In contrast to the majority of research into personal selling, this research takes an interpretive approach through the analysis of transcripts from a series of CIT interviews with key <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> in the field. Twenty-nine key <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> from seven participating FMCG, Blue Chip organisations in the U. K. and U. S. participated in the research. From the CIT interviews conducted, 112 critical incidents were described with both positive and negative outcomes. This research provides further insight into the complexity of conflict, suggesting conflict is inherent within the key account management internal selling role, that incidents of conflict do not occur in isolation, that these conflict episodes are complex, having multiple components and that a combination of behaviours can be used in their management. In addressing these issues in the key account management context, this research further develops our knowledge of personal selling and the key <b>account</b> <b>manager’s</b> internal selling role by providing an analysis of the recollections of how conflict is perceived and managed by the key <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> involved.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the growing stream of organization research that explores the relationship between professional identities and gender. Our central question pertains to how <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> ‘do gender’ in constructing their professional identities. While account management has been considered a sales occupation with a strong masculine connotation, some indications towards ‘feminization’ have also been observed. Our analysis of 39 interviews with white women and men working as <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> in the Netherlands suggests that these <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> construct a ‘tough salesman’ identity and a ‘co-operative communicator’ identity. These identities have different gender connotations. The ‘co-operative communicator’ identity facilitates a critical dialogue with the – often implicit – masculinity in the ‘tough salesman’ identity norm. We reflect {{on the effects of}} these gender connotations both for <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> and for our practice as organization researchers who intend to deconstruct rather than reproduce gender stereotypes in our study of professional identities...|$|R
