5|$|The {{state of}} war between the United States and Japan officially ended when the Treaty of San Francisco took effect on April 28, 1952. Japan and the Soviet Union {{formally}} <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> four years later, when they signed the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956.|$|E
5|$|A revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its {{assault in}} 161 AD, {{defeating}} two Roman armies and invading Armenia and Syria. Emperor Lucius Verus and general Gaius Avidius Cassius were sent in 162 AD {{to counter the}} resurgent Parthia. In this war, the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was {{burned to the ground}} by Avidius Cassius in 164 AD. The Parthians <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> but were forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Beaujeu, having {{fulfilled}} {{his mission}} in escorting the colonists across the ocean, returned to France aboard the Joly in mid-March 1685. Many of the colonists chose {{to return to}} France with him, leaving approximately 180. Although Beaujeu delivered a message from La Salle requesting additional supplies, French authorities, having <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with Spain, never responded. The remaining colonists suffered from dysentery and venereal diseases, and people died daily. Those who were fit helped build crude dwellings and a temporary fort on Matagorda Island.|$|E

5|$|Burnham and Armstrong leapt {{over the}} dead Mlimo {{and ran down}} a trail toward their horses. The warriors in the village nearby picked up their arms and searched for the attackers; to {{distract}} them, Burnham set fire to some of their huts. The two men escaped and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with the rebels, ending the Second Matabele War.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, Henry VIII allied {{himself with}} Spain {{in a war}} against France. Despite Henry's initial successes, France and Spain <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> in 1544, leaving England exposed to a French invasion, backed by her allies in Scotland. In response, Henry issued an {{instruction}} to improve the country's defences, particularly along the south coast. Dartmouth Castle was reinforced by three new gun batteries, two {{either side of the}} gun tower, and another, Lamberd's Bulwarke, positioned in the south-east corner of the fortalice.|$|E
5|$|Laevinus {{had begun}} {{exploring}} {{the possibility of}} an alliance with the Aetolian League, as early as 212 BC. The Aetolians, war weary, had <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with Philip at Naupactus in 217 BC. However five years later the pendulum had swung in the other direction, the war faction was on the ascendency, and the Aetolians were once again ready to consider taking up arms against their traditional enemy, Macedon.|$|E

5|$|Richard began {{discussions about}} a {{potential}} alliance with Philip II in Paris during 1187, {{and the next}} year Richard gave homage to Philip in exchange for support for a war against Henry. Richard and Philip fought a joint campaign against Henry, and by the summer of 1189 the king <b>made</b> <b>peace,</b> promising Richard the succession. John initially remained loyal to his father, but changed sides once it appeared that Richard would win. Henry died shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Stephen IV {{attempted}} {{to regain his}} throne with Emperor Manuel I's support, but the latter <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with Stephen III. He agreed to send his younger brother, Béla, to Constantinople and to allow the Byzantines to seize Béla's duchy, which included Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. In an attempt to recapture these territories, Stephen III waged wars against the Byzantine Empire between 1164 and 1167, but could not defeat the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{conquest of}} the Jaffna kingdom {{occurred}} after Portuguese traders arrived at the rival Kotte Kingdom in the southwest of modern Sri Lanka in 1505. Many kings of Jaffna, such as Cankili I, initially confronted the Portuguese in their attempts at converting the locals to Roman Catholicism, but eventually <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with them.|$|E

5|$|Wulfred {{came into}} {{conflict}} with King Coenwulf of Mercia {{over the issue of}} whether laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries. In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Cenwulf had not yet <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with the archbishop, but by 809 they seem to have been on good terms; the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815.|$|E
5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with China when {{it opened}} border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E
5|$|Bureaucratic affairs were {{completed}} during Diocletian's stay: a census took place, and Alexandria, in punishment for its rebellion, {{lost the ability}} to mint independently. Diocletian's reforms in the region, combined with those of Septimius Severus, brought Egyptian administrative practices much closer to Roman standards. Diocletian travelled south along the Nile the following summer, where he visited Oxyrhynchus and Elephantine. In Nubia, he <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with the Nobatae and Blemmyes tribes. Under the terms of the peace treaty Rome's borders moved north to Philae and the two tribes received an annual gold stipend. Diocletian left Africa quickly after the treaty, moving from Upper Egypt in September 298 to Syria in February 299. He met with Galerius in Mesopotamia.|$|E

On October the chief of the Dolbahnata Girad Ali Farah was murdered by the Dervish. Through the end of 1899 most of the earlier tribal followers of the Dervish <b>made</b> their <b>peace</b> with the coastal administrations, all deputations from Dolbahnata, Habr Yunis, and Habr Tojalaa <b>made</b> their <b>peace.</b> The core Dervish elements however crossed the Border into Ethiopia in November 1899 and settled at Harradiggit ( [...] Hara-Digeed).|$|R
5|$|By 1920, Roosevelt, on Howe's advice, had <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with Tammany boss Charles Murphy, {{and again}} sought New York state office. In July, however, {{he was drafted}} by the Democratic National Convention as the vice presidential nominee on a ticket with Ohio {{governor}} James M. Cox. Roosevelt selected Howe as his campaign manager. The CoxRoosevelt ticket lost overwhelmingly to Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, but both Roosevelt and Howe saw themselves as having successfully built Roosevelt a national reputation; {{not long after the}} election, Howe boasted to several friends that Roosevelt would soon occupy the White House, taking Howe with him.|$|E
5|$|Conflicts between Ladislaus's {{father and}} {{grandfather}} developed into a civil war in 1264. Béla IV's troops, which were {{under the command of}} Ladislaus's aunt, Anna, captured the castle of Sárospatak, where Ladislaus and his mother were staying, and imprisoned them. Ladislaus initially was kept in the Turóc Castle, but two months later, he was sent to the court of Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow, who was Béla IV's son-in-law. After his grandfather and father <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> in March 1265, Ladislaus was set free and returned to his father.|$|E
5|$|Conrad {{completed}} {{construction of}} the castles of Hohensalzburg, Werfen, and Friesach, which Archbishop Gebhard had started to build in 1077. In Styria, he reformed the military organization and administration of church properties, and built strong fortresses. For defense against Hungary, he built strongholds at Leibnitz (Seggau) and Pettau (Ptuj), and Brestanica castle. He also expanded the Burg Deutschlandsberg castle {{at the center of}} the Salzburg possessions in western Styria. In 1131, he <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with King Béla II of Hungary, which was followed by a long period of stability in the border region.|$|E

5|$|During the Nanboku-chō period {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, Nanbu Motoyuki accompanied Kitabatake Akiie north when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North, and Shugo of Mutsu Province. Nanbu Motoyuki established Ne Castle, which was intended to be a center for the imperial government administration in the area. This marked the official transfer of the seat of the Nanbu clan from Kai Province to Mutsu. Nanbu Motoyuki was under allegiance to the Southern Court; however, at the same time, another branch of the same Nanbu family ruled the nearby Sannohe and Morioka areas under allegiance to the rival Northern Court. The two branches of the clan <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with each other in 1393.|$|E
5|$|Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin {{had ordered}} all {{settlers}} to stay {{to the east}} of the Divide, as the state and federal governments had not <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> with the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to Ashcroft, an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher Cottonwood Pass through Taylor Park and then back over Taylor Pass to get there, even though this made for a 100-mile (160km) journey, 40 miles (64km) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{moved back}} onto the {{offensive}} in Europe in 1543, allying himself with Spain against France once again. Despite Henry's initial successes around Boulogne in northern France, King Charles and Francis <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> in 1544, leaving England exposed to an invasion by France, backed by her allies in Scotland. In response Henry issued another device in 1544 to improve the country's defences, particularly along the south coast. Work began on Southsea Castle in 1544 on Portsea Island to further protect the Solent, and on Sandown Castle the following year on the neighbouring Isle of Wight. Brownsea Castle in Dorset was begun in 1545, and Sharpenrode Bulwark was built opposite Hurst Castle from 1545 onwards.|$|E
