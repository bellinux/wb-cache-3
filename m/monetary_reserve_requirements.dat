40|$|This paper applies {{and extends}} a {{theoretical}} model built by Agénor and Montiel (2007) by exploring {{the effectiveness of}} government bonds and monetary policy in a small, open, credit-based economy with a fixed exchange rate. The model is applied to Benin, {{a member of a}} currency union, using a general equilibrium model with stochastic simulation. Model calibration replicates the historical pattern for 1996 – 2009. Policy experiments simulated an increase in government securities in Benin’s regional market and a cut in the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement.</b> Simulations produced mixed results. It appears that, among other factors, excess bank liquidity lowers the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments through the credit channel and that government bonds can help mop up excess bank liquidity.

Time series and bank-specific data are utilized to highlight linkages between policy, wholesale market, and retail market interest rates. Our analysis shows that responses {{to changes in}} the policy interest rate are gradual in the wholesale market. Prolonged deviation in the interbank interest rate from the prime rate illustrate the challenges the Bank of Ghana faces when targeting a short-term money market interest rate. Asymmetries in the wholesale market adjustment possibly relate to monetary policy signaling, weak policy credibility, and liquidity management. In the retail market, pass-through to deposit and lending interest rates is protracted and incomplete. 1 Banks;Central bank policy;Financial systems;Interest rates;monetary policy, central bank, inflation, money market, monetary fund, monetary policy implementation, money market interest rate, monetary authorities, liquidity management, <b>monetary</b> transmission, lead, <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements,</b> inflation-targeting, <b>monetary</b> transmission mechanism, monetary aggregates, monetary aggregate, <b>monetary</b> policy framework, <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement,</b> open market operations, monetary authority, monetary targets, money demand, monetary system, monetary systems, demand for money, monetary policy regimes, monetary policy rules, monetary union, monetary policy transparency, monetary economics...|$|R

It first describes the changing transmission channels over the last decade. Second, the channels are evaluated in a VAR model. The exchange rate channel plays a strong role in propagating monetary shocks to output and prices. Most other channels (bank lending, asset price) are rather weak. The interest rate channel is underdeveloped but appears to be strengthening since the introduction of the interest corridor in 2005, which bodes well for adopting inflation targeting over the medium term.

But maintaining reserve requiremnts needs a contemporary rationale, no matter what their original purposes may have been. The obvious reasons to maintain reserve requiremets are to regulate bank liquidity, to conduct monetary policy (regulation of the money multiplier or short-term interest rates) and to pay the special "tax" to the state budget. This article deals especially with the third reason but the liquidity and monetary policy are also discussed. All three rationales seems not to be equivalent to the burden of the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> on the banking system and to the distorting effects on financial markets.

It also looks for systematic differences in the behavior of domestic and foreign banks during periods of financial distress and tranquil times. Using differences in bank ownership as a proxy for financial constraints, the paper finds weak evidence that foreign banks have a lower sensitivity of credit to monetary conditions relative to their domestic competitors, with the differences driven by banks with lower asset liquidity and/or capitalization. The lending and deposit rates of foreign banks tend to be smoother during periods of financial distress. However, the differences across domestic and foreign banks {{do not appear to be}} strong. These results provide weak support to the existence of supply-side effects in credit markets and suggest that foreign bank entry in emerging countries may have contributed somewhat to stability in credit markets.

Second, using Markov switching models, central bank operations are then graphically associated with reductions in term funding stress. Finally, bivariate VAR and GARCH models are adopted to econometrically quantified these impacts.

This model is used to show that counterpart funds need not have any economic impact if their creation, use, and effects are adequately monitored and understood, both by donors and by the authorities in the recipient country. The policy rules that ensure an inflation- and foreign reserves-neutral result from expected and unexpected foreign aid are derived and contrasted with a policy rule regarding unexpected foreign aid that is sometimes observed in IMF programs.

Inflation in 2002 was the lowest since Belarus became independent, yet it remains the highest in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Under current policies, the outlook for 2003 is broadly similar to the outcome for 2002. Inflation is expected at about 27 percent, and real GDP growth is likely to slow modestly to about 4 percent.

40|$|As China''s economy {{becomes more}} market based and {{continues}} its rapid {{integration into the}} global economy, having an independent and effective monetary policy regime oriented to domestic objectives will become increasingly important. Employing modern principles of monetary policy {{in light of the}} current state of China''s financial institutions, we motivate and present a package of proposals to guide the operation of a new monetary policy regime. Specifically, we recommend an explicit low long-run inflation objective, operational independence for the People''s Bank of China (PBC) with formal strategic guidance from the government, and a minimal set of financial sector reforms (to make the Chinese banking system robust against interest rate fluctuations). We argue that anchoring monetary policy with an explicit inflation objective would be the most reliable way for the PBC to tie down inflation expectations, and thereby enable monetary policy to make the best contribution to macroeconomic and financial stability, as well as economic growth. The management and monitoring of money (and credit) growth by the PBC would continue to play a useful role in the stabilization of inflation, but a money target would not constitute a good stand-alone nominal anchor.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the evolving role of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> {{as a policy}} tool in China. Since 2007, the Chinese central bank (PBC) has relied more on this tool to withdraw domestic liquidity surpluses, as a cheaper substitute for open-market operation instruments in this period of rapid FX accumulation. China’s <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> system has also become more complex and been used to address a range of other policy objectives, not least being macroeconomic management, financial stability and credit policy. The preference for using <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> reflects the size of China’s FX sterilisation task and the associated cost considerations, a quantity-oriented monetary policy framework challenged to reconcile policy dilemmas and tactical considerations. The PBC often finds it easier to reach consensus over <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> decisions than interest rate decisions and enjoys greater discretion in applying this tool. The <b>monetary</b> effects of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> need to be explored {{in conjunction with other}} policy actions and not in isolation. Depending on the policy mix, higher <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> tend to signal a tightening bias, to squeeze excess reserves of banks, to push market interest rates higher, and to help widen net interest spreads, thus tightening domestic monetary conditions. There are, however, costs to using this policy tool, as it imposes a tax burden on Chinese banks that in turn appear to have passed a significant portion of this cost onto their customers, mostly depositors and SMEs. However, the pass-through onto bank customers appears to be partial. reserve requirements; sterilisation tools; monetary policy; net interest margin and spread; tax incidence; Chinese economy...|$|R
40|$|This paper takes {{stock of}} the {{evolution}} of the international monetary system over the last thousand years. Several points stand out from the analysis. One is the reluctance of governments to embrace radical changes in international monetary relations. Another is the conflict between external and domestic objectives over the cycle, which {{has been a source of}} significant tension in the industrial core through much of this century, is now becoming a significant issue for developing countries. Finally, recent developments represent a return to the more market-driven international monetary system that characterized the better part of the preceeding millennium.

40|$|Most {{central banks}} oblige {{depository}} institutions to hold minimum reserves against their liabilities, predominantly {{in the form}} of balances at the central bank. The role of these <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> has evolved significantly over time. The overlay of changing purposes and practices has the result that it is not always fully clear what the current purpose of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> is, and this necessarily complicates thinking about how a reserve regime should be structured. This paper describes three main purposes for <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> - prudential, <b>monetary</b> control and liquidity management - and suggests best practice for the structure of a reserves regime. Finally, the paper illustrates current practices using a 2010 IMF survey of 121 central banks.

40|$|The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) and its {{operational}} independence {{changed over}} time {{in line with the}} evolution of the monetary policy framework {{and as a result of}} the currency crisis in the late 1980 s. The paper examines the developments of the CBJ, its independence in conducting monetary policy and the various instruments at its disposal, with special focus on the certificates of deposit (CDs) market, the main monetary policy instrument, and the treasury bill market. The paper also examines the issue of the autonomy of monetary policy in Jordan given the influence of world interest rates. Although, Jordan operates an exchange rate peg, which has been fixed to the USD since 1995, there is some room for flexibility in operating monetary policy in the short-run, where the CBJ has some autonomy in determining the spread between domestic and US interest rates. VAR and VECM results suggest that the response of the policy rate in Jordan to innovations in the US Federal Fund''s rate is less than one-for-one. In the short-run, the CBJ appears to conduct monetary policy in response to domestic inflation and a measure of the domestic output gap.

The large and highly variable payment float in the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Russia has complicated the conduct of monetary policy. However, reforms in late 1992 and early 1993 have been effective, as judged from their impact in reducing the level and variability of float, and have set the stage for medium-term reforms of the payments system. Rapid progress in the implementation of these reforms, and their appropriate coordination with monetary operations, remain critical to meet the emerging needs in money and foreign exchange markets, and to support the transition to indirect methods of monetary control.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{question}} of how to achieve monetary policy credibility and price stability after a financial crisis. We draw stylized facts and conclusions from ten recent cases: Brazil (1999); Bulgaria (1997); Ecuador (2000); Indonesia (1997); Korea (1997); Malaysia (1997); Mexico (1994), Russia (1998); Thailand (1997); and Turkey (2001). Among our conclusions, highlights include: (i) monetary policy alone cannot stabilize; (ii) floats bring nominal stability quickly in countries with low pre-crisis inflation and hard pegs have been at least narrowly successful for countries in deeper disarray; (iii) in floats, early and determined tightening brings nominal stability and does not appear more costly for output; (iv) monetary aggregate targeting rarely serves as a coherent framework for floats; informal or full-fledged inflation targeting offers more promise.
