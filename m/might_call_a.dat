In a letter to Stern, Rush indicated that he <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> hearing [...] "should the facts warrant public scrutiny."

500|$|The BBC {{tracked down}} several {{officials}} {{involved in the}} accident's aftermath. One was William H. Chambers, a former nuclear weapons designer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Chambers headed a team dealing with nuclear accidents, including the Thule crash. He explained the logic behind the decision to abandon the search: [...] "There was disappointment in what you <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> failure to return all of the components... {{it would be very}} difficult for anyone else to recover classified pieces if we couldn't find them." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Rolling Stone, Greil Marcus wrote in 1969 that Morrison's lyrics were thoughtful and deeply intellectual, [...] "in {{terms of the}} myths and metaphors that exist within the world of rock and roll". He believed both the music and lyrics captured the spirit of Bob Dylan's 1967 album John Wesley Harding, while calling Astral Weeks a [...] "unique and timeless" [...] record. Rolling Stone later named it the album of the year. Melody Maker also called {{it one of the}} year's best records, featuring Morrison's [...] "small harsh voice" [...] backed by an attractive musical combo that [...] "verges on genius" [...] during [...] "Madame George". When his third album Moondance was released in 1970, Warner Bros. ran full-page advertisements remarking on the unavailability of Astral Weeks in record stores, calling it a [...] "damn shame" [...] that it [...] "ended up as what you <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> critically acclaimed but obscure album ... If you want it and can't find it, yell at the store's record buyer. Loud, because you're the customer and you're always right. Undo the veils of potential obscurity." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{time series}} {{database}} (TSDB) is a software {{system that is}} optimized for handling time series data, arrays of numbers indexed by time (a datetime or a datetime range). In some fields these time series are called profiles, curves, or traces. A time series of stock prices <b>might</b> be <b>called</b> <b>a</b> price curve. A time series of energy consumption <b>might</b> be <b>called</b> <b>a</b> load profile. A log of temperature values over time <b>might</b> be <b>called</b> <b>a</b> temperature trace.|$|R
2500|$|The British {{government}} {{subscribed to}} what one <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> 1930s {{version of the}} [...] "domino theory." [...] If Japan took control of China, {{it was believed that}} inevitably, Japan would then attack Britain's Asian colonies plus the Dominions of Australia and New Zealand. As such, the Chamberlain government, unwilling {{to go to war with}} Japan, was not prepared to accept a Japanese victory over China either. From the viewpoint of London, it was much preferable that Japan remain embroiled in China than attack the British Empire. The British Ambassador in China, Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr reported to London that unless Britain gave China loans to continue the war, the economic collapse of Nationalist China that the Japanese were banking on might very well occur.|$|E
2500|$|Since commencing {{his writing}} process in January 1973, Lucas had done [...] "various rewrites {{in the evenings}} after the day's work." [...] He would write four {{different}} screenplays for Star Wars, [...] "searching {{for just the right}} ingredients, characters and storyline. It's always been what you <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> good idea in search of a story." [...] By May 1974, he had expanded the film treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller. He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role {{as a member of a}} family of dwarfs. Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills. He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog, Indiana (whom he would later use as namesake for his character Indiana Jones), who often acted as the director's [...] "co-pilot" [...] by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{interpretations of}} global {{citizenship}} are positive. For example, Parekh advocates {{what he calls}} globally oriented citizenship, and states, [...] "If global citizenship means being {{a citizen of the}} world, it is neither practicable nor desirable." [...] He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community. He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be [...] "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland." [...] Parekh presents his alternate option with the statement: [...] "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> globally oriented citizen." [...] Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E

2500|$|Vibe writer Laura Checkoway gave Afrodisiac 3.5 out of 5 {{stars and}} noted it as [...] "a {{far cry from}} the {{pleasing}} pubescent fluff of her formative years," [...] and although she felt that [...] "Brandy's sultry alto drowns on some songs," [...] she acknowledged, that [...] "while Brandy's musical liaison with Timbaland is what some people <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> match made in heaven, it's her crazy, sexy, cool revival that's the true bliss of this fourth coming." [...] Steve Jones from USA Today gave the album a three out of four stars rating, and commented: [...] "Timbaland provides her with plenty of funk-infused beats to groove to [...] while a few of the tracks are a bit pedestrian, Brandy is still seductive more often that not." [...] Ben Sisario, who wrote for Blender and gave the album three out of five stars, summed the album as [...] "an episode of her growing-pains TV show Moesha: This week, our honey-voiced heroine sheds her girlishness, sexing up to become 'a woman, a passionate woman'," [...] referring to its lyrical makeover. He called non-Timbaland productions like [...] "Talk About Our Love" [...] and [...] "Say You Will" [...] the highlights of the album. In 2012, amid the released of Norwood's sixth album Two Eleven, Noah Berlatsky of The Atlantic called Afrdoisiac [...] "the best album of Brandy's career and one of the greatest R albums of the last 25 years." ...|$|E
