40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} senior {{design team}} at Boise State University has been tasked with designing {{and building a}} Pill Box to allow for dosage alerts and a greater peace of mind for caregivers {{in accordance with the}} requests of our sponsor, Dr. Jim Browning. Studies show that medication non-compliance among the elderly population is largely due to poor memory, limited dexterity and a complex medication regimen. After reviewing products currently available on the market, and building various rudimentary prototypes, a device has been designed to address this widespread and potentially dangerous problem. With a $ 700 budget, the device currently being built will incorporate 28 compartments that will each house a pill cup for easy access. Above each pill cup, there will be a <b>magnetically</b> <b>held</b> lid with a plunger sensor. The sensor allows the device to monitor and record dosage activity as well as alert the user of incorrect dosage attempts. Each compartment is also equipped with a green LED light that will flash along with an audio alert to remind the user to take their medication based on programming input by the caregiver. This device will serve to reduce medication errors and increase independence for its users...|$|R

The purpose of these is to take any incoming individual Time Slot and connect it to an outgoing Time Slot and so perform a switching and routing function.

40|$|Zarembski, Allan M. Railroad {{transportation}} {{has been}} very important for human being for last two centuries. Although it is {{known as one of}} the safest forms of land transportation systems; mechanical, operational, and human behavioral problems result in a significant number of derailments on US railroads every year. While a collision represents the impact between two trains in any direction, a derailment occurs when a wheel of a car runs off the track. One of the most common derailment cause category is wheel climb derailments. Wheel climb derailments can be results of wheel problems, rail problems and operational problems or combination of these. A significant percentage of the wheel climb derailments occurs at turnouts. Thus, it is vitally important to determine the conditions of switch points before a derailment occurs. In this study, a mechanism for wheel climb derailments has been applied to turnouts by using data taken from an Automated Switch Inspection Vehicle (ASIV). This data was used to conduct a set of wheel climb analysis to determine the critical points through the specific turnouts and the risk of wheel climb derailment. This thesis introduces the background of this methodology, conducts an analysis of collected data, and discusses the results and conclusions of this analysis. This methodology will help to evaluate condition of any switch point. Furthermore, hand <b>held</b> <b>switch</b> point inspection tools were evaluated and modified as a part of an IDEA Transportation Research Board project to reduce derailments in turnouts, and they are also presented in this thesis as a remedy of reducing wheel climb derailment risk. The author participated in this IDEA project, and conducted research on producing hand held tools for the US railroads. This thesis includes discussion of these newly generated tools. This study has an importance since it will change the inspection technique from visual type to a more reliable one. As a result of this study, critical locations that have a risk of wheel climb on turnouts are identified by the proposed methodology. The IDEA project outcomes also provided newly generated inspection tools to be used to inspect these critical points. University of Delaware, Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringM. C.

50|$|Magnetic liquid rotary seals {{operate with}} no {{maintenance}} and extremely low leakage {{in a very}} wide range of applications. Ferrofluid-based seals used in industrial and scientific applications are most often packaged in mechanical seal assemblies called rotary feedthroughs, which also contain a central shaft, ball bearings and an outer housing. The ball bearings provide two important functions: maintaining the shaft's centering within the seal gap, and supporting external loads. The bearings are the only mechanical wear-items, as the dynamic seal is actually a series of rings made of ultra-low vapor pressure, oil-based liquid <b>held</b> <b>magnetically</b> between the rotor and stator. Therefore, the operating life and equipment maintenance cycles are generally very long, and the drag torque very low. The magnet material is permanently charged and requires no electrical power or other re-energizing or maintenance. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs reach performance levels that other technologies can't achieve, by optimizing features such as ferrofluid viscosity and magnetic strength, magnet and steel materials, bearing arrangements, and water cooling for applications with extremely high speeds or temperatures. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs routinely operate in environments including ultra-high vacuum (below 10−8 mbar), temperatures over 1,000 °C, {{tens of thousands of}} RPM, and multiple-atmosphere pressures.|$|R

40|$|NASA is {{developing}} micro-shutter arrays for the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSpec) instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). These micro-shutter arrays allow NIRspec to do Multi Object Spectroscopy, {{a key part}} of the mission. Each array consists of 62414 individual 100 x 200 micron shutters. These shutters are <b>magnetically</b> opened and <b>held</b> electrostatically. Individual shutters are then programmatically closed using a simple row/column addressing technique. A common approach to provide these data/clock patterns is to use a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Such devices require complex VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) programming and custom electronic hardware. Due to JWST's rapid schedule on the development of the micro-shutters, rapid changes were required to the FPGA code to facilitate new approaches being discovered to optimize the array performance. Such rapid changes simply could not be made using conventional VHDL programming. Subsequently, National Instruments introduced an FPGA product that could be programmed through a Labview interface. Because Labview programming is considerably easier than VHDL programming, this method was adopted and brought success.
