This article identifies spatial quality determinants that are affected by renovation in residential buildings. We performed a detailed assessment of changes in spatial quality due to <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations</b> in renovation. The article presents two main findings. First we identified common spatial quality determinants in the research literature: view, privacy, lighting, spatiality, spatial arrangements, the transition between public and private spaces, and perceived, built, and human densities. Second we found that the available assessment for the renovation of dwellings covers only partially the impact of <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations</b> on spatiality. We suggest, based on these findings, a general spatial quality checklist to support architects, developers, and building owners. We probed deeper into the impact of <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations</b> on the spatiality of dwellings to propose a spatial quality assessment to be considered before and after renovation. The proposed assessment represents a further step toward the inclusion of spatial quality in building renovation processes, which benefits stakeholders from design professionals to end users...|$|R

A systematic approach with multidisciplinary inputs will lead to the formulation of a series of holistic and practical measures. An investigation in “WiseNews”, a comprehensive newspaper search engine, shows that there were at least 60 E&M works related fatal cases between 1998 and 2014 in Hong Kong. Fatalities due to fall of person from height and contact with electricity account for over 70 % of all occupational fatalities in electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations.</b> The study also found that the proportion of occupational fatalities due to fall of person from height is occurred more frequently in air-conditioning installation trade.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this project is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of replacing steam driven turbines in a sugar mill with electric motors. To do this {{it was necessary to}} firstly verify precisely what the task was that the existing drive was doing. In this case the steam turbine was driving a pump that delivered water to two bagasse fuelled boilers in a sugar mill. Also the task involved the investigation and delivery of improving the existing system. By analysing parameters of the current installation such as reliability, efficiency and suitability of the existing installation, a benchmark was created that we could measure any improvements against. After the plant requirements were determined, the new installation could be designed. Pump and motor sizing was done using flow, head and pressure measurements. Drawings such as Electrical schematics, P &IDs and mechanical layouts were then developed. The electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>installation</b> then followed. As part of the upgrade a programmable logic controller and HMI (Human Machine Interface) were programmed to provide better control and supervision of the process.

The building is located {{in the heart of the}} Piran city centre and consists of ground and first floor with dimensions of 17, 0 x 10, 0 m. Reconstruction of the bearing structure and replacement of the existing wooden floor slab by a reinforced concrete one was foreseen. Restoration of stone stairs and new electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>installation</b> was planned. Time schedule and the site layout plan are specific due to the inaccessibility and lack of space which are typical for old historical city centres. A separate chapter describes the basic preliminary tests which should be carried out prior to reconstruction works.

During wide excavation, historical underground structures were discovered. Construction was therefore stopped, and archeological works had to be initiated. These works resulted in a set of findings and consequent recommendations to be used in continuation. Methods suitable for restoration of old foundations and walls are described.

The paper presents the concept of Multi-objective Multidisciplinary design optimization techniques to support trade-off decisions between multiple conflicting design objectives and interdisciplinary design methodology, during the conceptual design of sport buildings. The proposed method is based on parametric modelling, performance simulation tools and algorithms for computational optimization, for which the paper tackles three specific aspects. First of all, due to the complexity of large sport buildings, the formulation of the optimization and the screening of the related design variables is crucial in order to obtain a meaningful design space, which helps reducing unnecessary computational burden.
