40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{moisture}} diffusion coefficient of Dahurian Larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) by use of the Finite Difference Method (FDM). To obtain <b>moisture</b> <b>distributions</b> the dimensional boards of Dahurian Larch were dried, from which test samples were cut and sliced evenly into 9 pieces in different drying periods, so that <b>moisture</b> <b>distributions</b> at different locations and times across the thickness of Dahurian Larch were obtained with a weighing method. With these experimental data, FDM was used to solve Fick’s one-dimensional unsteady-state diffusion equation, and the moisture diffusion coefficient across the thickness at specified time was obtained. Results indicated that the moisture diffusion coefficient decreased from the surface {{to the center of}} the Dahurian Larch wood, and it decreased with decreasing moisture content at constant wood temperature; as the wood temperature increased, the moisture diffusion coefficient increased, and the effect of the wood temperature on the moisture diffusion coefficient was more significant than that of moisture content. Moisture diffusion coefficients were different for the two experiments due to differing diffusivity of the specimens...|$|R
50|$|Rachie & Roberts (1974) classed ricebean as {{adapted to}} subhumid regions with 1000-1500 mm precipitation, {{although}} {{they noted that}} other factors were also involved in adaptation, for example rainfall pattern, <b>moisture</b> <b>distribution,</b> temperature, cloud cover and relative humidity, soil characteristics, pests and diseases. They noted the importance of human needs in assessing adaptation - for example taste, {{the need for a}} particular use, or market price. Average yields were between 200 and 300 kg ha−1, although with the potential for 1200 kg ha−1, the crop would grow on a range of soils, and was resistant to pests and diseases. It would mature in as little as 60 days, and although performing well under humid conditions, was also tolerant to drought (NAS 1979) and high temperatures. It is tolerant to some degree of waterlogging, although the young plants appear to be susceptible (de Carvallho & Veira, 1996). Ricebean is also known to be tolerant to acid soils (Dwivedi, 1996). Shattering is a problem in comparison with other grain legumes, and can be particularly serious under conditions of frequent wetting and drying.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. High-performance {{concrete}} (HPC) {{will undergo}} severe damage under fire conditions.

Therefore, the determination of the <b>moisture</b> <b>distribution</b> evolution in concrete is essential to the damage analysis of heated HPC. This paper presents a numerical method for the prediction of the <b>moisture</b> <b>distribution</b> evolution in HPC under fire conditions. In the method, the vapor pressure and the moisture transport induced by the vapor pressure gradient are analyzed. The effect of the thermal decomposition on the <b>moisture</b> <b>distribution</b> and the effects of the slippage flow and the water saturation degree on the permeability are considered. The proposed method is applied to the <b>moisture</b> <b>distribution</b> analysis of a concrete cube with 90 % initial moisture content under fire conditions and can be further used for the analysis of the thermal damage of heated HPC...|$|E

Four drying models are employed to determine the drying process parameters (drying coefficient, lag factor, and half-drying time) and moisture transfer parameters (moisture diffusivity and moisture transfer coefficient), and to calculate <b>moisture</b> content <b>distributions</b> and compare themwith extensive sets of experimen-tal moisture data measured during the drying of slab cut potato slices at different drying air temperatures and flow velocities. Good agreement is obtained between the calculations and experimental measurements for the cases. In addition, experimental drying times are deter-mined and compared with those obtained by the four different drying models.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to study factors affecting <b>moisture</b> <b>distribution</b> in 290 -kilogram stirred-curd Cheddar cheese blocks cooled in stainless steel hoops. Uneven <b>moisture</b> <b>distribution</b> within blocks may create cheese with variable texture and flavor, which can be extremely costly to the producer. The effects of temperature, pH, and vacuum treatment on <b>moisture</b> <b>distribution</b> were investigated. Temperature, pH, moisture, and pressure profiles were presented. Also, comparisons were made between temperature profiles of 290 - kilogram stirred-curd Cheddar cheese blocks cooled in stainless steel and in plywood hoops, {{as well as between}} temperature profiles of 66 -kilogram Swiss cheese blocks cooled in cardboard and in plastic boxes. Moisture transferred from high to low temperature in the cheese blocks. Moisture may have transferred in response to thermally induced curd moisture-holding capacity gradients in the cheese blocks. Moisture also may have transferred in the cheese blocks by a mechanism similar to thermo-osmosis of liquids in porous solids. The cheese in the plywood or cardboard insulating materials cooled more uniformly than the cheese in the stainless steel or plastic containers. More uniform cooling of the cheese produced more uniform <b>moisture</b> <b>distribution</b> in the cheese blocks. Recommendations were made to help the cheesemaker produce cheese with even <b>moisture</b> <b>distribution...</b>|$|E
