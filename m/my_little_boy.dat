Before Allenby went to bed every night, Allenby would enter the office of the officer who took the daily casualty returns, ask [...] "Have you any news of <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> today?" [...] and after the officer replied [...] "No news sir", Allenby would then go to bed a reassured man. His son, a lieutenant in the Royal Horse Artillery, was to die of wounds on 29 July 1917 aged 19, at Coxyde, Belgium.|$|E
2500|$|Armageddon was {{originally}} slated for release mid-2012, {{but it was}} delayed because Sebastian wanted to be completely happy with it before it was released. He said, [...] "It's the longest I have spent with an album but I'm not rushing it for a TV performance or anything. It will happen when it's ready". He explained he had approached Armageddon {{in a different way}} than his previous albums, [...] "I haven't sat down to write an album, I've just been writing whatever I feel. I'm still learning what defines me as an artist. There's stuff in there that radio won't touch but it needs to be there and I think it lifts the album. [...] I've done most of it myself and I've really taken my time." [...] While the album has the upbeat happy music and love songs he is known for, Sebastian said becoming a father earlier in the year brought new awareness, and he started analysing the world his son would grow up in. He explained it gave him a broader perspective, and while he had always taken notice of the state of world affairs, he had never written about it in song before. Because of this he said the album has more light and shade, [...] "there's definitely moments where it has a bit more depth to it -- it's not just 'I love you, do you love me too?' Obviously there's some love songs in there, but there's also a bit more commentary on the world that <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> (Hudson) is going to inherit." [...] When asked to give five words that could describe the album Sebastian used the words [...] "dark", [...] "reflective", [...] "happy", [...] "appreciative" [...] and [...] "anxious".|$|E
