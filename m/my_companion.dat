An {{example of the}} former {{would be the case}} of an engineer facing a difficult professional decision, who, while sitting in a cinema, heard a voice saying, ‘loudly and distinctly’: ‘You can’t do it, you know’. [...] He adds: ‘It was so clear and resonant that I turned and looked at <b>my</b> <b>companion</b> who was gazing placidly at the screen I was amazed and somewhat relieved when it became apparent that I was the only person who had heard anything.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr and Abdullah ibn Umar were mid level Muslim commanders at the Battle of Yarmouk {{that took}} Syria. Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr sister Asmā' bint Abu Bakr also {{fought in the}} Battle of Yarmouk and was opposed to Yazid. Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr {{had been one of}} the first to duel in that battle, after taking a sword to hand over to a Qays bin Hubayrah who had lost his sword, while in a duel with the Roman Army's best horseman. Two more Roman {{horsemen}} then came forward, saying, [...] "We see no justice when two of you come against one of us." [...] Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr replied, [...] "I only came to give <b>my</b> <b>companion</b> a sword and then return. Were 100 of you to come out against one of us we would not be worried. You are now three men. I am enough to take on all three of you". After which he took down the Roman horsemen on his own. After seeing this, Bannes the Roman general said [...] "Caesar really knew these people best. I now know that a difficult situation is to come on you. If you do not attack them with great numbers, you will have no chance". Abdullah ibn Umar had also been a mid level commander in the Battle of Yarmouk. Some Roman soldiers went to the house of Abu al-Jaid a local Christian in az-Zura ah and after eating all the food, raped his wife and killed his son. His wife complained to the Roman general and he ignored her. Abu al-Jaid then went to the Muslims and told them that he knows the local area and if the Muslims exempt him and his descendents from taxes for ever he will help them defeat the Roman army. He then took horse men led by Abdullah ibn Umar to the Roman camp at night and attacked them and then ran away. The Romans chased them and in the dark tens of thousands of them fell down a cliff at the an-Naqusah Creek into a river. Abdullah bin Az-Zubair had also been a commander in various battles including in North Africa and was also involved in the siege of Constantinople.|$|E
