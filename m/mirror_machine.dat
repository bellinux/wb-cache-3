5000|$|The {{design of}} a {{magnetic}} <b>mirror</b> <b>machine</b> {{was first published in}} 1967. [...] The concept was developed in the US by Richard F. Post and his team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory during the late sixties. [...] Partially due to the 1970s energy crisis and the Cold War the funding was available for a massive magnetic mirror and magnetic bottle research program. This led to a series of machines starting in the late 1960s and continuing into the mid eighties. This included the 2X magnetic bottle and Baseball I, Baseball II mirror machines before the TMX was built.|$|E
50|$|A {{magnetic}} bottle is two magnetic mirrors placed close together. For example, two parallel coils {{separated by a}} small distance, carrying the same current {{in the same direction}} will produce a {{magnetic bottle}} between them. Unlike the full <b>mirror</b> <b>machine</b> which typically had many large rings of current surrounding the middle of the magnetic field, the bottle typically has just two rings of current. Particles near either end of the bottle experience a magnetic force towards the center of the region; particles with appropriate speeds spiral repeatedly {{from one end of the}} region to the other and back. Magnetic bottles can be used to temporarily trap charged particles. It is easier to trap electrons than ions, because electrons are so much lighter This technique is used to confine the high energy of plasma in fusion experiments.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1960s, {{many of the}} center's {{exhibits}} {{were carried}} over from the original World's Fair exhibition, though {{only a few of}} these original exhibits remain. Currently, exhibits remaining from the World's Fair are the Lens and <b>Mirror</b> <b>Machine</b> and a suspended model of the Earth's moon. One of the more notable science exhibits during the World's Fair was a ramp where the buildings were built at a tilt (the [...] "illusion ramp"); this exhibit was reproduced in the late 1990s. The domed Spacerium, now known as the Seattle Laser Dome and used for laser light show, was designed for a wide-angle movie journey through space. Before IMAX, a previous movie theater there showed films such as NASA's Apollo 8 (to the soundtrack of Yellow Submarine) and The 21st Century with Walter Cronkite. Before being elected {{governor of the state of}} Washington, Dixy Lee Ray, Ph.D. served as Science Center director for many years. Ray helped promote the Science Center amongst school children by hosting a school-age geared science program televised on Seattle PBS station KCTS-9.|$|E
5000|$|Lawrence Lidsky famously {{criticized the}} {{magnetic}} <b>mirror</b> <b>machines</b> by saying: [...] "They kept adding {{one set of}} magnets a year until it collapsed under its own weight" [...] and in his article [...] "The Trouble With Fusion." ...|$|R
25|$|Magnetic Mirror One {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement {{is with the}} magnetic mirror effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices that try to use this effect. The most famous was the magnetic <b>mirror</b> <b>machines,</b> which {{was a series of}} large, expensive devices built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from the 1960s to mid 1980s. Some other examples include the magnetic bottles and Biconic cusp. Because the <b>mirror</b> <b>machines</b> were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second direct conversion energy capture, was easier to implement. As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|Post {{joined the}} staff at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{as leader of the}} {{controlled}} thermonuclear research group until 1974. [...] During this time, he developed many of concepts behind magnetic mirrors and direct energy conversion. [...] He worked with Marshall Rosenbluth to develop the stability of plasma inside <b>mirror</b> <b>machines.</b> [...] From 1974 to 1987 he was deputy associate director of the magnetic fusion energy program at LLNL. This was a heavily funded effort by the United States Department of Energy to build a succession of magnetic <b>mirror</b> <b>machines,</b> including the <b>Mirror</b> Fusion Test Facility (MFTF) and the Tandem Mirror Facility. After 1987, Post was senior scientist in the magnetic fusion energy program. [...] He has held advisory roles at NASA, the National Academy of Sciences and the United States Air Force.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} protecting distributed IoT units from network based attacks while still having {{a high level of}} availability. In particular we suggest a novel method where the IoT device execution state is modeled with a suitable high level application model and where the execution state of the application of the IoT device is “mirrored” in a cloud executed machine. This machine has very high availability and high attack resistance. The IoT device will only communicate with the <b>mirror</b> <b>machine</b> in the cloud using a dedicated synchronization protocol. All essential IoT state information and state manipulations are communicated through this synchronization protocol while all end application communication directed towards the IoT units is done towards the <b>mirror</b> <b>machine</b> in the cloud. This gives a very robust and secure system with high availability at the price of slower responses. However, for many non-real time IoT application with high security demands this performance penalty can be justified...|$|E

25|$|For many decades, cusped {{confinement}} never behaved experimentally as was predicted. Sharply bent {{fields were}} used by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{in a series of}} magnetic <b>mirror</b> <b>machines</b> from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. After hundreds of millions were spent, the machines still leaked plasma at the field ends. Many scientists shifted focus onto looping the fields, into a tokamak. Eventually it was thought that cusped confinement effect did not exist.|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{engineering}} simplicity, <b>mirror</b> <b>machines</b> and related open-trap machines such as gas dynamic traps, are an attractive concept for achieving controlled nuclear fusion. Unfortunately, these concepts have not achieved to date very spectacular laboratory results, and their reactor prospects are dimmed {{by the prospect}} of a low Q-factor, the ratio of fusion power produced to auxiliary power. Nonetheless, because of its engineering promise, over the years numerous improvements and inventions have been proposed to enhance the reactor prospects of magnetic mirror fusion, such as tandem designs, end-plugging, and the design of electric potential barriers. Here, we suggest that the use of rf fields interacting with mirror-confined ions, such that the ions diffuse in the rf fields along highly constrained orbits, can make these open-trap concepts considerably more attractive as fusion devices. The alpha channeling effect in <b>mirror</b> <b>machines</b> holds similar promise to alpha channeling in tokamaks, In tokamaks, where diffusion along highly constrained orbits might channel the alpha particle energy, the alpha channeling effect is implemented by exciting waves that diffuse resonant particles along diffusion paths connecting high-energy alpha particles in the tokamak interior with low-energy partcles in the periphery, so that a population inversion occurs alon...|$|R

As a result, {{it is expected}} that the LFS-measurement is possible at the plasma periphery but is difficult at the centre of the core plasma, the latter being because of a low signal to noise ratio (SNR< 1).

Experimental studies of electron and ion diffusion through the magnetic cusps and its relation with plasma and machine working parameters are presented. The relations between the obtained ECR plasma with the desired characteristics of material plasma processing re-actors are also studied.

25|$|In high beta conditions, {{the machine}} may operate with cusp confinement. This is an {{improvement}} over the simpler magnetic mirror. The MaGrid has six point cusps, each located {{in the middle of}} a ring; and two highly modified line cusps, linking the eight corner cusps located at cube vertices. The key is that these two line cusps are much narrower than the single line cusp in magnetic <b>mirror</b> <b>machines,</b> so the net losses are less. The two line cusps losses are similar to or lower than the six face-centered point cusps.|$|R
