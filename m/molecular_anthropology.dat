40|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>Anthropology</b> is a {{relatively}} young field of research. In fact, less than 50 {{years have passed since}} the symposium ''Classification and Human Evolution'' (1962, Burg Wartenstein, Austria), where the term was formally introduced by Emil Zuckerkandl. In this time, <b>Molecular</b> <b>Anthropology</b> has developed both methodologically and theoretically and extended its applications, so covering key aspects of human evolution such as the reconstruction of the history of human populations and peopling processes, the characterization of DNA in extinct humans and the role of adaptive processes in shaping the genetic diversity of our species. In the current scientific panorama, molecular anthropologists have to face a double challenge. As members of the anthropological community, we are strongly committed to the integration of biological findings and other lines of evidence (e. g. linguistic and archaeological), while keeping in line with methodological innovations which are moving the approach from the genetic to the genomic level. In this framework, the meeting "DNA Polymorphisms in Human Populations: <b>Molecular</b> <b>Anthropology</b> in the Genomic Era" (Rome, December 3 - 5, 2009) offered an opportunity for discussion among scholars from different disciplines, while paying attention to the impact of recent methodological innovations.

40|$|This review broadly {{summarizes}} how {{molecular biology}} {{has contributed to}} our understanding of human evolution. <b>Molecular</b> <b>anthropology</b> began in the 1960 s with immunological comparisons indicating that African apes and humans were closely related and, indeed, shared a common ancestor as recently as 5 million years ago. Although initially dismissed, this finding has proven robust and numerous lines of molecular evidence now firmly place the human-ape divergence at 4 – 8 Ma. Resolving the trichotomy among humans, chimpanzees and gorillas took a few more decades. Despite the readily apparent physical similarities shared by African apes to the exclusion of modern humans (body hair, knuckle-walking, thin tooth enamel), the molecular support for a human–chimpanzee clade is now overwhelming. More recently, whole genome sequencing and gene mapping have shifted the focus of <b>molecular</b> <b>anthropology</b> from phylogenetic analyses to phenotypic reconstruction and functional genomics. We are starting to identify the genetic basis of the morphological, physiological and behavioural traits that distinguish modern humans from apes and apes from other primates. Most notably, recent comparative genomic analyses strongly indicate that the marked differences between modern humans and chimpanzees are likely due more to changes in gene regulation than to modifications of the genes themselves, an idea first proposed over 30 years ago.

We observed that some HLA alleles distribute unevenly in the North and in the South, and that the genetic diversity (heterozygosity of the populations) decreased from north to south.

In addition, we tested the ability of RM Y-STRs to discriminate between unrelated individuals carrying the same Y-filer haplotype, using the haplogroup R-M 269 (reportedly characterised by a strong resemblance in Y-STR profiles) as a case study. Our results, despite confirming the high mutability of RM Y-STRs, show significantly lower mutation rates than reference germline ones. Consequently, their power to discriminate between related individuals, despite being higher than the one of Y-filer, does not seem to improve significantly the performance of the latter. On the contrary, when considering R-M 269 unrelated individuals, RM Y-STRs reveal significant discriminatory power and retain some phylogenetic signal, allowing the correct classification of individuals for some R-M 269 -derived sub-lineages.

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Molecular</b> <b>anthropology</b> - {{the study}} of human genetic polymorphisms - is now often used to {{investigate}} the accuracy of archaeological and/or linguistic hypotheses. One of the classic examples {{is the use of}} genetics in an attempt to discriminate between two alternative models for the spread of agriculture in Europe - the demic and the cultural diffusion models - which finally led to a general approval of the former by geneticists, who regard this spread as possibly linked to the expansion of Indo-European languages (Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza 1984, Renfrew 1992, Barbujani et al. 1995, Weng and Sokal 1995, Chikhi et al. 2002). More generally, because genetic clines can give evidence for population migrations (Barbujani 2000), the analysis of genetic patterns is particularly interesting for the analysis of early agriculturalist diasporas and their link to the diffusion of human languages (Barbujani and Pilastro 1993, Bellwood 2001). <b>Molecular</b> <b>anthropology</b> can also be useful in estimating the contribution of different gene pools to the make-up of present-day populations, when attempting to ascertain the origin of specific linguistic families (such as the Austronesian family, see further in this chapter); to test the permeability of linguistic boundaries to gene flow (Dupanloup de Ceuninck et al. 2000); or to investigate precise linguistic hypotheses (Excoffier et al. 1987; Poloni et al., this volume; this study), although genetics alone cannot be used to discriminate between alternative linguistic models. The present work aims at bringing genetic evidence to bear on the vexing question of East Asian linguistic relationships. The phylogenetic links between the main language phyla of this region (ST, AA, Tai-Kadai, AN and Altaic) are still deeply controversial (see the introduction to the volume for a review of the main theories). To investigate these relationships from a genetic point of view, we report here on the results of a population genetics analysis of one molecular polymorphism, HLA-DRB 1. The DRB 1 locus of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans is a cell surface protein-encoding gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 6 and surrounded by other HLA loci. Its allelic variability is amongst the highest known in the human genome thus far, with 418 DRB alleles detected by DNA oligotyping and sequencing techniques (IMGT/HLA sequence database 2003). Besides this high level of polymorphism, the DRB 1 locus also has the advantage of having been extensively tested at the DNA level in human populations for at least 15 years (mostly using the HLA International Workshop typing kits), and abundant population data with high-resolution allelic definition are thus available. In this study, we analyse this polymorphism to explore a possible congruence between genetic and linguistic relationships in East Asia...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{ability of}} the Y {{chromosome}} to retain a record of its evolution has seen it become an essential tool of <b>molecular</b> <b>anthropology.</b> In the last few years, however, it has also found use in forensic genetics, providing information on the geographic origin of individuals. This has been aided {{by the development of}} efficient screening methods and an increased knowledge of geographic distribution. In this study, we describe the development of single base extension assays used to resolve 61 Y chromosome haplogroups, mainly within haplogroups A, B and E, found in Africa. Results: Seven multiplex assays, which incorporated 60 Y chromosome markers, were developed. These resolved Y chromosomes to 61 terminal branches of the major African haplogroups A, B and E, while also including a few Eurasian haplogroups found occasionally in African males. Following its validation, the assays were used to screen 683 individuals from Southern Africa, including south eastern Bantu speakers (BAN), Khoe-San (KS) and South African Whites (SAW). Of the 61 haplogroups that the assays collectively resolved, 26 were found in the 683 samples. While haplogroup sharing was common between the BAN and KS, the frequencies of these haplogroups varied appreciably. Both groups showed low levels of assimilation of Eurasian haplogroups and only two individuals in the SAW clearly had Y chromosomes of African ancestry...|$|E
