50|$|In the Menabe {{region of}} Madagascar, a {{biodiversity}} hotspot of great importance, the Trust {{is working with}} a cluster of endangered species, including the Malagasy giant rat, flat-tailed tortoise, Madagascar big-headed turtle, narrow-striped mongoose and <b>Madagascar</b> <b>teal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{endangered}} animals {{include the}} aye-aye, Alaotran gentle lemur, free-ranging black lion tamarin, pied tamarin and silvery marmoset, Andean bear, maned wolf, narrow-striped mongoose, Mauritius pink pigeon, Mauritius kestrel, Saint Lucia amazon, Bali starling, Meller's duck, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>teal</b> (Bernier's teal), Round Island boa, Lesser Antillean iguana and Mallorcan midwife toad.|$|E
5000|$|Bernier's teal (Anas bernieri), {{also known}} as <b>Madagascar</b> <b>teal,</b> is a species of duck in the genus Anas. It is endemic to Madagascar, where it is found only along the west coast. Part of the [...] "grey teal" [...] complex found {{throughout}} Australasia, it is most {{closely related to the}} Andaman teal.|$|E
5000|$|Previously thought extinct, (found {{when looking}} for {{something}} else), Durrell have recently teamed up with Madagascar to help research and study the species. With scouts unable to locate more individuals, {{it has become a}} possibility that experts will have to bring the survivors back to Jersey, using expertise from the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>teal</b> and Meller's duck to help the duck get back from the brink ...|$|E
50|$|The RSCC housed {{species of}} birds, reptiles, mammals and {{amphibians}} from Africa, South America, Australasia and Asia including: Bali starling, Victoria crowned pigeon, american flamingo, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>teal,</b> binturong, clouded leopard, cotton-top tamarin, emperor tamarin, crowned lemur, fat-tailed dwarf lemur, fossa, Goeldi's monkey, jaguarundi, Owston's civet, potto, pygmy slow loris, red ruffed lemur, slow loris, western lesser bamboo lemur, rhinoceros hornbill, smooth-coated otter, sun bear, radiated tortoise, Malayan tiger, fishing cat and snow leopard.|$|E
50|$|Project Angonoka {{is one of}} the {{successful}} breeding programmes that has seen the rarest tortoise in the world, the angonoka, brought back from the brink of extinction. One of the rarest ducks in the world, the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>teal,</b> is now breeding successfully at the Trust’s headquarters in Jersey, and the Alaotran gentle lemur is starting to make a recovery, now that hunting and burning of its habitat have been dramatically reduced thanks to an education programme targeted at local villages and schools.|$|E
50|$|Great Apes - The exhibit {{features}} a walkway that is suspended above the ape's enclosure. The ground {{is covered in}} grass and includes trees and rope for the apes to climb. Western lowland gorilla {{can be seen on}} one side of the walkway and common chimpanzee and Bornean orangutan can be seen on both sides. Outside of this exhibit, various primate islands can be found that are home to the ring-tailed lemur, black-and-white ruffed lemur, blue-eyed black lemur, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>teal,</b> black-handed spider monkey, siamang, and koi.|$|E
5000|$|Madagascar, {{opened in}} 2008, is a {{walk-through}} exhibit which {{draws attention to}} the plight of endangered lemur species. The mixed exhibit features ring-tailed lemurs, collared lemurs, mongoose lemurs, crowned sifaka, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>teal</b> and radiated tortoise are also on show, and were brought into the collection especially for [...] "Madagascar". The breeding record of the lemur collection is very good with the ring-tailed lemurs giving birth regularly since their introduction in 2009, and the red bellied lemurs also having bred successfully. Lemur feeding and talk is held daily at 12 noon.|$|E
50|$|The Trust’s {{headquarters}} {{is also a}} ‘window’ {{to the work of}} Durrell Wildlife around the world - where visitors can enjoy the opportunity {{to see some of the}} planet’s most endangered species and learn how the Trust is working to save them. What keeper-conservationists learn about a species while it is living in Jersey can help to save its cousins struggling for survival in the wild. Some species, such as gorillas and orangutans, are well known while other species, such as the Livingstone's fruit bat, the pied tamarin, the giant jumping rat, the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>teal</b> (Bernier's teal), the echo parakeet (Mauritius parakeet), the mountain chicken (actually a giant frog), and Round Island boa, are more obscure.|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the globally {{threatened and}} little known <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Teal</b> was studied at Lake Bemamba, western Madagascar in July 1992. At least seven pairs and two single birds were observed. The pairs were tightly bonded and aggressively defended feeding space from conspecifics. Paired birds were dominant over and {{more aggressive than}} single birds. Paired males and females appeared to show similar levels of aggression. Copulation was observed but no other courtship behaviour, {{and there was no}} evidence of nesting activity. During day-light hours (0645 h to 1810 h), 80 % of time was spent feeding. The amount of time spent rest-ing increased notably between 1000 and 1300 h, but over 55 % of time was spent feeding at all times. <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Teal</b> are active dabblers in shallow water, moving almost constantly. Of time spent feeding, 68 % was conducted on foot and 32 % swimming. Detailed descriptions of feeding and agonistic behaviour are made. The species has markedly different behaviour, habitat use and life cycle to the other six species of Anatidae present in the lake. There also appear to be important differences in behaviour in comparison with the other, closely related, Austral teal. However, it is likely that <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Teal</b> have the long term pair bonds typical of Austral teal...|$|E
40|$|During {{one week}} {{of a survey}} for the {{endangered}} Madagascar Fish Eagle conducted along the coast between Mahajanga and Soalala of western Madagascar in June 1995, all mangroves that were accessible by boat were searched. In addition to one pair of Fish Eagles, a pair and a large flock of 81 <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Teal</b> were observed on a tidal mudflat in the Betsiboka River delta and another pair was sighted 15 km south flying by a Fish Eagle nest located in the mangroves of this estuary...|$|E
40|$|Ten wildfowl taxa are {{resident}} in Madagascar including four endemics: Madagascar White-backed Duck Thalassornis leuconotus insularis, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Teal</b> Anas bernieri, Meller’s Duck A. melleri and Madagascar Pochard Aythya innotata. These endemic duck taxa were amongst the last wildfowl forms {{to be described}} in Africa and are undoubtedly currently the rarest in this region. The history of our knowledge of these birds follows four easily definable stages: discovery, understanding, protection and the future. The new millennium has started with a much more detailed understanding of the four ducks ’ ecology than ever before, the protection of several key sites and the re-discovery in 2006 of the Madagascar Pochard. The next few years will tell if the ducks have a more secure future and, while not yet safe, Madagascar’s ducks are perhaps now among the better known of Africa’s endemic wildfowl. Key words: endemic, Madagascar, protection, status review, wildfowl. Madagascar has ten extant species of wildfowl (Anatidae) with a further two species (of sheldgeese) Centrornis majori and Alopochen sirabensis known only from sub-fossil remains (Table 1) (Young et al. 2003; Young & Kear 2006). The extant taxa include three full endemic species and an endemic subspecies with varied geographical origins: two species – <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Teal</b> Anas bernieri and Madagascar Pochard Aythya innotata – are of Australo/Asian origins, and two others...|$|E
