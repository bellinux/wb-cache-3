500|$|Ellen Wilkinson {{was born}} on 8 October 1891, at 41 Coral Street in the Manchester {{district}} of Chorlton-on-Medlock. She was the third child and second daughter of Richard Wilkinson, a cotton worker who became an insurance agent, and his wife, Ellen, née Wood. Richard Wilkinson was a pillar of his local Wesleyan Methodist church, and combined {{a strong sense of}} social justice with forthright views on self-help; rather than espousing working-class solidarity his view, according to Ellen, was: [...] "I have pulled <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the gutter, why can't they?" [...] Entirely self-educated, he ensured that his children received the best schooling available, encouraged them to read widely, and inculcated strong Christian principles.|$|E
500|$|Windle {{retired after}} the Games, noting that [...] "I have swum {{to that point}} when I could hardly lift <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water. I have seen John Konrads to that point also. I would always give 110%. There is no {{substitute}} for hard and honest work". Windle was usually regarded as the fittest and hardest-working member of the Australian swimming team. In retirement, Windle stayed in the United States for a few more years, working for Allis-Chalmers, an agricultural equipment corporation. He returned home after being transferred to the Australian division of the firm's operations. Windle was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Joe Kernan {{was adamant}} that Diarmuid Marsden {{did not deserve}} to be sent off and criticised players for pretending to be injured during the game. The player himself also {{disagreed}} with the decision: [...] "The umpire said I struck him but I just saw the man coming towards me and {{it was more a}} case of getting <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way or protecting myself." [...] He added: [...] "I'd never been sent off for Armagh before and to be sent off in an All-Ireland final is hard to take. Hopefully I won't be remembered for that. And I wouldn't like to end the career on that note." [...] Kernan and Marsden contested the decision and subsequent ban, but the GAA's Games Administration Committee upheld the penalty. However, after taking their case to the Central Council, the ban was overturned.|$|E

500|$|Webb's mother, {{a gifted}} classically trained pianist, {{encouraged}} his musical interests {{at a very}} young age. Music came naturally to him, and he began to play the guitar at six years old. Concerning his musical training, Webb explains that he got his ear for music from his mother, but not the ability to read music, and that he [...] "took one [...] lesson and then just taught <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the book." [...] While in high school, he became known for his skill on the guitar. He toured with a band, though it broke up in his junior year following a serious car accident returning from playing a show at Baylor University. Webb graduated from Klein High School in Klein, Texas in 1992. Before joining Caedmon's Call, he went to community college in Houston for half a semester, and shared an apartment with his older brother who was attending medical school.|$|E
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album were written by A.C. Newman and Destroyer {{frontman}} Dan Bejar. Newman recalled that he thought [...] "'How could we lose?' You could just take some interesting elements and put them together. Even taking <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the picture, when I looked at the band I just thought, 'This band's got to be great.' I thought, 'Okay, everyone can hate my songs, they can dismiss them.' But I have the most confidence in Dan's songs because I'm totally outside of him, looking in. I'm just a fan of him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's 1999 double album The Fragile was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics and was a commercial success, selling over two million copies {{by the end of}} the year. However, it failed to attain the success of its predecessor and fell from the top of the Billboard after only a week. Afterwards, the only original Nine Inch Nails material released until 2005 was the 2000 remix album Things Falling Apart, as well as the 2001 single [...] "Deep" [...] from the [...] and Still. Reznor told Spin magazine in 2005 that [...] "I was going to just drink myself or drug <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. [...] I got back to New Orleans after the Fragile tour, and I'd pretty much lost my soul." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{other sources}} do not concur that Kirwan {{was present at}} the commune in Munich. Fleetwood Mac roadie Dinky Dawson remembers that the only two to go to the party were Green and another roadie, Dennis Keane, and that Kirwan did not go. Dawson also states that when Keane {{returned}} to the band's hotel to explain that Green would not leave the commune, neither Kirwan nor Davis travelled to the commune to fetch Green, leaving that job to Keane, Dawson and Mick Fleetwood. Keane himself concurs with Dawson, except that he telephoned Davis from the commune and did not physically return to the hotel to fetch help, and that Davis accompanied Dawson and Fleetwood to fetch Green. Green also commented, [...] "To my knowledge only Dennis and <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the English lot went there." [...] Jeremy Spencer has also stated that he {{was present at the}} commune, and has implied that he arrived later with Fleetwood. Neither Keane, Dawson, Green nor Spencer mention Kirwan being present at the commune.|$|E

2500|$|My {{studio is}} crammed with equipment, but I ended up feeling I was being {{overcome}} by it all—it {{was just too}} much. I {{used to go to}} bed every night thinking 'Tomorrow, I'm going to write the tune. Tomorrow {{is going to be the}} day', but nothing ever happened. Eventually Neil McLellan pointed out that we'd been in the studio for four months without having anything to show for it. [...] Nat [...] was doing her own record so we weren't spending a lot of time together , but [...] there were always dogs to stroke and videos to watch and gardens to walk 'round, so I didn't ever feel like I was at work—I was too laid-back. [...] Neil [...] said we had to get out, get back to London. I knew I physically couldn't sit in my room any more, and for the first time in my life I listened to someone else and realised I actually needed help. It wasn't [...] that I needed help with the writing, just that I needed help finding the right headspace to get into the right frame of mind. I wanted to write a good album— one I was happy with—but to do that I knew I'd have to jerk <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> [...] situation I was in and start again.|$|E
2500|$|Derulo {{commented on}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest that [...] "This album {{has a lot}} of dimensions, 'The Other Side' and 'Marry Me' was one side. But when I was making this album, I wasn’t {{thinking}} about making hit songs... it was just about getting <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the darkness. It came from an honest place, I feel like it’s me" [...] Much of the new material incorporates hip hop and R styles unlike previously seen in Derulo's earlier albums. Four new songs were recorded for Talk Dirty: [...] "Wiggle" [...] (with Snoop Dogg), [...] "Zipper", [...] "Bubblegum" [...] (with Tyga) and [...] "Kama Sutra" [...] (with Kid Ink). The newly recorded material for the reissue follow the [...] "provocative nature and upbeat sound of the aforementioned" [...] title track Talk Dirty. [...] "Wiggle" [...] is an [...] "upbeat club-ready" [...] hip-hop infused R song that's all about a woman's [...] "big fat butt". Compared to the [...] "matching the slinky nature" [...] of the album's title track, the song features guest vocals from Snoop Dogg. Ricky Reed from Wallpaper. produced [...] "Wiggle", while also handling the song's music and programming with assistance from [...] Axident, Joe London and John Ryan. The song was recorded by Alex Granelli at Serenity West Recording in Los Angeles, Tha Compound in Los Angeles and at Start From Infinity [...] "Joshua Tree Sessions". It was mixed by Manny Marroquin with additional engineering provided by Ricky Reed, Axident, John Ryan, Joe Spargur and Alex Granelli. It was mastered by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound in New York City. Speaking to NewNowNext, Derulo described it as [...] "a song that you can’t help but move to. If the person next to you is not moving, don’t trust that person—that is not a good person".|$|E
2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second level}} of {{existence}} is the ethical. This is where an individual {{begins to take}} on a true direction in life, becoming aware of and personally responsible for good and evil and forming a commitment to oneself and others. One's actions at this level of existence have a consistency and coherence that they lacked in the previous sphere of existence. For many readers of Kierkegaard, the ethical is central. It calls each individual to take account of their lives and to scrutinize their actions in terms of absolute responsibility, which is what Kierkegaard calls repentance. If we compare Kierkegaard's idea of ethics with Vedic system of four aims of life, this Ethical system probably correlates most with Dharma - following this or that religion,set of rules, laws etc. (Hindus would call any religion as [...] "dharma", though dharma is also a law). [...] "He repents himself back into himself, back into the family, back into the race, until he finds himself in God. Only on this condition can he choose himself. And this is the only condition he wants, for only in this way can he choose himself absolutely." .... “I repent <b>myself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the whole existence. Repentance specifically expresses that evil essentially belongs to me {{and at the same time}} expresses that it does not essentially belong to me. If the evil in me did not essentially belong to me, I could not choose it; but if there were something in me that I could not choose absolutely, then I would not be choosing myself absolutely at all, then I myself would not be the absolute but only a product." .... "It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam." ... "The Either/Or I erected between living esthetically and living ethically is not an unqualified dilemma, because it actually is a matter of only one choice. Through this choice, I actually choose between good and evil, but I choose the good, I choose eo ipso the choice between good and evil. The original choice is forever present in every succeeding choice." [...] Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216-217, 224, 237-238, 219 ...|$|E
