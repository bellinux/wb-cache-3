5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E

5|$|The mass {{distribution}} of the Neptunian moons is the most lopsided of the satellite systems of the giant planets in the Solar System. One moon, Triton, <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> {{nearly all of the}} mass of the system, with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent. This is similar to the moon system of Saturn, where Titan <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> more than 95% of the total mass. This may be because Triton was captured well after the formation of Neptune's original satellite system, much of which would have been destroyed in the process of capture.|$|E

5|$|Thrips are hemimetabolous, metamorphosing {{gradually}} to the adult form. The first two instars, called larvae or nymphs, are like small wingless adults (often confused with springtails) without genitalia; these feed on plant tissue. In the Terebrantia, {{the third and}} fourth instars, and in the Tubulifera also a fifth instar, are non-feeding resting stages similar to pupae: in these stages, the body's organs are reshaped, and wing-buds and genitalia are formed. The adult stage can be reached in around 8–15 days; adults can live for around 45 days. Adults have both winged and wingless forms; in the grass thrips Anaphothrips obscurus, for example, the winged form <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> 90% of the population in spring (in temperate zones), while the wingless form <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> 98% of the population late in the summer.

5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian orogeny. This {{happened}} long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> the park today.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} that 55 Cancri e is a solid planet made of carbon-rich material rather than the oxygen-rich material that <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> the terrestrial planets in our solar system. In this case, roughly {{a third of the}} planet's mass would be carbon, much of which may be in the form of diamond {{as a result of the}} temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior.

Others had turned to arable farming, turf growing or horse livery instead of salad and vegetable crops. Chat Moss also contains the largest block of semi-natural woodland in Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor that <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer. Like serous {{cell carcinoma}}, {{it is usually}} aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it {{is characterized by the}} features common to all clear cells: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H stained and visible, distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{extensive}} clearing of the Wheatbelt in the 1930s, B.cuneata {{must have had}} a highly fragmented distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> only 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now been cleared of native vegetation, with the remaining 7% occurring in remnants of various sizes. Thus land clearing must have further fragmented an already fragmented population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.|$|E
5|$|Extremely high-purity (99.9999+%) gallium is commercially {{available}} {{to serve the}} semiconductor industry. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium nitride (GaN) used in electronic components represented about 98% of the gallium consumption in the United States in 2007. About 66% of semiconductor gallium {{is used in the}} U.S. in integrated circuits (mostly gallium arsenide), such as the manufacture of ultra-high speed logic chips and MESFETs for low-noise microwave preamplifiers in cell phones.

5|$|Foraging {{is mainly}} on the ground, and the bird's diet {{consists}} mainly of seeds. Oily seeds, {{such as those of}} brassicas, are ignored in favour of more starchy items. Typical food plants include common nettle, docks, common knotgrass, fat hen, common chickweed and yarrow. Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, and grain <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> {{a significant part of the}} food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks which can occasionally number hundreds of birds, and often contain other buntings and finches.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{water is}} a form of water that {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> most of the hydrogen in ordinary water. Deuterium was discovered by Harold Urey in 1931 and he was later able to concentrate it in water. His mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in 1933.|$|E

5|$|Most {{living things}} that are {{visible to the naked}} eye in their adult form are eukaryotes, {{including}} humans. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms.
