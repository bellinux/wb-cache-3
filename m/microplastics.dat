Common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and <b>microplastics</b> floating in the world's oceans. Recent examples of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of Minamata disease, in Japan (1932–1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil, and high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E

In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems.

5|$|Manta {{rays are}} subject to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of <b>microplastics.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{dynamics of}} <b>microplastic</b> (3 ̆c 5 mm) are well documented in marine ecosystems, but the sources, abundance, and ecological role of <b>microplastic</b> in rivers are unknown {{and likely to}} be substantial. <b>Microplastic</b> fibers (e. g., synthetic fabrics) and pellets (e. g., abrasives in personal care products) are abundant in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and {{can serve as a}} point source of <b>microplastic</b> in rivers. The buoyancy, hydrophobic surface, and long transport distance of <b>microplastic</b> make it a novel substrate for the selection and dispersal of unique microbial assemblages. We measured <b>microplastic</b> concentration and bacterial assemblage composition on <b>microplastic</b> and natural surfaces upstream and downstream of WWTP effluent sites at nine rivers in Illinois, United States. <b>Microplastic</b> concentration was higher downstream of WWTP effluent outfall sites in all but two rivers. Pellets, fibers, and fragments were the dominant <b>microplastic</b> types, and polymers were identified as polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene. Mean <b>microplastic</b> flux was 1, 338, 757 pieces per day, although the flux was highly variable among nine sites (min = 15, 520 per day, max = 4, 721, 709 per day). High-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes showed bacterial assemblage composition was significantly different among <b>microplastic,</b> seston, and water column substrates. <b>Microplastic</b> bacterial assemblages had lower taxon richness, diversity, and evenness than those on other substrates, and <b>microplastic</b> selected for taxa that may degrade plastic polymers (e. g., Pseudomonas) and those representing common human intestinal pathogens (e. g., Arcobacter).

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years <b>microplastic</b> {{pollution}} has been recorded in all major marine habitats, and is now considered to be of high environmental concern. Correspondingly, the number of reports of <b>microplastic</b> ingestion by marine species is increasing. Despite this, there are still relatively few studies which address the uptake and retention of <b>microplastic</b> in wild populations. Langoustine, Nephrops norvegicus, sampled from the Clyde Sea Area, have previously been seen to contain large aggregations of <b>microplastic</b> fibres. The large proportion of contaminated individuals and size of the <b>microplastic</b> aggregations observed suggests that Nephrops are at high risk of <b>microplastic</b> ingestion. In this study the levels of ingested <b>microplastic</b> in populations of N. norvegicus from the Clyde Sea Area, North Minch and North Sea are examined. Animals in the near-shore, Clyde Sea population showed both a higher percentage of <b>microplastic</b> containing individuals and much greater weights of <b>microplastic</b> retained in the gut. N. norvegicus revealed that {{only a small percentage of}} individuals from the North Sea and Minch contained <b>microplastic,</b> predominantly single strands. An expanded sample from the Clyde Sea Area was examined to identify the factors influencing <b>microplastic</b> retention. This revealed that males, larger individuals, and animals that had recently moulted contained lower levels of <b>microplastic.</b> The presence of identified food items in the gut was not seen to correlate with <b>microplastic</b> loads. Observations of <b>microplastic</b> in the shed stomach lining of recently moulted individuals and the lack of aggregations in wild-caught individuals suggests that ecdysis is the primary route of <b>microplastic</b> loss by N. norvegicus.

25|$|A {{growing concern}} {{regarding}} plastic {{pollution in the}} marine ecosystem {{is the use of}} <b>microplastics.</b> <b>Microplastics</b> are little beads of plastic less than 5 millimeters wide, and they are commonly found in hand soaps, face cleansers, and other exfoliators. When these products are used, the <b>microplastics</b> go through the water filtration system and into the ocean, but because of their small size they are likely to escape capture by the preliminary treatment screens on wastewater plants. These beads are harmful to the organisms in the ocean, especially filter feeders, because they can easily ingest the plastic and become sick. The <b>microplastics</b> are such a concern because it is difficult to clean them up due to their size, so humans can try to avoid using these harmful plastics by purchasing products that use natural, environmentally safe exfoliates.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{environmental}} {{threats from}} plastic {{have been suggested}} {{in the light of}} the increasing presence of <b>microplastics</b> in the marine food chain along with many highly toxic chemical pollutants that accumulate in plastics. They also accumulate in larger fragmented pieces of plastic called nurdles. In the 1960s the latter were observed in the guts of seabirds, and since then have been found in increasing concentration. In 2009, it was estimated that 10% of modern waste was plastics, although estimates vary according to region. Meanwhile, 50-80% of debris in marine areas is plastic.|$|E
25|$|Degradation during service life, {{or after}} {{careless}} disposal, is a chemical change that drastically reduces the {{average molecular weight}} of the polyvinyl chloride polymer. Since the mechanical integrity of a plastic depends on its high average molecular weight, wear and tear inevitably weakens the material. Weathering degradation of plastics results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that continue on in the environment. Also known as <b>microplastics,</b> these particles act like sponges and soak up Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) around them.

40|$|Plastic {{pollution}} in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), dubbed the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch," {{has been the subject}} of substantial public concern. However, there is relatively limited scientific understanding of how <b>microplastic</b> affects pelagic ecosystems. The motivation for this dissertation is to provide scientific information on the extent and impact of <b>microplastic</b> in the NPSG. The dissertation is organized around two central questions : 1) What are the abundance, distribution, and characteristics of plastic microdebris in the NPSG? 2) What is the impact of this <b>microplastic</b> on the neustonic zooplankton and plastic-associated rafting communities?. I documented widespread, though spatially and temporally variable, plastic {{pollution in}} the NPSG and adjacent water masses. The numerical majority of objects are small particles, but the majority of debris surface area is found in large objects. While plastic was highly variable on the submesoscale, an analysis of all available data showed that overall NPSG <b>microplastic</b> concentrations increased by two orders of magnitude between 1972 - 1988 and 1999 - 2010. I performed a laboratory weathering experiment on plastic pre-production pellets that suggested that changes in <b>microplastic</b> composition over the eastern North Pacific may be explained by differential rates of weathering between plastic types, and that carbonyl formation may be a proxy for the length of time a plastic object has weathered in the ocean. <b>Microplastic</b> interacted with marine life through its direct ingestion and by providing a hard substrate for oviposition and settlement. Thirty-three percent of lepadid barnacles collected in 2009 contained <b>microplastic</b> in their gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, neustonic zooplankton did not show significant ingestion of plastic microspheres during a series of at-sea incubation experiments. Oviposition in the oceanic insect Halobates sericeus was positively correlated with <b>microplastic</b> abundance. Most plastic- associated macroinvertebrates were known members of the rafting assemblage, but several potentially invasive taxa were also associated with debris. The diversity of taxa in the rafting assemblage increased with debris surface area, as predicted by the concept of island biogeography. This dissertation demonstrated that <b>microplastic</b> pollution is pervasive at the surface of the NPSG, and that ecological impacts include direct ingestion, release from substrate limitation, and enhanced dispersal. The introduction of <b>microplastic</b> to the NPSG may therefore represent a widespread alteration of the pelagic ecosyste...|$|R
40|$|<b>Microplastic</b> is {{considered}} a potential threat to marine life as it is ingested by {{a wide variety of}} species. Most studies on <b>microplastic</b> ingestion are short-term investigations and little is currently known about how this potential threat has developed over the last decades where global plastic production has increased exponentially. Here we present the first long-term study on <b>microplastic</b> in the marine environment, covering three decades from 1987 to 2015, based on a unique sample set originally collected and conserved for food web studies. We investigated the <b>microplastic</b> concentration in plankton samples and in digestive tracts of two economically and ecologically important planktivorous forage fish species, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and European sprat (Sprattus sprattus), in the Baltic Sea, an ecosystem which is under high anthropogenic pressure and has undergone considerable changes over the past decades. Surprisingly, neither the concentration of <b>microplastic</b> in the plankton samples nor in the digestive tracts changed significantly over the investigated time period. Average <b>microplastic</b> concentration in the plankton samples was 0. 21 ± 0. 15 particlesm- 3. Of 814 fish examined, 20 % contained plastic particles, of which 95 % were characterized as <b>microplastic</b> (< 5 mm) and of these 93 % were fibres. There {{were no significant differences in}} the plastic content between species, locations, or time of day the fish were caught. However, fish size and <b>microplastic</b> in the digestive tracts were positively correlated, and the fish contained more plastic during summer than during spring, which may be explained by increased food uptake with size and seasonal differences in feeding activity. This study highlights that even though <b>microplastic</b> has been present in the Baltic environment and the digestive tracts of fishes for decades, the levels have not changed in this period. This underscores the need for greater understanding of how plastic is cycled through marine ecosystems. The stability of plastic concentration and contamination over time observed here indicates that the type and level of <b>microplastic</b> pollution may be more closely correlated to specific human activities in a region than to global plastic production and utilization as such...|$|R

An increased amount of <b>microplastic</b> from both primary and secondary sources disrupts the marine environment. Due to its amorphous structure, plastic is able to release toxic monomers and additives. Furthermore, plastic has the ability to attract diffent environmental toxins especially persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that through the “Trojan horse” effect can accumulate in the organisms that consume it. By collecting information from scientific reports we attempt to clarify that <b>microplastic,</b> due to its size and presence, presents physical problems for many marine organisms. Not only does <b>microplastic</b> create problems by its presence, by decreasing mobility and reproduction, but it also contributes to the spreading and bioavailability of other environmental toxins, especially POPs. <b>Microplastic</b> can change the viability of many marine organisms and an increase of plastic waste in marine environment could potentially harm many more marine organisms...|$|R

Chronic exposure to <b>microplastic</b> is rarely lethal, but can adversely affect individual animals, reducing feeding and depleting energy stores, with knock-on effects for fecundity and growth. We explore the extent to which ecological processes could be impacted, including altered behaviours, bioturbation and impacts on carbon flux to the deep ocean.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that ingestion of <b>microplastic</b> increases exposure of aquatic organisms to hydrophobic contaminants. To date, most laboratory studies investigated chemical transfer from ingested <b>microplastic</b> without taking other exposure pathways into account. Therefore we studied {{the effect of}} polyethylene (PE) <b>microplastic</b> in sediment on PCB uptake by Arenicola marina as a model species, quantifying uptake fluxes from all natural exposure pathways. PCB concentrations in sediment, biota lipids (Clip) and porewater measured with passive samplers were used to derive lipid-normalized bioaccumulation metrics Clip, Biota sediment accumulation factor (BSAF), Bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and the Biota plastic accumulation factor (BPAF). Small effects of PE addition were detected suggesting slightly increased or decreased bioaccumulation. However, the differences decreased in magnitude dependent on the metric used to assess bioaccumulation, in the order: Clip>BSAF>BPAF>BAF, and were non-significant for BAF. The fact that BAF, i. e. normalization of Clip on porewater concentration, largely removed all effects of PE, shows that PE did not act as a measurable vector of PCBs. Biodynamic model analysis confirmed that PE ingestion contributed marginally to bioaccumulation.

40|$|SummaryInadequate products, waste management, {{and policy}} are {{struggling}} to prevent plastic waste from infiltrating ecosystems [1, 2]. Disintegration into smaller pieces means that the abundance of micrometer-sized plastic (<b>microplastic)</b> in habitats has increased [3] and outnumbers larger debris [2, 4]. When ingested by animals, plastic provides a feasible pathway to transfer attached pollutants and additive chemicals into their tissues [5 – 15]. Despite positive correlations between concentrations of ingested plastic and pollutants in tissues of animals, few, if any, controlled experiments have examined whether ingested plastic transfers pollutants and additives to animals. We exposed lugworms (Arenicola marina) to sand with 5 % <b>microplastic</b> that was presorbed with pollutants (nonylphenol and phenanthrene) and additive chemicals (Triclosan and PBDE- 47). <b>Microplastic</b> transferred pollutants and additive chemicals into gut tissues of lugworms, causing some biological effects, although clean sand transferred larger concentrations of pollutants into their tissues.

The attachment efficiency ranged from 0. 004 to 0. 2 for 70 nm and 1050 nm polystyrene particles aggregating with kaolin or bentonite clays in natural freshwater.
