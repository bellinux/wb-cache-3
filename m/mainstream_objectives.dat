40|$|Web 3. 0, the web {{of social}} and {{semantic}} cooperation, calls for a methodological multidisciplinary architecture {{in order to reach}} its <b>mainstream</b> <b>objectives.</b> With the lack of such an architecture and the reliance of existing efforts on lightweight semantics and RDF graphs, this thesis proposes "Web 3. OWL", an ontology-driven framework towards a Web 3. 0 knowledge architecture. Meanwhile, the online social parenting data and their corresponding websites users known as "mommy bloggers" undergo one of the fastest online demographics growth, and the available literature reflects the very little attention this growth has so far been given and the various deficiencies the parenting domain suffers from; these deficiencies all fall under the umbrella of the scarcity of parenting sociomedical analysis and decision-support systems. The Web 3. OWL framework puts forward an approach that relies on the Meta-Object Facility for Semantics standard (SMOF) for the management of its modeled OWL (Web Ontology Language) expressive domain ontologies on the one hand, and the coordination of its various underlined Web 3. 0 prerequisite disciplines on the other. Setting off with a holistic portrayal of Web 3. OWL’s components and workflow, the thesis progresses into a more analytic exploration of its main paradigms. Out of its different ontology-aware paradigms are notably highlighted both its methodology for expressiveness handling through modularization and projection techniques and algorithms, and its facilities for tagging inference, suggestion and processing. Web 3. OWL, albeit generic by conception, proves its efficiency in solving the deficiencies and meeting the requirements of the sociomedical domain of interest. Its conceived ontology for parenting analysis and surveillance, baptised "ParOnt", strongly contributes to the backbone metamodel and the various constituents of this ontology-driven framework. Accordingly, as the workflow revolves around Description Logics principles, OWL 2 profiles along with standard and beyond-standard reasoning techniques, conducted experiments and competency questions are illustrated, thus establishing the required Web 3. 0 outcomes. The empirical results of the diverse preliminary decision-support and recommendation services targeting parenting public awareness, orientation and education do ascertain, in conclusion, the value and potentials of the proposed conceptual framework...|$|E
40|$|This article {{assesses the}} utility of impact {{assessments}} (IA) as an effective tool for mainstreaming. Specifically, it analyses whether the European Union’s (EU) system of integrated impact assessments (IIA) contributes to the realisation of six <b>mainstreaming</b> <b>objectives</b> defined in the EU Treaties. The article first studies whether the legal framework for the EU’s system of IIAs makes it a viable tool for mainstreaming. It then proceeds with an empirical analysis of 35 impact assessments to assess {{the extent to which}} <b>mainstreaming</b> <b>objectives</b> are taken into account in practice. The analysis shows that all the six <b>mainstreaming</b> <b>objectives</b> have a place within the IIA system, but the system does not ensure systematic consideration of them. There is considerable variation across the mainstreaming agendas as well as across Directorates-General. The article concludes the IIA system is no panacea for mainstreaming, while proposing changes to the institutional framework to improve its mainstreaming potential...|$|R

Using the phenomenological sociology of Thomas Luckmann, it seeks to expand on the ideas of Nelson and identify their sociological utility.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Latin America's market-oriented reforms, {{together}} with increased monetary and fiscal discipline, {{were successful in}} bringing down inflation, inducing export growth and diversification, and attracting foreign direct investment. Nonetheless, economic growth was frustratingly slow. Pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies generated, in turn, strong business cycles {{in the face of}} unstable access to international capital markets. Higher productivity in leading firms and sectors failed to spread throughout the economy and led to increasing productive sector dualism. Furthermore, despite the democratic dividend reflected in increased social spending and coverage of social services, weak economic performance and additional distributive tensions led to disappointing results in terms of employment generation and poverty reduction. Overcoming these frustrating outcomes would require counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies, open-economy productive development strategies and <b>mainstreaming</b> social <b>objectives</b> into economic policies. ...|$|R

The history of approaches to security in the development field sheds light on how this has come about, i. e. on how the notion of ‛human security‛ has evolved into ‛security sector reform‛ (SSR). While development stakeholders first devised the human-security approach as a means of <b>mainstreaming</b> their <b>objectives</b> into the security sector, it also had the effect of opening their own field up to the semantics of security; and today, the objectives of the narrower approach of SSR, together with the new norms it has brought into play, appear torn between support for Western security policies and, on the other hand, the strengthening of democratic control over the sector and its capacity to ensure a secure national environment in the non-Western States where they are introduced. This is confirmed in a study of SSR in the Lebanon, which exposes the conflicting norms inherent to a policy of reinforcing ‛weak states‛ through outside intervention in national policy-making...|$|R

Although inclusive design {{is not a new}} genre, given that similar ideas already existed in the 1970 s, the context today is different from that of thirty years ago. The new technology, the emerging ‘grey’ market and the growing disability movement leading to the integration of disabled people into the mainstream society, etc., have formed a new paradigm of designing for inclusion. Designers seldom deny the importance and benefits of inclusive design. However, they are lacking appropriate skills for practising inclusive design.

40|$|Adaptation to a {{changing}} climate is unavoidable. <b>Mainstreaming</b> climate adaptation <b>objectives</b> into existing policies, {{as opposed to}} developing dedicated adaptation policy, is widely advocated for public action. However, knowledge on what makes mainstreaming effective is scarce and fragmented. Against this background, this paper takes stock of peer-reviewed empirical analyses of climate adaptation mainstreaming, {{in order to assess}} current achievements and identify the critical factors that render mainstreaming effective. The results show that although in most cases adaptation policy outputs are identified, only in a minority of cases this translates into policy outcomes. This “implementation gap” is most strongly seen in developing countries. However, {{when it comes to the}} effectiveness of outcomes, we found no difference across countries. We conclude that more explicit definitions and unified frameworks for adaptation mainstreaming research are required to allow for future research syntheses and well-informed policy recommendations...|$|R

The results point out that, between the two Overqualification dimensions – Mismatch (having more skills than necessary for a function) and No Growth (restrictions to the development and use of skills), it is the No Growth factor that more significantly influences Satisfaction, Intention to leave an organization and Cooperative behavior.

40|$|Knowledge {{management}} as a conscious discipline {{would appear to}} be somewhere between five and fifteen years old. It evolved from the thinking of academics and pioneers such as Peter Drucker in the 1970 s, Karl-Erik Sveiby in the late 1980 s, and Nonaka and Takeuchi in the 1990 s. During that time, economic, social and technological changes were transforming the way that companies worked. Globalisation emerged and brought new opportunities and increased competition. Companies responded by downsizing, merging, acquiring, reengineering and outsourcing. Many streamlined their workforce and boosted their productivity and their profits by using advances in computer and network technology. However their successes in doing so came with a price. Many lost company knowledge as they grew smaller. And many lost company knowledge as they grew bigger - they no longer knew what they knew. By the early 1990 s a growing body of academics and consultants were talking about knowledge {{management as}} the new business practice, and it began to appear in more and more business journals and on conference agendas. By the mid- 1990 s, it became widely acknowledged that the competitive advantage of some of the world's leading companies was being carved out from those companies' knowledge assets such as competencies, customer relationships and innovations. (Neef, 1999; Chekland and Holwell 1998; Snowdeen 2000; Bhatt 2001; Raub e Ruling 2001).

This article presents findings from an independent evaluation of the Frontline pilot stage which compared the pre-training characteristics of Frontline participants with those of social work training enrolments in England for 2013 – 14, derived from Higher Education Statistics Agency data, the Frontline participant database and a questionnaire administered to postgraduate students in five ‘high-tariff’ universities.

40|$|A {{large scale}} {{programme}} that provides grants along with background support services was implemented by BRAC {{in an effort}} to alleviate extreme poverty using a grant-based approach known as Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction (CFPR). At the beginning of the programme, the participants are provided with income generating assets and training on various issues over a course of two years so that they may graduate into <b>mainstream</b> poverty. The <b>objective</b> {{of this study is to}} see the impacts of the CFPR programme two years after the intervention. We have analysed a two round panel dataset from 2007 (baseline) and 2009 (end-line) using the propensity score matching methodology. Results show that not only did the level of income and savings go up amongst the participants, employments dynamics changed from dead end jobs such as working as housemaids and day labourers to more entrepreneurial activities. Furthermore, results also show that the level of food security had also improved. The participants were able to expand their asset base beyond what was provided by the programme initially. Though public expenditures for the poor are not insignificant, often suffer from substantial leakages either through corruption or mismanagement, rendering them toothless. This paper finds that the CFPR approach as implemented by BRAC is clearly an effective strategy to fight ultra poverty in a sustainable manner which can be replicable in other developing country. ...|$|R
40|$|Comparative policy {{analysis}} {{plays an important}} role in the EU: European social policy, as it developed from the 2000 s, is intrinsically interwoven with comparative social {{policy analysis}}, notably in the context of the Open Method of Coordination (OMC). A review of the role of comparative social policy analysis in the OMC highlights a number of long-standing challenges, which are discussed in the first section of the paper. Do EU member states commit themselves to a real "burden sharing" with regard to the agreed objectives? How can we effectively <b>mainstream</b> social policy <b>objectives</b> into the EU’s economic and budgetary governance? How can we assess the comparative efficiency of EU welfare states? These challenges have a political, a scientific and a technical (data-related) nature. They underscore the necessity of in-depth, shared and validated comparative social policy analysis of member states’ policies. The second section of the paper explains that we may be entering a new era, given the reform agenda for the Economic and Monetary Union set out by the so-called Five Presidents’ Report; these reforms, if implemented, may lead to important spill-over effects in the domain of European social policy, with new demands for comparative social policy analysis. The third section zooms in on the related challenges for the statistical capacity of the EU and the need to invest in the development of reliable and comparable data...|$|R
40|$|Environmental policy {{provides}} one of {{the oldest}} and most puzzling cases of policy coordination in the European Union (EU). The integration (or <b>mainstreaming)</b> of environmental <b>objectives</b> into non environmental policies such as agriculture, energy and transport, has a long history and commands high level political support among heads of state. However, the implementation of environmental policy integration (EPI) has not yet matched these ambitions. One of the main problems is that EPI has been seen as a macro problem of drafting sweeping statements and writing long term integration strategies. The need to embed EPI in micro policy processes i. e. the bottom-up formulation and implementation of EU policies in administrative settings has, however, mostly been ignored. This paper analyses the administrative coordination mechanisms at the micro-level within the Commission, the Netherlands and UK governments to gauge how fit they are to deliver on the EUs broader EPI objective. Using different theories of coordination, this paper concludes that all three have relied too heavily on setting long term coordination targets, without putting in place the administrative coordination (i. e. delivery) mechanisms. This paper concludes that the EUs macro approach (dubbed the Cardiff process) cannot perform effectively without the support of implementing actions at the micro level. At the same time, activities at the micro level need the political commitment expressed at the macro level. Moreover, environmental information needs to be transferred within and between the actors in a much more active manner so that environmental impacts can be designed out of policy proposals early on in the policy process. The conclusion of this study is that, in the face of greater interdependence between policies and the concomitant demand for greater policy coordination, passive coordination has had its day. But for many different reasons, the actors have not yet come to grips with what is required to implement active coordination...|$|R

The Current Status section provides the basic terminology definition of mental disability. The Quantitative Evaluation section captures the division and characteristics of individual degrees of mental disability. These are followed by a description of individual signs and causes of mental disability. To achieve a theoretical balance of the thesis, abilities of people with mental disabilities are assessed {{also in terms of}} a qualitative personality structure. The thesis describes specific characteristics of mental functions: perception, memory, thinking, attention, emotivity, and volitive traits. The thesis mentions documents affecting the rights of people with mental disabilities and it emphasises the right to education and employment. Opportunities for upbringing and education of persons with mental disabilities are monitored by their age and within the Czech educational system. Job opportunities for young people with mental disabilities are governed by the Employment Act and specific social programs also have their impacts; they are, for example, supported employment and transition programme, which provide support to people with mental disabilities in fulfilling their right to employment and integration into the <b>mainstream</b> society. The <b>objective</b> of the thesis is to describe the method of the transition programme and the definition of the supporting factors affecting the degree of inclusion in the occupational environment.
