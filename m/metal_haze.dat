40|$|Studies {{have yet}} to {{evaluate}} how bentonite properties may affect the protein profile, polyphenol content, metal concentration, and heat stability of a white wine at different pH values. Therefore, this work assessed the proteins, polyphenols, <b>metals,</b> and <b>haze</b> forming tendency when heating white wine samples before and after a fin- ing treatment with four activated sodium bentonites in a typical wine pH range (3. 00 to 3. 60). Soluble wine proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gel images were compared using the Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA). The wine <b>haze</b> forming tendency, <b>metals,</b> and polyphenols were measured using heat tests and International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) methods. Low molecular mass proteins were efficiently removed {{by all of the}} bentonites, regardless of the pH. High and medium molecular mass proteins {{were less likely to be}} removed and the efficiency, which depended on the pH, was variable. Reductions of vacuolar invertase (GIN 1) and VVTL 1 fractions of the thaumatin-like proteins were induced by bentonites with pH values less than 10. These bentonites were affected to a lesser extent by the negative effect of acidic pH. The reduction in haze forming tendency of the unfined Erbaluce wine was particularly notice- able in bentonite fined samples heated at 50 to 60 °C, 60 to 80 °C, and 70 to 80 °C at pH 3. 17, pH 3. 30, and pH 3. 60, respectively. The poor removal of glycoproteins (YGP 1 and Hmp 1) at higher pH values contributed to an increased thermal stability. The exchange of cationic species, notably sodium and potassium, between the bentonites and the wine was related more to the wine pH than to the clay type. Finally, the extent of polyphenol removal correlated with the amount of protein removed. When protein removal did not occur, the reduction of polyphenols was driven by the specific surface area and the surface charge density of the bentonite...|$|R
40|$|<b>Metal</b> soap {{efflorescent}} <b>hazes</b> and crusts {{are one of}} {{the most}} visually disturbing of all metal soap related alterations in paintings. The phenomenon presents particular challenges for conservators as the surface deposits that form are insoluble and intimately bound with the paint film. The superficial deposits accumulate following migration of metal carboxylates, a product formed within the paint film from reaction of free fatty acids with metal ions from pigments and/or driers. Upon deposition at the surface, the metal carboxylates undergo a process of remineralisation, the products of which are determined by the atmospheric conditions that the painting is exposed to. The material can appear optically similar to the whitish haze of organic efflorescence though manifestations also range from crystalline clusters to thick crusts, and in some cases the painting may consequently be rendered partially unreadable. This study aimed to investigate the removal of visually disturbing lead soap efflorescence with Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which sequesters the lead ions from the remineralised crust. Through a careful balance of variables such as pH, concentration and application, it is feasible to thin the superficial material significantly. By this means it is possible to saturate the surface of the paint film and render the previously disfiguring efflorescence transparent. Paintings previously treated with this method show no signs of recurrence and thus it appears to be a viable, long-term treatment option...|$|R
40|$|Biomass burning plumes {{containing}} aerosols from {{forest fires}} can be transported long distances, which can ultimately impact climate and air quality in regions {{far from the}} source. Interestingly, these fires can inject aerosols other than smoke into the atmosphere, which very few studies have evidenced. Here, we demonstrate a set of case studies of long-range transport of mineral dust aerosols in addition to smoke from numerous fires (including predominantly forest fires and a few grass/shrub fires) in the Pacific Northwest to Colorado, US. These aerosols were detected in Boulder, Colorado, along the Front Range using beta-ray attenuation and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and corroborated with satellite-borne lidar observations of smoke and dust. Further, we examined the transport pathways of these aerosols using air mass trajectory analysis and regional- and synoptic-scale meteorological dynamics. Three separate events with poor air quality and increased mass concentrations of metals from biomass burning (S and K) and minerals (Al, Si, Ca, Fe, and Ti) occurred due {{to the introduction of}} smoke and dust from regional- and synoptic-scale winds. Cleaner time periods with good air quality and lesser concentrations of biomass burning and mineral <b>metals</b> between the <b>haze</b> events were due to the advection of smoke and dust away from the region. Dust and smoke present in biomass burning haze can have diverse impacts on visibility, health, cloud formation, and surface radiation. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} how aerosol populations can be influenced by long-range-transported aerosols, particularly those emitted from large source contributors such as wildfires...|$|R
40|$|Clouds and hazes {{are found}} in every {{significant}} planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, from the sulfuric acid clouds of Venus and the water clouds of Earth and Mars, to the photochemical hazes that pervade the giant planets, ice giants, Titan, and even Pluto. Beyond the Solar System, transmission spectroscopy of exoplanets have found that many are also bound in clouds and hazes, though their higher temperatures give rise to clouds of salts, rocks, and <b>metals,</b> and <b>hazes</b> of soots and sulfurs. Understanding the behavior and role of clouds and hazes in planetary atmospheres is instrumental in understanding atmospheres as a whole, as they are strongly coupled to other atmospheric processes. For example, highly reflective clouds can reduce the effective temperature of a planet, while UV absorbing hazes can increase local atmospheric temperatures. Clouds and hazes also act as reservoirs for important trace species and can be crucial to atmospheric chemical cycles. In this Ph. D thesis, I use modeling and comparisons to observations to understand cloud and haze processes on multiple worlds within and beyond the Solar System. I use the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA) to simulate the sulfuric acid clouds of Venus {{in an attempt to}} find the cause of the spatial and temporal variability in the Venus upper haze, as observed by Venus Express. I show that the variability is likely caused by sustained updrafts lofting large cloud particles into the haze. I then modify CARMA to include fractal aggregate particles to investigate the properties of the photochemical haze on Pluto as observed by New Horizons, and find that the haze particles must be porous, and that they may act as nucleation cites for simple hydrocarbons. Finally, I add exotic condensates to CARMA to model clouds on exoplanets, where their existence has led to difficulties in finding the atmospheric compositions of these worlds. I show that not all species that can condense will, due to their material properties, and that the cloud optical depth is largely controlled by the rate of particle production via homogeneous nucleation. In addition, I investigate the effect a sulfur haze would have on the reflected light spectrum of giant exoplanets to prepare for upcoming direct imaging missions, and find that sulfur hazes significantly brighten these planets at long wavelengths, while darkening them at short wavelengths due to UV absorption. Finally, I retrieve the properties of water ice particles from Cassini observations of the plumes of Enceladus assuming that they are aggregates rather than spheres, and thereby unifying forward scattering observations with in situ measurements. </p...|$|R
