[...] "The very people whom they injure and {{inconvenience}} the <b>most,</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> whom they hamper and cramp and debar, don't seem to object to them, but believe in them and are afraid of them. In Samoa, I remember, certain fruits and fish and animals and so forth were tabooed to the chiefs, and nobody else ever dared to eat them. They thought it was wrong, and said, if they did, some nameless evil would at once overtake them. These nameless terrors, these bodiless superstitions, are always the deepest. People fight hardest to preserve their bogeys. They fancy some appalling unknown dissolution would at once result from reasonable action. I tried one day to persuade a poor devil of a fellow in Samoa who'd caught one of these fish, and who was terribly hungry, that no harm would come to him if he cooked it and ate it. But he was too slavishly frightened to follow my advice; {{he said it was}} taboo to the god-descended chiefs: if a mortal man tasted it, he would die on the spot: so nothing on earth would induce him to try it. Though to be sure, even there, nobody ever went quite so far as to taboo the very soil of earth itself: everybody might till and hunt where he liked. It's only in Europe, where evolution goes furthest, that taboo has reached that last silly pitch of injustice and absurdity. Well, we're not afraid of the fetich, you and I, Mrs. Monteith. Jump up on the gate; I'll give you a hand over!" [...] And he held out one strong arm as he spoke to aid her.|$|E

40|$|Accelerated {{climate change}} and {{increasing}} variability is the single greatest threat to humanity. Despite more extreme weather events across the world {{there appears to be}} a lack of urgency in reaching an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This chapter reviews the evolution of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and argues that the governance of the convention is a mess and the reliance on market based measures are unlikely to produce the reduction in emissions that are needed if we are to avoid dangerous climate change. This chapter posits that the society is missing from the governance of climate change. The current debate is dominated by climate scientists as well as economists, but those that will be impacted the <b>most,</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> have little or no voice.

40|$|When 7. 8 -magnitude {{earthquake}} struck Nepal in 2015, many monuments, {{temples and}} houses turned into rubbles killing more than 8, 000 people and injuring above 21, 000. This unfortunate and tragic natural disaster brought international attention to Nepal. But {{in this time}} of despair and pain there was a sign of hope that should be acknowledged well, the spirit of community facing the disaster. This paper is about the indigenous community of Kathmandu on how they organized an important traditional festival just four months after the disaster when <b>most</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> were still living in the makeshifts, along with the smaller aftershock continuing almost everyday. In the country like Nepal with numerous intangible heritages, which is, still living is not taken seriously by the concerned authorities and mostly been neglected. It is the indigenous community who has been carrying out those heritages, as they are inseparable aspect of the social life. With this paper it tries look at the community involvement and intangible heritage of Kathmandu Valley, which is a part of my PhD research thesis.

40|$|The Sioux Hudson Literacy Council {{is making}} {{groundbreaking}} strides to reach adult Aboriginal learners who reside in remote, isolated communities of Northwestern Ontario, Canada. This literacy organization services learners {{within the community}} and surrounding area. The 35 communities, which have a total population of approximately 35, 000 people, are often only accessible by plane in the summer months and ice roads during the winter. The Aboriginal community members {{have not had the}} privilege of strong, structured educational backgrounds and have not had the opportunity to improve their existing literacy and employability skills. There are currently programs in these communities offered to high school and college students via video- and audio-conferencing. It appears however, that individuals who would benefit the <b>most,</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who need assistance to attain the literacy levels required to achieve success at the high school and college levels are those who have had few educational opportunities. Over the last three years, the Sioux Hudson Literacy Council has been offering solutions for the literacy learner at a distance. We have created a unique website with direct links to synchronous online classrooms and offers a solution to the growing number of Indigenous learners who have little or no education. (Website:www. siouxhudsonliteracy. com) Our journey continues and we have discovered many challenges and issues surrounding the obtaining and retaining of both online learners in Northwestern Ontario. This presentation will deliver some research findings, insights and experiences from our progressive work to reach Aboriginal distance learners in the remote, isolate communities of Ontario Canada 2 ̆ 7 s North...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the representation of}} interviewees according to apperance and time of apperance in the Swedish children’s news programme Lilla Aktuellt, 1994 and 2014 set out from an intersectional perspective. The thesis therefore examines whom of the interviewees that is over-and underrepresented in the programme, {{when it comes to}} the collaboration of the chosen categories: Sex, Age and Ethnicity. As researchers point out that a high frequency in appearance in media means domination and a conception of representing the norm in society this thesis therefore also does examine the superiority and inferiority that occures in the programme both years.   The result of this thesis show that there has been changes in the representation over time. All groups of children have been given a larger amout of space while the representation of all groups of people that don’t follow the ethnical norm, basically hasn’t changed at all. Amongst the different sexes there has been a fairly more even representation over time. The overall results show that there has been a slightly more balanced distribution over time between all of the groups appearances and time of appearances. Therefore not said that there isn’t room for improvement, on the contrary there are still things to be done for a greater representation according to multiplicity and equality in Lilla Aktuellt.   Of all the groups of interviewees in Lilla Aktuellt the people that are “male and not children who follow the ethnical norm” have decreased their visability most over time and are therefore the ones that have decreased their power <b>most.</b> <b>The</b> <b>people</b> that are “female children who don’t follow the ethnical norm” are the ones that have increased their visability most over time thus this means that they are the ones that have increased their power most over time...|$|E
