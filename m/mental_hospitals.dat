5|$|The Brezhnev-era Soviet regime became {{notorious for}} using {{psychiatry}} {{as a means}} of silencing dissent.

These improvements began under Governor Chandler, and while Johnson stated that the <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> and prisons were in their best condition in forty years {{by the end of}} his term, he was disappointed that he was not able to do more. In light of the financial obligations brought about by World War II, he had to curb state construction.|$|E
5|$|Advocacy {{groups for}} {{individuals}} with Down syndrome began to be formed after the Second World War. These were organizations advocating {{for the inclusion of}} people with Down syndrome into the general school system and for a greater understanding of the condition among the general population, as well as groups providing support for families with children living with Down syndrome. Before this individuals with Down syndrome were often placed in <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> or asylums. Organizations included the Royal Society for Handicapped Children and Adults founded in the UK in 1946 by Judy Fryd, Kobato Kai founded in Japan in 1964, the National Down Syndrome Congress founded in the United States in 1973 by Kathryn McGee and others, and the National Down Syndrome Society founded in 1979 in the United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Holocaust during World War II, German Nazis used gas vans at Chelmno {{extermination}} camp and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several death camps such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in action T4, the euthanasia programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and disabled people before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by IG Farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals,</b> such as Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers {{of people in the}} gas vans and the special gas chambers used in the death camps such as Treblinka. Exhaust fumes from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of {{psychiatry}} for political purposes {{was reported to have}} been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease. In many countries political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet times, <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> were {{frequently}} created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, {{a human rights}} activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who {{have been living in}} a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} was highly {{supportive of the}} war efforts. The political left supported the war (unlike World War I, which Socialists opposed.) The churches showed much less pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God, based in Anderson, had a strong pacifist element, reaching a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked. Anti-Communist sentiment has since kept strong pacifism from developing in the Church of God. Likewise the Quakers, with a strong base near Richmond, generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors. The Mennonites and Brethren continued their pacifism, but {{the federal government was}} much less hostile than before. The churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation. Goshen College set up a training program for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals.</b>|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{social forces}} {{led to a}} move for deinstitutionalization; {{researchers}} generally give credit to six main factors: criticisms of public <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals,</b> incorporation of mind-altering drugs in treatment, support from President Kennedy for federal policy changes, shifts to community-based care, changes in public perception, and individual states' desires to reduce costs from <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals.</b>|$|E
25|$|The anti-psychiatry {{movement}} {{coming to}} the fore in the 1960s has opposed many of the practices, conditions, or existence of <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals.</b> The psychiatric consumer/survivor movement has often objected to or campaigned against conditions in <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> or their use, voluntarily or involuntarily. The mental patient liberation movement emphatically opposes involuntary treatment but generally {{does not have any}} issue with any psychiatric treatments that are consensual, provided that both parties are free to withdraw consent at any time.|$|E

25|$|As debates {{regarding}} the deteriorating role of American asylums and psychiatry amplified {{around the turn}} of the century, new reformation arose. With the founding of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, acute treatment centers like psychopathic hospitals, psychiatric dispensaries and child guidance clinics were created. Beginning with the State Care Act in New York, states began assuming full financial control for the mentally ill, in an effort to compensate for the deprivations of asylums. Between 1903 and 1950, the number of patients in state <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> went from 150,000 to 512,000. Morrissey recognizes that despite persistent problem of chronic mental illness, these state <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> were able to provide a minimal level of care.|$|E

25|$|ECT {{soon became}} {{more popular than}} cardiazol {{convulsion}} therapy in <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> in the UK. It was quickly identified as being especially useful {{in the treatment of}} affective psychosis. The therapeutic value of ECT in schizophrenia was recognised as limited, but some psychiatrists saw it as useful to control the behaviour of institutionalised patients who had been diagnosed as schizophrenic. Some psychiatrists thought that ECT should be restricted to the treatment of depression; others used it in the treatment {{of a wide variety of}} disorders, for example, schizophrenia, epilepsy, neurosis, and hysteria. It was also used on people who had suffered war trauma. By the mid 1950s there was a 20 fold difference in the rate of ECT use in <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> in the UK, and a similar difference in its rate of use in teaching hospitals. In the 1940s and 1950s ECT machines used sine-wave current and patients were given a shock lasting a fraction of a second.|$|E
