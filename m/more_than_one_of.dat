5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic Stones are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can {{be picked up by}} the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponent players by bumping into another player. The player can then activate the Magic Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some Magic Stones, the power of the stone increases if <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the same stone is picked up by the player. Each stone is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with question marks represent random Magic Stones, which grant the player either a Haste Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Thunder Stone, Minimize Stone, Reflect Stone, Doom Stone, or Ultima Stone.|$|E

5|$|The {{first time}} that <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{brothers}} played for Victoria together came in 194647, after Neil was selected {{to play for the}} state against Tasmania. At the time, a second-string team was used to play Tasmaniawho were not in the Sheffield Shieldin two first-class matches, while the strongest team played in the regular interstate competition. Neil struck a century in the second match against Tasmania, and was called into the Victorian team to play against New South Wales in a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG, and he played alongside Merv for their state’s three remaining matches of the season. However, the brothers never batted together in these three matches. Merv opened the batting and was always out before Neil came in, usually at No. 6 upon the fall of the fourth wicket. Merv captained at first-class level {{for the first time in}} the last match, a draw against South Australia that was severely shortened by rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{begins in}} 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) {{over a number}} of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic neuritis, and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the previous difficulties. The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of cases). A combination of these two patterns may also occur or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on. Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning. Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year. Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer. Similarly, viral infections such as the common cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk. Stress may also trigger an attack. Women with MS who become pregnant experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases. Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability. Many events have been found not to affect relapse rates including vaccination, breast feeding, physical trauma, and Uhthoff's phenomenon.|$|E
