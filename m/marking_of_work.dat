50|$|It {{can often}} be assumed {{that there is a}} lack of social {{communication}} in an online school, therefore for younger students (pupils) a concern for lack of social skills training. The distance learning model where study packages are sent out, does fit this assumption, as the only human interaction is the <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> by a teacher, and even that much may not be part of the service. But in a live, interactive, online school (synchronous learning) lessons are socially constructed. Students or pupils are in contact with each other and with teachers through software provided by the online school, and by email, both in lessons and outside them. Students can also communicate by phone, where permitted. Through the various kinds of social contact personal relationships develop. Some online schools do specifically address personal and welfare support, especially in the case of younger students (pupils) for social skills training, both in its own right and to underpin effective, orderly lessons.|$|E

50|$|Miki Malör's works elude {{unilateral}} attributions: {{they are}} inspired by the avant-gardes of the 20th century, postmodern, deconstructivist, subversive, alternative, experimental, post-dramatic, feminist, rhizomatic, sensual, absurd, highly comical, intimate, transgressing taboos, excessive, and much more. Her works are neither based on drama pieces, nor are they meta-narrations, {{and there are no}} actors impersonating roles. She exclusively realises her own pieces and favours working with performers, dancers, and laypersons. Another <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> her <b>works</b> is her special attachment to music; her frequent trade with objects indicates a close relationship with the fine arts.|$|R

50|$|London-based {{sculptor}} Susan Collis uses {{a variety}} of techniques and strategies to investigate issues concerning interpretation, craft, value and labor. Everyday objects are presented etched, splattered and stained with <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> wear and tear. At first glance, the marks seem to be the accidental results of normal use, and as such seem meaningless and not worthy of examination. Collis is interested in the shift of perception that takes place upon discovery that they are, in fact, careful, intentional acts, and that the materials used are traditionally valued for their financial or decorative properties. A tired stepladder covered with paint drips from years of use has been simulated by the meticulous inlaying of diamonds, pearls, opals and other prized materials. A bucket catching a drip from the gallery ceiling may not be the result of neglect, rather a complex staging of pumps, water-tanks and false walls to artificially create the scenario. Typically works involve momentous amounts of often hidden labor to create an object that may easily go unnoticed, but is replete with value, be it material or conceptual. Much <b>of</b> Collis’ <b>work</b> can go unnoticed and this visual gamble results in a possible conceptual pay-off that rewards concerted investigation by the viewer.|$|R
