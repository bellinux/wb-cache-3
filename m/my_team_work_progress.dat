It is articulated in two parts, the first one describing <b>my</b> <b>team</b> <b>work</b> and the second presenting my research work. In the first part, I explain how I worked to improve the collaboration between NTU and the French institute Inria, and to install some tools bringing the power of Unix (or Linux) to the PC of the "Vision and Control" Strategic Research Program. On another hand, the research part of this report proposes an algorithm to integrate, on a Nomad 200 TM robot, vision sensing with a control and planning system adapted to the robot. If practical results have not been as successful as anticipated, theoretical results and implementations should allow to achieve the aimed objectives soon.

He acknowledged that my customers had this information, but he was hearing some disturbing comments between when I submitted my reports, comments like, 'What has he done for me lately?' I decided to take this input to heart. My ideas about communications norms needed a major overhaul. The communication norms I was comfortable with were becoming outdated. I realized the written and verbal communications response time was suddenly being measured in days or minutes. People's perception of a project team based on monthly or quarterly meetings was no longer adequate. In the past, once the team's credibility was established {{it was hard to}} change.

40|$|Abstract. I briefly {{describe}} the Lick Observatory Supernova Search with the 0. 76 -m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope. I then present {{an overview of}} optical observations of Type II, IIb, Ib, and Ic supernovae (SNe), {{all of which are}} thought to arise from core collapse in massive progenitors that have previously experienced different amounts of mass loss. SNe IIn are distinguished by relatively narrow emission lines with little or no P-Cygni absorption component; they probably have unusually dense circumstellar gas with which the ejecta interact. Some SNe IIn, however, might actually be super-outbursts of luminous variable stars; rarely, they may even be SNe Ia in disguise. Plausible detections of the progenitors of a few SNe II have been made. Spectropolarimetry of core-collapse SNe reveals that asphericity increases toward the core. 1. The Lick Observatory Supernova Search In 1989, <b>my</b> <b>team</b> began to <b>work</b> on developing a robotic telescope for CCD imaging of relatively faint objects.

40|$|Abstract. I review recent optical {{observations}} of supernovae (SNe) conducted by my group. The Lick Observatory Supernova Search with the 0. 76 -m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope {{is currently the}} world’s most successful search for nearby SNe. We also use this telescope to obtain multicolor light curves of SNe. One {{of the more interesting}} SNe we discovered is SN 2000 cx, which differs from all previously observed SNe Ia. Another very strange SN Ia that we studied is SN 2002 cx, many of whose properties are opposite those of SN 2000 cx. Extensive data on SNe II-P 1999 em and 1999 gi were used to derive distances with the expanding photosphere method. Results from spectropolarimetry suggest that the deeper we peer into the ejecta of core-collapse SNe, the greater the asphericity. We are using Hubble Space Telescope data to identify, or set limits on, the progenitors of core-collapse SNe. 1 The Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) In 1989, <b>my</b> <b>team</b> began to <b>work</b> on developing a robotic telescope for CCD imaging of relatively faint objects.

40|$|Curs 2014 - 2015 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} if it would be possible for a mechatronic product development team to use Scrum, an Agile Development framework with both, the students of UVIC-UCC and the company ITQ GmbH, behind the student project called Mi 5. The Agile philosophy and methods have revolutionized the software development industry in the last decade, and therefore it was of interest to see if this new way of working would be applicable in other disciplines. Thus, the study focuses on if Scrum can be applied in mechatronic product development, and if it needs any adaptations. Two case studies of agile methods used in mechanics, electronics and software development are presented. The primary case study follows a mechatronic product development team through their 5 -month experiment of using Scrum. In this context a five-member team in question co-operates to develop an intelligent prototype for packaging food products in a production line. The methods used in order to form the case studies were observations, interviews, documentary analysis and informal conversations. The results indicate that it is possible for a mechatronic development team to use the Scrum framework, with some adaptions of the framework. The team in the case study made use of all main aspects of the framework, but the deviations were not a working product or product increment is not produced every iteration and not all the members finish until the end of the project. The results also indicate that using the framework improved the <b>team’s</b> <b>work</b> and <b>progress,</b> and the team decided to continue using the framework after the experiment. The conclusion is that Scrum can be used in a mechatronic environment, by mechatronic development teams. Some adaptations might be needed, depending on each case, but this is also recommended in the literature to software development teams...|$|R

The research objectives were development of: • A comprehensive measure of NHS outputs and productivity • Methods to facilitate regular in-year analysis of NHS productivity • Output measures capable of measuring efficiency and productivity at sub-national levels. The research team was also asked to co-operate with The Atkinson Review on measurement of government output and productivity for the national accounts. Three interim reports on this research were produced (July 2004, November 2004 and June 2005) as well as memoranda on data requirements (September 2004) and methodology (January 2005, August 2005).
