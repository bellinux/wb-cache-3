5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} <b>mutant</b> <b>protein,</b> since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
25|$|The second known {{mutation}} in SCN2A associated with GEFS+ is R102X. This mutation {{is located in}} the intracellular N-terminus (figure 3) and results in SMEI in patients. The result of this mutation is completely non-functional channels and membrane hypoexcitability. Interestingly, the truncated <b>mutant</b> <b>protein</b> also seems to cause wild-type channels to inactivate at more hyperpolarized potentials, indicating that it also acts in a dominant negative manner.|$|E
25|$|Notably, {{the protein}} {{lysozyme}} {{is among the}} few native-state proteins shown to contain an alpha-strand region; lysozyme from both chickens and humans contains an alpha strand located close {{to the site of}} a mutation known to cause hereditary amyloidosis in humans, usually an autosomal dominant genetic disease. Molecular dynamics simulations of the <b>mutant</b> <b>protein</b> reveal that the region around the mutation assumes an alpha strand conformation. Lysozyme is among the naturally occurring proteins known to form amyloid fibers under experimental conditions, and both natively alpha-strand region and the mutation site fall within the larger region identified as the core of lysozyme amyloid fibrillogenesis.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} gain insight into the {{mechanism}} by which the Escherichia coli transcription factor FNR* is activated in response to anaerobiosis, we have analyzed FNR <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> which, unlike the wild-type protein, stimulate gene expression {{in the presence of}} oxygen in vivo. Cell extracts containing seven different FNR* <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> were tested in vitro for the ability to bind to the FNR consensus DNA site in a gel retardation assay under aerobic conditions. At the concentration of protein tested, only extracts which contained FNR* <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> with amino acid substitutions at position 154 showed significant DNA binding. The three position- 154 FNR* <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> could be further distinguished from the other <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> by analysis of the in vivo phenotypes of FNR* proteins containing amino acid substitutions at either of two essential cysteine residues. In the presence of oxygen, FNR* <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> with amino acid substitutions at position 154 were the least affected when either Cys- 23 or Cys- 122 was substituted for Ser. On the basis of these in vivo and in vitro analyses, FNR* <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> appear to segregate into at least two classes. Thus, it appears that each class of FNR* substitutions alters the normal pathway of FNR activation in response to oxygen deprivation by a different mechanism...|$|R

The numerical modeling was aimed at mimicking protein expansion upon heating. After the conditions for an expanding protein accessible surface area were established for T 4 lysozyme and barnase wild-type proteins, MD simulations were carried out under the same conditions using the crystal structures of several <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins.</b> The computed thermal expansion of the accessible surface area of <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> {{was found to be}} strongly correlated with their experimentally measured stabilities.

However, one disadvantage of such therapy is the short intracellular half-life of the delivered protein. Here, we generated <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> in which multiple lysine residues in the C-terminal were substituted by arginines. The <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> were effectively delivered in glioma cells and were resistant to Mdm 2 -mediated ubiquitination.

25|$|Experimental errors can be high in {{measuring}} equilibrium stability {{as well the}} folding/unfolding rates in water for the wild-type protein and mutants. The necessity of extrapolating phi values in pure water from measurements made in solutions containing denaturants adds uncertainty to the reported values. When the stability difference between the native and <b>mutant</b> <b>protein</b> are low (< 7 kJ/mol), experimental error can be very large; unusual phi-values outside the 0-1 range may arise from these errors rather than illustrating deviations from the conditions assumed by the method. In addition, calculated phi values {{have been shown to}} depend strongly on the number of data points collected and the laboratory in which the experiment was performed.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{specific}} sequences in the transmembrane (TM) domain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) fusion (F) protein {{in the structure}} and function of this protein was assessed by replacing this domain with the F protein TM domains from two other paramyxoviruses, Sendai virus (SV) and measles virus (MV), or the TM domain of the unrelated glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). <b>Mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> with the SV or MV F protein TM domains were expressed, transported to cell surfaces, and proteolytically cleaved at levels {{comparable to that of}} the wild-type <b>protein,</b> while <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> with the VSV G protein TM domain were less efficiently expressed on cell surfaces and proteolytically cleaved. All <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> were defective in all steps of membrane fusion, including hemifusion. In contrast to the wild-type <b>protein,</b> the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> did not form detectable complexes with the NDV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein. As determined by binding of conformation-sensitive antibodies, the conformations of the ectodomains of the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> were altered. These results show that the specific sequence of the TM domain of the NDV F protein is important for the conformation of the preactivation form of the ectodomain, the interactions of the protein with HN protein, and fusion activity...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{polymerase}} beta {{is one of}} {{the smallest}} known eukaryotic DNA polymerases. This polymerase has been very well characterized in vitro, but its functional role in vivo has yet to be determined. Using a novel competition assay in Escherichia coli, we isolated two DNA polymerase beta dominant negative mutants. When we overexpressed the dominant negative <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cells became sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate. Interestingly, overexpression of the same polymerase beta <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> did not confer sensitivity to UV damage, strongly suggesting that the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> interfere with the process of base excision repair but not nucleotide excision repair in S. cerevisiae. Our data implicate a role for polymerase IV, the S. cerevisiae polymerase beta homolog, in base excision repair in S. cerevisiae...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: To probe for {{residual}} structure {{present in}} the urea-unfolded form of the small protein barstar, to determine how salt might modulate such structure, and to determine how such structure might affect {{the stability of the}} <b>protein,</b> <b>mutant</b> variants that display m values {{different from that of the}} wild-type protein have been studied. The <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis at residue positions located on the surface of the folded protein. The m value, which represents the preferential free energy of interaction of urea with the unfolded form in comparison to that with the folded state, was determined from equilibrium urea-induced unfolding curves. <b>Mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> for which the m values were significantly greater than (m+ mutant forms), significantly smaller than (m- mutant forms), or similar to (m 0 mutant forms) the m value determined for the wild-type protein were studied. The unfolded forms of the m 0, m+ and m- <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> represent different components within the unfolded form ensemble, which differ from each other in their solvent-exposed surface areas. Hence, the m value has been used as a measure of residual structure in the unfolded form. To further understand the nature of structures {{present in the}} unfolded form ensemble, the effects of the salt KCl on the stabilities of the wild-type and the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins,</b> as well as on the structures present in the unfolded form ensemble, were also studied.

50|$|A mutated NLGN 3 gene, R451C, {{has been}} cloned.

The small amount of <b>mutant</b> <b>protein</b> that reached the cell membrane demonstrated diminished binding activity for neurexin-1, consistent with a loss of function. The mutant gene has been cloned and was introduced into mice, resulting in impaired social interactions, enhanced spatial learning abilities, and increased inhibitory synaptic transmission. Deleting NLGN 3 did not produce these effects, thus indicating R451C to be a gain-of-function mutation. This supports the claim that increased inhibitory synaptic transmission may contribute to human autism spectrum disorders.|$|E
40|$|DNA topoisomerase II is a multidomain homodimeric {{enzyme that}} changes DNA {{topology}} by coupling ATP hydrolysis to {{the transport of}} one DNA helix through a transient double-stranded break in another. To investigate the biochemical properties of the individual domains of Leishmania donovani topoisomerase II, four truncation mutants were generated. Deletion of 178 aminoacids from the C-terminus (core and LdÎC 1058) had no apparent effect on the DNA-binding or cleavage activities of the enzymes. However, when 429 aminoacids from the N-terminus and 451 aminoacids from the C-terminus were removed (LdÎNÎC), the enzyme was no longer active. Moreover, the removal of 429 aminoacids from the N-terminus (LdÎNÎC, core and LdÎN 429) render the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> incapable of performing ATP hydrolysis. The <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> show cleavage activities at wide range of KCl concentrations (25 â 350 mM). In addition, the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins,</b> excepting LdÎNÎC, can also act on kDNA and linearize the minicircles. Surprisingly, the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> fail to show {{the formation of the}} enhanced cleavable complex in the presence of etoposide. Our findings suggest that the conformation required for interaction with the drug is absent in the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins.</b> Here, we have also identified Tyr 775 through direct sequencing of the DNA linked peptide as the catalytic residue implicated in DNA-breakage and rejoining. Taken together, our results demonstrate that topoisomerase II are functionally and mechanistically conserved enzymes and the variations in activity seem to reflect functional optimization for its physiological role during parasite genome replication...|$|R
40|$|The role of beta-turns in dictating the {{structure}} of a beta-barrel protein is assessed by probing the tolerance of the central beta-turn of poplar plastocyanin to substitution by arbitrary sequences. Native plastocyanin binds copper and is colored bright blue. However, when the wild-type Pro 47 -Ser 48 -Gly 49 -Val 50 turn sequence is replaced by arbitrary tetrapeptides, the vast majority (92 / 98 = 94 %) of <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> cannot fold into the native blue structure. Characterization of the colorless <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> demonstrates that the majority of substitutions in this type II beta-turn disrupt the native structure severely. Gross structural changes are indicated by major differences in the CD spectra of the mutants relative to the wild-type protein, and by the much larger apparent size of <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> in gel filtration experiments. These <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> do not bind copper. Furthermore, Cys 84 forms a disulfide bond readily in the colorless <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins,</b> indicating that it has moved away from the buried position it occupies in the native copper binding site and has become exposed. These results indicate that the central beta-turn in plastocyanin is not merely a default structure arising in response to the surrounding context; rather, sequence information in this turn plays an active role in dictating the location of a chain reversal in the beta-barrel structure. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the folding of natural proteins, as well as the design of de novo proteins...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{two lines}} of genetic evidence consistent with the premise that CheW, a cytoplasmic component of the chemotactic signaling system of Escherichia coli, interacts directly with Tsr, the membranebound serine chemoreceptor. (i) We demonstrated phenotypic suppression between 10 missense <b>mutant</b> CheW <b>proteins</b> and six missense <b>mutant</b> Tsr <b>proteins.</b> Most of these <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> had leaky chemotaxis defects and were partially dominant, implying relatively minor functional alterations. Their suppression pattern was allele specific, suggesting that the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> have compensatory conformational changes at sites of interactive contact. (ii) We isolated five partially dominant CheW mutations and found that four of them were similar or identical to the suppressible CheW <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins.</b> This implies {{that there are only}} a few ways in which CheW function can be altered to produce dominant defects and that dominance is mediated through interactions of CheW with Tsr. The amino acid replacements in these <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> were inferred from their DNA sequence changes. The CheW mutations were located in five regularly spaced clusters in the first two-thirds of the protein. The Tsr mutations were located in a highly conserved region in the middle of the cytoplasmic signaling domain. The hydrophobic moments, overall hydrophobicities, and predicted secondary structures of the mutant segments were consistent with the possibility that they are located at the surface of the CheW and Tsr molecules and represent the contact sites between these two proteins...|$|R

Cancer-testis antigens are antigens expressed primarily in the germ cells of the testes, but also in fetal ovaries and the trophoblast. Some cancer cells aberrantly express these proteins and therefore present these antigens, allowing attack by T-cells specific to these antigens. Example antigens of this type are CTAG1B and MAGEA1.|$|E

40|$|The dnaB gene of Escherichia coli encodes a bifunctional primase {{accessory}} protein/helicase {{necessary for}} chromosomal replication.

To investigate {{the role of the}} linker in the structure and function of DnaB, we have purified and characterized three DnaB <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> having single amino acid substitutions in the linker. We find that the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> retain the two-domain structure and assemble into hexamers that may be less stable than hexamers formed by wild-type DnaB.

Paired cysteine substitutions were introduced at locations predicted to form a disulfide bond. One cysteine in each mutant was introduced into the membrane insertion domain of the toxin; the second cysteine was introduced into the <b>protein</b> backbone. <b>Mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> with cysteine substitutions at amino acid positions I 51 /A 114 and at V 56 /F 118 lacked detectable cytotoxic activity in a MDCK cell assay. Cytotoxic activity could be reconstituted in both <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> by incubation with dithiothreitol, indicating {{that the lack of}} cytotoxic activity was attributable to the formation of a disulfide bond. Fluorescent labeling of the cysteines also indicated that the introduced cysteines participated in a disulfide bond.

Unlike the wild-type protein, hyperproduction of the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> did not inhibit macromolecular syntheses, was not toxic to cells and caused a less drastic compaction of the nucleoid. Gel shift and ligase-mediated circularization tests demonstrated that the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> retained almost normal affinity for non-curved DNA, but lost the wild-type capacity to recognize preferentially curved DNA and to actively bend non-curved DNA, a property of wild-type H-NS demonstrated here for the first time. DNase I foot-printing and in vitro transcription experiments showed that the <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> also failed to recognize the intrinsically bent site of the hns promoter required for H-NS transcription autorepression and to inhibit transcription from the same promoter. The failure of the Pro 115 <b>mutant</b> <b>proteins</b> to recognize curved DNA and to bend DNA despite their near normal affinity for non-curved DNA can be attributed to a defect in protein-protein interaction resulting in a reduced capacity to form oligomers observed in vitro and by a new in vivo test based on functional replacement by H-NS of the oligomerization domain (C-domain) of bacteriophage lambda cI repressor...|$|R
