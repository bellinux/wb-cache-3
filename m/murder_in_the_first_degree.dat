25|$|After Shackleford's arrest Chuck Palahniuk {{was asked}} {{to be part of}} the {{decision}} as to whether Shackleford would receive the death sentence. Palahniuk had worked in a hospital and as a crime reporter and struggled with his stance on capital punishment. Over the next few months he began working on Lullaby. According to him it was a way to cope with the decision he had to make regarding Shackleford's death. In the spring of 2001 Shackleford was found guilty for two counts of <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>degree.</b> A month after Palahniuk finished Lullaby, Shackleford was sentenced to death.|$|E

Twenty-five were for rioting and twelve for the crime of <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>degree.</b> Some men were indicted on both charges. Three men: Louis Dondino, Carl Hammerberg, and Gilbert Stephenson were convicted of rioting; none served more than 15 months in prison.

2500|$|A murder, defined broadly, is an {{unlawful}} killing. [...] Unlawful {{killing is}} probably the act most frequently targeted by the criminal law. [...] In many jurisdictions, the crime of murder is divided into various gradations of severity, e.g., <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>degree,</b> based on intent. [...] Malice is a required element of murder. [...] Manslaughter (Culpable Homicide in Scotland) is a lesser variety of killing committed {{in the absence of}} malice, brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness.|$|E
2500|$|On January 2, 2007, two {{employees}} of Cheli's in Detroit were fatally stabbed. Megan Soroka, 49, was {{a manager at}} the restaurant and Mark Barnard, 52, was a chef. Police arrested Justin Blackshere, 17, who confessed to the crime. He was a busboy at the restaurant and was fired in November 2006. Blackshere's pregnant girlfriend had also been fired from {{her job as a}} dishwasher. Blackshere was found guilty of <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>degree</b> on August 22, 2007. He was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole on September 7, 2007. Chelios took a leave of absence from the Detroit Red Wings to help the families of his murdered employees. He said, [...] "I'll come back when I feel ready and the families feel ready. I'm just going to try to get through this day by day with everybody." [...] On January 9, 2007, the Red Wings announced that Chelios would be playing that night.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{the police}} and the DA {{particularly}} said in 1998 that JonBenét's brother Burke, who was 9 {{years old at the time}} of her death, was not a suspect. [...] The Ramseys gave several televised interviews, but resisted police questioning except on their own terms. In October 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 grand jury had recommended filing charges against John and Patsy for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation and hindering the prosecution of an unidentified person who had [...] "committed ... the crime of <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>degree</b> and child abuse resulting in death". However, the DA determined there was insufficient evidence and did not pursue an indictment. In 2002, the DA's successor took over investigation of the case from {{the police and}} primarily pursued alternative theories of a non-family intruder committing the killing. In 2003, a trace DNA taken from the victim's clothes was found to belong to an unknown male, inducing the DA in 2008 to send the Ramseys a letter of apology declaring the family [...] "completely cleared". In February 2009, the Boulder Police Department took the case back from the DA and reopened the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|The year 1999 {{brought a}} series of great {{personal}} tragedies to Palahniuk's life. At that time, his father, Fred Palahniuk, had started dating a woman named Donna Fontaine, whom he had met through a personal ad under the title [...] "." [...] Her former boyfriend, Dale Shackelford, had previously been imprisoned for sexual abuse, and had vowed to kill Fontaine {{as soon as he}} was released from prison. Palahniuk believes that using a personal ad, Fontaine was looking for [...] "the biggest man she could find" [...] to protect her from Shackelford, and Palahniuk's father qualified. After his release, Shackelford followed Fontaine and the senior Palahniuk to Fontaine's home in Kendrick, Idaho after they had gone out for a date. Shackelford then shot them both and dragged their bodies into Fontaine's cabin home, which he then set afire. In the spring of 2001, Shackelford was found guilty for two counts of <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>degree</b> and sentenced to death. In the wake of these events, Palahniuk began working on the novel Lullaby. He has stated that he wrote the novel to help him cope with having participated in the decision to have Shackelford receive the death sentence.|$|E

60|$|I {{got hold}} of Kingsley, and read 'Yeast,' and I think some other novels of his, with great relish, and without {{sensibility}} to his Charles Readeish lapses from his art into the material of his art. But of all the minor fiction that I read at this time none impressed me so much as three books which had then already had their vogue, and which I knew somewhat from reviews. They were Paul Ferroll, 'Why Paul Ferroll Killed His Wife,' and 'Day after Day.' The first two were, of course, related to each other, {{and they were all}} three full of unwholesome force. As to their aesthetic merit I will not say anything, for I have not looked at either of the books for thirty years. I fancy, however, that their strength was rather of the tetanic than the titanic sort. They made your sympathies go with the hero, who deliberately puts his wife to death for the lie she told to break off his marriage with the woman he had loved, and who then marries this tender and gentle girl, and lives in great happiness with her till her death. <b>Murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>degree</b> is flattered by his fate up to the point of letting him die peacefully in Boston after these dealings of his in England; and altogether his story could not be commended to people with a morbid taste for bloodshed. Naturally enough the books were written by a perfectly good woman, the wife of an English clergyman, whose friends were greatly scandalized by them. As a sort of atonement she wrote 'Day after Day,' the story of a dismal and joyless orphan, who dies to the sound of angelic music, faint and farheard, filling the whole chamber. A carefuller study of the phenomenon reveals the fact that the seraphic strains are produced by the steam escaping from the hot-water bottles {{at the feet of the}} invalid.|$|E
