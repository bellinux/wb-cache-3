5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} March 4, 1867 in Columbiana County, Ohio to a Lutheran {{father and a}} Mennonite mother. The ninth of 11 children, Beilhart {{was raised in the}} Lutheran church and his early home {{environment}} was strictly religious. Jacob did not receive <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> formal education. His father died when he was six or seven years old so Jacob attended only elementary school. At the age of 17, Beilhart went to work at his brother-in-law's harness shop in southern Ohio and, when they moved to Ottawa, Kansas, Jacob went with them.|$|E
25|$|Antibes and Juan les Pins host {{a number}} of festivals, mainly during the summer months. There's not <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> {{traditional}} cultural festivals in Antibes; most of the festivals focus on music and contemporary activities.|$|E
25|$|In Art History, {{paintings}} showing {{two or more}} females together seldom displayed <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> potential {{sexual activity}} between them. When it came to nudity, most women subjects were depicted as dancers or bathers, usually stated as goddesses.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture {{not being}} intensive, {{there are many}} commons and access lands, {{together}} with an extensive network of footpaths and bridleways including the North Downs Way, a scenic long-distance path. Accordingly, Surrey provides <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> rural leisure activities, with a very large horse population.|$|E
25|$|As built, {{however, the}} class was lacking <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> modern {{appliances}} due to the PRR's conservatism; features missing included a mechanical stoker, power reverse, and a feedwater heater, {{although most of the}} class were later given a stoker and all received power reverse.|$|E
25|$|As Carnegie {{went from}} his retail to {{wholesale}} period of library funding he refined his philanthropical philosophy. Instead of providing funding for large, multi-purpose buildings in larger urban areas {{he began to}} focus on providing more and smaller locales with libraries, communities that may not have had <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> cultural institutions before Carnegie's benefaction.|$|E

5000|$|A {{convergence}} of BPM and RPA tools, <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>the</b> distinction between BPM and workflow tools is now blurred. The acquisition of OpenSpan in 2016 by Pegasystems is perhaps just one early indication {{of such a}} convergence.|$|R
25|$|The boss of a clan is {{typically}} {{elected by the}} rank-and-file soldiers (though violent successions do happen). Due to {{the small size of}} most Sicilian clans, the boss of a clan has intimate contact with all members, and doesn't receive <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> privileges or rewards as he would in larger organizations (such as the larger Five Families of New York). His tenure is also frequently short: elections are yearly, and he might be deposed sooner for misconduct or incompetence.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{populations have}} been {{established}} in all the Great Lakes. Coho stocks were planted {{by the state of}} Michigan in the late 1960s to control the growing population of non-native alewife. Now Chinook (king), Atlantic, and coho (silver) salmon are annually stocked in all Great Lakes by most bordering states and provinces. These populations are not self-sustaining and do not provide <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> a commercial fishery, but have {{led to the development of}} a thriving sport fishery.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman empire, few {{buildings}} large enough to require <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> vaulting were built for several centuries. In the early Romanesque period, a return to stone barrel vaults was seen for the first great cathedrals; their interiors were fairly dark, due to thick, heavy walls needed to support the vault. One {{of the largest and most}} famous churches enclosed from above by a vast barrel vault was the church of Cluny Abbey, built between the 11th and 12th centuries.|$|E
50|$|Beccaria did <b>much,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> both of {{experiment}} and exposition, to spread {{a knowledge of}} the electrical researches of Benjamin Franklin and others. His principal work was the treatise Dell’ Elettricismo Naturale ed Artificiale (1753), which was translated into English in 1776.|$|R
6000|$|... "You perceive, Mr. Wychecombe, {{what are}} your uncle's wishes," [...] {{observed}} Sir Gervaise, very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that a well-bred superior intimates to an inferior the compliance he expects; [...] "I trust his desire will not be disregarded, at a moment like this." ...|$|R
60|$|Seeing that Hendry was as <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> as myself, I {{invited him}} {{upstairs to the}} attic, whence we heard Jess and Leeby upbraiding each other shrilly. I was aware that the room was speckless; but for all that, Leeby was turning it upside down.|$|R
25|$|Vénus was {{too small}} and too weak for the Royal Navy (RN) to take her in as a sixth-rate frigate or even a post-ship. She was {{designed}} for short-range privateering in the Channel and the Bay of Biscay, rather than the longer-range escort or patrol work of a British sloop. Accordingly, she couldn't stow as <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> stores as the Admiralty needed; reducing her armament, relative to her French establishment, would have permitted her to carry the larger weight of stores she had to carry in RN service.|$|E
25|$|The {{oldest of}} the {{mandolin}} orchestras, which has been continuously active since the 1940s, is the Shfeya Orchestra, founded by Moshe Medalia, and today made up of graduates from the Shfeya Youth Village. The village is a boarding school for at-risk junior and senior high-school students. Part of the education includes students working together in small groups, teaching music to one another. There wasn't <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> learning materials when Moshe Jacobson, founder of the music program arrived in 1942. So he wrote text books for the instruments and composed music and songs.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time {{sculpture}} and statues were put to wider uses. The great temples of the Classical era such as the Parthenon in Athens, and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, required relief sculpture for decorative friezes, and sculpture in the round to fill the triangular fields of the pediments. The difficult aesthetic and technical challenge stimulated <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> sculptural innovation. Unfortunately these works survive only in fragments, {{the most famous of}} which are the Parthenon Marbles, half of which are in the British Museum.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] said Lopez. Mr. Dixon was the {{underground}} manager {{out at the}} San Juan mine, and was perhaps as anxious for a loyal and honest colleague as was Mr. Lopez. If so, Mr. Dixon was very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to be disappointed.|$|R

25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E
25|$|De Córdoba {{was born}} at Montilla {{in what is now}} the {{province}} of Córdoba, the son of Pedro Fernández de Córdoba (Count of Aguilar) and his wife Elvira de Herrera. He and his older brother, Alonso, were orphaned when they were young. As the younger brother in a society practicing primogeniture, Gonzalo could not expect <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> inherited wealth or titles, and of his two options – the church or the military – he chose the latter. He was first attached to the household of Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, the half-brother of King Henry IV of Castile. After Alfonso's death in 1468 Córdoba devoted himself to Alfonso's sister, Isabella of Castile.|$|E
25|$|Lanfranc {{was trained}} in the liberal arts, at that time a field in which {{northern}} Italy was famous (there {{is little or no}} evidence to support the myth that his education included <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> Civil Law, and none that links him with Irnerius of Bologna as a pioneer in the renaissance of its study). For unknown reasons at an uncertain date, he crossed the Alps, soon taking up the role of teacher in France and eventually in Normandy. About 1039 he became the master of the cathedral school at Avranches, where he taught for three years with conspicuous success. But in 1042 he embraced the monastic profession in the newly founded Bec Abbey. Until 1045 he lived at Bec in absolute seclusion.|$|E
5000|$|The song is a {{dramatic}} ballad. Pugacheva sings to a [...] "prima donna" [...] and describes her desire to overcome struggles <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> as <b>the</b> singer apparently has. She sings that the prima donna has an [...] "injured soul" [...] but is yet able to sing well.|$|R
60|$|Now Sir Marmaduke cursed {{himself and}} his folly for having made this arrangement. He had not known--when he made it--that Richard would be back at Acol then. Adam the smith, never came home before eight o'clock and the old Quakeress herself {{would not have been}} <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a pity," [...] she thought, [...] "that Dora and {{his sister}} {{are not likely to}} be friends. That would help wonderfully. This schoolgirl, {{probably}} jealous of the superiority of grown-up young ladies, may be very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> I am sorry the case is not different." ...|$|R
25|$|Then in November, she and , {{together}} {{with a number of}} East Indiamen, participated in the campaign to eradicate piracy in the Persian Gulf, centered on Ras al-Khaimah. In an attack the British began with a cannonade of the town and followed with a ground attack. The destroyed about some vessels, 30 of them very large dhows, {{together with}} <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> naval stores. Chiffonnes casualties amounted to two men wounded. She and Caroline destroyed the Persian towns of Linga and Laft on Qeshm Island. Chiffone also destroyed 20 vessels, nine of them large dhows at Linga and eleven, nine of them large dhows, at Laft. This time the resistance on shore was more intense and Chiffone lost one man killed and 17 wounded out of total British casualties (including men from the East India Company's vessels), of two killed and 27 wounded.|$|E
25|$|Historically, work on radio-loud {{unification}} has {{concentrated on}} high-luminosity radio-loud quasars. These can be unified with narrow-line radio galaxies {{in a manner}} directly analogous to the Seyfert 1/2 unification (but without the complication of <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> a reflection component: narrow-line radio galaxies show no nuclear optical continuum or reflected X-ray component, although they do occasionally show polarized broad-line emission). The large-scale radio structures of these objects provide compelling evidence that the orientation-based unified models really are true. X-ray evidence, where available, supports the unified picture: radio galaxies show evidence of obscuration from a torus, while quasars do not, although {{care must be taken}} since radio-loud objects also have a soft unabsorbed jet-related component, and high resolution is necessary to separate out thermal emission from the sources' large-scale hot-gas environment. At very small angles to the line of sight, relativistic beaming dominates, and we see a blazar of some variety.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s and 1960s, {{the area}} went into decline, {{in line with}} a trend of general urban {{deterioration}} in Manhattan. As middle-class residents left for the suburbs, buildings were allowed to fall into disrepair and were divided into small units for new low-rent tenants, many of them originally from Puerto Rico. Urban renewal programs, headed by city planner Robert Moses, called for several city blocks to be demolished in order to construct the Frederick Douglass Houses in the superblock where they stand today. The development of the Douglass Houses greatly increased the density of low-income renters without providing <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> amenities (food shops, clubs, restaurants, and open space) for them to use. Rampant graft and corruption associated with the project blighted their opening and brought ill repute on the neighborhood, and the debacle contributed strongly to Moses's fall from power and ouster. Although community groups, such as the Manhattan Valley Development Corporation, tried to find alternative solutions for the housing shortage in the area, the city's 1976 fiscal crisis caused many of these alternate plans to be shelved.|$|E
50|$|The {{nuclear fusion}} process works as follows: five billion years ago, the new Sun formed when gravity pulled {{together}} a vast cloud of hydrogen and dust, {{from which the}} Earth and other planets also arose. The gravitational pull released energy and heated <b>the</b> early Sun, <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Helmholtz proposed.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} on several occasions {{that the price of}} a Mars bar correlates fairly accurately with <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> value of <b>the</b> pound sterling since World War II, <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>the</b> Big Mac Index {{has proven to be a}} good indicator of the actual relative purchasing power of world currencies.|$|R
50|$|Ika somen ("squid noodles") {{refer to}} a type of sashimi made from raw squid cut into fine strips, vaguely {{resembling}} somen type noodles. They are typically served with grated ginger and soy sauce or a soy sauce-based mentsuyu sauce. They are slurped up, <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that noodles are eaten according to Japanese custom.|$|R
