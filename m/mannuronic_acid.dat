Under acidic conditions the methyl ester and the carboxylic acid took up an "inverted" 1 C 4 chair conformation {{as opposed to}} the "normal" 4 C 1 chair at basic pH. This conformational change is explained by the stereoelectronic effects of the ring substituents and it parallels the behavior of the <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid</b> ester oxocarbenium ion. Because of this solution phase behavior, the <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid</b> ester azasugar was probed as an inhibitor for a Caulobacter GH 47 mannosidase that hydrolyzes its substrates following a reaction itinerary that proceeds through a 3 H 4 transition state.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{following}} the inclusion of alginate high in <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid</b> there is {{a reduction in the}} viscosity of soya melt during extrusion, this work attempts to identify the mechanism for this effect. The effect of water content and hydrocolloid inclusion on the denaturation behaviour and water binding properties of soya protein has been investigated, mainly by the use of differential scanning calorimetry. Of a range of parameters investigated, transition onset temperature and enthalpy, change in specific heat function and coopertivity of the transition all show a dependence on initial moisture content. These parameters are all changed if soya is heated {{in the presence of a}} high <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid</b> alginate. With the exception of changes in enthalpy these effects are not seen to the same extent with other added hydrocolloids. These changes have been attributed to the production of water during heating. Measurements of freezable water and sorption isotherms suggest that alginate addition increases the water binding ability of soya isolate after denaturation. When heated at high temperatures only soya and gluten (out of 7 proteins tested) produced measurable quantities of additional water. In the presence of 2 % Manucol DM the formation of water was markedly increased in the soya and gluten samples but not in the other proteins. Production of increased amounts of water after alginate addition was demonstrated to be dependent on the quantity of <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid</b> in the alginate. The dependence of this effect on water activity suggests that it is the result of browning or condensation reactions. Glutamic acid was implicated with the specific reaction between soya and alginate, though in heated soya both loss of lysine and serine were found. Differential rates of degradation were found between a high <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid</b> alginate and a high guluronic acid alginate after heat treatment. The alginate high in <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid</b> was shown to depolymerise to a far greater extent. Various estimates for the molecular weight of the heat treated samples were obtained and no correlation could be found between increased reducing capability of the sample and extent of depolymerisation. Furthermore the production of volatiles that may be expected from sugar ring degradation were not found. Increased brown colour formation and water production and concomittant decreased glutamic acid content were found in soya samples extruded in the presence of 1 % Manucol DM. It was concluded that the chemical reactivity of glutamic acid with alginates rich in <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid</b> explains the well established effect of this type of polysaccharide in extrusion processing...|$|E

The aim of this work was to investigate the usefulness of alginate as a non-toxic coagulant used in purification of drinking water.

40|$|Light {{microscopy}} {{and transmission}} electron microscopy of thin sections and metal-shadowed specimens showed that the sheath of Leptothrix discophora SP- 6 (ATCC 51168) is a tube-like extracellular polymeric structure consisting of a condensed fabric of 6. 5 -nm-diameter fibrils underlying a more diffuse outer capsular layer. In thin sections, outer membrane bridges seen to contact the inner sheath layer suggested that the sheath fabric {{was attached to the}} outer layer of the gram-negative cell wall. The capsular polymers showed an affinity for cationic colloidal iron and polycationic ferritin, indicating that they carry a negative charge. Cell-free sheaths were isolated by treatment with a mixture of lysozyme, EDTA, and N-lauroylsarcosine (Sarkosyl) or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Both Sarkosyl- and SDS-isolated sheaths were indistinguishable in microscopic appearance. However, the Mn-oxidizing activity of Sarkosyl-isolated sheaths was more stable than that of SDS-isolated sheaths. The Sarkosyl-isolated sheaths also contained more 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctanoic acid and more outer membrane protein than SDS-isolated sheaths. The oven-dried mass of detergent-isolated sheaths represented approximately 9 % of the total oven-dried biomass of SP- 6 cultures; the oven-dried sheaths contained 38 % C, 6. 9 % N, 6 % H, and 2. 1 % S and approximately 34 to 35 % carbohydrate (polysaccharide), 23 to 25 % protein, 8 % lipid, and 4 % inorganic ash. Gas-liquid chromatography showed that the polysaccharide was an approximately 1 : 1 mixture of uronic acids (glucuronic, galacturonic, and <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acids</b> and at least one other unidentified uronic acid) and an amino sugar (galactosamine).

Digestion of these alginates with either polymannuronide or poly-guluronide lyase left alginatc-lLke polyuronides (residual alginates) which were richer in guluronic or <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid</b> residue, and were not only heterogeneous on gel-filtra-tion but also very different in their average chain length. The guluronic acid rich residual alginates from the polymannuronide lyase digest of MG-fraction was degraded by polyguluronide lyase extensively to di- and triuronides, while higher oligouronides were produced beside them from M- and G-fractions. Thus, it was shown that the alginic acid molecules of this alga were heterogeneous in the localization of each kind of uronic acid residue as well as iD its proportion.

The P. syringae pv. glycinea alginates from in vitro batch cultures were of lower molecular weight and polydispersity than those from in planta cultures, and both were of lower molecular weights than alginates produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa...|$|R
40|$|The total {{synthesis}} of mixed-sequence alginate oligosaccharides, featuring both -D-mannuronic acid (M) and -L-guluronic acid (G), is {{reported for the}} first time. A set of GM, GMG, GMGM, GMGMG, GMGMGM, GMGMGMG, and GMGGMG alginates was assembled using GM building blocks, having a guluronic acid acceptor part and a <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid</b> donor side to allow the fully stereoselective construction of the cis-glycosidic linkages. It {{was found that the}} nature of the reducing-end anomeric center, which is ten atoms away from the reacting alcohol group in the key disaccharide acceptor, had a tremendous effect on the efficiency with which the building blocks were united. This chiral center determines the overall shape of the acceptor and it is revealed that the conformational flexibility of the acceptor is an all-important factor in determining the outcome of a glycosylation reaction...|$|E

40|$|Decapsulated {{cells of}} Serratia marcescens were {{fractionated}} to yield crude cytoplasmic (I) lipopolysaccharide (II) and cell-wall (III) polysaccharides. Further separation of I yielded dialyzable polysaccharides composed of D-glucose and D-mannose and nondialyzable polysaccharides containing various proportions of D-glucose, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, glucuronic acid, and glucosamine. Fractionation of II by precipitation with Cetavlon 2 ̆ 013 boric acid and by highspeed centrifugation yielded polysaccharides containing D-glucose, L-rhamnose, D-mannose, D-glycero-D-manno-heptose, L-glycero-D-mannose-heptose, glucuronic acid, <b>mannuronic</b> <b>acid,</b> and glucosamine. Analytical {{data on the}} various fractions indicated that these polysaccharides included an acidic glucomannan, a rhamnoglucan, and a heptoglucan. Polysaccharides of similar composition {{have been found in}} S. marcescens capsular and extracellular polysaccharides in an earlier investigation. Removal of the mucopeptide material from the cell-wall III left an insoluble polysaccharide residue composed of glucose and glucosamine units. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The alginate-like polysaccharides {{synthesized}} by Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida {{have been}} prepared from batch cultures grown with glucose and fructose as carbon substrates. Despite the different methods of catabolism of the two substrates and synthesis of the alginate precursors, both strains produced polysaccharides which were consistent in their composition of <b>mannuronic</b> and guluronic <b>acids</b> and {{in the frequency of}} occurrence of dimers of D-mannuronic acid. All preparations lacked homooligomeric sequences of L-guluronic acid and were highly acetylated (12 - 21 %). In all the culture conditions tested, polysaccharide production was growthassociated and maximum M, was obtained after 48 h growth; older cultures contained material of progressively lower M,. This was ascribed to the degradative activity of alginate lyases which were detected intracellularly in both species and are presumably released by cell lysis. At 72 h, alginate from P. putida grown on either substrate had an M, of only 34000 - 38500, whereas the product from P. fluorescens grown on fructose had an M, of 300000 and that from glucose-grown cultures an M, of 72000...|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of sodium alginate in salt-free solutions were studied by steady shear, dynamic oscillatory and extensional measurements. This biopolymer consists of <b>mannuronic</b> and guluronic <b>acid</b> residues that give a polyelectrolyte character. We applied the scaling theories and checked their accordance with polyelectrolyte behaviour for low concentrations with {{a shift to}} neutral polymer behaviour at larger concentrations. This nature {{was supported by the}} effect of the concentration on the specific viscosity, the relaxation times from steady shear and the longest relaxation times from small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) measurements. To analyze the extensional behaviour of the samples, we conducted a study of dimensionless numbers and time scales where filament thinning driven by viscous, capillary or elastic forces is at play. We conclude that an exponential filament thinning followed by breakup results in the best regimes that describe the experimental data. Besides, the data pointed out that alginate in salt-free concentrated solutions shows strain thinning of the extensional viscosity and chain rigidity, behaviours that cannot be inferred from the shear rheometry.

40|$|Pseudomonas syringae {{produces}} the exopolysaccharide alginate, a copolymer of <b>mannuronic</b> and guluronic <b>acid.</b> Although alginate has been isolated from plants infected by P. syringae, the signals {{and timing of}} alginate gene expression in planta have not been described. In this study, an algD: : uidA transcriptional fusion, designated pDCalgDP, was constructed and used to monitor alginate gene expression in host and non-host plants inoculated with P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000. When leaves of susceptible collard plants were spray-inoculated with DC 3000 (pDCalgDP), algD was activated within 72 h post-inoculation (p. i.) and {{was associated with the}} development of water-soaked lesions. In leaves of the susceptible tomato cv. Rio Grande-PtoS, algD activity was lower than in collard and was not associated with water-soaking. The expression of algD was also monitored in leaves of tomato cv. Rio Grande-PtoR, which is resistant to P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000. Within 12 h p. i., a microscopic hypersensitive response (micro-HR) was observed in Rio Grande-PtoR leaves spray-inoculated with P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 (pDCalgDP). As the HR progressed, histochemical staining indicated that individual bacterial cells on the surface of resistant tomato leaves were expressing algD. These results indicate that algD is expressed in both susceptible (e. g. collard, tomato) and resistant (Ri...|$|R
