50|$|A {{large number}} of grape {{varieties}} are grown in the Douro region, most of them local Portuguese grapes. For a long time, the grape varieties grown in the Douro were not very well studied. Vineyards of <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation</b> were the norm, {{and most of the}} time, the vineyard owners didn't know which grape varieties they were growing. A pioneering effort were made in the 1970s which identified Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Touriga Franca, Tinta Cão and Tinta Barroca as the prime dark-skinned grape varieties. Tinta Amarela and the teinturier Sousão has later come to be included among the varieties that attract the most interest. This work was important for creating the new wave of top Douro wines and has also led to a greater focus on the grape varieties that go into Port wine. Most top quintas now replant with single-variety vineyards and focus on a limited number of varieties, but older, mixed vineyards will remain in production for many decades to come.|$|E

The study, carried out for six years on sixteen year old plantations, compared three theses: pure common walnut plantation (pure common walnut); 50 % common walnut - 50 % Italian alder plantation; 25 % common walnut - 75 % Italian alder plantation. Beyond annual surveys of girth at breast height, total height, stem volume and biomass, several variables, useful to describe canopy and foliage characteristics such as leaf area index (LAI), leaf biomass and photosynthetic active radiation below the canopy, were recorded. Data collected allowed to compare growth at individual and whole stand level, to calculate the net assimilation rate (NAR) and to compare the growth efficiency of the three theses. <b>Mixed</b> <b>plantations</b> performed results significantly higher than the pure plantation in terms of growth, LAI and leaf biomass both before and after experimental thinning. With reference only to common walnut, growth in <b>mixed</b> <b>plantations</b> was higher than the pure plantation with differences ranging from + 40 % to + 100 %. More relevant differences among pure common walnut, 50 % common walnut and 25 % common walnut at canopy and foliage characteristics were observed, with LAI values of 1. 07, 3. 96 e 4. 35 m 2 m- 2 respectively. Results accounted for a general positive effect of Italian alder as accessory tree species on growth and efficiency of <b>mixed</b> <b>plantations,</b> mainly due to the good performances induced in common walnut trees. Such performances were enabled by the good ecological integration between the two species and by the positive effects of N-fixing activity of Italian alder.

40|$|Tree mono-plantations are {{susceptible}} to soil nutrient impoverishment and <b>mixed</b> species <b>plantations</b> have been proposed {{as a way of}} maintaining soil fertility while enhancing biodiversity. In the Solomon Islands, <b>mixed</b> species <b>plantations</b> where teak (Tectona grandis) is inter-planted with a local tree species (Flueggea flexuosa) have been used as an alternative to teak mono-plantations and are expected to increase soil microbial diversity and modify microbial biogeochemical processes. In this study, we quantified the abundance of microbial functional genes involved in the nitrogen (N) cycle from soil samples collected in teak, flueggea, and <b>mixed</b> species <b>plantations.</b> Furthermore, we measured soil properties such as pH, total carbon (C) and total N, stable N isotope composition (δ 15 N), and inorganic N pools. Soil pH and δ 15 N were higher under teak than under flueggea, which indicates that intercropping teak with flueggea may decrease bacterial activities and potential N losses. Higher C:N ratios were found under <b>mixed</b> species <b>plantations</b> than those under teak, suggesting an enhancement of N immobilisation that would help preventing fast N losses. However, inorganic N pools remained unaffected by plant cover. Inter-planting teak with flueggea in <b>mixed</b> species <b>plantations</b> generally increased the relative abundance of denitrification genes and promoted the enrichment of nosZ-harboring denitrifiers. However, it reduced the abundance of bacterial amoA (ammonia monooxygenase) genes compared to teak mono-plantations. The abundance of most denitrification genes correlated with soil total N and C:N ratio, while bacterial and archeal nitrification genes correlated positively with soil NH 4 + concentrations. Altogether, these results show that the abundance of bacterial N-cycling functional guilds vary under teak and under <b>mixed</b> species <b>plantations,</b> and that inter-planting teak with flueggea may potentially alleviate N losses associated with nitrification and denitrification and favour N retention. <b>Mixed</b> <b>plantations</b> could also allow an increase in soil C and N stocks without losing the source of income that teak trees represent for local communities...|$|R

Two fast-growing mangrove species of the genus Sonneratia, the native S. caseolaris and non-native S. apetala, have been widely used for mangrove reforestation in China; however their ability to sequester carbon is still unclear. The present study aimed to estimate the growth, carbon accumulation in biomass and carbon sequestration in sediments of these two species, in both mixed (50 % S. caseolaris: 50 % S. apetala) and monoculture plantations, in the intertidal zones of Shenzhen Bay, Guangdong Province, China. Twenty-five months of observation showed strong competition between the two species in the <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation,</b> with the native S. caseolaris outcompeting the non-native S. apetala due to a faster growth rate. Although S. caseolaris in the <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation</b> had lower carbon storage in biomass than in monoculture, carbon accumulation in sediment was higher in the <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation.</b> Thus, the relative advantage of the <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation</b> was in sequestering more carbon in sediment, as opposed to high carbon accumulation to biomass. These results indicated that the <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation</b> could be a good option for mangrove restoration and carbon sequestration of sediment. However, the two and a half years of this study may not indicate long-term trends, so more research on long-term species performance is essential for successful mangrove reforestation.

Cinnamomum camphora is thought to improve soil properties and health condition of P. massoniana; however, little information is available from mixed plantations of P. massoniana and C. camphora exposed to acid rain. Our objective was to examine soil chemical properties and growth traits of these two species in mixed plantations in the region. Methods We investigated soil chemical properties and above- and below-ground growth condition of a <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation</b> of P. massoniana and C. camphora in the Tieshanping Forest Farm of Chongqing City. We compared results with those from adjacent pure plantations of P. massoniana and C. camphora, which were planted {{at the same time}} as the <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation.</b> Important findings Compared with the pure P. massoniana plantation, pH values were greater in the humus and soil of the <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation,</b> contents of exchangeable Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + were higher, contents of exchangeable Al 3 + and H+ were significantly lower (p < 0. 05), the amount of fine roots of P. massoniana in the humus and soil was smaller (p < 0. 05), height of dominant trees of P. massoniana was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) and needle discoloration percentage of dominant trees of P. massoniana was higher (p < 0. 05). Growth characteristics of C. camphora were similar to those of the pure C. camphora plantation. This study suggested that although C. camphora ameliorated soil chemical properties, health of P. massoniana of the <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation</b> worsened, which might be caused by stronger competitive abilities of C. camphora. Therefore, the competitive advantage of C. camphora against P. massoniana should be properly controlled when establishing mixed plantations of P. massoniana and C. camphora for improving the health of pure P. massoniana plantations in the region...|$|E

Material and Methods : It was measured by total diameter, heartwood, bark thickness, several physical wood properties (green density, specific gravity, volumetric, tangential and radial shrinkage and moisture content) and wood color. Main results: The largest of this diameter are reached when S. saman is planted with E. cyclocarpum, E. cyclocarpum and Swietenia macrophylla and S imarouba glauca. Meanwhile the largest total diameter and heartwood in E. cyclocarpum was found when this species is planted with Dalbergia retusa. Heartwood percentage, bark percentage, and some physical properties are not affected when S. saman or E. cyclocarpum are planted with other species. However, parameters of wood color were affected mixture plantation of S. saman or E. cyclocarpum with other species. The lowest difference between wood from mixed plantations and wood from trees growing in native forests is produced when S. saman is mixed with E. cyclocarpum, but this last species is mixed with Hymenaea courbaril and produced wood with the lowest difference in wood color compared to trees growing in the natural forest.

We derived site index (SI) equations for ten priority species to evaluate performance and site preferences. Variation in SI of focus species demonstrated that there are strong species-specific responses to climate and soil variables.

40|$|Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is {{frequently}} planted as a monoculture, {{but it is}} also grown in <b>mixed</b> <b>plantations</b> with other native trees such as pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Both pine and oak form ectomycorrhizas that cover their roots and extend into the soil, facilitating tree water and nutrient uptake in exchange for photosynthetic carbon. Forming the interface between the soil and tree roots, mycorrhizal fungi are key drivers of biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and {{play an important role in}} the successful establishment of tree seedlings. They can, however, be susceptible to changes in the soil environment and in their hosts. Both environment and neighboring hosts affect how fungi colonize roots and may affect their host preference. Despite the importance of mycorrhizal fungi in forest ecosystems, little is known about the biodiversity and functional effects of mycorrhizal communities in mixed compared with monoculture plantations. Changes in mycorrhizal richness and composition can result in changes in functional groups with consequences for forest ecosystem stability and functioning. We compared pine mycorrhizas in eight <b>mixed</b> <b>plantations</b> of pine and oak and eight pine monocultures in two forests in England, and we investigated the main factors driving their taxonomic and functional composition. Geographical location and litter pH explained over 50 % of the variation in pine mycorrhizal communities. Different environmental factors affected taxonomic and functional composition across stands, indicating functional redundancy. Pine tended to associate with more fungi in the presence of oak, but the abiotic environment exerted a stronger influence than oak presence on pine mycorrhizal diversity...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{normally}} low content of organic matter found in sandy soils, it is responsible for almost the totality of cation exchange capacity (CEC), water storage and availability of plant nutrients. It is therefore important to evaluate the impact of alternative forest exploitation on the improvement of soil C and N accumulation on these soils. This study compared pure and mixed plantations of Eucalyptus grandis and Pseudosamanea guachapele, a N 2 -fixing leguminous tree, {{in relation to their}} effects on soil C and N stocks. The studied Planosol area had formerly been covered by Panicum maximum pasture for at least ten years without any fertilizer addition. To estimate C and N contents, the soil was sampled (at depths of 0 - 2. 5; 2. 5 - 5. 0; 5. 0 - 7. 5; 7. 5 - 10. 0; 10. 0 - 20. 0 and 20. 0 - 40. 0 cm), in pure and mixed five-year-old tree plantations, as well as on adjacent pasture. The natural abundance 13 C technique was used to estimate the contribution of the soil organic C originated from the trees in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer. Soil C and N stocks under <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation</b> were 23. 83 and 1. 74 Mg ha- 1, respectively. Under guachapele, eucalyptus and pasture areas C stocks were 14. 20, 17. 19 and 24. 24 Mg ha- 1, respectively. For these same treatments, total N contents were 0. 83; 0. 99 and 1. 71 Mg ha- 1, respectively. Up to 40 % of the soil organic C in the <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation</b> was estimated to be derived from trees, while in pure eucalyptus and guachapele plantations these same estimates were only 19 and 27 %, respectively. Our results revealed the benefits of intercropped leguminous trees in eucalyptus plantations on soil C and N stocks...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of vegetation on slope stability is well understood at the slope level but scaling {{up to the}} catchment level is still a challenge, partially {{because of a lack}} of suitable data to validate models. We tested the physical landslide model, LAPSUS_LS, which models slope stability at the catchment scale. LAPSUS_LS combines a hydrological model with a Limit Equilibrium Method model, and calculates the factor of safety of individual cells based on their hydrological and geomorphological characteristics. We tested two types of vegetation on slope stability: (i) coffee monoculture (Coffea arabica) and (ii) a <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation</b> of coffee and deep rooting Erythrina (Erythrina poeppigiana) trees. Using soil and root data from Costa Rica, we performed simulations to test the response of LAPSUS_ LS to root reinforcement, soil bulk density, transmissivity, internal friction angle and depth of shear plane. Furthermore, we modified the model to include biomass surcharge effect in the calculations. Results show that LAPSUS_ LS was most sensitive to changes in additional cohesion from roots. When the depth of the shear plane was fixed at 1. 0 m, slopes were not unstable. However, when the shear plane was fixed to 1. 5 m, the <b>mixed</b> <b>plantation</b> of coffee and trees stabilized slopes, but the coffee monoculture was highly unstable, because root reinforcement was low at a depth of 1. 5 m. Soil transmissivity had a limited impact on the results compared to bulk density and internal friction angle. Biomass surcharge did not have any significant effect on the simulations. In conclusion, LAPSUS_ LS responded well to the soil and vegetation input data, and is a suitable candidate for modeling the stability of vegetated slopes at the catchment level...|$|E
