Before they hung up, Rogers warned him, [...] "your tomorrow {{will not be the}} same". Conway thought the reporter was exaggerating, saying, [...] "I didn't appreciate the full extent of what was about to happen. Not even close." [...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke up the next morning, his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations. [...] "I did 10 interviews and had to have a colleague take <b>my</b> <b>class</b> that day," [...] said Conway.|$|E
500|$|An {{experienced}} theatre and serial director, Roger Michell {{was chosen}} to direct Persuasion, in {{what was to be}} his first feature film. As a young child, Michell had been an admirer of Austen's, which set him apart from his male classmates. [...] "I was the only boy in <b>my</b> <b>class</b> who took Austen as a special paper", he said. His attraction to Persuasion was based on his belief that it was Austen's most emotional and poignant novel, as well as her most autobiographical. [...] He described the work as an [...] "erotic love story which is full of sexual yearning". While directing, Michell sought to emphasise contrasts in Austen's story, seen for instance between [...] "the chilly formality of Kellynch Hall and the warm, wet feel of Uppercross". The Royal Navy was another point of interest, as officers like Wentworth would often have returned to society wealthy and full of stories. The director wished to depict the integration of cultures, as naval officers came back with [...] "an informality of behaviour and language which was in marked contrast to what was there before".|$|E

As a new faculty member, I have chosen to improve my teaching by first implementing collaborative learning exercises into <b>my</b> <b>classes.</b> The exercises I have used include in-class group problem solving, informal study groups, and group term projects. In this paper, I will detail the published benefits of collaborative learning that led me to use this in <b>my</b> <b>classes.</b> The introduction of collaborative learning exercises into my lectures has also brought a number of problems and fears including time constraints, the practical issues of forming groups in large classes, and the barrier students have towards working together. From the perspective of a new faculty, I will discuss the problems I have had implementing collaborative work into <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> and tips for avoiding and overcoming the problems I have encountered...|$|R

[...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and <b>my</b> <b>class!</b> And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E

[...] "How can this be right?" [...] He also added, [...] "There's class warfare, all right, but it's <b>my</b> <b>class,</b> the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning."

In 2004 Howard Dean stated, [...] "In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004.

These classes are methodology seminars which depend on a lecture class and which aim at putting into practice what is said in the latter thanks to a series of assignments: oral presentations, essays, reading commentaries and "fiches techniques" (i. e. sort of short essays on specific topics). All these assignments are typical of the IEP, and students there get so used to them that these assignments become too repetitive in the end.
