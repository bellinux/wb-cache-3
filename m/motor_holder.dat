2500|$|After driving only 300 meters, {{their car}} was ambushed by hidden German machine guns {{on both sides}} of the Amiens-Saint-Quentin Road (...) [...] Before Holder could turn the car around, German fire {{disabled}} its <b>motor.</b> <b>Holder</b> and Bolling took cover in separate shell holes, which were connected by a ditch that enabled Bolling to see Holder. [...] The fire of the machine guns lasted fifteen minutes, after which two German soldiers approached Holder's position. When one of them fired twice at the unarmed Holder crouching in his hole, Bolling shot and killed the German with his revolver. [...] The other soldier killed Bolling with two shots, one to the chest and the other to the head.|$|E
50|$|LaFayette was {{originally}} headquartered in Mars Hill, Indianapolis, Indiana and made luxury motor cars, beginning in 1920. LaFayette innovations include the first electric clock in an auto. In 1921, Charles W. Nash {{became president of}} LaFayette. Nash was already president of Nash Motors, but for a time the two brands remained separate companies, although Nash Motors was the principal LaFayette <b>Motors</b> stock <b>holder.</b> In the 20's rumors circulated about Pierce-Arrow merging with LaFayette, Rolls-Royce or General Motors.|$|R
50|$|While last year's finalist SC Leipzig was {{eliminated}} {{in the quarter}}finals by SC <b>Motor</b> Jena, title <b>holders</b> Aufbau Magdeburg reached the final again. Two quarter finals were decided on extra time, DDR-Liga side Chemie Halle forced a replay on Oberliga side Motor Zwickau in the quarter final and surprisingly beat Zwickau 2-0. Only in the semi finals was Halle's high stopped.|$|R
50|$|The early 1990s {{recession}} severely {{affected the}} company, especially in its main market, Europe. The difficult situation led to Groupe Pechiney to seek divest of Carbone Lorraine's stock. In 1995, Pechiney sold a 21 percent stake to Paribas Affaires Industrielles. Carbone Lorraine was starting {{the recovery process}} and in the following years strengthened its electrical components sector by purchasing UGIMAG and Dietrich of Germany, which converted it in the European leader in electric <b>motor's</b> brush <b>holders.</b> During the next years, {{the expansion of the}} company continued, with the acquisitions of ferrite magnet divisions of Philips and ITT-Automotive and the American corrosion resistant materials' manufacturer Autocosmos. At the same time, Paribas sold its shares and the company became independent, with a large percentage of its stock on free float. It expanded the size of its operations in the United States with the acquisition of Gould Electronics' electrical fuses division (1999).|$|R
2500|$|Driver {{registration}} {{was introduced}} in 1903 with the <b>Motor</b> Car Act. <b>Holders</b> [...] of the sulphur-yellow coloured document were entitled to [...] "drive a motor car or motor cycle". [...] The wording was changed in 1930 after which holders were allowed to [...] "drive or steer a motor car or to drive a motor cycle". Shortly afterwards, the document cover was changed to a dark red colour. Holders were for a period entitled to drive a vehicle of [...] "any class or description". Subsequent changes saw the document list precisely those vehicle types for which holders were licensed.|$|R
50|$|A 'Walk of Stars', {{similar to}} the Hollywood Walk of Fame, runs along the {{pavement}} on Broad Street. Ozzy Osbourne, of the Aston area of Birmingham, became {{the first person to}} be honoured when he had his brass star installed on 6 July 2007. Since then comedian Jasper Carrott, glam rocker Noddy <b>Holder,</b> <b>motor</b> racing commentator Murray Walker, the cast and crew of BBC Radio 4's The Archers, long serving Archers cast member Norman Painting and founding member of Black Sabbath, Tony Iommi have all been honoured on the street with a star. Other famous local people nominated to do the same include Frank Skinner, Cat Deeley and Duran Duran a group that {{at the start of the}} 1980s based themselves in the Rum Runner nightclub situated in Broad Street but which has subsequently been knocked down to make way for the Hyatt Hotel.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} the initial study in using ZA industrial solid wastes, as raw material for the manufacture of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) {{with the addition of}} carbon dioxide gas (CO 2). Materials - The materials used include: Solid Waste, Gas, Carbon dioxide (CO 2), HCl, sakarosa PP Indicator (Phenol Phtalein) The instrument used is a CO 2 gas cylinders, safety tubes, three-neck flask as a batch reactor, mixer, electric mixer <b>motor,</b> stative + <b>holder,</b> thermometer, regulator, electric heaters, Orifice meter, electric ovens, Furnace, Glass Beaker, Measuring cup, Balance Sheet analytic. The process of research to produce CaCO 3 with raw materials ZA industrial solid waste through 3 -stage process, namely process kaisinasi, hidratasi process and the process of carbonation. The results can be concluded that the products produced by the process of CaCO 3 kaisinasi, hidratasi and carbonation, the optimum conditions of high, namely 94. 1...|$|R
40|$|Peptide arrays, {{produced}} through {{combinatorial synthesis}} from amino-acid monomers, {{are an important}} tool for proteomic research. The arrays enable high throughput screening by exposing {{a large number of}} different peptide spots to a solution of target molecules. In particle based synthesis, the monomers are encapsulated into solid particles and deposited on the synthesis spots. The resulting spot density can be much higher than that of liquid based on-spot peptide synthesis. This dissertation presents the construction of a CMOS-chip based “printing system” that automatically prints monomer particles onto a glass slide for combinatorial synthesis of high-density arrays. The monomer particles (4 μm) are addressed onto the electrode pixels of a CMOS chip, and then printed onto a glass slide by using an electrical field. Afterwards, the particles are melted to release monomers for peptide synthesis. The printing system should print particles onto the slide with high reproducibility and homogeneity. This is achieved with high precision (μm) <b>motors,</b> a slide <b>holder</b> and 3 electrical contact sensors. For ideal printing result, the parameters including particle size, printing voltage, and printing distance are discussed. With printed particles, a peptide synthesis is performed, resulting in an array with 10, 000 spots per cm 2, which is 100 times more than with conventional method. Additionally, the advantage of the printing system is that the synthesis is not performed on the CMOS chip but on the regular glass slide, which is more chemically robust and suitable for biological applications...|$|R
40|$|Risk-taking {{behaviour}} {{has been}} identified as a possible explanation for the high incidence of motor vehicle crashes involving young male drivers. This study examines the extent to which differences in risk-taking behaviour explain the differential crash rates by age and gender. A random sample of 689 adults aged 17 - 88 were selected from <b>motor</b> vehicle license <b>holders</b> within randomly selected geographical areas across Queensland. Participants completed a questionnaire covering their attitudes towards driving behaviour and general risk-taking behaviour, selected demographic characteristics and self-reported history of road crashes as a driver. Univariate analysis showed that males scored higher means than females in driver aggression and thrill seeking and in their general risk acceptance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that males were twice as likely (OR 2. 46, CI 1. 59 - 3. 83) to have reported at least one crash as a driver compared to females and nearly three times as likely (OR 2. 88, CI 1. 84 - 4. 49) to have reported two or more crashes. Drivers aged 17 - 29 were also twice as likely (OR 2. 31, CI 1. 10 - 4. 19) to have reported at least one crash when compared to those aged over 50 years. When risk-taking behaviours were introduced into the logistic model the odds of males (OR 1. 70, CI 1. 29 - 3. 30) or 17 - 29 year olds (OR 1. 30, CI 0. 93 - 3. 91) being involved in at least one crash substantially reduced. An increased risk of a crash as a driver can, in part, be explained by the age and gender differential in risk-taking behaviour. The challenge for public health professionals is to determine suitable strategies to modify risk-taking behaviour in young or male drivers. No Full Tex...|$|R
