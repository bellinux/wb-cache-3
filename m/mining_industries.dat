5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Cornish mining {{industry}} went into decline, public opposition to the use of female and child labour in mines was rising. The Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act 1872 brought the mines of Cornwall under the provisions of the Mines Act 1842, which had previously applied only to coal mines, limiting the use of child labour in the mines and thus increasing costs. The Act prohibited women from working underground, which the bal maidens did not do, but it also forbade any child under ten from working in any mine, even on the surface. The passing of the Factory and Workshop Act 1878 drastically limited the use of female and child labour. The employment of children under 10 was banned outright, the maximum working hours for children aged 10–14 were drastically restricted, and women were banned from working over 56 hours per week. The sudden loss of cheap child labourers made the already weakened <b>mining</b> <b>industries</b> of Cornwall and West Devon even less profitable, and more than half the mines in the area went out of business in the following decade. Some bal maidens continued to work in surviving mines and in tin-streaming, but instability in the metal markets made what remained of the <b>mining</b> <b>industries</b> increasingly unviable. In the 1880s William Ewart Gladstone's Liberal government tried to ban female labour from mines altogether; although the Bill was defeated, the number of bal maidens continued to fall. At the 1891 census the number of working bal maidens had fallen to around half its 1850s–60s peak. By 1895 only 23 mines remained operational compared to 307 in 1873, and in 1901 Devon Great Consols, the last significant copper mine in Devon and Cornwall, closed. Electrification and the introduction of Frue Vanners at the surviving mines replaced most of the jobs still done by women, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few bal maidens remained in employment. With wartime shortages of raw materials and many younger men in the armed forces, some bal maidens were temporarily rehired to dress potash ore at a re-opened mine at St Austell, and to re-dress the existing spoil heaps of defunct mines for wolfram and arsenic.|$|E

The hog and pig industry generated $7 million and the cattle industry generated $4 million in sales (the 10th and 27th highest of Pennsylvania counties, respectively). The county's grain industry generated $1 million (the 35th highest of Pennsylvania counties). The county is the fourth most prolific poultry-producing county in Pennsylvania.

40|$|M. A. (Politics) Abstract: The Marikana massacre, {{together}} with the 21 -week long strike of 2014 in the platinum sector, put the hostile labour relations noticeable in the <b>mining</b> <b>industry,</b> particularly the platinum sector, under the microscope. The Marikana massacre was also sparked by what was seemingly a labour dispute. Beyond exhibiting existing hostile labour relations in South Africa’s platinum belt and the <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> as a whole, the two occurrences also indicate the prevalence of political risks. The <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> is a key industry {{in terms of the}} country’s economy. The platinum sector, in which the aforementioned events unfolded, is also a key sector. The <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> accounts for about 17 % of the private sector investment and {{a significant portion of the}} country’s exports. South Africa, being responsible for amounts exceeding 70 % of the world’s production, is the largest producer of platinum. The sector is also the largest employer within the <b>mining</b> <b>industry.</b> In addition, the platinum sector accounts for most of the <b>mining</b> <b>industry’s</b> income. The sector accounted for 29 % of the <b>mining</b> <b>industry’s</b> income in 2014, which was R 117 150 million of R 407 857 million. In 2015, the sector accounted for 22 % of the <b>mining</b> <b>industry’s</b> R 234 billion GDP. Considering the significance of both the <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> and the platinum sector and the hostile labour relations characterising the platinum sector, it was necessary to investigate the prevalent political risks in the <b>mining</b> <b>industry,</b> with particular interest in the platinum sector. The study only assesses four political risks ie labour relations, skills shortage, electricity constraints and the regulatory regime. These political risks are not exclusive to the <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> and the platinum sector. The study attempts to show whose actions are responsible for the proliferation of the risks...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The South African <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> {{has been}} a male {{dominated}} environment {{for a very long}} time. With changes in government policy and legislation, discriminatory laws forbidding women to work underground have been repealed and the <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> have since been trying to accommodate women. Unfortunately there is an imbalance to this general trend of increase shown by the consistently low numbers of female employees within the <b>mining</b> <b>industry.</b> It was far-fetched for management to perceive that women can ever {{play a role in the}} underground <b>mining</b> <b>industry.</b> Unfortunately the perceptions of management is having an enormous impact on the attitudes of the rest of the employees in this industry. This leads to discrimination in the <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> that will make it difficult for the women seeking financial stability. The whole <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> should learn to adapt to this idea of women in mining. Employing women in the mine is a challenge of the mindset of viewing mining as a men's world. The objective of this research was to determine the experience of women in the platinum <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> in South Africa as well as the impact that women entering the <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> could have on the mines in terms of the working conditions, harassment, physiological aspects, ergonomics, physical strength, discrimination etc. The research method for this article consists of a brief literature review and an empirical study. A qualitative design has been used on an availability sample (N = 14) females in the platinum <b>mining</b> <b>industry.</b> The qualitative research makes it possible to determine the subjective experience of women working in the platinum <b>mining</b> <b>industry.</b> The literature focused on previous research on the experience of women entering the <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> as an employee. vii The outcome of this research was that the male worker attitude and discrimination have an enormous impact on women that are entering the <b>mining</b> <b>industry.</b> One of the more difficult hurdles to overcome is the harassment that women need to deal with The women are also facing a huge challenge in terms of their physical strength not being adequate in order to perform up to a minimum of eight hours per day in the harsh working conditions including the ergonomics of the <b>mining</b> <b>industry.</b> Most of the women are entering the <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> for financial reasons in order to survive in the South f i c a n Economic environment of today. After a hard day performing these physical activities they need to face their responsibilities at home in order to manage a work-home life balance. Management need to start seeking solutions to make the <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> a more women free environment for example focussing on facilities for women. The fact that women were appointed into the mining environment covering traditionally male sectors, also speaks to a commitment to changing the face of the <b>mining</b> <b>industry.</b> Recommendations for future research were made.
