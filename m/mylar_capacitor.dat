40|$|For {{many years}} the {{standard}} weak-link, pulse-discharge capacitors for DOE systems have utilized either the dry-wrap-and-fill, buried-foil <b>Mylar</b> <b>capacitor</b> or the Flourinert-filled, extended-foil <b>Mylar</b> <b>capacitor</b> designs. New stringent system requirements demanded a low-inductance, weak-link capacitor with higher energy density than the dry-wrap-and-fill, extended-foil <b>Mylar</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The hoop-shaped requirement, so that vital components could be thermally protected inside the weak-link capacitor, made the Flourinert capacitor design too expensive, complex and impractical. The low-inductance requirement eliminated the standard dry-wrap-and-fill, buried-foil design. This paper discusses evolvement of the close-tap-pair {{design of a}} buried-foil capacitor, {{which resulted in a}} capacitor that met the volume, shape, inductance, and reliability requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{alignment}} of the stable electrical characteristics of film capacitors in the physical dimensions of ceramic and tantalum capacitors are discussed. The reliability of polycarbonate and <b>mylar</b> <b>capacitors</b> are described {{with respect to their}} compatibility with military specifications. Graphic illustrations are presented which show electrical and physical comparisons of film, ceramic, and tantalum capacitors. The major focus is on volumetric efficiency, weight reduction, and electrical stability...|$|R
40|$|There are {{applications}} of high-voltage, energy-storage, capacitors {{where it is}} desirable that the energy storage capability can be reliably and predictably negated in abnormal environments such as fire. This property serves as a safety feature to prevent events of unintended consequence. The present paper describes studies of the thermal response characteristics of a cylindrically wound, discrete <b>Mylar</b> film/foil <b>capacitor</b> design. The experimental setups that simulate fires will be presented. Three different heat input geometries were employed: uniform radial input, spot radial input, and axial input. Heat input was controlled via feedback system to maintain specific temperature ramp rates. Both capacitor voltage and current were monitored during the thermal excursion to ascertain the failure temperature, i. e. when the capacitor permanently shorts. Temperature of failure data is presented for the three heat input cases along with a statistical analysis of the results and application implications. The physics of failure will be {{described in terms of}} the thermal/mechanical properties of the Mylar...|$|R
