40|$|AIM: To {{delineate}} {{the mechanisms of}} renal vasocon-striction in hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), we investigated the expression of typeinositol 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate receptors (IP 3 R) of kidney <b>in</b> <b>mice</b> with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). METHODS: FHF was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in D-galactosamine (GalN) sensitized BALB/c mice. There were 20 <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> normal saline (NS) -treated group, 20 <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> LPS-treated group, 20 <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> GalN-treated group, and 60 <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> GalN/LPS-treated group (FHF group). Liver and kidney tissues were obtained at 2, 6, and 9 h after administration.

40|$|We {{conducted}} an in vivo {{study with the}} mouse model of Vibrio vulnificus infection to evaluate the efficacies of therapy with minocycline or cefotaxime alone and in combination. V. vulnificus was introduced subcutaneously into the area over the right thigh. The inoculum size ranged from 1. 0 × 103 to 1. 2 × 108 CFU from experiment to experiment but was constant for all animals in the same experiment. Antibiotics were given intraperitoneally 2 h after the bacteria were inoculated. In experiments 1 to 4, the standard dose for humans was used to treat the infection, while in experiment 5, five times the standard dose for humans was used to treat the infection. In experiment 1, with a small inoculum of 5 × 103 CFU, all <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the saline-treated control group and the cefotaxime-, minocycline-, and combined antibiotic-treated groups survived. In experiment 2, with a moderate inoculum of 1. 2 × 105 CFU, all the <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the three antibiotic-treated groups survived, while only two of nine <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the control group survived. In experiment 3, with a large inoculum of 8. 0 × 107 CFU, six of nine <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the combined antibiotic-treated group survived, while only one of nine <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the cefotaxime-treated group {{and none of the}} <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the control and minocycline-treated groups survived. In experiment 4, with a large inoculum of 1. 2 × 108 CFU, 8 of 20 <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the combined antibiotic-treated group survived, while none of the 20 <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the control group, the group treated with cefotaxime alone, and the group treated with minocycline alone survived. In experiment 5, <b>in</b> which <b>mice</b> were infected with a large inoculum of 6. 6 × 107 CFU and treated with five times the standard human dose of antibiotics, 10 of 12 <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the combined antibiotic-treated group survived, while only 4 of 12 <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the minocycline-treated group, 1 of 12 <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the cefotaxime-treated group, and none of the <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> the control group survived. In experiments 3 to 5, the difference in the survival rates between the combined antibiotic-treated and minocycline-treated groups was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). These results indicate that combination therapy with cefotaxime and minocycline is distinctly more advantageous than therapy with the single antibiotic regimen for the treatment of severe experimental V. vulnificus infections...|$|R

40|$|Members of the Toll-like {{receptor}} (TLR) family {{serve as}} pathogen sensors {{and participate in}} local autoimmune responses. This study found a correlation between glomerular injury and TLR expression by analysing BXSB/MpJ-Yaa (BXSB-Yaa) lupus model <b>mice.</b> <b>In</b> isolated glomeruli, the mRNA expression of several TLRs was higher <b>in</b> BXSB-Yaa <b>mice</b> than <b>in</b> healthy control BXSB <b>mice.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the expression of Tlr 8 and its downstream cytokines was markedly increased. <b>In</b> <b>mouse</b> kidneys, TLR 8 protein and mRNA localized to podocytes, and TLR 8 protein expression in the glomerulus was higher <b>in</b> BXSB-Yaa <b>mice</b> than <b>in</b> BXSB <b>mice.</b> <b>In</b> BXSB-Yaa <b>mice,</b> the glomerular levels of Tlr 8 mRNA negatively correlated with the glomerular levels of podocyte functional markers (Nphs 1, Nphs 2, and Synpo) and positively correlated with urinary albumin levels. Furthermore, the glomerular and serum levels of miR- 21, a putative microRNA ligand of TLR 8, were higher <b>in</b> BXSB-Yaa <b>mice</b> than <b>in</b> BXSB <b>mice.</b> The urinary levels of Tlr 8 mRNA were also higher <b>in</b> BXSB-Yaa <b>mice</b> than <b>in</b> BXSB <b>mice.</b> <b>In</b> conclusion, the overexpression of TLR 8 correlates with the progression of podocyte injury in glomerulonephritis. Thus, altered levels of urinary Tlr 8 mRNA might reflect podocyte injury...|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} eight {{iterations}} in the Naga series, {{not counting the}} redesigned versions, with release dates spanning from 2009 to 2016. The mice are, in order of release: the Naga, Naga Epic, Naga 2012, Naga Hex, Naga 2014, Naga Epic Chroma, Naga Chroma, and Naga Hex v2. All except the Naga Epic and the Naga Epic Chroma are wired and connected through a USB port. The Naga Hex and the Naga Hex v2 are the only iterations to have less than twelve buttons, with six and seven respectively. The Naga 2014 is the only <b>mouse</b> <b>in</b> the series to have a left-handed version. The colors of the mice vary.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a <b>mouse</b> <b>in</b> a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} low intensity white light irradiation on the retinas of mice. METHODS: Thirty C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were randomly divided into two groups. The number of the <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> each group was 15. The <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> experimental group received dark adaptation from 5 : 00 p. m. to 6 : 00 p. m.,and then exposed to LED white light from 6 : 00 p. m. to 7 : 00 p. m. everyday for a month. At 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 d after the beginning, we examed the histology of mice retinas, calculated the thickness of outer nuclear layer(ONL),inner nuclear layer(INL) and analyzed electrophysiology of mice. RESULTS:One month after experiment, compared to the control group, the latency of Rod-R a wave of the <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> experimental group significantly prolonged, the amplitude of Cone-R b wave of the <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> experimental group significantly decreased and the latency of b wave of the <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> experimental group significantly prolonged(P CONCLUSION: 100 lux low intensity white light could give rise to the impairment of the retinal functions <b>in</b> dark-adapted <b>mice...</b>|$|R
5|$|Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney {{developed}} an early interest in drawing. He took art classes {{as a boy}} and {{got a job as}} a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. With Ub Iwerks, Walt developed the character Mickey <b>Mouse</b> <b>in</b> 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Fantasia, Pinocchio (both 1940), Dumbo (1941) and Bambi (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful Cinderella (1950) and Mary Poppins (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{improvements}} in computing {{technology and the}} early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers, which would later be termed minicomputers, led to the loosening of restrictions regarding programming access to the computers. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), access to the TX-0 experimental computer was opened to students and employees of the university. This in turn {{led to the development}} of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect. The games created for the TX-0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and <b>Mouse</b> <b>in</b> the Maze, which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through. When the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer was installed at MIT in 1961, the community built a video game to showcase its abilities, Spacewar, which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP-1 systems and later on other mainframe computers.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, various {{computer}} games {{were created in}} the context of academic computer and programming research and for demonstrations of computing power, especially after the introduction later in the decade of smaller and faster computers on which programs could be created and run in real time as opposed to being executed in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate and graduate students and university employees, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer. These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students and university employees affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and Bob Saunders. The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and <b>Mouse</b> <b>in</b> the Maze, which used a light pen to set up a maze of walls for a virtual mouse to traverse.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2012, the Naga 2012 was released. Similarly to the Naga Epic, it came with {{interchangeable}} side panels. The Naga 2012 supported Razer's Synapse 2.0 software allowing all the buttons to be programmed and that information to be stored online. The other 2012 installment was the Naga Hex, the first <b>mouse</b> <b>in</b> the series to have only six programmable side-on buttons. Razer noted it was made for multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), such as League of Legends and Diablo 3, instead of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). In May of the same year, the Wraith Red edition was released. The only difference between the versions was the coloring. In March 2013, after the announcement of a partnership between Razer and Riot Games, a League of Legends style Naga Hex was released, with the only difference being the design and the change from a plastic to a matte surface.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: In a {{previous}} study, {{we showed that}} experimentally induced gastroduodenal-esophageal reflux <b>in</b> <b>mice</b> treated with a carcinogen can result in Barrett esophagus and Barrett-associated adenocarcinoma. Since we have shown that most Barrett-associated adenocarcinomas in human beings have lost the tumor suppressor gene p 27, we sought to determine whether cancer {{would be more likely}} to develop in p 27 knockout <b>mice</b> than <b>in</b> p 27 heterozygous or p 27 wild type mice. Methods: Three groups of mice were treated by esophagojejunostomy resulting in gastroduodenal-esophageal reflux and by a carcinogen (N -methyl-N -benzylnitrosamine) : group I (50 wild type), group II (45 p 27 heterozygous), and group III (50 p 27 knockout). The mice were killed 18 to 20 weeks after operation and studied macroscopically and histopathologically. Results: Barrett esophagus developed in 7 (14 %) <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> group I, 4 (8. 9 %) <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> group II, and 13 (26 %) <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> group III. Cancers developed in 30 (60 %) <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> group I, 31 (68 %) <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> group II, and 43 (86 %) <b>mice</b> <b>in</b> group III. Ten percent of the cancers in group I were adenocarcinomas, as were 16. 1 % in group II, and 23. 3 % in group III. The difference between rates of Barrett esophagus in groups I and II compared with group III was statistically significant (P =. 035), as was true of the cancer rates (P =. 006). The percentage of cancers that were adenocarcinomas was highest in group III, but not significantly different from groups I and II. Conclusions: This experimental mouse model of Barrett esophagus and Barrett- associated adenocarcinoma is similar to what occurs in human beings and may be useful in developing methods to inhibit malignant transformation of Barrett esophagus...|$|R
