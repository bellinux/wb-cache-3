5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev became the Soviet leader {{following}} the deposition and execution of Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes. As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared {{that the only way}} to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E

25|$|A lack of {{accurate}} data {{makes it}} difficult to document numerically the extent of the human losses suffered by Polish citizens during World War II. Additionally, many assertions <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> must be considered suspect due to flawed methodology and a desire to promote certain political agendas. The last available enumeration of ethnic Poles and the large ethnic minorities is the Polish census of 1931. Exact population figures for 1939 are therefore not known.|$|E

25|$|The union did strike, however. On November 1, 1979, 35,000 UAW workers (36 {{percent of}} International Harvester's workforce) at 21 plants in eight states—Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas—struck International Harvester at noon rather than accept the new work rules and {{mandatory}} overtime provisions. But McCardell was not alarmed, seeing the strike {{as a way}} to challenge the union's power in the workplace and as an opportunity to improve efficiency by regaining concessions the company had <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{recycling}} of PET will become cost-efficient only applying high capacity recycling lines {{of more than}} 50,000 tons/year. Such lines could only be seen, if at all, within the production sites of very large polyester producers. Several attempts of industrial magnitude to establish such chemical recycling plants have been <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> but without resounding success. Even the promising chemical recycling in Japan has not become an industrial breakthrough so far. The two reasons for this are: at first, the difficulty of consistent and continuous waste bottles sourcing in such a huge amount at one single site, and, at second, the steadily increased prices and price volatility of collected bottles. The prices of baled bottles increased for instance between the years 2000 and 2008 from about 50 Euro/ton to over 500 Euro/ton in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Pump-Type water {{consists}} of a - or 5-gallon non-pressurized metal or plastic container with a pump mounted to it, and a discharge hose and nozzle. Pump type water extinguishers are often used where freezing conditions may occur, {{as they can be}} economically freeze-protected with calcium chloride (except stainless steel models), such as barns, out buildings and unheated warehouses. They are also useful where many, frequent spot fires may occur, such as during fire watch for hot work operations. They are dependent on the user's strength to produce a decent discharge stream for firefighting. Water and antifreeze are the most common, but loaded stream and foam designs were <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Backback models exist for wildland firefighting, and may be solid material such as metal or fiberglass, or collapsible vinyl or rubber bags for ease of storage.|$|E

25|$|The first mutiny {{occurred}} in 1573, with the soldiers ultimately being paid off with 60 florins each, two further mutinies followed, freezing {{the progress of}} the Spanish campaign. Mutinies continued in 1575 and 1576, up until the death of the Army's commander, Requesens. The Army effectively collapsed, sustaining itself by extorting money and food from the local peoples – widespread fresh Dutch revolts recommenced, accompanied by a general outcry of 'death to the Spaniards'. The new commander in the Netherlands, Don John of Austria was unable to restore order, resulting in the Sack of Antwerp, a horrific event in which 1,000 houses were destroyed and 8,000 people killed by rampaging soldiers. The States General, influenced by the sack, signed the Pacification of Ghent only four days later, unifying the rebellious provinces and the loyal provinces with the goal of removing all Spanish soldiers from the Netherlands, as well as stopping the persecution of heretics. This effectively destroyed every accomplishment the Spanish had <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> ten years. Attempting to mollify the situation, Don John removed his Spanish troops from the country in 1577, before recalling them shortly afterwards when the political situation worsened again. The damage, however, had been done – the mutinies shaped the course {{of the rest of the}} Eighty Years' War.|$|E
25|$|In May 2016, Steven {{returns with}} Lauren and Louie after {{they learn that}} Jane is in {{hospital}} after being attacked by Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington), who also confessed to killing Lucy. Ian initially rejects Steven, but Steven says he is back to help and repair any damage he <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Ian accepts Steven's offer of driving him to the hospital. Steven and Lauren do not tell anyone that they are together but when Ian finds out, he throws them out. Ian eventually accepts Steven back into the family but Jane is wary of him. Steven helps Ian at his restaurant and impresses him with his sales skills. Sadly, Jane soon finds an unfinished credit card application in Lucy's name and accuses Steven. Steven admits being responsible because he realised Ian is struggling financially. Ian promotes Steven to restaurant manager. When the restaurant is burgled, it is revealed that Steven arranged it and sold the kitchen equipment to pay debts. Kyle Slater (Riley Carter Millington), an employee at the restaurant, realises Steven arranged the burglary, so Steven sends him on a training course, and he admits to Lauren what he did. Later, Kyle asks Steven for a pay rise, saying he has kept quiet about the burglary, but Steven refuses.|$|E
25|$|A modern beginner's bassoon is {{generally}} made of maple, with medium-hardness types such as sycamore maple and sugar maple preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of {{materials such as}} polypropylene and ebonite, primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons were <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The bore of the bassoon is conical, {{like that of the}} oboe and the saxophone, and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected {{at the bottom of the}} instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and tone holes are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the axis of the bore, which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with hard rubber along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also stained and varnished. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of metal, plastic or ivory. The joints between sections consist of a tenon fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.|$|E

500|$|Helvellyn. The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} the name dates from 1577, but early records are spelling variations of the modern name (such as Helvillon, Helvelon or Hell Belyn) rather than any help with the etymology. Various attempts to interpret the name have been <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Some, misled by the present spelling, thought the final syllable was the Welsh word llyn, [...] "lake". Richard Coates in 1988 proposed a Celtic derivation from the deduced Cumbric word hal, [...] "moorland", and velin, the Cumbric equivalent of the Welsh word melyn meaning [...] "yellow." [...] Hel is a Welsh word meaning to gather, drive or hunt.|$|E

500|$|Nickel {{had been}} removed from the cent over the {{objection}} of Pennsylvania industrialist Joseph Wharton, who had large interests in the metal; his congressman, Thaddeus Stevens, had fought against the act. [...] In 1864, Wharton published a pamphlet arguing for a coinage in which all coins less than ten cents would be made of a copper-nickel alloy with 25% nickel, just over twice the percentage which the cent had contained. [...] In March 1865, Congress passed legislation for a three-cent coin of that alloy, intended to retire fractional currency of that denomination. [...] Longacre furnished a head of Liberty for the coin resembling his other depictions of the goddess which he had <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 16 years; for the reverse he used the [...] "laurel" [...] wreath from the 1859 cent surrounding the Roman numeral III borrowed from the silver three-cent piece.|$|E
500|$|The monastery {{was damaged}} {{as a result}} of the 2011 Van earthquake. According to Ara Sarafian, [...] "parts of the main church collapsed, while other parts were {{significantly}} weakened. Old cracks got bigger, new ones appeared." [...] Turkish engineers reportedly inspected it and announced that they would commence restoration work in the spring of 2012. Sarafian wrote that [...] "such promises have been <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and one needs to be a little skeptical. The current state of the church makes such work much harder than at any time in the past." [...] He noted in a 2012 article that the local and provincial governments supported the preservation and restoration of the monastery. In October 2012, the artist Raffi Bedrosyan, who contributed to the restoration of the St. Giragos Church in Diyarbakır, stated that he had hoped to restore Varagavank and added that [...] "Both Ankara and Van agreed to launch the restoration project, but social and natural obstacles delayed the process.". In 2017 it was documented that the remaining stones of the monastery are torn down bu the authorities and local government to build a local mosque and other developments with them.|$|E
500|$|Livingstone {{intended}} to stand again as Labour {{candidate in the}} London Mayoral election, 2008, this time against Conservative candidate Boris Johnson. At {{the start of the}} campaign Livingstone took Johnson more seriously than many others were doing, referring to him as [...] "the most formidable opponent I will face in my political career." [...] Much of Labour's campaign revolved around criticising Johnson for perceived racist and homophobic comments that he had <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> although Johnson strenuously denied that he was bigoted. Livingstone also proposed that if he were to win a third term he would increase the congestion charge fee to £25 for the most polluting vehicles, while removing it for the least, and that he would also introduce a cycling scheme based on the Vélib' system in Paris. As part of his campaign, Livingstone highlighted that by 2008, the Metropolitan Police had 35,000 officers, 10,000 more than it had had in 2000, also highlighting statistics to indicate falling crime rates across the city during his Mayorship. Nevertheless, there had been a recent rise in gang killing among young people, with 27 teenagers having been killed in gang warfare during 2007, a statistic used by Johnson's campaign who emphasised the idea that a Johnson administration would be far tougher on youth crime and anti-social behaviour.|$|E

500|$|... "Coming Home" [...] is a downtempo {{hip-hop and}} pop song, that {{opens with a}} [...] "simple piano intro" [...] and a [...] "delicate vocal verse from Skylar Grey". It was written by Diddy, Skylar Grey, Jay-Z, J. Cole, and Alex [...] "da Kid" [...] Grant, and {{produced}} by Jay-Z and Grant. When speaking to Kid about what he wanted, Diddy said, [...] "I want a beat {{that makes me feel}} like a white man in a basement in Atlanta". Diddy later called [...] "Coming Home" [...] a gift from Jay-Z and Kid. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by EMI Music Publishing, the song was written in the key of D major with a time signature of common time and a tempo of 69 beats per minute. It follows the basic chord progression of GDBmFm. [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV noted that the concept and theme of the song were similar to events in Diddy's life, [...] "referencing mistakes he has <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and that he wants to put behind him." [...] Rodriguez also noted the song's tribute to The Notorious B.I.G, in the line [...] "I miss you, B.I.G." [...] The chorus features vocals from the group's female members, Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richard, as well as background vocals from fellow Bad Boy Records recording artist Cassie. The trio use a vocal range of A3A4. Grey also sings some of the vocals, predominately during the song's opening chorus.|$|E

Ironically, in May 2011, Jennifer Aniston started dating Justin Theroux, who guest starred in the episode, and they later married.

500|$|The free-associative [...] "Champion" [...] is {{primarily}} composed of motivational lyrics, but West also briefly {{touches on the}} strained relationship he had with his father–who divorced from his mother {{when he was just}} three-years-old–eventually reaching the conclusion that even with their ups and downs, in the end, his father was a champion in his eyes. West described [...] "Stronger" [...] as an [...] "emancipation", as he uses the song to vent his frustration over mistakes he has <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> He describes his tribulation's with music critics and media causing his return as a [...] "Stronger" [...] rapper, as the song title implies. [...] "I Wonder" [...] carries an introspective tone, retaining a chorus about finding one's dreams, while West uses the verses to describe the struggle a person experiences in determining the meaning behind their life and achieving those dreams. Inspired by watching Bono open stadium tours, West concentrated on speaking volumes without using too many words on the song and delivers his raps in an exuberant, staccato manner. Using the same vocal stylings, [...] "Flashing Lights" [...] tells the operatic narrative of man contemplating the complexities of a tragic relationship. [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothing" [...] serves as West's reflection on his fame and is characterized by bitter remorse and defiant self-awareness. West begins the song by expounding his conflicted feelings regarding wealth and desire, describing a compulsion to spend that overwhelms any and all other objectives in life. He ties this into his perceived overall inability to keep himself together even as he grows into an increasingly prominent figure in the public eye.|$|E
