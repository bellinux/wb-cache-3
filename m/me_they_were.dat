I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell <b>me</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
25|$|In 1946 {{he went to}} University of the Witwatersrand (more {{commonly}} known as Wits University) in Johannesburg {{with the help of}} a Government loan and grant, where he first befriended fellow students and future anti-apartheid political activists Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo. He joined the United Party and assisted in the 1948 election. However, as a result of the National Party victory, he was determined to become more active and was elected Chairman of the United Party branch at the university. He argued that the National Party's victory in 1948 was reversible and anyone who opposed them should concentrate on defeating them. In an interview in 1991, Schwarz said on the National Party victory that “To <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the people who had supported Germany during the war. As a young man, it was very objectionable to me that the very people I had been fighting against were the people that the National Party had supported.” He was also president of the university's ex-servicemen's league and chair of the Law Students Council. He stood as a candidate for treasurer of the Students Representative Council and refrained from voting for himself which he considered to be unethical. When the votes were counted, it was announced that Schwarz had lost by one vote.|$|E

500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to <b>me</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E

2500|$|Dave Vanian (David Lett), Captain Sensible (Raymond Burns) and Rat Scabies (Chris Millar) {{had been}} {{members of the}} band Masters of the Backside, which also {{included}} future Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde. Brian James (Brian Robertson) {{had been a member}} of London SS, who never played live, but in addition to James included musicians who later found fame in The Clash and Generation X. Scabies knew James through a failed audition as drummer for London SS. When the two decided to start their own band, with James on guitar and Scabies on drums, they invited Sid Vicious and Dave Vanian to audition to be the singer. Only Vanian showed up, and got the part. Sensible became the band's bassist, and the four called themselves The Damned. Chrissie Hynde would later write that [...] "Without <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> probably the most musically accomplished punk outfit in town".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his landmark runs on Animal Man and The Invisibles, Bolland has also produced lengthy runs on covers for Geoff Johns' The Flash (from roughs by series editor Joey Cavalieri) and the Batman anthology series , as well as assorted issues of Tank Girl (for original UK publication Deadline and the two subsequent Vertigo miniseries Tank Girl: The Odyssey and Tank Girl: Apocalypse), Superman, Green Lantern, Batman and many more, including a number of oneshots and miniseries for DC's offshoot Vertigo. Bolland is currently the cover artist on Vertigo's Fables spin-off Jack of Fables, replacing previous cover artist James Jean. Bolland's covers also appear on the DC/Vertigo trade paperback collections of Grant Morrison's Doom Patrol, although he only produced [...] "a couple" [...] of covers for the individual issues. He recalls that he [...] "turned in quite a few roughs, but, disappointingly for <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> often rejected," [...] previous cover artist Simon Bisley being [...] "a hard act to follow." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970s, Barbeau starred as Carol Traynor, the {{daughter}} of Bea Arthur's title character on the comedy series Maude, which ran from 1972 to 1978 (actress Marcia Rodd had originated the role of Carol in a 1972 episode of All in the Family, also titled [...] "Maude", alongside Arthur). [...] In her autobiography, There Are Worse Things I Could Do, Barbeau remarked: [...] "What I didn't know is that when I said [...] I was usually walking {{down a flight of}} stairs and no one was even listening to <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> just watching my breasts precede me." [...] During the last season of Maude, Barbeau did not appear in the majority of the episodes. In a 2009 Entertainment Tonight TV interview, Barbeau mentioned that she had good on- and off-camera chemistry with Arthur; she said that the two stayed close until Arthur's death on April 25, 2009. Barbeau and Arthur reunited on camera during a 2007 taping of The View, reminiscing about their long-running friendship and their years as co-stars on Maude.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the final}} day of the inquest held at the coroner’s court, Dacre and other Mail {{executives}} had lunch with Sir Paul Condon, then Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, [...] "who very eloquently told <b>me</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> as guilty as sin". Four of the five suspects had never provided any alibi for their whereabouts on the night of Stephen Lawrence's murder and they invoked the privilege against self incrimination to avoid giving evidence and exposing themselves to cross examination. The police believed that the alibi of the fifth suspect was unconvincing. The newspaper on 14 February 1997, under its headline asserted: [...] "The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us". No claim was issued and the newspaper received significant acclaim and opprobrium as a result. Two of the men featured on the Mail front page were convicted of Stephen Lawrence's murder in January 2012. Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian wrote of the development: [...] "He made an unlikely anti-racist campaigner, but there were few voices more critical in the demand for justice for Stephen Lawrence than Paul Dacre and the Daily Mail.|$|E

Shirley MacLaine appeared with me. Warren Beatty came out, too, {{and did a}} lot of fundraising for me. Helen Gahagan Douglas, a former California Congresswoman who was the first victim of Nixon's Dirty Tricks in the 1950 Senate race came out of retirement to fight hard for <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> with me from the beginning to the end." [...] On April 15, 1972, Barbra Streisand held a fundraising concert for McGovern at The Forum in Los Angeles {{in front of an audience}} of 18,000 people. [...] Seat prices ranged from $5.50 to $100, and the event grossed $300,000, but after the expenses of producing the show, McGovern's campaign was given only $18,000. [...] On June 24, 1972, Neil Young and Graham Nash backed by The Stray Gators released the single [...] "War Song" [...] as a single in support of McGovern's campaign, but it failed to make an impression on the charts or in airplay.|$|E

2500|$|Laudonnière {{then pushed}} {{on through the}} woods, where his party was {{increased}} the following day by that of the artist, Jacques Le Moyne. Wandering along one of the forest paths with which he was familiar, Le Moyne had come upon four other fugitives like himself. After consultation together the party broke up, Le Moyne going {{in the direction of}} the sea to find Ribault's boats, and the others making for an Indian settlement. Le Moyne finally, while still in the forest, came upon the party of Laudonnière. Laudonnière had taken the direction of the sea in the evident hope of finding the vessels Ribault had sent inside the bar. After a while the marshes were reached, [...] "Where," [...] he wrote, [...] "being able to go no farther by reason of my sicknesse which I had, I sent two of my men which were with me, which could swim well, unto the ships to advertise them of that which had happened, and to send them word to come and helpe <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> not able that day to get unto the ships to certifie them thereof: so I was constrained to stand in the water up to the shoulders all of that night long, with one of my men which would never forsake me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Love {{remembers that}} Capitol's working {{title for the}} album was Our Freaky Friends, and that the label planned the cover shoot at the zoo, with the animals {{representing}} the group's [...] "freaky friends". In May, the San Diego Union reported that the group [...] "came down from Hollywood to take a cover picture for their forthcoming album Our Freaky Friends.... Zoo officials were not keen about having their beloved beasts connected with {{the title of the}} album, but gave in when the Beach Boys explained that animals are an 'in' thing with teenagers. And that the Beach Boys were rushing to beat the rock and roll group called The Animals." [...] Asher remembered: [...] " [...] had some proofs of the pictures they'd done at the zoo, and he told <b>me</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> thinking of calling the album Pet Sounds. I thought it was a goofy name for an album – I thought it trivialized what we had accomplished." [...] Until arriving to the photo shoot, Jardine thought that [...] "pet" [...] referred to slang for making out ("petting"). Jardine also expressed disappointment with the chosen cover, believing it was [...] "crazy" [...] to go to the zoo, that [...] "the art department screwed up pretty badly on that one... wanted a more sensitive and enlightening cover." [...] Author Peter Doggett writes that the design was at odds with the increasingly sophisticated cover portraits used on releases by artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan over 1965–67. He highlights it as [...] "a warning of what could happen when music and image parted company: songs of high romanticism, an album cover of stark banality." ...|$|E

She began writing songs before entering Australian Idol, but stated that she had [...] "stopped and just did the projects I was told to do," [...] referring to her first two albums released through Sony BMG. Paulini had no songwriting credits on her debut album One Determined Heart (2004), and co-wrote only two tracks on her second album Superwoman (2006). In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Paulini revealed that she felt manufactured with her first two albums, saying: [...] "You kind of actually feel trapped because when they would ask you to make an album, they'd {{have a list of}} songs ready for you to choose from. It was like a massive list of just songs that other people have written that you can just kind of go, 'Oh yeah. I like that one. I like the sound of this.' It just didn't seem real. I mean, it wasn't real for <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> all great songs and written by awesome writers. But, they weren't my words and my experiences; I didn't feel like it belonged to me." [...] Paulini was heavily involved with the songwriting on her third album Come Alive (2015), having co-written all but two tracks on the album. She referred to Come Alive as her first real album as she took her time working on it, explaining that with [...] "this one, this is me.
