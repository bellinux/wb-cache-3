50|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>cutting</b> of the heather {{has been}} used in Europe, but it is {{important}} for the material to be removed to avoid smothering regrowth. If heather and other vegetation is left for too long, a large volume of dry and combustible material builds up.

40|$|Well-maintained lawns are {{comfortable}} and safe places for leisure activities and sports practice, {{and they also}} bring environmental benefits; for example, they reduce soil exposure to erosion and releases atmospheric CO 2, thus reducing the greenhouse effect. However, regardless {{of the purpose of}} use or the choice of the plant species to form the lawn, the highest costs involve cutting that is needed to keep the turfgrass at its appropriate height. Successive lawn cutting operations are necessary basically because of the vegetative and reproductive growth of turfgrass which, in Brazil, occurs mainly from October to March. Expenditures with successive <b>mechanical</b> <b>cuttings</b> have fostered the search of alternative procedures to keep lawn plants at appropriate height, {{such as the use of}} plant growth inhibitors, an increasingly interesting procedure. Since the use of this technology in Brazil is still at its early stage, the aim of this literature review is to examine aspects associated with lawn management by using growth inhibitors.

50|$|Advantages {{of laser}} cutting over <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting</b> include easier {{workholding}} and reduced contamination of workpiece (since {{there is no}} cutting edge which can become contaminated by the material or contaminate the material). Precision may be better, since the laser beam does not wear during the process. There is also a reduced chance of warping the material that is being cut, as laser systems have a small heat-affected zone. Some materials are also very difficult or impossible to cut by more traditional means.|$|E
50|$|Setralit {{production}} is two-staged. During {{the first step}} the raw material is being subjected to an aqueous ultrasonic procedure followed by washing and drying. During the second step of conditioning the so-cleaned Setralit-fiber is specifically threatened depending on its end use. In general this step is merely <b>mechanical</b> (<b>cutting,</b> grinding, fibrillating etc.), {{but it can also}} be combined with a thermal or chemical treatment. The term Setralit process means the combination of two (or more) manufacturing steps in a row. Decomposition of the plant fiber bundles leaves the basic physical properties of the elementary fibers unaffected; therefore Setralit is still identified as a natural fiber.|$|E
5000|$|Rancidification, {{the product}} {{of which can be}} {{described}} as rancidity, is the process which causes a substance to become rancid, that is, having a rank, unpleasant smell or taste. Specifically, it is the hydrolysis and/or autoxidation of fats into short-chain aldehydes and ketones which are objectionable in taste and odor. When these processes occur in food, undesirable odors and flavors can result. In some cases, however, the flavors can be desirable (as in aged cheeses). In processed meats, these flavors are collectively known as warmed-over flavor. Rancidification can also detract from the nutritional value of food, and some vitamins are highly sensitive to degradation. [...] Akin to rancidification, oxidative degradation also occurs in other hydrocarbons, e.g. lubricating oils, fuels, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting</b> fluids.|$|E

5000|$|In 1984 the 'Martindale Research Project" [...] {{was started}} by the University of Western Australia with a large grant from Sir James McCusker. This project {{encouraged}} the participation of local farmers and the Western Australia Department of Agriculture in the research and development. Farmers such as John Cook and Bob Wilson at Lancelin developed seeding and <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting</b> equipment that allowed tagasaste to be sown and managed cheaply by farmers on a broadacre scale. The Martindale Research Project resolved many issues relating to the agronomy, animal production and economics {{that resulted in a}} reliable package that farmers could adopt with confidence. The Western Australia Department of Agriculture also conducted trials on their Badgingarra Research Station and at Bob Wilson's farm at Lancelin. Local farmers and researchers formed the West Midlands Fodder Shrub Improvement Group. This later evolved into the Evergreen Group (http://www.evergreen.asn.au/index.htm), which expanded its interests to include a range of other shrubs, grasses and perennial legumes.|$|E
5000|$|Before the 19th century, hay {{was cut by}} {{hand and}} most {{typically}} stored in haystacks using hay forks to rake and gather the scythed grasses into optimal sized heaps [...] - [...] neither too large (promoting conditions that might create spontaneous combustion), nor too small, {{so much of the}} pile is susceptible to rotting. These haystacks lifted most of the plant fibers up off the ground, letting air in and water drain out, so the grasses could dry and cure, to retain nutrition for livestock feed at a later time. In the 1860s <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting</b> devices were developed; from these came the modern devices including mechanical mowers and balers. In 1872 a reaper that used a knotter device to bundle and bind hay was invented by Charles Withington; this was commercialized in 1874 by Cyrus McCormick. [...] In 1936, Innes invented an automatic baler that tied bales with twine using Appleby-type knotters from a John Deere grain binder; an improved version patented by Ed Nolt in 1939 was more reliable and became commonly used.|$|E
50|$|In {{the era of}} {{acoustical}} recordings (prior to {{the introduction}} of microphones, electrical recording and amplification), the earliest recording studios were very basic facilities, being essentially soundproof rooms that isolated the performers from outside noise. During this era it was not uncommon for recordings to be made in any available location, such as a local ballroom, using portable acoustic recording equipment. In this period, master recordings were made using a direct-to-disc cutting process. Performers were typically grouped around a large acoustic horn (an enlarged version of the familiar phonograph horn). The acoustic energy from the voices and/or instruments was channeled through the horn's diaphragm to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting</b> lathe located in the next room, which inscribed the signal as a modulated groove directly onto the surface of the master cylinder or disc. Following the invention and commercial introduction of the microphone, the electronic amplifier, the mixing desk and the loudspeaker, the recording industry gradually converted to electric recording, and by 1925 this technology had replaced mechanical acoustic recording methods for such major labels as RCA Victor and Columbia, and by 1933 acoustic recording was completely disused.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that laser cutting or <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting</b> of nonoriented electrical steel causes structural changes at the cutting edge, which finally affect the magnetic properties. During <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting,</b> plastic deformation appears in the zone near the cutting edge. On the contrary, laser cutting induces thermal stress due to temperature gradients within the material during processing, which finally also results in deterioration of the magnetic properties. The knowledge {{of the type of}} the deterioration mechanism and the degree of the deterioration of magnetic property deterioration mechanisms is important for designing electrical machines in terms of magnetic field and loss calculations. In this paper, the effect of cutting on the magnetic flux distribution for <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting</b> as well as solid state laser cutting is calculated and analyzed space-resolved using the data obtained from investigations by neutron grating interferometry. In addition, the resulting changes of magnetization behavior, i. e., the character of the B versus H curve, were studied. It will be demonstrated that the deterioration of the magnetic properties depends on the geometry of the parts at cutting. It is shown that the nature of the resulting spatial distribution of the magnetic flux is different for <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting</b> and cutting by laser. By <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting,</b> a drop of the magnetic flux in the region at the cutting edge appears. Through cutting by laser, the observed decrease of the magnetic flux B is observed over the total width of the strip. The decrease of B at cutting of small parts by laser is remarkably different at the cutting edges, which are opposite to each other. Finally, the observed magnetic behavior is correlated to the different character of the induced residual stresses by <b>mechanical</b> <b>cutting</b> and cutting by laser...|$|E
