40|$|Labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> {{are used}} to improve the {{connection}} between job seeker and job. They aim not only to get job seekers more quickly into new jobs but also {{to make a better}} quality match, getting the more appropriate worker into the right job. Done well, labor intermediation helps reduce short-term unemployment, reduce job rotation, reduce the cost of new hires, improve productivity and firm growth, and importantly, reduce job discrimination. For many years, labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> were embodied in a single national public employment service that varied in quality and investment. Today, we find a range of public and private <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> and a wider range of products and services, including those to link workers to training, self-employment, and social services. This policy brief first examines the characteristics of labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services,</b> then reviews key reform efforts in developed and Latin America and Caribbean economies, and lays out the principal institutional models or public/private configurations that can be found in these countries. It concludes by providing a series of recommendations and considerations for Latin American and Caribbean countries seeking to reinvigorate or reform labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services.</b> In particular, the policy brief offers some key considerations for adapting labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> to the realities of Latin American and Caribbean economies. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal taxation of {{two types of}} financial <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> (savings <b>intermediation,</b> and payment <b>services)</b> in a dynamic general equilibrium setting, when the government can also use consumption and income taxes. When payment services are used in strict proportion to final consumption, {{and the cost of}} <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> is the same across firms, the optimal taxes on financial intermediation are generally indeterminate. But, when firms differ in the cost of <b>intermediation</b> <b>services,</b> the tax on savings intermediation should be zero. Also, when household time and payment services are substitutes in transactions, the optimal tax rate on payment services is determined by the returns to scale in the conditional demand for payment services, and is generally different to the optimal rate on consumption goods. In particular, with constant returns to scale, payment services should be untaxed. These results can be understood as applications of the Diamond-Mirlees production efciency theorem.

We empirically analyze whether signaling {{works in the}} German market for insurance <b>intermediation</b> <b>services.</b> For this a signal must increase service quality and be easily identifiable by consumers so that it pays for intermediaries to spend the related costs. By using OLS and logit estimations we test whether intermediary type, reputational activities {{and a variety of}} signaling instruments work as credible signals. Our findings confirm the main hypotheses derived from signaling theory as to the poor working of market forces in markets for {{information services}}. Accordingly, public policy regulation is necessary to mitigate the resulting problems. signaling, insurance <b>intermediation,</b> information <b>services...</b>|$|R
3000|$|We {{extended}} the model by considering two job search channels, public and private, with endogenous search efforts in both search channels. In contrast to Fougère et al. (2009), we {{consider that the}} job offer arrival rate via the public channel to be endogenous since {{the features of the}} public labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> we are studying suggest that individuals need to allocate a complementary search effort to make effective a job offer. In this study, the job offer arrival rate depends on the individual’s search effort, the type of technology employed by the public labor mediation services, and the set of information used to match individuals to jobs. We consider an unemployed individual who does not receive any UI benefits and is actively searching for a job using both private and public labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services.</b> Unemployed individuals using public <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> are contacted and informed about job openings according to a Poisson process with endogenous rate s [...]...|$|R
40|$|Whether {{and how to}} tax {{financial}} <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> {{is unclear}} because individual preferences are not defined directly over financial services, but only over the goods that are consumed. <b>Intermediation</b> <b>services</b> facilitate consumption but do not directly provide utility. In this paper, we show how taxing goods alone (but not financial services) can be welfare preferred to taxing both goods and financial services on an equal-yield basis and at a lower rate in a general equilibrium model with transactions costs. This is consistent with Foley's (1970) and Hahn's (1971) well-known treatments of general equilibrium with transactions costs which suggest that the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics may not hold in such circumstances. Use of more <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> yields gains from trade, but reduces resources available for provision of other (consumption) goods. We explore the net effect first using a numerical example, and then using U. S. data, drawing out implications for policy...|$|R

In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{desirability}} of service trade liberlization {{in the presence of}} incompleteness of markets where there is both inter-spatial and intertemporal trade between countries. We use numerical simulation methods for insights and relate our discussion to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) in the WTO. We interpret the absence of intertemporal trade as an absence of <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> provided by both domestic and foreign service providers. For simplicity, we consider extreme cases where intertemporal <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> can only be provided by domestic providers, so that when intertemporal trade in services is not allowed, markets are not complete. To our knowledge, this type of models is not used in the trade literature as general comparative statics results are unavailable. We first consider the liberalization of trade in financial services in an inter-spatial and intertemporal model of two countries, and we show how services liberalization can be welfare worsening {{in the presence of a}} tariff on spatial trade in goods. We show that this can hold in an artificial world with no domestic financial services provider. We compare financial service trade autarky in which there is no <b>intermediation</b> to financial <b>service</b> trade liberalization which involves costless intertemporal intermediation provided by foreign service providers. We also consider a more complex (and realistic) world where costly <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> can be provided by both domestic and foreign providers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{liberalization of}} trade in both inter-temporal <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> and goods {{in a joint}} spatial-inter-temporal trade model. Joint multi-commodity spatial intertemporal models are not (to our knowledge) used in the trade literature as general comparative statics results are unavailable and (in the presence of incomplete markets) existence can also be an issue. Here we use numerical simulation methods. We first consider world with service trade autarky {{in which there is}} no domestic <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> provision, and service trade liberalization involves costless inter-temporal intermediation provided by foreign service providers. This simple treatment allows us to model service trade liberalization as removing period by period budget constraints for domestic consumers. In such a world, if nonzero tariffs apply to spatial trade we present an example showing how service trade liberalization can be welfare worsening. One implication is that negotiations on services in the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) need not be welfare improving if there are also ongoing tariff negotiations. We then expand the model to capture a more complex world where costly <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> can be provided by both within-country and foreign providers. We again illustrate how services liberalization can be welfare worsening. We finally discuss whether welfare worsening service trade liberalization is likely in a real-world situation of highly restricted services trade and considerably more open goods trade, and when services trade are around 1 / 3 of total goods and services trade as is often claimed from available global service trade data. ...|$|R

40|$|We examine {{underwriting}} {{fees for}} repeat issuers of new securities {{to determine the}} relation between loyalty to an underwriting bank and the fees charged. For a sample of offers over the 1975 - 2001 period, we find that loyalty is associated with lower fees for common stock offers, consistent with valuable relationship capital being built through loyalty. For debt offers, however, we document the opposite pattern, consistent with relationship capital not being as valuable. For both offer types, firms that graduate to higher quality banks face lower fees. Firms that {{are more likely to}} be switching banks to improve analyst coverage face high fees for common stock offers, but not for debt offers. Firms often have a primary investment bank, one with whom they have a long-term relationship and regularly use for underwriting new security issues to the public. The persistence of such bank-client relationships in a competitive market for <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> has been ascribed to “relationship specific capital ” by, among others, Rajan (1992) and James (1992).
