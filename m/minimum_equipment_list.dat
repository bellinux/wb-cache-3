25|$|Before the flight, {{the crew}} {{found that one}} of the two main power {{generators}} was defective since 6 September, and the mechanic who inspected the aircraft was unable to repair it. In the Norwegian jurisdiction an aircraft is only allowed to take off if it has two operable sources of power. Also the aircraft's <b>Minimum</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>List</b> required two operating generators. The first officer decided that he would run the auxiliary power unit (APU) throughout the flight so that the flight would have two sources of power and therefore be allowed to leave.|$|E
25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the thrust {{reverser}} for engine #3 (treated as a <b>minimum</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> item) because of technical {{problems with the}} thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the total air temperature sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's <b>Minimum</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>List</b> allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{almost all}} {{aircraft}} documentation in commercial aircraft cockpits is presented via hardcopy manuals. Several recent projects {{are aimed at}} eliminating all paper documentation in cockpits using electronic libraries. Electronic libraries encompass diverse information bases including aircraft system documentation, operations and procedures, checklists, maintenance logs, <b>minimum</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>lists,</b> maps and charts, and flight management information. These electronic libraries are envisioned to be embedded in the avionics so as to provide real time monitoring and display of information. Background issues are examined (motivation, information retrieval models, and preliminary designs) for the on-line presentation of aircraft systems documentation including operations, procedures, and checklists...|$|R

5000|$|Following another air {{disaster}} killing 13 {{people on}} 18 March 1998, Formosa Airlines was grounded until 1 April, {{as it was}} determined that the pilots had not complied with the standard operating procedure. The Saab 340 (registered B-12255) with eight passengers and five crew members on board crashed a few minutes into a scheduled passenger flight from Hsinchu to Kaohsiung, at 19:32 local time. During the pre-flight check, the pilots had noticed that several systems were unavailable, including the autopilot and electronic flight instrument system (EFIS). Violating the <b>minimum</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>list,</b> according to which the aircraft should have been considered to be in a non-flyable condition, the pilots decided to take-off nevertheless. In flight, the aircraft proved to behave in an unpredicted way, as the leading edges of the wings could not be kept at equal temperatures because of the failing bleed air supply, causing a loss of control.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{motive to}} use the iPad as a {{navigation}} tool is the practicality of the product. The iPad would replace about 25 pounds of paper charts used by pilots that include aircraft flight manuals, approach plates, navigation charts, policy manuals, <b>minimum</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> and taxi charts. Major airlines based in the United States are mainly paper based, which includes some who have fleets of 900 plus planes. This translates {{to a lot of}} paper in the form of charts that could be saved by the iPad. The switch to an electronic system would also make life easier on the pilot. No longer would pilots carry around a heavy flight bag. It would be replaced by the 9.5 inch by 7.31 inch 1.33 pound tablet. When used in conjunction with a specially designed strap, this small size allows them to be used in place of kneeboards. Flight planning is also made easier by the iPad. The pilot would be able to use one device to check everything from weather, other airport facilities and flight plans. All this makes a pilot's life a lot easier.|$|E
