5|$|Rivers {{introduced}} legislation {{to increase taxes}} on medical <b>marijuana.</b> Washington {{is one of only}} a few states that has legalized <b>marijuana</b> for both medical and recreational use. Recreational <b>marijuana</b> has a 25% tax for consumers. However, medical <b>marijuana</b> does not have any taxes. Rivers' legislation would also force medical <b>marijuana</b> clinics to obtain more permits and waivers.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to <b>marijuana,</b> given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, the large number of medical <b>marijuana</b> dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical <b>marijuana</b> law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to <b>marijuana</b> use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical <b>marijuana</b> laws, removed jail time for {{possession}} of small amounts of <b>marijuana,</b> and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale of <b>marijuana</b> outright. The factors which have led to this change are many, {{but some of them}} could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, and the potential for state financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although outright legalization for non-medical use of <b>marijuana</b> has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of drugs like <b>marijuana</b> and cocaine, but does not support jailing <b>marijuana</b> users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of <b>marijuana</b> for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical <b>marijuana</b> under federal law.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, two national-level legalization acts were {{proposed}} in Congress, the Regulate <b>Marijuana</b> Like Alcohol Act by Jared Polis (D-Colorado) and the <b>Marijuana</b> Tax Revenue Act by Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon).|$|E
5|$|Measure 91 was {{approved}} in 2014, legalizing non-medical cultivation and uses of <b>marijuana.</b> It followed perennial, unsuccessful efforts to legalize <b>marijuana</b> by ballot initiative, including in 1986 and in 2012 {{which made it}} to the ballot, but voters rejected.|$|E
5|$|On March 10, 2015, Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) {{proposed}} a new bipartisan medical <b>marijuana</b> bill for patients and veterans to access medical <b>marijuana.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{contemporary}} national political {{issues have been}} influenced by events in Massachusetts, such as the decision in 2003 by the state Supreme Judicial Court allowing same-sex marriage and a 2006 bill which mandated health insurance for all Bay Staters. In 2008, Massachusetts voters passed an initiative decriminalizing possession of small amounts of <b>marijuana.</b> Voters in Massachusetts also approved a ballot measure in 2012 that legalized the medical use of <b>marijuana.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1994, highway patrolmen found <b>marijuana</b> {{in his car}} near Waco, Texas. His {{requirement}} {{to appear in court}} prevented him attending the Grammy awards that year. While traveling to Ann W.

Nelson received six months probation.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Denver {{became the}} first major city in the U.S. to vote to make the private {{possession}} of less than an ounce of <b>marijuana</b> legal for adults 21 and older. The city voted 53.5 percent {{in favor of the}} <b>marijuana</b> legalization measure, which, as then-mayor John Hickenlooper pointed out, was without effect, because the city cannot usurp state law, which at that time treated <b>marijuana</b> possession {{in much the same way}} as a speeding ticket, with fines of up to $100 and no jail time. Denver passed an initiative in the fourth quarter of 2007 requiring the mayor to appoint an 11-member review panel to monitor the city's compliance with the 2005 ordinance. In 2012, Colorado Amendment 64 was signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper and at the beginning of 2014 Colorado {{became the first}} state to allow the sale of <b>marijuana</b> for recreational use.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, the United States Justice Department allowed {{recognized}} Indian Reservations {{to regulate}} cannabis laws within their reservation. The {{laws in the}} reservations are allowed {{to be different from}} state and federal laws. As with State and Territories, the Federal government will not intervene as long as the reservations regulate strict control over <b>marijuana.</b> Some domestic nations such as the Yakama Nation and the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council rejected the approval to allow <b>marijuana</b> on their reservation.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, Newsom {{released}} {{the final report}} of the Blue Ribbon Commission on <b>Marijuana</b> Policy, which he had convened with the American Civil Liberties Union of California in 2013. The report's recommendations to regulate <b>marijuana</b> were intended to inform a legalization measure on the November 2016 ballot. Newsom supported the resulting measure, Proposition 64, which legalized cannabis use and cultivation for California state residents who are 21 or older.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Mackey, {{the school}} counselor, is giving {{a drug and}} alcohol {{prevention}} lecture to the class, emphasizing that smoking, drinking, <b>marijuana,</b> and LSD are bad. He passes a sample of <b>marijuana</b> around the class so that the children can learn its smell, but it is never returned. As a result, Mackey is fired, and is later kicked out of his house, leaving him homeless. A desperate Mackey gives in to trying <b>marijuana</b> one night in an alley, and later, LSD. Soon enough, Mr. Mackey becomes a drug-addled hippie, and meets a female hippie, with whom he decides to get married. While on honeymoon in India, Mr. Mackey is captured and taken into rehab. Mr. Mackey emerges clean from rehab and is given his job back.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, 2013, Colorado {{representative}} Jared Polis introduced Ending Federal <b>Marijuana</b> Prohibition Act of 2013 (H.R. 499; 113th Congress), a {{bill that}} would decriminalize <b>marijuana</b> on the federal level, instead treating it as a substance to be regulated in a similar manner to alcohol.

5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, {{finding that}} {{cannabis}} grown within California for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit <b>marijuana.</b> Moreover, because the intrastate medical cannabis market {{contributes to the}} interstate illicit <b>marijuana</b> market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where California citizens are using medical cannabis in compliance with state law, those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities for violating federal law.|$|E
5|$|According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), {{cannabis}} {{is readily}} available in Oregon. According to a 2006 report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, in 20032004 Oregon {{ranked in the top}} fifth of states for cannabis usage in three age categories: 12 to 17, 18 to 25, and 26 and older. In 2005, while most states that had passed medical <b>marijuana</b> bills over the past decade saw <b>marijuana</b> use among teenagers decline faster than the national average (a 43% decrease), Oregon, Nevada, and Maine saw smaller decreases than the average.|$|E
5|$|An {{initiative}} {{seeking to}} legalize medical <b>marijuana</b> dispensaries {{appeared on the}} November 2010 ballot as Ballot Measure 74 where it was defeated with 56% of voters opposing the initiative.

5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as <b>marijuana</b> and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for <b>marijuana</b> is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Friedman also {{supported}} libertarian policies such as legalization {{of drugs and}} prostitution. During 2005, Friedman and more than 500 other economists advocated discussions regarding the economic benefits of the legalization of <b>marijuana.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gonzales v. Raich 545 U.S. 1 (2005) was a {{decision}} in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (6–3) that even where individuals or businesses in accordance with state-approved medical cannabis programs are lawfully cultivating, possessing, or distributing medical cannabis, such persons or businesses are violating federal <b>marijuana</b> laws. Therefore, under federal law violators are prosecuted because the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants the federal government jurisdiction to prosecute <b>marijuana</b> offenses, here defendants violation of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Oregon House Bill 3466, {{which would}} have recriminalized <b>marijuana</b> in Oregon, died. According to bill sponsor Jerry Grisham (R–Beavercreek), HB 3466 was meant to counter a {{circulating}} initiative petition called The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act of 1997, {{which would have}} allowed state liquor stores to sell <b>marijuana</b> and permitted hemp production for paper, fabric, oil, and protein. Taxes on these products would go to schools to replace funding allegedly lost by Measure 5. The petition was sponsored by a political action committee named Pay for Schools by Regulating Cannabis.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, nearly 20,000 people {{attended}} the third annual Hempstalk Festival at Sellwood Riverfront Park in Portland, Oregon. While organizers insisted smoking {{would not be}} tolerated, the smell of <b>marijuana</b> lingered {{in the air and}} some festival goers chose to consume various forms of cannabis foods. No festival attendees were arrested. Seattle Hempfest is an annual event in Seattle, Washington also attended by Oregonians, known as the world's largest annual gathering advocating decriminalization of <b>marijuana</b> for uses including but not limited to medicinal, industrial, and recreational. The 2008 Seattle Hempfest, which took place August 1617, set a new record with around 150,000 people in attendance.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a study {{conducted}} by , UC Davis, US Forest Service, and the Hoopa Tribe showed that fishers in California were exposed to and killed by anticoagulant rodenticides associated with <b>marijuana</b> cultivation. In this study, 79% of fishers that were tested in California were exposed to an average of 1.61 different anticoagulant rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants. A 2015 follow-up study building on this data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, that California fishers were now exposed to an average of 1.73 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and that nine more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of <b>marijuana</b> cultivation within fishers' home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from <b>marijuana</b> cultivation within the Sierra National Forest. Research showed that fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.|$|E
