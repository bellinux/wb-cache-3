50|$|Audits In January 2009, the Pennsylvania Auditor General {{conducted}} a performance audit on the district. Several findings {{were reported to}} the school board and administration. The auditors noted that Board members had failed to file Statements of Financial Interests {{in violation of the}} Pennsylvania Public Official and Ethics Act. In October 2013, the district was audited again. A violation of state law was found and reported to the School Board. In particular, the termination of a former superintendent, as well as, nonresidents students attending the district at no costs were cited. Additionally, the Board was criticized <b>for</b> approving retirement <b>packages</b> <b>for</b> a <b>former</b> Superintendent and two former principals totaling at least $690,466.|$|R
25|$|The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA) is an {{agreement}} between the government of Canada and approximately 86,000 Native Canadians who at some point were enrolled as children in the Canadian Indian residential school system, a system which was in place between 1879 and 1996.. The IRSSA recognized the damage inflicted by the residential schools and established a $2 billion compensation <b>package</b> <b>for</b> all <b>former</b> IRS students and, in particular, {{those who had been}} abused or otherwise harmed. The agreement, announced in 2006, was the largest class action settlement in Canadian history. As of December 2012 a total of $1.62 billion has been paid to 78,750 former students.|$|R

500|$|Upon {{leaving the}} presidency, Truman {{returned}} to Independence, Missouri, {{to live at}} the Wallace home he and Bess had shared for years with her mother. [...] Once out of office, Truman quickly decided {{that he did not}} wish to be on any corporate payroll, believing that taking advantage of such financial opportunities would diminish the integrity of the nation's highest office. He also turned down numerous offers for commercial endorsements. Since his earlier business ventures had proved unsuccessful, he had no personal savings. As a result, he faced financial challenges. Once Truman left the White House, his only income was his old army pension: $112.56 per month. Former members of Congress and the federal courts received a federal retirement package; President Truman himself ensured that former servants of the executive branch of government received similar support. In 1953, however, there was no such benefit <b>package</b> <b>for</b> <b>former</b> presidents, and he received no pension for his Senate service.|$|R
