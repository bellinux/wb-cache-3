40|$|This mixed methods study {{draws on}} Sensemaking Theory (Weick, 1995) and Activity Theory (Engeström, 1987) to {{understand}} how teachers experience <b>mandated</b> programs, curriculum, and other activities associated with large- and small-scale reform efforts. The complex nature of teachers' practice, as they are situated in this nexus of reforms, is a largely unexamined area {{in the field of}} education. Missing from the research literature is a study that explicitly combines these constructs in an examination of how teachers experience about <b>mandates.</b> Study participants included nine teachers at an elementary school in Southern California who had contrasting orientations toward teaching and learning, a range of teaching experience, and varying attitudes toward <b>mandated</b> change. Surveys, interviews, and questionnaires were used to examine how teachers conceptualized <b>mandates,</b> felt about <b>mandates,</b> perceived <b>mandates,</b> and talked about implementing them. The study yielded four findings. First, several factors play a role in how teachers define and interpret <b>mandates,</b> which leads to contrasting notions of what <b>mandates</b> are and which activities are <b>mandated.</b> Secondly, teachers approach their practice with agency. Thus, they tend to adapt <b>mandates</b> and have a strong desire for autonomy. Third, teachers tend to have negative attitudes toward <b>mandates,</b> as well as negative feelings associated with implementing <b>mandates.</b> As such, teacher's personal lives can be adversely affected. Finally, there are distinct features of <b>mandates</b> that teachers believe have positively and negatively impacted their practice: effective <b>mandates</b> have goals that were realized and fairly moderate rules, whereas ineffective <b>mandates</b> have goals that are not realized and strict or permissive rules. The {{results of this study suggest}} that teachers will thrive in environments in which they are allowed to express their autonomy. Conversely, if teachers practice in constraining environments, their professional identities and emotions may suffer. Therefore, administrators should create supportive environments, provide adequate resources, and encourage teachers to modify <b>mandates.</b> In addition, because there is so much variation in how teachers defined and thought about <b>mandates,</b> it is important that administrators clearly communicate their expectations and whether certain activities are <b>mandated,</b> especially as new <b>mandates</b> are introduce...|$|R

The <b>mandate</b> applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. Critics claimed that the <b>mandate</b> created a perverse incentive for business to keep their full-time headcount below 50 and to hire part-time workers instead. Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} full-time jobs increased by 2 million.

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>mandate</b> was to prevent the {{healthcare}} system from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high premiums for the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} <b>mandated</b> disclosure {{on the design of}} contracts and induced behavior in the presence of career concerns. We analyze the impact of two key properties of a <b>mandated</b> performance measure that is publicly disclosed: its sensitivity to the agent's effort and its informativeness about the agent's ability. We find that when the <b>mandated</b> measure is highly sensitive to the agent’s effort but the measure is relatively uninformative about the agent's ability, the agent's effort (and the firm’s output) will be higher and the pay-for-performance sensitivity will be lower relative to a scenario in which the measure is not <b>mandated.</b> In contrast, if the <b>mandated</b> measure’s informativeness dominates the measure’s sensitivity to effort, then effort is lower and the pay-for-performance sensitivity is higher in the <b>mandated</b> setting. We also characterize settings where a <b>mandated</b> disclosure would be desirable or not; variations arise because <b>mandated</b> disclosures can increase both effort and risk. Our results imply that <b>mandating</b> the public disclosure of performance measures, particularly measures that are relatively informative about ability but are difficult to influence through managerial effort, may have the unintended consequence of generating inefficiencies in firms' employment contracts. 1 1...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, federal {{corporate}} criminal enforcement policy {{has undergone a}} significant transformation. Firms that commit crimes are no longer simply required to pay fines. Instead, prosecutors and firms enter into pretrial diversion agreements (PDAs). Prosecutors regularly use PDAs to impose <b>mandates</b> on firms creating new duties that alter firms’ internal operations or governance structures. This Article evaluates PDA <b>mandates</b> to determine whether and when prosecutors can appropriately use them to deter corporate crime. We find that <b>mandates</b> can be justified. But, contrary to DOJ policy favoring <b>mandates</b> for any firm with a deficient compliance program {{at the time of}} the crime, we find that <b>mandates</b> should be imposed more selectively. Specifically, <b>mandates</b> are only appropriate if a firm is plagued by “policing agency costs”—in that the firm’s managers did not act to deter or report wrongdoing because they benefitted personally from tolerating wrongdoing or from deficient corporate policing. We show that this policing agency cost justification provides guidance on how to reform federal policy to make appropriate use of <b>mandates,</b> guidance which reveals that many <b>mandates</b> are inappropriate...|$|R
40|$|Federal {{laws and}} {{regulations}} sometimes require non-federal entities to expend their resources to carry out national policies. The Unfunded <b>Mandates</b> Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), enacted as Public Law 104 - 4, defines many of those requirements as federal <b>mandates.</b> The law aims to ensure that Members of Congress receive information about the potential effects of <b>mandates</b> as they consider proposed legislation and that federal agencies take information about <b>mandates</b> into account as they weigh proposed regulations. To that end, UMRA requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), at certain points in the legislative process, to assess the cost of <b>mandates</b> that would apply to state, local, and tribal governments or to the private sector; it also requires most federal agencies to estimate those costs and other effects {{in the course of}} promulgating regulations to implement such <b>mandates.</b> This report describes CBO’s role in assessing the impact of private-sector <b>mandates</b> during the legislative process and provides information about the private-sector <b>mandates</b> that have become law during the past decade...|$|R
