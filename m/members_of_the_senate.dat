5|$|Eventually, the {{purchasing}} power of Byzantine merchants became such that it could influence prices in markets as far afield as Cairo and Alexandria. In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> that is to integrate themselves with the ruling elite. This had an end {{by the end of}} the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more. Following that phase, however, the enterprising merchants bounced back and wielded real clout during the time of the Third Crusade.|$|E

Each Senator has one year-round administrative assistant, as well as a secretary who assists them during the legislative session. There is also an allowance given to help pay for district offices.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E

5|$|Hendrik Pieter Nicolaas Muller {{was born}} in Rotterdam (Netherlands) on 2 April 1859, as the third child and second son of Hendrik Muller Sz. and Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel. His father was a {{successful}} businessman based in Rotterdam and trading with Africa and the Netherlands East Indies. H.P.N. Muller's maternal grandfather, Abram van Rijckevorsel, was the doyen of the Rotterdam merchant community {{in the early part}} of the nineteenth century. Both his father and maternal grandfather were politicians as well, liberals who staunchly defended the principle of free trade, and both were at one time <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> of the States-General of the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In {{adopting}} Christianity as {{the state}} religion, Mieszko sought to achieve several personal goals. He saw Poland's baptism {{as a way of}} strengthening his hold on power, as well as using it as a unifying force for the Polish people. It replaced several smaller cults with a single, central one, clearly associated with the royal court. It would also improve the position and respectability of the Polish state on the international, European scene. The Church also helped to strengthen the monarch's authority, and brought to Poland much experience with regard to state administration. Thus, the Church organisation supported the state, and in return, bishops received important government titles (in the later era, they were <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> of Poland).|$|E

It consisted of the Governor {{and members of the}} Governor's appointed council. With slight variation, the body to meet in that form until 1776, when Maryland, now a state independent of British rule, passed a new constitution that created an electoral college to appoint <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> This electoral college was abolished in 1838 and members began to be directly elected from each county and Baltimore City. In 1972, because of a Supreme Court decision, the number of districts was increased to 47, and the districts were balanced by population rather than being geographically determined.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, Mulkey {{resigned}} the seat effective December 17, 1918, and McNary was then reappointed to the Senate on December 12, 1918, and took office on December 18, {{instead of taking}} office in January, when his term {{he was elected to}} would have started. Mulkey resigned in order to give McNary a slight seniority edge over other new <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> In 1920, former adversary Stanfield defeated incumbent Democrat George Earle Chamberlain for Oregon's other Senate seat, making McNary the state's senior senator. McNary won re-election four times, in 1924, 1930, 1936, and 1942, serving in Washington, D.C., until his death.|$|E
5|$|After the Union of Lublin, the Senate {{of general}} sejm of the Commonwealth became {{augmented}} by Lithuanian high officials; {{the position of}} the lay and ecclesiastical lords, who served for life as <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> was strengthened, as the already outnumbered middle szlachta high office holders had now proportionally fewer representatives in the upper chamber. The Senate could also be convened separately by the king in its traditional capacity of the royal council, apart from any sejm's formal deliberations, and szlachta's attempts to limit the upper chamber's role had not been successful. After the formal union and the addition of deputies from the Grand Duchy, and Royal Prussia, also more fully integrated with the Crown in 1569, there were about 170 regional deputies in the lower chamber (referred to as the Sejm) and 140 senators.|$|E
5|$|As Secretary Upshur {{accelerated}} the secret treaty discussions, Mexican diplomats learned that US-Texas talks were taking place. Mexican {{minister to the}} U.S. Juan Almonte confronted Upshur with these reports, warning him that if Congress sanctioned a treaty of annexation, Mexico would break diplomatic ties and immediately declare war. Secretary Upshur evaded and dismissed the charges, and pressed forward with the negotiations. In tandem with moving forward with Texas diplomats, Upshur was secretly lobbying US Senators to support annexation, providing lawmakers with persuasive arguments linking Texas acquisition to national security and domestic peace. By early 1844, Upshur was able to assure Texas officials that 40 of the 52 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> were pledged to ratify the Tyler-Texas treaty, more than the two-thirds majority required for passage. Tyler, in his annual address to Congress in December 1843, maintained his silence on the secret treaty, {{so as not to}} damage relations with the wary Texas diplomats. Throughout, Tyler did his utmost to keep the negotiations secret, making no public reference to his administration's single-minded quest for Texas.|$|E

5|$|Each of the 338 {{members of}} {{parliament}} in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the governor general, either {{on the advice of}} the prime minister, or if the government loses a confidence vote in the House. Constitutionally, an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election, although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October. The 105 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2015 election: the Liberal Party of Canada who currently form the government, the Conservative Party of Canada who are the Official Opposition, the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Lobbying {{is common}} in Annapolis; {{there are more than}} 700 lobbyists {{registered}} with the state. While lobbyists may spend freely on advocacy, they are limited in gifts to legislators and in their ability to contribute to campaigns. Ethics issues related to lobbyists and other matters are handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, a twelve-member committee that includes six Senators. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> may turn to either this committee or an ethics counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict. Members are encouraged to avoid conflicts of interest, and are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state. In addition to employment prohibitions laid out in the state constitution, members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government.|$|E
5|$|Once {{legislation}} is introduced, it is passed {{to one of}} the standing committees of the Senate. There are six such committees. As a whole, the Maryland General Assembly has fewer standing committees than any other state legislature in the United States. Each committee has between 10 and 15 members. Four of the standing committees deal primarily with legislation; the Budget and Taxation Committee, the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Judicial Proceedings Committee. The Chairs of these legislative committees have the power to determine whether their committees will hear a bill, and they therefore have significant influence over legislation. The Executive Nominations Committee manages the Senate's responsibility to confirm gubernatorial appointments and makes recommendations of approval and disapproval to the body as a whole. Lastly, the Rules Committee sets the rules and procedures of the body. It also has the power to review legislation that has been introduced {{by a member of the}} Senate after the deadline for submission, and decide whether to refer it to a standing committee or let it die. Along with serving on the Senate committees, <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> also serve on a number of joint committees with members of the House of Delegates.|$|E

5|$|The {{cases that}} were known in West Berlin {{provoked}} demonstrations among the population. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> inspected the crime scenes {{and spoke to}} the press as well as public audiences. Various groups, and also individuals, launched protest campaigns against the Wall and the shootings. The fact that Peter Fechter bled to death in plain view of the public without anybody being able to help him lead to spontaneous mass demonstrations, which in turn resulted in riots in the following night. West Berlin policemen and US soldiers prevented a storming of the Wall. Buses bringing Soviet soldiers to the Tiergarten where they were to guard the Soviet War Memorial were pelted with stones by protesters. The incident also lead to anti-American protests, which were condemned by Willy Brandt. In the ensuing time, loudspeaker cars were sporadically set up at the Wall, urging the GDR border guards not to shoot at refugees and warning them of possible consequences. As a result of the shootings, West German groups lodged complaints with the UN Commission on Human Rights. The non-partisan Kuratorium Unteilbares Deutschland (Committee for an Indivisible Germany) sold protest placards and lapel pins in all of West Germany against the border regime and its consequences. Initially, West Berlin's regulatory authorities gave fugitives covering fire if they were being fired at by GDR border guards. This resulted in at least one lethal incident on 23 May 1962, when the border guard Peter Göring was shot dead by a West Berlin policeman while firing 44 times at a fleeing boy.|$|E
