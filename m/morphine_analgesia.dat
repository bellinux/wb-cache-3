25|$|Morphine is a {{phenanthrene}} {{opioid receptor}} agonist– its main effect is binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptors {{in the central}} nervous system. Its intrinsic activity at the μ-opioid is heavily dependent on the assay and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a full agonist while in others {{it can be a}} partial agonist or even antagonist. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the μ-opioid receptors is associated with analgesia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Morphine is also a κ-opioid and δ-opioid receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with spinal analgesia, miosis (pinpoint pupils) and psychotomimetic effects. δ-Opioid is thought {{to play a role in}} analgesia. Although morphine does not bind to the σ-receptor, it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-pentazocine, inhibit <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia,</b> and σ-antagonists enhance <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia,</b> suggesting downstream involvement of the σ-receptor in the actions of morphine.|$|E

This study presents subgroup analyses from a large, randomized, multicentre, European study comparing the efficacy and safety of the fentanyl HCl iontophoretic transdermal system and <b>morphine</b> intravenous patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> for postoperative pain management. Methods The efficacy and safety of the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system and <b>morphine</b> intravenous patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> were evaluated for patients divided by surgery type, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status and type of anaesthesia used during surgery. Efficacy measures included a patient global assessment of the method of pain control (a rating of 'good' or 'excellent' was considered as a success rating) and mean last pain intensity scores in the first 24 h. Discontinuation rates and the incidence of adverse events were also evaluated. Results Numerically similar percentages of patients in most subgroups reported success on the last patient global assessment in the first 24 h for both the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system and <b>morphine</b> intravenous patient-controlled <b>analgesia.</b> Similar percentages of investigators reported success ratings on the investigator global assessment at the last assessment for both treatment groups regardless of surgery type, except for the knee surgery subgroup (fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system, 75 %; <b>morphine</b> intravenous patient-controlled <b>analgesia,</b> 95 %).

40|$|Introduction. Patients {{who have}} chronic renal disease present {{challenges}} to anesthesiologists {{because of the}} sequelae of the underlying disease. Postoperative pain is usually mild to moderate after renal transplantation and is a concern because of underlying co-morbidities and variable responses of the graft. Effective postoperative pain management contributes to a a successful outcome after renal transplantation. Methods. A retrospective study, based on the collected data from clinical process and registration of the acute pain unit. Results. During 2007 and 2008, 124 patients were transplanted with cadaver donor kidneys. The final sample included 55 patients, namely 67 % males and 33 % females, whose ages range between 15 and 75 years (average, 47. 23 years). Their American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4 in 71 % and 3 in 29 %. Analgesia during surgery used a fentanyl, paracetamol and morphine protocol (n 47) or fentanyl, paracetamol, morphine, and local anesthetic infiltration (n 8). The postoperative pain was quantified using a numerical rating scale (0 – 4) with mean value of 1. 07 on day 1, a mean value of 1 on day 2, and a mean value of 0. 67 on day 3. Postoperative <b>analgesia</b> with <b>morphine</b> patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> was used for every patient, combined with paracetamol in 89 % of cases. The average number of bolus demands was 60 with 26. 4 effective boluses, the mean total administered dose was 26. 6 mg.

40|$|Morphine {{has been}} and {{continues}} {{to be one of the}} most potent and widely used drugs for the treatment of pain. Clinical and animal models investigating sex differences in pain and analgesia demonstrate that morphine is a more potent analgesic in males than in females; indeed, we report the effective dose of morphine for female rats is twice that of male rats. In addition to binding to the neuronal mu opioid receptor, morphine binds to the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) on microglia. Morphine action at TLR 4 initiates a neuroinflammatory response and directly opposes <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Our recent studies demonstrate that administration of chronic morphine activates microglia within the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), a critical brain region for the antinociceptive effects of morphine, while blockade of vlPAG microglia increases <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia</b> and suppresses the development of tolerance in male rats. Despite increasing evidence of the involvement of microglia in altering morphine efficacy, no studies have examined sex differences in microglia within the PAG.

40|$|Background: Hydrostatic or {{pneumatic}} {{reduction of}} intussusception is an invasive procedure that is stressful {{and may be}} painful for a child. Resistance of the child may increase {{the duration of the}} procedure and decrease success rate of reduction. Analgesia can help to reduce pain, but not necessarily resistance. General anesthesia increases success rate of reduction. However, it requires the presence of an anesthesiologist, and may lead to anesthesia-related complications. Procedural sedation with esketamine could be a safe alternative.   Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare hydrostatic reduction using <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia</b> compared to procedural sedation with esketamine in terms of success rate, adverse events, and duration of reduction.   Methods: A retrospective case-cohort comparison study was performed with two groups of patients who had undergone hydrostatic reduction for ileocolic intussusception and received <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia</b> (n =  37) or esketamine sedation (n =  20). Until July 2013, reduction was performed after intravenously administered morphine. Hereafter, a new protocol for procedural sedation was implemented and reduction was performed after administration of esketamine. Cases were matched for age and duration of symptoms.   Results: No adverse events requiring intervention other than administration of oxygen were reported for either group. Success rate of reduction using esketamine sedation was 90 % vs 70 % using <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia,</b> risk ratio (RR) 1. 29, 95 % CI[0. 93 - 1. 77]. Recurrence rate using esketamine sedation was 10 % vs 15 % using <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia,</b> RR 0. 67, 95 % CI[0. 12 - 3. 57].

Our previous study {{has demonstrated that}} neuron-restrictive silencer factor represses mu opioid receptor (MOP) gene expression in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) via histone hypoacetylation-mediated mechanisms after peripheral nerve injury, thereby causing loss of peripheral <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Here, we showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as trichostatin A and valproic acid, restored peripheral and systemic <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia</b> in neuropathic pain. Also, these agents blocked nerve injury-induced MOP down-regulation in the DRG. These results suggest that HDAC inhibitors could serve as adjuvant analgesics to morphine {{for the management of}} neuropathic pain...|$|E
40|$|Morphine is a {{well-known}} μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and an efficient analgesic, but its long-term use inevitably leads to drug addiction and tolerance. Here, we show that specific inhibition of β-arrestin 2 with its siRNA lentivirus microinjected in mice periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) significantly improved both acute and chronic <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia</b> and delayed the tolerance in the hotplate test. The specific effect of β-arrestin 2 was proven by overexpression or knockdown of its homology β-arrestin 1 in PAG, which showed no significant effects on <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesia.</b> These findings suggest that specific siRNA targeting β-arrestin 2 may constitute {{a new approach to}} morphine therapy and other MOR agonist-mediated analgesia and tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Usual dosage of {{morphine}} (10 mg/kg) induces analgesia and ultra-low dose (ULD) {{of morphine}} (1 µg/kg); hyperalgesia, and C-fibers are also bearing µ-opioid receptors; here {{the importance of}} C-fibers on pain and morphine induced analgesia/hyperalgesia is questioned and investigated using pain evaluation methods and infant capsaicin treating for C-fibers lesioning. Wistar male rats (200 - 250 grams) were assigned to three categories i. e. control, sham (receiving neonatal capsaicin vehicle) and c-lesion (receiving neonatal capsaicin), each one with three groups (n= 7). They were injected intraperitoneally with single dosage of saline, 10 mg/kg or 1 µg/kg morphine, respectively. Thermal pain threshold was evaluated using the tail flick test before and 30 minutes after the injections. Chemical pain was assessed using the formalin test (FT) 30 minutes after the administrations. Results indicated that thermal (P < 0. 001) and chemical pains in both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of FT (P < 0. 05) were reduced in C-lesion animals. In the C-normal and C-lesion animals, 10 mg/kg <b>morphine</b> exerted <b>analgesia</b> both in thermal (P < 0. 001) and two phases of FT (P < 0. 01), {{but it was more}} potent in C-lesion animals (P < 0. 05). Although ULD of morphine in C-normal animals produced hyperalgesic effect in thermal and chemical pains (P < 0. 001), in C-lesion animals, it produced analgesia (P < 0. 05) at the neurogenic phase of FT. Results can raise the C-fibers involvement for a significant portion of nociceptive transmission, because C-lesioning potentiated <b>morphine</b> induced <b>analgesia</b> and eliminated ULD of morphine induced hyperalgesia. Therefore C and Aδ fibers can be involved in morphine analgesia; while, just C-fibers are possibly responsible for only presynaptically hyperalgesic/excitatory action of ULD in morphine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEpidural <b>morphine</b> in patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> regimens {{controls}} {{postoperative pain}} well but easily induces pruritus and other epidural morphine-related side effects. With 90 pregnant American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II females scheduled for elective cesarean delivery, {{the present study}} was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of patient-controlled antipruritus (PCP) use of intravenous nalbuphine-based regimens for attenuation of postoperative pruritus and related side effects in combination with epidural <b>morphine</b> patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> with regard to the quality of postoperative pain management. Patients were randomly assigned to two nalbuphine groups (5  μg/kg/hour, Group N 5 or 10  μg/kg/hour, Group N 10) and bolus dose of 1. 6  μg/kg for PCP or the control (normal saline) group. Comparable visual analog scale scores for rest pain at each measured time interval among the three groups demonstrated that adequate pain relief was offered; however, the cumulative dose of nalbuphine administered to the patients in Group N 10 attenuated the analgesic effect of epidural morphine in moving pain at POh 24 only. Fewer episodes and milder severity of pruritus were observed in patients in Groups N 5 and N 10 at all postoperative time intervals. Epidural morphine provided good postoperative pain relief but with incommodious side effects. In addition, intravenous nalbuphine not only attenuated the incidence of pruritus but also decreased total morphine consumption. In conclusion, intravenous administration of low-dose nalbuphine (5  μg/kg/hour) for PCP maintained analgesia produced by epidural morphine and offered low pruritus incidence...|$|R
