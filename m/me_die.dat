500|$|Returning to Studio A the {{following}} day, Dylan recorded his new song about fallout shelters, [...] "Let <b>Me</b> <b>Die</b> In My Footsteps". Other original compositions followed: [...] "Rocks and Gravel", [...] "Talking Hava Negiliah Blues", [...] "Talking Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues", {{and two more}} takes of [...] "Sally Gal". Dylan recorded cover versions of [...] "Wichita", Big Joe Williams' [...] "Baby, Please Don't Go", and Robert Johnson's [...] "Milk Cow's Calf's Blues". Because Dylan's songwriting talent was developing so rapidly, nothing from the April sessions appeared on Freewheelin.|$|E

500|$|The musicologist Suzanne Cusick {{writes that}} Monteverdi [...] "creat the lament as a {{recognizable}} genre of vocal chamber music {{and as a}} standard scene in opera... that would become crucial, almost genre-defining, to the full-scale public operas of 17th-century Venice". Cusick observes how Monteverdi is able to match in music the [...] "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" [...] {{in the text of}} [...] Ottavio Rinuccini. The opening repeated words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] (Let <b>me</b> <b>die)</b> are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as [...] "an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain". Ringer suggests that the lament defines Monteverdi's innovative creativity {{in a manner similar to}} that in which the Prelude and the Liebestod in Tristan und Isolde announced Wagner's discovery of new expressive frontiers.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Faith No More's {{previous}} albums, initial reception to King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime was mixed. Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a grade of C− {{and called it}} an [...] "archaic progressive-rock fusion, oddly {{out of step with}} the times". Al Wiesel of Rolling Stone gave it a rating of two stars out of five, saying [...] "one hopes that that last song's moving chorus– 'Don't let <b>me</b> <b>die</b> with this silly look in my eyes'– doesn't prove to be Faith No More's epitaph". Metal Hammer acknowledges that the album was met with [...] "crushing disappointment", but praised its diversity. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, was more favourable, calling it [...] "an utter triumph", adding that it was [...] "enigmatic, sarcastic, provocative and incisive". Spin magazine's Jonathan Gold rated the album 6 out of 10, praising its [...] "deftness" [...] and its [...] "burnished, jackhammer-sheathed-in-a-lubricated-condom presence", but feeling that its multiple genres were a distraction.|$|E
500|$|In January 1801, Benedict Arnold's health {{began to}} decline. He had {{suffered}} from gout since 1775, and the condition attacked his unwounded leg {{to the point}} where he was unable to go to sea. The other leg ached constantly, and he walked only with a cane. His physicians diagnosed him as having dropsy, and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition. He died after four days of delirium on June 14, 1801, at the age of 60. Legend has it that, when he was on his deathbed, he said, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>die</b> in this old uniform in which I fought my battles. May God forgive me for ever having put on another," [...] but this story may be apocryphal. Arnold was buried at St. Mary's Church, Battersea in London, England. As a result of a clerical error in the parish records, his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later. His funeral procession boasted [...] "seven mourning coaches and four state carriages"; the funeral was without military honors.|$|E
500|$|The final {{drama of}} {{recording}} Freewheelin occurred when Dylan {{was scheduled to}} appear on The Ed Sullivan Show on May 12, 1963. Dylan had told Sullivan he would perform [...] "Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues", but the [...] "head of program practices" [...] at CBS Television informed Dylan that this song was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society, {{and asked him to}} perform another number. Rather than comply with TV censorship, Dylan refused to appear on the show. There is disagreement between Dylan's biographers about the consequences of this censorship row. Anthony Scaduto writes that after The Ed Sullivan Show debacle, CBS lawyers were alarmed to discover that the controversial song was to be included on Dylan's new album, only a few weeks from its release date. They insisted that the song be dropped, and four songs ("John Birch", [...] "Let <b>Me</b> <b>Die</b> In My Footsteps", [...] "Rambling Gambling Willie", [...] "Rocks and Gravel") on the album were replaced with Dylan's newer compositions recorded in April ("Girl from the North Country", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Talkin' World War III Blues", [...] "Bob Dylan's Dream"). Scaduto writes that Dylan felt [...] "crushed" [...] by being compelled to submit to censorship, but he was in no position to argue.|$|E

500|$|In its operatic context the lament {{takes the}} form of an {{extended}} recitative of more than 70 vocal lines, delivered in five sections divided by choral comments. Some of the wording is prefigured in the immediately preceding scene in which the First Envoy describes Arianna's plight to a sympathetic chorus of fishermen. The lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Cusick draws attention to the manner in which Monteverdi is able to match in music the [...] "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" [...] in Rinuccini's text. The opening repeated words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] (Let <b>me</b> <b>die)</b> are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as [...] "an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain"; Monteverdi {{was one of the first}} users of this musical device. What follows, says Ringer, has a range and depth [...] "comparable to Shakespeare's most searching soliloquies". The words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] are followed by [...] "O Teseo, O Teseo mio" [...] (O Theseus, my Theseus"); the two phrases represent Arianna's contrasting emotions of despair and longing. Throughout the lament indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until the final iteration of [...] "O Teseo", after which a descending line brings the lament to a quiet conclusion.|$|E
500|$|... "Weight of the World" [...] was {{released}} as a promotional single in October 2007 exclusively in Colombia. [...] "Together Again", a track recorded for The Open Door which was later rejected, was made {{available as a}} free digital download on January 22, 2010, to benefit the United Nations Foundation for their recovery efforts following the Haiti earthquake. Lee spoke of the recording, [...] "I am deeply moved by the tragic loss and devastation in Haiti. We {{hope to be able}} to make a positive contribution to the UN's emergency response by teaming with the UN Foundation through our music." [...] The song {{was released}} as a digital download by online retailers on February 23, 2010; it peaked at number 86 on the Canadian Hot 100. In a 2004 interview with MTV News, Lee said she was composing music for the film , where its producers had offered her a small role; regarding this, the singer said, [...] "They were like, 'Do you want to do a cameo?' And I was like, 'Hell yeah! Let <b>me</b> <b>die.</b> I want to be somebody who gets murdered.' So I don't think that's going to happen." [...] It was later also revealed that the album track [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] was originally written for the film but was not included in it.

Reportedly, another track was completed for the movie, but was rejected due to its dark sound.|$|E
