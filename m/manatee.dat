5|$|The {{last of the}} sirenian {{families}} to appear, Trichechidae, apparently arose from early dugongids in the late Eocene or early Oligocene. It is a monophyletic taxa. In 1994, the family was expanded to not only include the subfamily Trichechinae (Potamosiren, Ribodon, and Trichechus), but also Miosireninae (Anomotherium and Miosiren). The African <b>manatee</b> and the West Indian <b>manatee</b> are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the Amazonian <b>manatee.</b>|$|E
5|$|The oldest <b>manatee</b> {{in captivity}} was Snooty, at the South Florida Museum's Parker <b>Manatee</b> Aquarium in Bradenton, Florida. Born at the Miami Aquarium and Tackle Company on July 21, 1948, Snooty {{was one of}} the first {{recorded}} captive <b>manatee</b> births. He was raised entirely in captivity, and died at the age of 69. Manatees can also be viewed in a number of European zoos, such as the Tierpark in Berlin, the Nuremberg Zoo, in ZooParc de Beauval in France, and in the Aquarium of Genoa in Italy. The River Safari at Singapore features seven of them.|$|E
5|$|The West Indian <b>manatee</b> {{has been}} {{upgraded}} from endangered to threatened. Collisions with boats and habitat loss are still its biggest threats.|$|E
5000|$|The Mighty <b>Manatees</b> is an American [...] "Dreadneck" [...] band {{based in}} Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Throughout a career {{spanning}} four decades the band {{has been known}} by many different names, including The <b>Manatees,</b> The Mighty <b>Manatees</b> Medicine Show, and Los <b>Manatees.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Manatees</b> {{occasionally}} ingest {{fishing gear}} (hooks, metal weights, etc.) while feeding. These foreign materials {{do not appear}} to harm <b>manatees,</b> except for monofilament line or string, which can block a <b>manatee's</b> digestive system and slowly kill it.|$|R
50|$|Some {{behaviors}} of African <b>manatees</b> provoke humans to hunt them. When <b>manatees</b> become tangled in fishing nets, they can damage them. People {{in countries such}} as Sierra Leone believe that killing the <b>manatees</b> to reduce the specie's size lowers the chances of the fishing nets requiring expensive repairs. In addition, African <b>manatees</b> can destroy rice crops by drifting into fields during the rainy season.|$|R
5|$|In Florida, the {{depression}} produced moderate winds near the coast, peaking at 51mph (82km/h) in Naples. As in Cuba, the system dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at 25inches (635mm) at Arcadia Tower. Large {{portions of the}} state reported totals in excess of 10inches (255mm) from {{the depression}}, with much of Sarasota County receiving over 20inches (510mm) of rain. The rainfall was classified as a 100-year flood in Sarasota and <b>Manatee</b> counties, where flooding reached 6feet (1.8m) deep in some locations. Officials in <b>Manatee</b> County {{declared a state of}} emergency in response to the flooding. There, about 3,000people were forced to evacuate their homes due to the flooding, some of whom left by boat. The flooding damaged about 50houses in and around Oneco. Due to the evacuations, no injuries were reported. The reservoir in <b>Manatee</b> County rose to over 39feet (11.9m), 4feet (1.2m) above normal, which resulted in officials opening floodgates to prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|On August14, about sixweeks {{after the}} flooding, President George H. W. Bush {{declared}} a major disaster area for Charlotte, DeSoto, <b>Manatee,</b> and Sarasota counties. The declaration {{allowed for the}} use of federal funding to assist {{in the aftermath of the}} system.|$|E
5|$|On June6, Governor of Florida Rick Scott {{declared}} a state of emergency for 34counties and also prepared to deploy 6,000Florida National Guard members, if necessary. All campuses of Seminole State College and University of Central Florida were closed on June6, while the University of South Florida closed all three of its campuses after 3:00p.m. EST. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, which spans across Tampa Bay, was closed on June6 due to high winds. In <b>Manatee</b> County, an elementary school in Holmes Beach closed for one day. School students in Pasco County were released early on June6. Boat ramps in Levy County were closed, while schools in Cedar Key and Yankeetown had an early release day on June6. Sandbags were available in several counties, including Alachua, Bradford, Citrus, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, <b>Manatee,</b> Marion, Pasco, Pinellas, St. Johns, and Volusia.|$|E
50|$|The play-by-play {{voice of}} the <b>Manatees</b> was Mark Fischel, with color analyst John Daley who was the {{head coach of the}} Jr. <b>Manatees</b> ice hockey program, with games carried on IRN.fm {{internet}} radio. The <b>Manatees</b> also received limited newspaper coverage in the Miami Herald, and nearby Ft. Lauderdale's Sun-Sentinel.|$|R
40|$|Florida <b>manatees</b> (Trichechus manatus latirostris) are a {{tropical}} species endemic at their northernmost habitat range within the southeastern United States. <b>Manatees</b> face a thermoregulatory requirement during winter months and follow a seasonal migration to warm water sources. To avoid cold stress syndrome (CSS), <b>manatees</b> utilize the warmth from artificial {{sources such as}} power plant discharge canals or natural sources such as artesian springs. Already endangered, this species nonetheless continually faces an ever-growing threat from human impact within these important locations. This paper reviews {{the past and present}} laws protecting <b>manatees</b> in Florida, chronicles the impacts <b>manatees</b> are facing presently and in the future, and details the increasing need for the application of protection from a management standpoint. With the correct management plan in place, <b>manatees</b> and humans can cooperatively coexist together in a shared environment...|$|R
50|$|The {{warm water}} in the river attracts large numbers of <b>manatees,</b> and Kings Bay, {{at the head of}} the river and the {{location}} of 28 of the springs, harbors approximately 350 <b>manatees</b> during the winter. Some biologists consider Crystal River to be the most important refuge for <b>manatees</b> in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Paralleling the coastline, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a light storm surge that peaked at 2.6feet (0.8m) above normal on Sanibel Island. In some locations, the surge rose rapidly, and, despite the unusual {{geography of the}} area, the levels varied only {{by as much as}} 9.8inches (250mm) than the predicted levels from the SLOSH model. The surge and waves caused minor beach erosion. Moderate to heavy rainfall fell across western Florida, peaking at 6.14 inches (156 mm) near Bradenton; the rainfall was beneficial after a very dry summer, though, because it fell quickly, even this amount of precipitation failed to relieve water restrictions across the area. The storm resulted in some flooding in its path, including some several homes in <b>Manatee</b> County, roadways, and two U.S. highways. Statewide damage totalled $3 million (1990 USD, $  USD), of which $1 million (1990 USD, $  USD) occurred in <b>Manatee</b> County.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck), including bats, giraffes, whales and humans. The exceptions are the <b>manatee</b> and the two-toed sloth, which have just six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine cervical vertebrae. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|The three extant <b>manatee</b> species (family Trichechidae) and the Dugong (family Dugongidae) {{are rated}} as {{vulnerable}} on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. All four {{are vulnerable to}} extinction from habitat loss and other negative impacts related to human population growth and coastal development. Steller's sea cow, extinct since 1786, was hunted to extinction by humans.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the African <b>manatees</b> that venture up the Niger River {{starve to}} death. At certain times each year, the Niger River dries up {{due to the}} hot {{temperatures}} and lack of rain. Many <b>manatees</b> migrate there during the rainy season. When the water dries up the <b>manatees</b> are unable to get to other bodies of water.|$|R
50|$|The Amazonian and Florida <b>manatees</b> are {{the only}} <b>manatees</b> known to vocalize. They have been {{observed}} vocalizing alone and with others, particularly between cows and their calves.|$|R
2500|$|During winter, <b>manatees</b> often congregate {{near the}} warm-water {{outflows}} of power plants {{along the coast}} of Florida instead of migrating south as they once did. [...] Some conservationists are concerned that these <b>manatees</b> have become too reliant on these artificially warmed areas. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is trying to find a new way to heat the water for <b>manatees</b> that are dependent on plants that have closed. The main water treatment plant in Guyana has four <b>manatees</b> that keep storage canals clear of weeds; there are also some in the ponds of the national park in Georgetown, Guyana.|$|R
5|$|All {{sirenians}} {{are protected}} by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to this, the four species are further protected by various specialty organizations. The Dugong is listed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on Migratory Species, and the Coral Triangle Initiative. In Florida, manatees {{are protected by}} the Florida <b>Manatee</b> Sanctuary Act of 1978, which implements actions such as the limitation or prohibition of watercraft speeds where manatees exist.|$|E
5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian <b>manatee,</b> face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian <b>manatee</b> deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, President of the United States Barack Obama {{issued a}} {{disaster}} declaration for Baker, Bradford, Citrus, Clay, Columbia, Duval, Franklin, Gilchrist, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lafayette, <b>Manatee,</b> Nassau, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, Suwannee, Taylor, Union, and Wakulla Counties of Florida. In Citrus County, total individual assistance of $127,000 was paid out to 140residents, including $112,000 in damage to housing. A total of 1,671applications for individual assistance were filed in Pinellas County, totaling $900,000.|$|E
50|$|Amazonian <b>manatees</b> are large, cylindrically shaped mammals, with forelimbs {{modified}} into flippers, no free hind-limbs, and {{the rear}} of the body {{in the form of a}} flat, rounded, horizontal paddle. The flexible flippers are used for aiding motion over the bottom, scratching, touching and even embracing other <b>manatees,</b> and moving food into and cleaning the mouth. The <b>manatee's</b> upper lip is modified into a large bristly surface, which is deeply divided. It can move each side of the lips independently while feeding. The general coloration is grey, and most Amazonian <b>manatees</b> have a distinct white or bright pink patch on the breast.|$|R
50|$|Based {{upon their}} behavior, Bauer et al. (2010) {{suggests}} that <b>manatees</b> may obtain the characteristic of pheromonal communication like their relative, the elephant. Some scientists (Rathbun, Reid, Bonde, and Powell, 1995) {{have observed that}} <b>manatees</b> form long periods of mating herds when wandering males come across estrous females, which indicates the possibility that males are able to sense the estrogen or other chemical indicators. <b>Manatees</b> also eat other manatees' feces; {{it is assumed that}} they do this to gather information about reproductive status or dominance indicating the important role chemoreception plays in the social and reproductive behavior of <b>manatees.</b>|$|R

5|$|Lobatus gigas {{lives at}} depths from 0.3–18m to 25–35m. Its depth range {{is limited by}} the {{distribution}} of seagrass and algae cover. In heavily exploited areas, the queen conch is more abundant in the deepest range. The queen conch lives in seagrass meadows and on sandy substrate, usually in association with turtle grass (species of the genus Thalassia, specifically Thalassia testudinum and also Syringodium sp.) and <b>manatee</b> grass (Cymodocea sp.). Juveniles inhabit shallow, inshore seagrass meadows, while adults favor deeper algal plains and seagrass meadows.|$|E
5|$|The depression, in {{combination}} with an upper-level trough to its west, produced heavy rainfall {{to the east of}} its path, peaking at 33.43inches (849mm) in Cuba and 25inches (635mm) in Florida. In Cuba, the rainfall destroyed hundreds of homes and caused two fatalities. In Florida, particularly in Sarasota and <b>Manatee</b> counties, the rainfall caused severe flooding. 4,000houses were affected, forcing thousands to evacuate. The flooding killed two in the state and was indirectly responsible for a traffic casualty. Damage in Florida totaled over $2.6million (1992USD, $4million 2009USD).|$|E
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The West Indian <b>manatee</b> and Dugong face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} to be exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African manatees can become stranded during the dry season when rivers and lakes become too small or dry up completely.|$|E
50|$|The zoo hosts a {{hospital}} for Florida <b>manatees</b> in which injured animals are rehabilitated {{with the intent of}} returning them to the wild. It is the only non-profit hospital in the world specifically dedicated to critical care for injured, sick and orphaned wild <b>manatees.</b> The zoo works in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the FloridaFish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to rescue, rehabilitate and release Florida’s endangered <b>manatees.</b> In 2012, Tampa’s Lowry Park Zoo was honored with a “Significant Achievement in North American Conservation Award” for its work with <b>manatees,</b> presented by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).|$|R
50|$|Tracking migrations is an {{important}} tool to better understand and protect species. For example, Florida <b>manatees</b> are an endangered species, and therefore they need protection. Radio tracking showed that Florida <b>manatees</b> may travel as far as Rhode Island when they migrate. This information suggests that the <b>manatees</b> may need protection along much of the Atlantic Coast of the United States. Previously, protection efforts focused mainly in the Florida area.|$|R

5|$|Coinciding {{with its}} {{classification}} as {{a tropical storm}}, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for {{the west coast of}} Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach, with a tropical storm watch declared from Keaton Beach northward to Saint Marks. An inland tropical storm warning was also issued for non-coastal and non-tidal areas of Charlotte, Citrus, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Lee, Levy, <b>Manatee,</b> Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, and Sumter counties. The passage of the storm resulted in an increased threat for rip currents, with officials recommending that swimmers stay out of the water until the storm leaves the area. A tornado watch was also posted for the southern portion of the state, though was dropped after the storm weakened.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, public schools and many private schools closed, Although no {{mandatory}} evacuations were ordered, multiple shelters were opened in schools and churches and government offices shut down in anticipation of Harvey's onslaught. Several counties issued a state of emergency. Residents prepared individually by, for example, securing boats and lawn furniture. Free sand and sandbags were {{made available to the}} general public and inmates filled bags for those physically unable to do so themselves. Officials at Lake <b>Manatee</b> began lowering the water level to help avoid flooding. In Hillsborough County the threat of the storm forced the cancellation of local football programs.|$|E
5|$|The Harbour {{porpoise}}, spectacled porpoise, Burmeister's porpoise, and Dall's porpoise are all {{listed on}} Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).
