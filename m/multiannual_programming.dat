40|$|Does the 2009 Stockholm Programme matter? This paper {{addresses}} the controversies experienced at EU institutional levels as to ‘who’ should have {{ownership of the}} contours of the EU’s policy and legislative <b>multiannual</b> <b>programming</b> in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) in a post-Lisbon Treaty landscape. It examines the struggles around the third multiannual programme on the AFSJ, i. e. the Stockholm Programme, and the dilemmas affecting its implementation. The latest affair to emerge relates to the lack of fulfilment by the European Commission of the commitment to provide a mid-term evaluation of the Stockholm Programme’s implementation by mid- 2012, as requested by both the Council and the European Parliament. This paper shifts the focus to a broader perspective and raises the following questions: Is the Stockholm Programme actually relevant? What do the discussions behind its implementation tell us about the new institutional dynamics affecting European integration on the AFSJ? Does the EU actually need a new (post- Stockholm) multiannual programme for the period 2015 – 20 ? And last, what role should the EP play in legislative and policy programming in order to further strengthen the democratic accountability and legitimacy of the EU’s AFSJ...|$|E
40|$|Farming {{activities}} can be assumed {{to be one of}} several driving forces which lead to continuous deterioration processes of tree and bush savannahs in the Kavango Region of northeastern Namibia. However, these farming {{activities can}} be assumed to be closely connected with securing subsistence needs of peasant farmers. In this context, the present study aims to a) empirically identify objectives of peasant farmers, b) quantify their most prevailing and other possible on-farm and off-farm activities, c) identify optimal farming strategies under important system constraints and their impacts on environmental and socioeconomic aspects and d) identify policyinduced changes to the previously identified optimal farming strategies. Results of this study are intended to a) serve as a solution point for similar problems in related ecological or economic systems and b) be relevant for policy makers to investigate policy impacts on peasant farming strategies. Chapter 2 addresses some major challenges of the Namibian economy. In particular, the agricultural sector and the peasant farming system of the Kavango Region are described. In this environment, agricultural activities are predominantly subsistenceoriented and embedded in a semi-commercial system of imperfect markets. The prevailing farmingsystem comprises of three major elements: a) crop production, b) livestock production and c) natural resource production. By a varying degree, all elements contribute to food security, cash income or domestic usage patterns. Hence, an important internal driving force which causes (over) usage or depletion of natural resources is the obligation to secure substantial living needs. This aspect is further discussed by giving an outline of a) environmental and socioeconomic threats as well as b) possible coping strategies. Chapter 3 illustrates the theoretical background of the present study by discussing two different methodological approaches. Peasant farmers in the research area can be as-sumed to be both producers and consumers. This aspect determines the first considered methodological approach. Several concepts of farm household (FHH) models reflect non-separability under specific assumptions and imply certain benefits and limitations. This study uses a FHH model which is primary based on Barnum and Squire. However, it is supplemented by features from Chayanov and Low. Economic farm activities are influenced by the natural resource base and vice versa. This aspect determines the second considered methodological approach. In order to reflect economic and environmental dynam-ics, bio-economic models (BEM) are wellknown tools. Hence, important facets of BEMs and their applications to various research tasks and areas are briefly outlined. This study develops a <b>multiannual</b> <b>programming</b> optimisation model (MAPOM) which is based on theories of FHHs and BEMs. MAPOM represents a typical village with two non-separable and non-interacting gender-specific FHH categories and includes some bio-physical features. Both FHH categories are equally equipped with several farm assets but follow different objectives. Utility is maximised for both FHH categories by consuming several goods and services which are generated by participating in different farm and off-farm activities. One major constraint which needs to be respected is food security. Biophysical dynamics are addressed by a) including rainfall in all on-farm production functions, b) updating the resource base each year and c) calculating a ‘native biomass loss’ index for each farming element. Chapter 4 consists of two parts which describe the data base of MAPOM. Primary data is predominantly obtained by a case study on farming systems (CSFS). Outcomes of the CSFS build the basis of all relevant parameter calculation processes (e. g. static input-output relationships). Moreover, a review of region-specific publications is supplemented to validate calculation outcomes and to fill data gaps. In a second part, this chapter de-picts the methodological approach of a traditional conjoint analysis (TCA). This method is used to identify objectives of peasant farmers. A brief outline of the research design is specified after a description of the theoretical foundation of TCAs and their applications in developing countries. Results of this analysis generated weighting factors for the arguments of the objective function used in MAPOM. Since these results showed some gender specifications, MAPOM distinguishes in this point between female and male-headed FHH. Chapter 5 presents the model framework and the mathematical model formulations. Generally, it embeds the previously determined static input-output combinations in dy-namic ecological and economic relationships, in terms of equations. These equations are specified for each farming element and off-farm activity in MAPOM. Moreover, the most important consumption patterns are outlined along with production functions. As an example, equations are specified for cattle dynamics, annual growth of native biomass and population dynamics. Linkages of the different farming system elements become apparent in exchange relationships specifically between livestock and crop production. In addition, attention is paid to the description of system-related constraints. They are imple-mented in MAPOM to mirror the prevailing conditions in the research area. A final section presents the development of the objective function. Chapter 6 illustrates the results of four different scenarios simulated by MAPOM. In general, all different farming elements and off-farm activities are represented to a varying degree in the optimal solution of the baseline scenario. Cattle production plays a minor role in optimal farming strategies. Results indicate that land and labour are limiting fac-tors. A trade-off between food security and native biomass conservation is apparent. To some degree, native biomass could be potentially conserved without tremendously threat-ening food security. Scenario 2 involves a modification of the cattlekeeping element in the objective function. Then, cattle production is slightly intensified at the costs of crop production activities. Simultaneously, overcompensations of nutrition requirements and potentials of native biomass conservation are reduced. Scenario 3 addresses the enforcement of a fee system for natural resources usage and considers an increased land endowment. Impacts of these changes on optimal farming strategies are rather small. However, in some cases farmers use even more land for cultivation, instead of conserving native natural resources. In a final scenario, weighting factors in the objective function are modified. Generally, average weighting factors (over both genders) are suitable to reflect optimal farming strategies of both genders to some degree. Contrarily, equal weighting factors underestimate or overestimate optimal production levels. Hence, they do not reflect actual native biomass destruction potentials. Results of all scenarios indicated that FHHs are highly attracted to labour-saving technologies or activities which demand little labour. Hence, family labour {{is one of the most}} prominent limiting factors. This factor might, however, be threatened in the future by several socioeconomic developments. Therefore, it seems to be of high relevance to promote labour-saving devices for the different farming activities of peasant farmers in the research area...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} is to make an {{international}} comparison of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Agencies, to show their similarities and differences. Methods: An e-mail questionnaire was sent to thirty HTA agencies internationally. Questions related to the structure of the agency, the relationship with health-related institutions, the prescriptiveness of the decisions taken, the main core and the modalities to spread the assessment, and the type of funding. Results: Twenty-four HTA Agencies answered the questionnaire: 25 percent in America, 4. 2 percent in Australia, and 70. 8 percent in Europe. Fifty-four percent of HTA Agencies are governmental institutions (83. 3 percent have central government funding), while 62. 5 percent have relationships with health-related governmental institutions. Of the agencies, 87 percent reported that their decisions are not prescriptive, while for 20. 8 percent and 8. 3 percent of them stated that this was the case totally or partially, respectively, especially for the governmental and American Agencies. Seventeen agencies (70. 8 percent) declared their work on <b>multiannual</b> <b>programs</b> (77 percent of the governmental HTA Agencies and 100 percent of the American ones). The assessments mainly addressed diagnostic procedures (85. 7 percent) and pharmaceuticals (25 percent). The most common way to disseminate results is by means of paper report (91. 7 percent), followed by the Internet (16. 7 percent), and seminars to expert audiences (12. 5 percent). Conclusions: The comparative analysis of HTA Agencies showed that governmental and American Agencies have a profound impact on the prescriptiveness of their assessment, and this could be linked to the fact that these types of Agencies work on <b>multiannual</b> <b>programs.</b> European and American HTA Agencies have many similarities in terms of type of assessment, funding, and dissemination of results.

40|$|Over {{time the}} success of {{business}} incubators has been questioned. There were observers who have noticed their beneficial effects (Haugen 1990), {{but there were also}} observers who have criticized the incubators and their impact, for example Cote (1991) who was highly critical with the incubators from Canada, funded by the government. Regarding the business incubators we should remember that the objectives of the incubators should be fully taken into account in evaluating their success. If the objective is to create new companies with a higher probability of success than a non-start-up incubator, then the criteria should be the long-term survival rates and the leaving moment from the incubator. On the other hand, if the objective of an incubator is to obtain profit as an independent entity, then the number of successful companies after leaving the incubator wouldn’t be an appropriate criterion for determining {{the success of}} the incubator.

40|$|Reviewed by Francisco MartinsTo achieve {{dependable}} real-time {{operation in}} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) we previously proposed a general technique based on non-parametric stochastic analysis. Such technique {{allows one to}} overcome the communication uncertainties that are intrinsic to wireless and dynamic environments, and to offer probabilistic real-time guarantees, by continually monitoring and adapting to environment conditions. An underlying assumption of the proposed technique is that the system can recognize changes {{in the state of}} the environment quickly enough, compared to the rate at which those changes occur. In this paper we effectively evaluate the validity of such an assumption, in WSNs based on the 802. 15. 4 networking standard. We present results from various simulation scenarios, as well as from a real network, and conclude that monitoring and adaptation can dependably provide probabilistic real-time guarantees in 802. 15. 4 -based WSNs, in the presence of realistic network dynamics.

40|$|The last <b>multiannual</b> Community <b>program</b> for the collection, {{management}} {{and use of}} data in the fisheries sector (Commission Decision 2008 / 949 /EC) stated the provision of precision levels and sampling intensities of the estimates at national level.

The cost-benefit analysis of a sampling program, besides addressing logistical and economic constraints, should deepen {{the potential of the}} tools currently available. This article proposes to test the calculation, provision and use in stock assessment of extensively collected precision parameters. First, sampling intensities and coefficients of variation of fisheries-dependent parameters are calculated using the COST software, a statistical tool specifically designed to quantify uncertainty in marine sampled data. Secondly, alternative ways are explored to provide precision parameters to the stock assessment coordinators by using InterCatch, the existing ICES web-based system to submit national data and compile international catch matrices. Finally, the incorporation of these precision parameters in the assessment model is tested, through a stock assessed by statistical assessment models (such as SS 3) which can account for sampling errors. Thus, {{it will be possible to}} quantify how errors in input data propagate through stock assessment models to affect harvest rules, and also to help identify the most cost-effective data collections that adequately support the advisory process...|$|R

The {{terms of}} {{reference}} for the meeting are given in section 2. 1. 27 experts from 16 Member States attended the meeting. PGECON is an operative meeting with a general aim to compare different approaches and to share different experiences. Participation is open to national experts involved {{in the implementation of}} the economic modules of the DCF. Attendance to the PGECON is expected to give useful inputs in improving the national sampling schemes. The main conclusions and recommendations from the meeting are given in the section n. 12. The meeting dealt with a broad range of issues considered relevant for the improvement of the collection of economic data and for the evolution of the DCF. A key topic for the meeting was the discussion on the revision of the data collection framework. This discussion considered both the general principles of the new Data Collection <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Program</b> (DCMAP) as well as the technical and operative issues of the new framework. PGECON discussed that for the economic modules of the DCF, a certain degree of flexibility would be advisable. This will allow to adjust the data requirements in terms of level of aggregation and to include additional variables if a specific scientific or political need emerges or to exclude variables when they turn out not to be needed. However, this flexibility should not exclude the necessity to also have stability in terms of the core of the economic data requirements. PGECON also addressed the issue of the level of aggregation of economic data. The present DCF requires the collection of economic data by fleet segment, by year and by supra-region. However, there seems to be several scientific fields where the availability of economic data at higher temporal, regional or activity-related level could be necessary. It was concluded that DCF fleet economic data should not be collected at less aggregated levels as it is not feasible to collect data at a level of resolution that fulfils all potential requirements. Rather these data should be disaggregated on the basis of other information (transversal variables) which is available at the required resolution. PGECON compared the methodologies used by the Member States attending the meeting in calculating the ecosystem indicator on “fuel efficiency of fish capture” and the variable “direct subsidies”. The aim of this comparative exercise was to attempt the definition of a standard methodology to calculate the ecosystem indicator and the direct subsidies. The Workshop on calculating capital value using PIM and definition of DCF variables, (13 th - 17 th June 2011) clarified some fundamental concepts related to the PIM methodology for the estimation of capital value and capital cost and illustrated some practical implementation of the approach. As a follow up of this workshop, PGECON carried out a comparison of the average prices per capacity unit and corresponding assumptions applied by the Member States attending the meeting.

40|$|Current field {{vegetable}} {{production in}} the Netherlands has difficulty {{to meet the requirements}} of the EU directives on water quality and to meet the market require¬ments on food safety, product quality and predictability. Therefore, a <b>multiannual</b> research <b>program</b> has been carried out to develop new soilless systems for field vegetables next to other outdoor horticultural crops. Profitability is a precondition for widespread implementation of these systems and to achieve a significant sustainability impact. This paper focuses on the potential of Deep Flow cultivation systems for vegetables to improve farm management and economics for growers. Results show that these crops give a yield increase on the soilless systems with respect to the soil bound system, mainly by faster growth and higher plant densities. At this moment, the cost prices for vegetables cultivated on this soilless system on a small scale are higher than conventional outdoor vegetables, because of the high capital costs for the soilless system in comparison with the costs for tractors and agricultural machinery and the higher energy requirement for water circulation. We expect that growers are able to make the system profitable for leek, lettuce and spinach by up scaling, optimization of production, mechanization and automation of the system. Product differentiation to high value market segments also offers perspectives to profitable systems, although the thus achieved cultivated area and sustainability impact on a national scale will be limited. The large investment costs in the systems may be a barrier for growers to change over to the soilless cropping system...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{prioritize}} {{an extended}} list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities {{to focus on}} the most relevant hazards in the food chain. METHODS: An evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. Scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). The scoring procedure was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. Independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. The zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. RESULTS: The following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli. A second group of "significant importance" included Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptosporidium parvum, Mycobacterium bovis, Echinococcus granulosus, Streptococcus spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Mycobacterium avium, Fasciola hepatica, Giardia intestinalis, and Rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. Applications: These results support food safety policy makers to establish the <b>multiannual</b> monitoring <b>program</b> of foodborne zoonoses. They also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. Principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Since 1990, the Dutch {{coastline}} {{is maintained}} within the ‘Dynamic Preservation’ program, {{according to which}} the coastline is maintained seawards from a reference line, mainly by applying nourishments. Research into {{the maintenance of the}} Dutch coast is continuous and causes the content of the coastline preservation program to change constantly since the initiation in 1990. In recent years, the switch was made from yearly nourishment programs to the use of <b>multiannual</b> nourishment <b>programs,</b> in which an interim nourishment planning is included for 4 years. Next to the nourishments following the ‘Dynamic Preservation’ program, ten large reinforcements were applied along the Dutch coast in the past decade according to the ‘Zwakke Schakel’ project. After reinforcement, the coastline at the ‘Zwakke Schakel’ locations needs continuous maintenance to remain at the desired position. The combination of the long term maintenance at the ‘Zwakke Schakel’ locations and the <b>multiannual</b> nourishment <b>program,</b> leads to a more or less fixed character of the nourishments program with recurring maintenance nourishments in each period. The question is to what extent also the adjacent coast is maintained by sediment transported from these recurring maintenance nourishments. A situation in which the adjacent coast can be sufficiently maintained by long term application of nourishments at the ‘Zwakke Schakel’ locations, would lead to an even more fixed character of the nourishment program. At this moment, knowledge on the contribution of sediment transported from beach nourishments to the maintenance of the adjacent coast is insufficient. The research presented in this thesis focusses on one case study. Along the coastal stretch between Scheveningen and IJmuiden, three distinct ‘Zwakke Schakel’ reinforcement nourishments were applied at Scheveningen, Katwijk and Noordwijk. At all locations the coastline was migrated seawards, with varying distances of 60 to 100 meters. The coastal stretch between Scheveningen and IJmuiden is part of the Holland coast and bounded by the breakwaters of the Scheveningen and IJmuiden harbours. Along the Holland coast, sediment transport is dominated by wave related processes wherein longshore transport is the most important sediment transport process. Gradients in longshore sediment transport are therefore an important cause of erosion and accretion. Results of the yearly measurements done along the entire Dutch coast already show a positive effect of the maintenance nourishments in the area. With a refined version of an existing Unibest-CL+ model the effect of the recurring maintenance is further assessed for the long term. In the model, the longshore sediment transport volumes and resulting coastline evolution are modelled for a timescale of 55 years, starting in 2006 before application of the ‘Zwakke Schakel’ reinforcement nourishments and including the effect of possible sea level rise of 0. 2 to 1. 5 cm per year. The model is validated by comparing transport quantities (volumes and gradients) and coastline development with real measurement results and results from earlier research. In order to maintain a positive coastline position along the adjacent coast, the autonomous erosion needs to be sufficiently compensated by the accretion related to the long term maintenance. At several locations in the area of interest initial erosion is expected, after which the erosional trend switches into a seaward migrating trend on the long term, partly under influence of the maintenance nourishments. This process is expected to occur at both Wassenaar (between Scheveningen and Katwijk) and Noordwijkerhout (north of Noordwijk) in the upcoming decades, although the inclusion of some uncertainty in amongst others sea level rise shows that it is unsure whether a positive development at Noordwijkerhout will really occur. The erosional trend at Bloemendaal and Zandvoort, close to IJmuiden, cannot be compensated by the sediment transported from maintenance nourishments. On the time scale of 55 years, the region of influence of the maintenance nourishments does not reach Bloemendaal and Zandvoort. The regions of influence of all ‘Zwakke Schakel’ maintenance nourishments are expected to cover the area from Scheveningen up to around 10 kilometres northwards from Noordwijk in 2060. Individual regions of influences are expected to reach a size of 15 to 24 kilometres up to 2060. Although in most cases the trends of coastline development within the regions of influence are expected to become positive on the long term, the coastline position itself may be located too much landwards due to the initial erosion. In order to solve this problem, additional (shoreface) nourishments need to be applied at Wassenaar and Noordwijkerhout. At both locations shoreface nourishments are already applied in the past decades, which supports the outcome of the model results. At Bloemendaal and Zandvoort, additional (shoreface) nourishments will surely be needed {{in order to maintain the}} coastline. KPP B&O Kus...|$|R

However, most of the cash transfer programs implemented and scientifically evaluated {{do not have a}} clear nutritional objective, which leads to a lack of evidence regarding their nutritional benefits. Methods/Design: The MAM'Out research project aims at evaluating a seasonal and <b>multiannual</b> cash transfer <b>program</b> to prevent acute malnutrition in children under 36 months, in terms of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in the Tapoa province (Eastern region of Burkina Faso, Africa). The program is targeted to economically vulnerable households with children less than 1 year old at the time of inclusion. Cash is distributed to mothers and the transfers are unconditional, leading to beneficiaries' self-determination on the use of cash. The study is designed as a two-arm cluster randomized intervention trial, based on the randomization of rural villages. One group receives cash transfers via mobile phones and one is a control group. The main outcomes are the cumulative incidence of acute malnutrition and the cost-effectiveness. Child anthropometry (height, weight and MUAC) is followed, as well as indicators related to dietary diversity, food security, health center utilization, families' expenses, women empowerment and morbidities. 24 h-food recalls are also carried out. Individual interviews and focus group discussions allow collecting qualitative data. Finally, based on a theory framework built a priori, the pathways used by the cash to {{have an effect on the}} prevention of under-nutrition will be assessed. Discussion: The design chosen will lead to a robust assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed intervention. Several challenges appeared while implementing the study and discrepancies with the research protocol, mainly due to unforeseen events, can be highlighted, such as delay in project implementation, switch to e-data collection and implementation of a supervision process...|$|R
