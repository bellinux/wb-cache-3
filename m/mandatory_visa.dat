The focus varies according to the country of origin of the individual, whether it lies within the European Economic Community, whether it is a country with which the European Union has co-operation and association agreements or finally, whether it is under the general regime. The utilitarian perspective which considers immigration as necessary manual labour has justified more efficient legal mechanisms to facilitate the employment of immigrant manual workers. These mechanisms do not apply to self-employed workers. The lack of interest of legislators in this type of worker is highlighted by the suppression of motivation and refusal of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>visa.</b> The detailed analysis of the anticipated administrative requirements emphasises that within the labour legislation for immigrants there is a marked difference between those who work for an employer and those who are self-employed and there is no correspondence or comparison with the more far reaching policies of the labour doctrine with regard to the rights and guarantees of both categories of workers...|$|E

40|$|Background: In Australia, {{temporary}} visa holders are {{ineligible for}} Medicare and subsidised antiretroviral drugs. Additionally, HIV testing is not <b>mandatory</b> for <b>visas</b> unless applicants seek {{work in the}} health sector. We sought to understand the impact of HIV and issues of access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people holding temporary visas and permanent residents. Methods: Data were gathered from interviews with 22 participants. Information concerning medication adherence, side effects, CD 4 T-cell count, viral load and rate of response to generic drugs were collected. Results: The mean age was 33. 4 years (±s. d. = 6. 0), 21 out of 22 were from HIV-prevalent areas in East Africa and Asia, 14 out of 22 were on temporary visas, 12 were ineligible for Medicare, 14 out of 22 were diagnosed during health screening, 19 out of 22 risk exposures were in country of origin, 8 out of 17 were taking generic ART at an average cost of $ 180 per month, adherence was excellent and self-reported side-effects were relatively infrequent. Participants applying for visa continuations and permanent residency were fearful, believing their HIV serostatus would prejudice their applications. Patients cited belief in ART efficacy, were motivated to maintain therapy and were anxious about {{lack of access to}} treatment in their countries of origin. Conclusion: Adherence to antiretroviral drugs in Medicare-ineligible HIV-infected individuals is excellent despite limited access to treatment. The threat of visa non-renewal and the likely failure of applications for permanent residency result in considerable anxiety and confidentiality concerns...|$|R
40|$|Legitimate {{concerns}} about people smuggling should not cause Australia to depart from its {{international human rights}} obligations to treat asylum seekers humanely and with fairness according to this report. Report Summary In early 2008, the Commission commended the Australian Government for ending the so-called ‘Pacific solution’ by closing the offshore immigration detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island. Since then, the government has initiated further positive reforms, in particular the July 2008 announcement of ‘New Directions’ for Australia’s immigration detention system. However, despite these positive changes, the Commission has ongoing concerns – {{one of the most}} critical being the mandatory detention and offshore processing of asylum seekers on Christmas Island. While there are clearly significant efforts being put into the detention and offshore processing system on Christmas Island, those efforts cannot overcome the fundamental problems with the system itself. The Commission’s major concerns can be summarised as follows: Excision and offshore processing Asylum seekers who arrive in excised offshore places such as Christmas Island are barred from the refugee status determination system that applies on the mainland under Australian law. Instead, they go through a ‘non-statutory’ process governed by guidelines that are not legally binding. They have no access to the Refugee Review Tribunal and very limited access to the Australian courts. They must rely on a non-compellable and non-reviewable Ministerial discretion to be allowed to apply for a protection <b>visa.</b> <b>Mandatory</b> detention, without judicial oversight Asylum seekers (including children) who arrive by boat without a valid visa in an excised offshore place are mandatorily detained on Christmas Island despite the fact that the Migration Act does not require this. Further, the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (Migration Act) purports to bar them from challenging the lawfulness of their detention in the Australian courts. Detention of unaccompanied minors and families with children Some children (including unaccompanied children) are detained in a closed immigration detention facility on Christmas Island – the ‘construction camp’. The Commission considers this a concerning regression from the 2005 changes to the Migration Act which affirmed the principle that children should only be detained as a last resort. There is a conflict of interest created by having the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship or DIAC officers act as the legal guardian for unaccompanied minors detained on Christmas Island. There is also a lack of clarity about responsibilities and procedures relating to child welfare and protection for children in immigration detention on the island. Detention in a small, remote community Asylum seekers on Christmas Island are detained in a small community in a remote location where their access to appropriate services including health and mental health care, legal advice, cultural and religious support, and community-based advocacy and support networks is more limited than it would be on the mainland. The remote location and limited facilities and infrastructure on Christmas Island make it a difficult place in which to ensure implementation of some key aspects of the government’s New Directions – in particular the intention to use immigration detention centres only as a last resort, and the presumption that unauthorised arrivals will be released into the community once their health, identity and security checks are completed. The shortage of community-based accommodation appears to be preventing the release of some detainees from closed detention facilities into community detention. The remote location of Christmas Island makes the immigration detention operations there less visible and transparent to the Australian public, and less accessible for external scrutiny bodies. Conditions and treatment of detainees The immigration detention facilities on Christmas Island are not appropriate for detaining asylum seekers, particularly those with a background of torture or trauma. The Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) is a high security detention centre that looks like a prison. The construction camp facility is not appropriate for unaccompanied minors or families with children. While some detainees on Christmas Island expressed positive views about their treatment, others expressed frustration about the restrictions placed on them during the initial ‘separation detention’ phase, the length of time they had been detained, their lack of access to external excursions, and difficulties accessing interpreters and translated documents. Under the Refugee Convention, asylum seekers should not be penalised because of their method of arrival. Regardless of how or where they arrive in Australia, all people are entitled to protection of their fundamental human rights, including the right to seek asylum. The excision and offshore processing regime establishes a two-tiered system for determining refugee status. Asylum seekers who arrive in excised offshore places such as Christmas Island have fewer legal safeguards than those who arrive on the mainland. In the Commission’s view this undermines the core principles of the Refugee Convention, jeopardises asylum seekers’ human rights and increases the risk that a refugee may be sent back to a place where their life or freedom would be threatened. Further, the policy of detaining all unauthorised boat arrivals in a place as small and remote as Christmas Island restricts asylum seekers’ access to essential services and support networks, and limits the ability of the Australian Government to ensure that those people are treated in accordance with key aspects of its own New Directions policy. The Commission therefore reiterates its past recommendations that the provisions of the Migration Act relating to excised offshore places should be repealed; people should not be held in immigration detention on Christmas Island; and all unauthorised arrivals who make claims for asylum should have those claims assessed through the refugee status determination system that applies under the Migration Act.  ...|$|R
