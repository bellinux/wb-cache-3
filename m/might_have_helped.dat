5|$|Back in {{the present}} Fox Mulder is dismayed to hear what his father was {{involved}} in. He asks Dales how Skur escaped and Dales speculates that someone <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> Skur escape hoping that {{the truth of what}} was done to him may one day be revealed. The episode ends with a final flashback of Bill Mulder driving down a road with Skur and giving Skur the keys to the car and walking away.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to ascertain {{how much of the}} Prayer Book is actually Cranmer's personal composition. Generations of liturgical scholars have been able to track down the sources that he used, including the Sarum Rite, writings from Hermann von Wied, and several Lutheran sources including Osiander and Justus Jonas. More problematic is determining how Cranmer worked on the book and with whom he worked. Despite the lack of knowledge of who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> him, however, he is given the credit for the editorship and the overall structure of the book.|$|E

25|$|The {{claims about}} Devapala's {{victories}} are exaggerated, but cannot be dismissed entirely: {{there is no}} reason to doubt his conquest of Utkala and Kamarupa. Besides, the neighbouring kingdoms of Rashtrakutas and the Gurjara-Pratiharas were weak at the time, which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> him extend his empire. Devapala is also believed to have led an army up to the Indus river in Punjab.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in light}} of recent genetic studies, Hiernaux's theory on the origin of Tutsis in East Africa appears doubtful. It has also been {{demonstrated}} that the Tutsis harbor little to no Northeastern African genetic influence on their paternal line. On the other hand, there is currently no mtDNA data available for the Tutsi, which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> shed light on their background.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 {{he took up}} {{the issue}} of {{producing}} oil from coal, and claimed that the Falmouth Committee looking into the question had deliberately restricted its remit and sent an insulting letter to a company which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> it.

25|$|US District Court Judge in Washington DC Emmet G. Sullivan, on October 2, 2008, {{denied the}} mistrial {{petition}} of Stevens's chief counsel, Brendan Sullivan, due to allegations of withholding evidence by prosecutors. Thus, {{the latter were}} admonished, and would submit themselves for internal probe by the United States Department of Justice. Brady v. Maryland requires prosecutors to give a defendant any material exculpatory evidence. Judge Sullivan had earlier admonished the prosecution for sending home to Alaska a witness who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> the defense.|$|E
25|$|Early {{on during}} the reign of Queen Christina (1644–1654) De la Gardie became the queen's favourite. Being, reportedly, both well-mannered and good looking <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> De la Gardie to gain the queen's favour. His {{knowledge}} concerning culture, politics and representation might also have impressed the queen just as his talent for organizing festivities and surrounding himself with extravagance and magnificence. His skill and interest in the mentioned areas was in demand during a time when the power should not only be well-learned, resolute and rooted in history, but have a sense of details and possess splendour as well.|$|E
25|$|Mercury <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> on {{the musical}} {{arrangements}} {{based on the}} fact that (as it has been recalled by former bassists and the band themselves) they were in a more collaborative period in the pre-studio days and he was usually the one getting his way with structural ideas. While it is highly possible that he contributed ideas to the song (the modulation types and the expanded form are closer to his style than to May's), the bottom line is that even in that case Mercury would be more a co-arranger than a co-writer per se (like George Martin on The Beatles' songs).|$|E

25|$|However, {{police were}} not able to develop any {{evidence}} from this material that <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> them locate Bethany. Roldan later stopped cooperating with the investigation; he has subsequently been described by law enforcement as a person of interest. Emile Decker later obtained a divorce from his missing wife. It has since been reported that he will no longer talk with investigators unless his lawyer, who says his client has nothing to hide, is also present. No record was ever found suggesting that Bethany had given birth by her expected due date later that summer, although Loudoun County police distributed to the public pictures of what she might look like near the end of a pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{completion}} of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure. Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model. He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery. There {{is no doubt that}} Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953. Some, including Maddox, have explained this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because {{it would have been very}} difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen.|$|E
25|$|Early on 25 December 1954, at 0330 hours, a British Overseas Airways Corporation Boeing 377 Stratocruiser {{crashed on}} landing at Prestwick, killing 28 of the 36 {{passengers}} and crew on board. The aircraft had been en route from London to New York City, when, on approach to Prestwick, it entered a steep descent before levelling out too late and too severely, hitting the ground short of the runway. The crash {{has been attributed to}} a number of factors, including: pilot fatigue (the Captain was well over his duty limit due to the aircraft being delayed); the landing lights at Prestwick being out of action due to repair; and the First Officer either not hearing a command from the Captain for landing lights (which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> judge the low cloud base) or mistakenly hitting the flaps, causing the aircraft to stall.|$|E
5|$|Although Brady and Hindley had {{confessed to}} the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided that nothing would be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving life {{sentences}} no further punishment could be inflicted, and a second trial <b>might</b> even <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> Hindley's case for parole by giving her a platform from which to make a public confession.|$|R
60|$|The {{loneliness}} and helplessness {{of the woman}} touched me.

5000|$|In 1641, the Massachusetts Body of Liberties {{was written}} {{as a first}} step at {{developing}} a body of law for the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

25|$|In {{terms of}} evolution, the oldest {{physiological}} role of Ahr is in development. Ahr {{is presumed to}} have evolved from invertebrates where it served a ligand-independent role in normal development processes. The Ahr homolog in Drosophila, spineless (ss) is necessary for development of the distal segments of the antenna and leg. Ss dimerizes with tango (tgo), which is the homolog to the mammalian Arnt, to initiate gene transcription. Evolution of the receptor in vertebrates resulted {{in the ability to}} bind ligand and <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> humans evolve to tolerate smoke of fires. In developing vertebrates, Ahr seemingly plays a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Despite lacking a clear endogenous ligand, AHR appears {{to play a role in}} the differentiation of many developmental pathways, including hematopoiesis, lymphoid systems, T-cells, neurons, and hepatocytes. AhR has also been found to have an important function in hematopoietic stem cells: AhR antagonism promotes their self-renewal and ex-vivo expansion and is involved in megakaryocyte differentiation.|$|E
25|$|Roger Mortimer of Wigmore was a {{powerful}} Marcher lord, married to the wealthy heiress Joan de Geneville, {{and the father of}} twelve children. Mortimer had been imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 following his capture by Edward during the Despenser wars. Mortimer's uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk finally died in prison, but Mortimer managed to escape the Tower in August 1323, making a hole in the stone wall of his cell and then escaping onto the roof, before using rope ladders provided by an accomplice {{to get down to the}} River Thames, across the river and then on eventually to safety in France. Victorian writers suggested that, given later events, Isabella <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> Mortimer escape and some historians continue to argue that their relationship had already begun at this point, although most believe that there is no hard evidence for their having had a substantial relationship before meeting in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Petre {{believed}} that Hohenlohe's surrender was unnecessary and {{his chief of}} staff Massenbach was partly responsible. He thought that the Prussians could have fought their way into Stettin, and probably would have if a strong-willed general like Blücher had been in command. The brigades of Hagen and Bila were not far away at the time and these forces <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> prevent Murat from encircling Hohenlohe. Petre listed several criticisms of Hohenlohe. First, he marched too slowly from Burg and took too many detours to the north at the incompetent Massenbach's advice. It might have been possible for him to reach Prenzlau a day earlier, in which case he would have escaped Murat. Second, he kept too much cavalry and Hagen's infantry brigade on his left flank, where there were no enemies. Only Schimmelpfennig's weak brigade of 1,300 men was in the critical sector on the right flank. Third, his best troops marched in the rear guard with Blücher, while the major threat was on the right flank.|$|E
50|$|After {{the capture}} of lead {{terrorist}} Abu Fayed, CTU stages a fake rescue of Fayed hoping that he will lead them to the remaining suitcase nukes. It is revealed by the ambassador that his country has captured a general who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>helping</b> Fayed. Buchanan persuades President Palmer to order the ambassador to have the captured general contact Fayed. Nadia Yassir warns Buchanan {{that there might be}} a distress signal encoded in the phone call. Fayed is later killed by Jack Bauer.|$|R

5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>helped</b> by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|R
25|$|Radar <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> {{detect the}} convoys {{regardless}} of the starvation in resources. However, progress was slow. A 136MHz FuG Atlas was installed in a Fw 200C-3/U3 in July 1941 and the similar Neptune-S was later trialled off Norway, but proved disappointing. When it was compared to a captured British metric (200MHz) ASV (air-to-surface vessel) MK II from a crashed Hudson in Tunisia, the British radar {{was found to be}} far better. By this time Rostock, operating 120MHz with a 16-nautical-mile (30km) range was under development, but production was slow and by November 1942 only five Fw 2000C-4/U3s in the west had radar, and one of those was the captured British set. The low-UHF band FuG 200 Hohentweil, operating at 550MHz, with a range of 43nm (80km) was being developed. It entered service in August 1943 in the Fw 200C-6, but Kessler's low place in the pecking order meant only 16 Fw 200s out of 26 in III./KG 40 had radar. It is unknown whether other groups were issued with the radar.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a fault next to the western flank of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex is normally {{considered to be the}} prime structural evidence for continental rifting in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. However, more recent mapping and seismic studies in the Coast Mountains have documented the presence of brittle rift-related faults southwest of the small community of Stewart in northwestern British Columbia. But these faults were in a matter of dispute in 1997 by geologists, stating these faults were last active between 20and five million years ago. In 1999, a sequence of north-trending faults were mapped that seem to represent young rifting events parallel with the southwestern boundary of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. These rift-related faults might have been active as recently as five million years ago and they might have connections with adjacent Miocene and younger volcanic activity {{in the southern part of}} the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. In addition, brittle faults with similar north-trending directions might enlarge as far north as the fault next to the western flank of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. These tectonic events <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> form the structure the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province.|$|E
25|$|Like other maniraptorans, Anchiornis had a propatagium, a flap of skin {{connecting}} the wrist {{to the shoulder}} and rounding out {{the front edge of}} the wing. In Anchiornis, this part of the wing was covered in covert feathers which smoothed the wing and covered the gaps between the larger primary and secondary feathers. However, unlike modern birds, the covert feathers of Anchiornis were not arranged in tracts or rows. The arrangement of the covert feathers was also more primitive in Anchiornis than in birds and more advanced paravians. In modern birds, the coverts usually cover only the upper portion of the wing, with most of the wing surface made up of uncovered flight feathers. In some Anchiornis fossils, on the other hand, several layers of covert feathers seem to extend down to cover most of the wing's surface, so that the wing is essentially made of multiple layers of feathers, rather than a layer of broad feathers with only their bases hidden by layers of coverts. This multi-layered wing arrangement <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> strengthen the wing, considering that the primary and secondary feathers themselves were narrow and weak.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Farm Board's {{purchase}} of surplus {{could not keep}} up with the production; as farmers realized that they could just sell the government their crops, they reimplemented the use of fertilizers and other techniques to increase production. Overall, the deflation could not be countered because of a massive fault in the bill: there was no production limit. Had there been a production limit, the deflation <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>helped</b> somewhat. The funds appropriated were eventually exhausted and the losses of the farmers kept rising.|$|R
50|$|One king named Dharmapala {{ruling in}} Dandabhukti finds {{mention in the}} Tirmulai Inscription of Rajendra Chola which he issued in his 13th regnal year (about 1025 AD). Scholars {{identify}} this Dharmapala of the Tirmulai Inscription with the Dharmapala of the Kamboja-Pala Dynasty ruling in Dandabhukti {{in the first quarter}} of the 11th century. It has also been suggested that when threatened by Pala rulers of Bengal, Dharmapala, this last ruler of the Kamboja-Pala Dynasty of Bengal, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> sought <b>help</b> from Rajendra Chola of the Chola Dynasty.|$|R
50|$|Gregory (1926) {{considered}} that dinocephalians were aquatic animals, the wide {{hands and feet}} and the extensive fore and aft reach being useful for propelling the animal through water and the massive forehead being an advantage in diving.He suggested that the pineal organ <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been phototropic, <b>helping</b> the animal to orient itself relative {{to the surface of}} the water.|$|R
