40|$|The {{hydrogen}} sulphide (H 2 <b>S,)</b> <b>test</b> {{has been proposed}} as a presence-absence, low-cost field test to detect microbial contamination for nearly 30 years and is now widely used in many counfries. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify different sfrategies for deploying the test and assess how each might be affected by the test's accuracy. Evidence on the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test's</b> accuracy is drawn from a recent systematic review. We ident/Ied six different sfrategies for deploying the test based on a literature review. Three sfrategies used the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> in isolation, while the other three used the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> in combination with standard, laboratory-based methods or alongside sanitary risk inspection surveys.

40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} {{accuracy of the}} H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> for microbiological contamination of domestic water across different settings, {{as a basis for}} providing guidance on its use. Methods We searched a range of bibliographic and ‘grey’ literature databases to identify studies that had processed domestic water samples using both the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> and recognized tests for thermotolerant coliforms or Escherichia coli. We screened 661 study abstracts and identified 51 relevant studies based on 13 853 water samples. For each relevant study, we recorded the level of correspondence between the H 2 <b>S</b> and recognized <b>tests,</b> microbial testing procedures, details of the samples processed and study quality indicators. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the impact of testing procedures, study quality and sample characteristics on the diagnostic accuracy of the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test.</b> Results H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> implementation varied between studies, and the test’s diagnostic accuracy varied significantly and substantially between studies. Little of this variation was explained by testing procedures, study quality or the nature of the samples processed. Conclusions Although in widespread use, our findings suggest that the diagnostic accuracy, particularly specificity, of the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> is variable. Optimal conditions for conducting the test remain unclear. As H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> accuracy is low in a minority of these studies, we recommend that its performance be evaluated relative to standard methods, prior to its operational deployment in a new setting...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{object of}} this study was to assess the {{usefulness}} of the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> for detection of fecal pollution of water in comparison to fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Materials and Methods: A total of 70 raw water samples were collected from drinking water sources in Isfahan province of Iran, aseptically in sterile containers during May-October 2012. The modified H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> medium of Manja et al. was used except that L-cysteine was added as an additional medium component. Total coliforms (TCs), fecal coliforms (FCs), and fecal streptococci (FS) were also estimated by multiple-tube fermentation method. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 20 at the 95 % conﬁdence level (α = 0. 05). Results: It was found that out of 70 water samples assessed, 48. 3 %, 30. 0 %, 34. 6 %, and 32. 9 % of the samples were positive for TCs, FCs, FS, and H 2 S, respectively. Analysis of data showed that 95. 6 %, 69. 5 %, and 76. 9 % of water samples, which were positive for H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> were also positive for TCs, FCs, and FS, respectively. The H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> was found to have the highest accuracy for the detection of FS, but it was not a suitable indicator for the prediction of FCs. Conclusions: Our results showed that H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> is not a suitable alternative approach for routine water quality monitoring. However, the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> could be used as an easy and economic test to assess the quality of drinking water in communities where manpower and sophisticated equipment are inadequate.

40|$|Results of {{previous}} studies have not indicated clearly which tests {{should be used to}} assess short-term efforts of people with intellectual disabilities. Thus, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate laboratory and field-based tests of short-term effort with maximal intensity of subjects with intellectual disabilities. Twenty four people with intellectual disability, who trained soccer, participated in this study. The 30 <b>s</b> Wingate <b>test</b> and additionally an 8 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> with maximum intensity were performed on a bicycle ergometer. The fatigue index, maximal and mean power, relative maximal and relative mean power were measured. Overall, nine field-based tests were conducted: 5, 10 and 20 m sprints, a 20 m shuttle run, a seated medicine ball throw, a bent arm hang test, a standing broad jump, sit-ups and a hand grip test. The reliability of the 30 s and 8 <b>s</b> Wingate <b>tests</b> for subjects with intellectual disability was confirmed. Significant correlation was observed for mean power between the 30 s and 8 <b>s</b> <b>tests</b> on the bicycle ergometer at a moderate level (r > 0. 4). Moreover, significant correlations were indicated between the results of laboratory tests and field tests, such as the 20 m sprint, the 20 m shuttle run, the standing long jump and the medicine ball throw. The strongest correlation was in the medicine ball throw. The 30 <b>s</b> Wingate <b>test</b> is a reliable test assessing maximal effort in subjects with intellectual disability. The results of this research confirmed that the 8 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> on a bicycle ergometer had a moderate correlation with the 30 <b>s</b> Wingate <b>test</b> in this population, thus, this comparison needs further investigation to examine alternativeness of the 8 s to 30 <b>s</b> Wingate <b>tests.</b> The non-laboratory tests could be used to indirectly assess performance in short-term efforts with maximal intensity...|$|R

40|$|The presence/absence {{hydrogen}} sulphide test (P/A H 2 S) {{is widely used}} as a low-cost alternative faecal indicator test in remote and resource-poor settings. The aim of the paper is to assess how bacterial density and sample volume affect its accuracy. Based on a systematic search, we identified studies that tested water samples (n = 2, 034) using both the P/A H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> and recognised tests for thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) or E. coli. We calculated P/A H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> specificity and sensitivity against a range of TTC and E. coli densities. For two studies, we compared this with sensitivity and specificity estimates for simulated 100 and 20 ml presence/absence tests. For most of the 19 included studies, as the threshold used to define contamination increased from 1 to 100 cfu/ 100 ml, P/A H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> sensitivity increased but specificity decreased. Similarly, the simulation indicated that increasing test volumes from 20 to 100 ml increased sensitivity but reduced specificity.

(6) There was no correlation between the quantity of birbic acid excreted in the urine in 24 hours and the disturbance in liver function. However, the association of the latter with the former was found to be the highest in the results of the test for urobilinogen in the urine, followed by those of the test for urobilin in the urine, BSP test and Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> in the named order. (7) There was no correlation between the quantity of birbic acid excreted in the urine in 24 hours and the results of Sawada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> urinary <b>test.</b> There occurred an increase in the quantity of of birbic acid only in the group to which the extract of capsules had not been administered, and the cases in which the increase had occurred were all positive for Sawada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> urinary <b>test.</b> The increase in the quantity of pyruvic acid excreted in the urine would, therefore, be attributed to vagotonia. (8) The changes in total protein and gamma globulin levels were most closely related to vitamin B_ 1 deficiency. (9) Of all the tests for liver function, Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> produced sesults which corresponded most closely to vitamin B_ 1 deficiency in total protein and gamma globulin levels. Significant difference in albumin fraction level and the ratio albumin/globulin between liver function disturbance and vitamin B_ 1 deficiency was found in the results of Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> alone,. The group consisting of cases positive for Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> showed a rise in gamma globulin level, while the group consisting of cases of vitamin B_ 1 de ficiency showed a lowering in gamma globulin level. Vitamin B_ 1 {{plays an important role in}} the metabolism of carbohydrates. Birbic acid is formed as an intermediary product of the metabolism of sugar and is converted into acetaldehyd and carbon dioxideby the catalyzing action of co-carboxylase. The disturbance in liver function is often noticed in cases of disorder of the metabolism of birbic acid as well as of vitamin B_ 1 deficiency. The author carried out experiments in about 100 each of normal and tubercular persons to see if there are any relations between the metabolism of vitamin B_ 1, the metabolism of birbic acid and the liver function. The statistical analysis of the results is givenbelow: (1) There was correlation between vitamin B_ 1 deficiency and the disturbance in liver function revealed as the results of BSP test, Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> and the tests for urobilin and urobilinogen in the urine. There was closer relation between vitamin B_ 1 deficiency and the disturbance in excretory function as revealed by Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> and the tests for urobilin and urobilinogen in the urine, than between _vitamin B_ 1 deficiency and the disturbance in metabolic function as revealed by BSP test. (2) There was correlation between the results of Sawada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> urinary <b>test</b> and the disturbance in liver function. The association of the latter with the former was found to be the highest in the results of the test for urobilinogen in the urine, followed by those of Takada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test,</b> the test for urobilin in urine and B <b>S</b> P <b>test</b> in the indicated order. (3) There was correlation between the results of Sawada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> urinary <b>test</b> and vagotonia. It would, however, going too far to say that the positive results of Sawada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>test</b> in the cases of vagotonia indicate the presence of vitamin B_ 1 deficiency in the broad sense of the word.

To verify that the FTA-ABS-DS test used with an anti-human IgM conjugate could detect specific IgM in fractionated serum samples (FTA-ABS-DS 19 <b>S</b> IgM <b>test),</b> 164 fractionated (QUIK-SEP IgM Isolation System; ISOLAB, Inc., Akron, Ohio) serum specimens from infected neonates or adults or from IgG-seronegative subjects were tested by both techniques. The sensitivity limits of the two tests were assessed with reactive serum samples diluted to an endpoint titer. Samples nonreactive by the FTA-ABS 19 <b>S</b> IgM <b>test</b> (n = 74) were either nonreactive (n = 65), minimally reactive (n = 5), or reactive (n = 4) by the FTA-ABS-DS 19 <b>S</b> IgM <b>test.</b> Samples minimally reactive by the FTA-ABS 19 <b>S</b> IgM <b>test</b> (n = 32) were minimally reactive (n = 1) or reactive (n = 31) by the double staining test. All samples reactive by the FTA-ABS 19 <b>S</b> IgM <b>test</b> (n = 58) were also reactive by the FTA-ABS-DS 19 <b>S</b> IgM <b>test.</b> There was a directly proportional linear relationship (r = 0. 9794) between titers obtained by both <b>tests.</b> FTA-ABS-DS 19 <b>S</b> IgM titers were constantly equal to or higher than FTA-ABS 19 S IgM titers.
