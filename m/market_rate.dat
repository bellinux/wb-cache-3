5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a <b>market</b> <b>rate</b> to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the <b>market</b> <b>rate</b> to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E
5|$|The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with the firm to have it undertake {{the construction of the}} railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the <b>market</b> <b>rate.</b> Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.|$|E

50|$|FRNs carry little {{interest}} rate risk. An FRN has a duration close to zero, and its price shows very low sensitivity {{to changes in}} <b>market</b> <b>rates.</b> When <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> rise, the expected coupons of the FRN increase {{in line with the}} increase in forward rates, which means its price remains constant. Thus, FRNs differ from fixed rate bonds, whose prices decline when <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> rise. As FRNs are almost immune to interest rate risk, they are considered conservative investments for investors who believe <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> will increase. The risk that remains is credit risk.|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has deeply affected money markets and thus, potentially, the proper {{functioning of the}} interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission. Therefore, we analyze the effectiveness of monetary policy in steering euro area money <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> looking at, first, the predictability of money <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> {{on the basis of}} monetary policy expectations, and second the impact of extraordinary central bank measures on money <b>market</b> <b>rates.</b> We find that during the crisis money <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> up to 12 months still respond to revisions in the expected path of future rates, even though to a lesser extent than before August 2007. We attribute part of the loss in monetary policy effectiveness to money <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> being driven by higher liquidity premia and increased uncertainty about future interest rates. Our results also indicate that the ECB's non-standard monetary policy measures as of October 2008 were effective in addressing the disruptions in the euro area money market. In fact, our estimates suggest that non-standard monetary policy measures helped to lower Euribor rates by more than 80 basis points.

25|$|The {{choice of}} {{discount}} rate is subjective. A smaller rate values future generations equally {{with the current}} generation. Larger rates (e.g. a <b>market</b> <b>rate</b> of return) reflects humans' attraction to time inconsistency—valuing money that they receive today more than money {{they get in the}} future. The choice makes a large difference in assessing interventions with long-term effects. One issue is the equity premium puzzle, in which long-term returns on equities may be rather higher than they should be. If so then arguably market rates of return should not be used to determine a discount rate, as doing so would have the effect of undervaluing the distant future (e.g. climate change).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{researchers}} (David Rodda, Jacob Vigdor, and Janna Matlack), argue that a shortage of affordable housing – {{at least in the}} US – is caused in part by income inequality. David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (Rhoda 1994:148). Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher <b>market</b> <b>rate</b> for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.|$|E
