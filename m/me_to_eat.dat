60|$|And {{the strong}} man answered: 'Willingly, {{as long as}} you give <b>me</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and drink.' And he came on the ship.|$|R
6000|$|... "So they will," [...] {{declared}} the Woozy, chuckling gleefully. [...] "When they find I'm gone the farmers will be badly scared, for they'll expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> up their honey-bees, as I did before." ...|$|E
60|$|This made {{my husband}} (but he knew {{not the real}} {{occasion}} of my illness) and the Quaker very uneasy, and they did all {{in their power to}} persuade <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> anything I could fancy.|$|E
6000|$|Denneys said: [...] "Give <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and to drink, for I am faint to death." [...] And the hermit said, [...] "You {{shall have}} food upon the moment," [...] {{and he went}} to fetch it.|$|E

6000|$|... "See here," [...] {{suddenly}} demanded Prince Zingle, {{standing up}} and shaking the bars of his cage, [...] "are you going <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> anything <b>to</b> <b>eat?</b> Or do you expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> live on peanuts forever?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Nancy!" [...] he implored her, [...] "do give <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>eat!</b> Something warm. Coffee, if you've got it. I've been sick, and I'm starving." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop! I {{beg your}} pardon! I {{never meant to}} hurt you. It isn't easy for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> my words," [...] Mr. Treffry said wistfully, [...] "let that count for something." [...] He held out his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I shall go," [...] said Mr. Traffick. [...] "No {{consideration}} {{on earth}} shall induce <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> another meal under your roof until you shall have thought {{good to have}} expressed regret for what you have said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are heartily {{welcome to}} it," [...] Fergus said. [...] "If {{you do not}} assist <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> it, it will be wasted. Tomorrow I shall breakfast at Erfurt, and maybe dine, also. I will start as soon as I get back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must {{explain all}} that <b>to</b> <b>me</b> later," [...] said the Angel. [...] "Unless I wake up. At present, please show <b>me</b> how <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> If you will. I feel {{a kind of}} urgency...." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Get <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> at once," [...] she begged. [...] "I am starving. Somewhere where it's cool. Leonard, how wonderful! I {{never even}} {{knew that you}} were in New York." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are plenty}} of them, of course," [...] said the Tiger, [...] "but {{unfortunately}} I have such a tender conscience that it won't allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> babies. So I'm always hungry for 'em and never can eat 'em, because my conscience won't let me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A fat baby. I want a fat baby," [...] {{said the}} Hungry Tiger. [...] "A nice, plump, juicy, tender, fat baby. But, of course, if I had one, my {{conscience}} {{would not allow}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> it. So I'll {{have to be an}} ornament and forget my hunger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor me," [...] said young Caddles. [...] "You {{little people}} made all that before I was born. You and your Law! What I must and what I mustn't! No food for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> unless I work a slave, no rest, no shelter, nothin', {{and you tell}} me--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do not be anxious if I do {{not come}} along for half an hour. It will be more natural that I should call for bread and cheese and beer and eat them there; then I can say {{carelessly}} that I may as well take some with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> later on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, thou great purse of fat!" [...] cried Little John, [...] "I ask thee not for fool's wisdom, but {{for bread}} and meat.

6000|$|... "O my sister, my sister! Dost thou {{not know}} me? Dost thou answer my caresses with kicks?

6000|$|... "Why, you dreadful creature!" [...] {{said the}} Tiger reproachfully; [...] "would you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> a poor little lost baby, that doesn't know where its mother is?"

60|$|He {{locked the}} door and turned to me again. He asked me no questions, but gave me some more brandy and water and pressed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> I {{was in a state}} of collapse. He said {{something}} vague about his forgetting to warn me, and asked me briefly when I left the house and what I had seen.|$|E
60|$|The {{excitement}} {{was very}} fierce; {{it seemed to}} consume <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> into my brain.
