40|$|In {{this work}} we propose an {{automatic}} approach {{to detect and}} recognize text in natural images. Differently from other techniques which extract text from the whole image, our approach is trained to detect a particular area of interest where performs the search of text. Firstly we detect the region of interest and then we detect and segment the characters found. The proposed method {{may be used to}} read a generic text contained in a specific object from a single image. To show the results of our approach we focused on the problem of the automatic gas meter reading. The goal is to process a natural image containing a gas meter in order to extract only the information from the digits of the <b>meter</b> <b>counter.</b> Despite the complexity of the problem, our approach shows good results and the low computational time required by the algorithm permits to use it in real applications and in mobile devices. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a novel method for {{automatic}} gas meter reading from real world images. In {{a wide range}} of countries all over the world, the existing automatic technology is not adopted, usually the reading is manually done on site, and a picture is taken through a mobile device as a proof of reading. In order to confirm the reading, a tedious work of checking the proof images is commonly done offline by an operator. With this contribution we aim to supply an effective system, able to provide a real support to the validation process reducing the human effort and the time consumed. We exploit both region-based and Maximally Stable Extremal Regions techniques, during the phase involving the localization of the meter area and to detect the <b>meter</b> <b>counter</b> digits in the detection step respectively. The evaluation has been carried out on every step of our approach, {{as well as on the}} overall assessment; although the problem is complex, the proposed method leads to good results even when applied to degraded images, it represents an effective solution to the gas meter reading problem and it can be utilized in real applications...|$|E

They are the technicians that connect the component to a test bench to simulate an aircraft, and troubleshoot and repair the equipment. In some instances the technician will not repair specific circuit card assemblies (CCAs); these CCAs will either go to depot level or {{back to the original}} manufacturer for repair. I-level AT's are usually assigned to fleet readiness centers on shore or aircraft intermediate maintenance departments aboard ships. The most challenging and demanding specialty that AT's can have is to be a calibration technician. Without properly calibrated gear such as test sets, oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, frequency <b>counters,</b> <b>meters,</b> gauges, thermometers, torque wrenches, and transducers, the rest of the maintenance ratings, for aircraft and ships alike, {{would not be able to}} do their jobs effectively.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to compare the calibration factors for Cs- 137 and Co- 60 of six radiation measuring instruments in fast five years to evaluate the accuracy of radiation measurements of different instruments. For this comparison, we used survey meters with different type of gaseous ionization detectors mainly GM tube, Proportional counters and ionization chambers. This research shows that, response of the survey meter for Co- 60 radiation {{is higher than the}} Cs- 137. Hence Calibration Factor for Co- 60 radiation is much lower than the Cs- 137. Calibration Factor of instrument remaining nearly stable within the regions of 0. 1 to 10 mSv/h for the duration of five years while other two regions, 0 - 0. 1 mSv/h and 10 - 30 mSv/h show some variation. Survey <b>meters</b> with GM <b>counters</b> and proportional counters have nearly same response to the gamma radiation.

50|$|In the four-player versions, {{each player}} {{position}} {{has its own}} coin slot and each credit value adds around a hundred health points to that position which slowly drains one health point per tick (similar to Gauntlet). Players are able to accidentally hit each other and cause allies to drop their weapons permanently. After defeating the boss {{at the end of}} each level, if the game has more than one current player then the players are given a time limit that refreshes when a player is hurt and tells the players to fight as long as they want and lose health. While some health is granted at the end of the time limit, it is possible to lose more health than granted during this fight. The two-player version gives players a set amount of lives and the health/timer system is replaced with a standard life <b>meter</b> and life <b>counter</b> similar to Double Dragon.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{implement}} prototype which, provides relevant information to the user at right time. The personal information that is targeted here was health-related information. This may include various type of information, such as drug information, education information, health monitor data for instance glucoses <b>meter,</b> step <b>counter,</b> personal notes, health related images,PDF files. To implement prototype, we use metadata of the information. Some of the metadata of the information describes {{the context of the}} information. We used time, date and location context of information to implement our goal successfully. By using these contexts of the information, the relevant information to user is provided. The four components were implemented to implement prototype: Metadata extractor, Information manger, controller and user interface. The metadata extractor allows user to download files and automatically store file in to the download folder and context of these files was extracted and stored in to the database. The second component was information manger; the main function of this component was to reads the context of downloaded files and make association of similar files by using context. The third component was controller, it was use to represent related files to the end users and the user interface allows user to interact with our system. The implemented prototype was tested for providing related information to the users. The information access was based on the context of the information, which eases to get results and to recognize useful information for the users. It was also tested whether the prototype stores updated files or not. The prototype makes association of new downloaded files to the database and it also avoids redundancy of files. Thus, it helps users to access the updated information and to reduce redundancy of data. The prototype provides user with the right set of information to the right time, by identifying the need of the users by matching with available information...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{increase}} of vehicle number in developing countries including Indonesia leads {{to the rise of}} the road traffic noise (RTN), and the RTN becomes a serious problem in living environment. Therefore, a guideline to reduce the RTN is needed. However, in many cities in developing countries such as Indonesia, any guidelines for the RTN mitigation have not been established yet, unlike developed countries. For example, in Japan, an integrated noise-GIS (Geographic Information System) which provides general functions for urban traffic noise modeling, noise prediction, environmental assessment, and noise abatement design, has been established. Regarding the condition, the author conduct a research to develop a method to find an optimal solution for the RTN problem in Makassar City, based on the reference scheme conducted in Japan. In the context of the RTN mitigation, this research has three objectives to achieve the goal; to grasp the present condition of the RTN, to construct the GIS of the RTN, to examine how to reduce the RTN. In the first step, this study has carried out the investigation data to grasp the present condition of the RTN in MakassarCity including physical characteristic of roadside that covering width of sidewalk, number of lanes, running direction for each time zone and traffic, noise levels (LAeq) at roadside, traffic data (traffic volume and running speed in each vehicles type), collect others information that covering photograph of the current state of investigation point, etc. The survey is conducted for 10 hours from 8 : 00 a. m. until 5 : 00 p. m. at 35 road points as sampling road in Makassar City. In addition, the survey uses sound level <b>meters</b> (SLM), <b>counter</b> and videocamera, and speed gun as equipments of the each data collection, respectively. Then, the research analyzes the noise and traffic data in order to describe the present condition of the RTN,and analyzes data in order to develop prediction model of the RTN by following and adapting the ASJRTN-Model 2008 (ASJ Model). In order to achieve predicting results more precisely, the prediction model of the RTN using the exact power level of vehicles, and the power level of vehicle horn sound in the city, are conducted. In the second step, the research investigates geographic data and applied the data using POEMfor RTN prediction, analysis, and evaluating, to construct the RTN-GIS in Makassar City. POEM is RTN-GIS software which Fujimoto and his colleagues have developed in Japan References. In the third step, this research attempts to propose and examine the mitigation strategyhow to reduce the RTN in Makassar City. A guideline or grand strategy for the RTNmitigationis arranged according to the short-term, middle term, and long-term solutions. Firstly, the strategy applies two physical abatement of the RTN reduction (i. e. barrier insertion and drainage asphalt pavement). Then, the strategy proposes some travel demand management (TDM) and incorporating traffic management system (TMS) measures in reducing the RTN problem, such three in one (3 IN 1) program scenario for passenger cars, two in one (2 IN 1) program scenario for motorcycle (MC), prohibition in generating horn sounds of vehicles, implementation of bus rapid transit (BRT) system. The results of the first step show that theaverage noise level is 74 dB (LAeq; equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level) and more than 90...|$|R
