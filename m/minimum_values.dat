5|$|There {{are some}} {{circumstances}} {{where this is}} not the case, and it is desirable to make the width of the transition line larger than the Doppler profile. For instance, when tracking a quickly accelerating object, the band-pass of the ALF must include within it the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>values</b> for the reflected light. The accepted method for increasing the band-pass involves placing an inert gas in the vapor cell. This gas both widens the spectral line and increases the transmission rate of the filter.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} {{research}} in Chernobyl and in the United States were similar: the filter material is well caught a fine aerosol, and created a small resistance {{to the passage of}} air through it; but a lot of unfiltered air passes through the gap between the mask and face. Research has shown that one can expect the <b>minimum</b> <b>values</b> of the protection factor 2÷8, or even 1.5.|$|E
25|$|They {{found that}} if the {{protection}} factors are not stable, the average efficiency {{is strongly dependent on}} smaller values: If the same worker used respirator twice, and if the protection factor was 230,000 in the first case, and the protection factor was 19 in the second (example values from), the average protection factor was only 38. (Penetrations in the first and second cases are 5.26% and 0%, respectively; and the average penetration is equal to 2.63%). Medium PF is strongly dependent on the <b>minimum</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{single most}} {{revealing}} property of wood {{as an indicator}} of wood quality is specific gravity (Timell 1986), as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm3 or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. <b>Minimum</b> <b>values</b> are associated with green (water-saturated) wood and are referred to as basic specific gravity (Timell 1986).|$|E
25|$|At {{any point}} on a surface a normal {{direction}} is {{at right angles}} to the surface because the sphere these are the lines radiating out {{from the center of the}} sphere. The intersection of a plane that contains the normal with the surface will form a curve that is called a normal section, and the curvature of this curve is the normal curvature. For most points on most surfaces, different sections will have different curvatures; the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>values</b> of these are called the principal curvatures. Any closed surface will have at least four points called umbilical points. At an umbilic all the sectional curvatures are equal; in particular the principal curvatures are equal. Umbilical points can be thought of as the points where the surface is closely approximated by a sphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{study showed}} that the three models of full face masks had a {{significant}} leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and the face. The <b>minimum</b> <b>values</b> of the workplace protection factors (WPF) {{of each of the}} three negative pressure full face mask models were 11, 17 and 26. The maximum value of the WPF from one of the models did not exceed 500 no times at all. And for all results together, the WPF was not more than 100 in ~ 30% of the measurements. So, for this reason, the values of the APFs for this RPD type in Germany (400), Finland (500), Italy (400), and Sweden (500), may not fully take into account the lower this type respirators' performance at the workplace compared to the performance in the laboratory (during certification).

2500|$|Tidal {{acceleration}} {{is one of}} the {{few examples}} in the dynamics of the Solar System of a so-called secular perturbation of an orbit, i.e. a perturbation that continuously increases with time and is not periodic. [...] Up to a high order of approximation, mutual gravitational perturbations between major or minor planets only cause periodic variations in their orbits, that is, parameters oscillate between maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>values.</b> [...] The tidal effect gives rise to a quadratic term in the equations, which leads to unbounded growth. [...] In the mathematical theories of the planetary orbits that form the basis of ephemerides, quadratic and higher order secular terms do occur, but these are mostly Taylor expansions of very long time periodic terms. The reason that tidal effects are different is that unlike distant gravitational perturbations, friction is an essential part of tidal acceleration, and leads to permanent loss of energy from the dynamic system in the form of heat. In other words, we do not have a Hamiltonian system here.|$|E
