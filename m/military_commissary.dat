40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFrom 1961 to present day, Walmart {{has expanded its}} number of Supercenters to 3, 336 locations throughout the continental United States, growing {{to be the most}} readily accessible grocer in the lower forty-eight states. This thesis will demonstrate that concentrated populations of active duty and retired military personnel are subject to shorter commutes when shopping at Walmart Supercenters rather than military commissaries. This thesis will further demonstrate that the average military base is closer to a Walmart than a <b>military</b> <b>commissary</b> and that the average number of Walmart Supercenters exceeds the number of commissaries within specific distances from military bases. With rising fuel costs and the number of Walmart Supercenters available nationwide, eligible commissary patrons may be less willing to drive long distances in order to save money on groceries. The closer and more convenient option may best serve the needs of the military customer. If better alternatives exist outside of the commissary, the government can reexamine the practicality of dedicating annual appropriations to the Defense Commissary Agency.

40|$|Slotting {{contracts}} involve manufacturer {{payments for}} retail shelf space. Slotting payments are {{an increasingly important}} part of the competitive process in many product markets, and {{have been the subject of}} government investigations, antitrust litigation, and scholarly debate. However, very little is known about their competitive consequences. This paper uses a unique data set consisting of slotting contracts at <b>military</b> <b>commissaries</b> prior to an exogenously imposed slotting prohibition to identify the impact of slotting on consumer welfare. This natural experiment provides a unique opportunity to directly answer the crucial policy counterfactual: would a ban on slotting contracts increase consumer welfare? The analysis measures the impact of slotting, at both the product and category levels, on prices, output, and product variety. I find no evidence that slotting is anticompetitive. To the contrary, the results suggest that slotting contracts provide substantial net benefits to consumers once one accounts for the unmeasured pass-through of slotting payments...|$|R
