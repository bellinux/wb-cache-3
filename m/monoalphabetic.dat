The code can be a {{consistent}} <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution for the entire cipher or the disks can be moved periodically throughout the cipher making it polyalphabetic. For a <b>monoalphabetic</b> use, the sender and the person receiving the messages would agree on a cipher key setting (e.g., the [...] "G" [...] in the regular alphabet would be positioned next to the [...] "Q" [...] in the cipher alphabet).

50|$|The use {{of symbols}} instead of letters is no {{impediment}} to cryptanalysis, and {{this system is}} identical {{to that of other}} simple <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution schemes.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{example of}} the homophonic substitution cipher is the one used by Duke of Mantua in the early 1400s. Homophonic cipher replaces each letter with multiple symbols depending on the letter frequency. The cipher is ahead of the time because it combines <b>monoalphabetic</b> and polyalphabetic features.|$|E
5000|$|The ACA {{was formed}} on September 1, 1929. Initially the primary {{interest}} was in <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution ciphers (also known as [...] "single alphabet" [...] or [...] "Aristocrat" [...] puzzles), {{but this has}} since extended to dozens of different systems, such as Playfair, autokey, transposition, and Vigenère ciphers.|$|E
50|$|Classical ciphers are {{typically}} vulnerable to known-plaintext attack. For example, a Caesar cipher {{can be solved}} using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely. A general <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution cipher needs several character pairs and some guessing if there are fewer than 26 distinct pairs.|$|E
5000|$|While {{solving a}} <b>monoalphabetic</b> {{substitution}} cipher is easy, solving even a simple code is difficult. Decrypting a coded message {{is a little}} like trying to translate a document written in a foreign language, with the task basically amounting to building up a [...] "dictionary" [...] of the codegroups and the plaintext words they represent.|$|E
5000|$|The Atbash cipher is a {{particular}} type of <b>monoalphabetic</b> cipher formed by taking the alphabet (or abjad, syllabary, etc.) and mapping it to its reverse, so that the first letter becomes the last letter, the second letter becomes the second to last letter, and so on. For example, the Latin alphabet would work like this: ...|$|E
5000|$|Dvorak encoding, {{like other}} <b>monoalphabetic</b> {{encryption}} ciphers, {{is a very}} simple encoding and provides a very weak level of security. It {{may be useful in}} combination with other encodings. The security involved is in no way comparable to modern encryption algorithms which advocate security, and the advantages with this encoding can as such be summarised to encompass: ...|$|E
50|$|Polygraphic {{systems do}} provide a {{significant}} improvement in security over <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitutions. Given an individual letter 'E' in a message, it could be encrypted using any of 52 instructions depending on its location and neighbors, {{which can be used}} to great advantage to mask the frequency of individual letters. However, the security boost is limited; while it generally requires a larger sample of text to crack, it can still be done by hand.|$|E
50|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of using the}} Kasiski examination lies in finding repeated strings. This is a very hard task to perform manually, but computers can make it much easier. However, care is still required, since some repeated strings may just be coincidence, so {{that some of the}} repeat distances are misleading. The cryptanalyst has to rule out the coincidences to find the correct length. Then, of course, the <b>monoalphabetic</b> ciphertexts that result must be cryptanalyzed.|$|E
50|$|A keyword cipher {{is a form}} of <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution. A keyword is used as the key, and it {{determines the}} letter {{matchings}} of the cipher alphabet to the plain alphabet. Repeats of letters in the word are removed, then the cipher alphabet is generated with the keyword matching to A,B,C etc. until the keyword is used up, whereupon the rest of the ciphertext letters are used in alphabetical order, excluding those already used in the key.|$|E
50|$|Cracking a code {{identified}} as polygraphic {{is similar to}} cracking a general <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution except with a larger 'alphabet'. One identifies the most frequent polygrams, experiments with replacing them with common plaintext polygrams, and attempts to build up common words, phrases, and finally meaning. Naturally, if the investigation led the cryptanalyst to suspect that a code was of a specific type, like a Playfair or order-2 Hill cipher, then they could use a more specific attack.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of substitution cipher. If the cipher operates on single letters, it is termed a simple substitution cipher; a cipher that operates on larger groups of letters is termed polygraphic. A <b>monoalphabetic</b> cipher uses fixed substitution over the entire message, whereas a polyalphabetic cipher uses a number of substitutions at different positions in the message, where a unit from the plaintext is mapped to one of several possibilities in the ciphertext and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Dvorak {{encoding}} {{is a type}} of encoding {{based on}} the differences in layout of a QWERTY keyboard and a Dvorak keyboard. There are two main variations: One is achieved by typing in the Dvorak layout on a QWERTY keyboard, and the other is similarly achieved by typing in the QWERTY layout on a Dvorak keyboard. This effectively makes Dvorak encoding into a <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution cipher like ROT13 and the Caesar Cipher, since each one character translates to one other character in a consistent pattern.|$|E
50|$|As a concept, polygraphic {{substitution}} {{contrasts with}} <b>monoalphabetic</b> (or simple) substitutions in which individual letters are uniformly substituted, or polyalphabetic substitutions in which individual letters are substituted {{in different ways}} depending on {{their position in the}} text. In theory, there is some overlap in these definitions; one could conceivably consider a Vigenère cipher with an eight-letter key to be an octographic substitution. In practice, this is not a useful observation since it is far more fruitful to consider it to be a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.|$|E
50|$|The {{previous}} examples {{were all}} examples of <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution ciphers, where just one cipher alphabet is used. It {{is also possible}} to have a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, where multiple cipher alphabets are used. The encoder would just make up two or more cipher alphabets using whatever techniques he or she chooses, and then encode their message, alternating what cipher alphabet is used with every letter or word. This makes the message much harder to decode because the codebreaker would have to figure out both cipher alphabets.|$|E
5000|$|At the end {{of every}} season 1 episode of the cartoon series Gravity Falls, during the credit roll, there is one of three simple {{substitution}} ciphers: A -3 Caesar cipher (hinted by [...] "3 letters back" [...] at {{the end of}} the opening sequence), an Atbash cipher, or a letter-to-number simple substitution cipher. The season 1 finale encodes a message with all three. In the second season, Vigenère ciphers are used in place of the various <b>monoalphabetic</b> ciphers, each using a key hidden within its episode.|$|E
5000|$|The affine cipher {{is a type}} of <b>monoalphabetic</b> {{substitution}} cipher, wherein {{each letter}} in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter. The formula used means that each letter encrypts to one other letter, and back again, meaning the cipher is essentially a standard substitution cipher with a rule governing which letter goes to which. As such, it has the weaknesses of all substitution ciphers. Each letter is enciphered with the function , where [...] is the magnitude of the shift.|$|E
50|$|In {{polyalphabetic}} substitution ciphers where the substitution alphabets are {{chosen by the}} use of a keyword, the Kasiski examination allows a cryptanalyst to deduce the length of the keyword. Once the length of the keyword is discovered, the cryptanalyst lines up the ciphertext in n columns, where n is the length of the keyword. Then each column can be treated as the ciphertext of a <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution cipher. As such, each column can be attacked with frequency analysis. Similarly, where a rotor stream cipher machine has been used, this method may allow the deduction of the length of individual rotors.|$|E

Just under half the listeners were adult, {{and it was a}} favorite of World War II United States Army Air Force) crews when they were stationed in the U.S. Radio premiums offered by the series (usually marked with Midnight's personal symbol of a winged clock with the hands pointing to midnight) included decoders. These Code-O-Graphs were used by listeners to decipher encrypted messages previewing the next day's episode, usually broadcast once a week. Other premiums included rings, telescopes, and World War II items. (The broadcast messages were encrypted with relatively trivial <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution ciphers with word division.) ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>monoalphabetic</b> {{substitution}} cipher {{such as the}} Caesar cipher can easily be broken, given {{a reasonable amount of}} ciphertext. This is achieved by frequency analysis of the different letters of the ciphertext, and comparing the result with the known distribution of letters {{in the language of the}} plaintext. With a polyalphabetic cipher, however, there is a different substitution alphabet for each successive character. So a frequency analysis shows an approximately uniform distribution, such as that obtained from a (pseudo) random number generator. By trying multiple putative chi-component partial key streams against the ciphertext, the Bletchley Park cryptanalysts were able to detect some of the underlying non-uniformity and so identify which partial key stream was likely to be correct.|$|E
5000|$|In {{classical}} cryptography, one of {{the earliest}} encryption methods was the simple substitution cipher, where letters in a message were systematically replaced using some secret scheme. <b>Monoalphabetic</b> substitution ciphers used only a single replacement scheme [...] - [...] sometimes termed an [...] "alphabet"; this could be easily broken, for example, by using frequency analysis. Somewhat more secure were schemes involving multiple alphabets, polyalphabetic ciphers. Because such schemes were implemented by hand, only a handful of different alphabets could be used; anything more complex would be impractical. However, using only a few alphabets left the ciphers vulnerable to attack. The invention of rotor machines mechanised polyalphabetic encryption, providing a practical way to use a much larger number of alphabets.|$|E
50|$|David Kahn {{notes in}} The Codebreakers that modern {{cryptology}} originated among the Arabs, {{the first people}} to systematically document cryptanalytic methods. The invention of the frequency-analysis technique for breaking <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution ciphers, by Al-Kindi, an Arab mathematician, sometime around AD 800 proved to be the single most significant cryptanalytic advance until World War II. Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma (Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages), in which he described the first cryptanalytic techniques, including some for polyalphabetic ciphers, cipher classification, Arabic phonetics and syntax, and most importantly, gave the first descriptions on frequency analysis. He also covered methods of encipherments, cryptanalysis of certain encipherments, and statistical analysis of letters and letter combinations in Arabic.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} known use of cryptography {{is found}} in non-standard hieroglyphs carved into {{the wall of a}} tomb from the Old Kingdom of Egypt circa 1900 BCE. These are not thought to be serious attempts at secret communications, however, but rather to have been attempts at mystery, intrigue, or even amusement for literate onlookers. These are examples of still other uses of cryptography, or of something that looks (impressively if misleadingly) like it. Some clay tablets from Mesopotamia somewhat later are clearly meant to protect information—one dated near 1500 BCE was found to encrypt a craftsman's recipe for pottery glaze, presumably commercially valuable. Later still, Hebrew scholars made use of simple <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution ciphers (such as the Atbash cipher) beginning perhaps around 500 to 600 BCE. In India around 400BCE to 200CE, Mlecchita vikalpa or the art of understanding writing in cypher, and the writing of words in a peculiar way was documented in the Kama Sutra for the purpose of communication between lovers. This was also likely a simple substitution cipher.|$|E
50|$|By the 1700s {{cryptanalysis}} {{was becoming}} industrialised, with teams of government cryptanalysts {{working together to}} crack the most complex <b>monoalphabetic</b> ciphers. Each European power had its own so called Black Chamber, a nerve centre for deciphering messages and gathering intelligence. The most celebrated, disciplined and efficient was the Geheime Kabinettskanzlei in Vienna. It operated according to a strict timetable, because it was vital that its activities should not interrupt the smooth running of the postal service. Letters which {{were supposed to be}} delivered to embassies in Vienna were first routed via the black chamber, arriving at 7 am. Secretaries melted seals, and a team of stenographers worked in parallel to make copies of the letters. Within three hours the letters had been resealed and returned to the central post office to be delivered to their intended destination. As well as supplying the emperors of Austria with vital intelligence, the Viennese Black Chamber sold the information it harvested to other European powers. In 1774, for example, an arrangement was made with Abbot Georgel, the secretary in the French Embassy, who had access to a bi-weekly package on information for 1,000 ducats.|$|E
5000|$|Kaczkowski {{was also}} a secret agent working for years on end in the 1860s for the Imperial Austria, one of the Partitioning Powers. His cover was blown in December 1863 when a partly {{encrypted}} diplomatic cable sent from Lwów to the central government in Vienna by Count Mensdorff-Pouilly, the Austrian steward of Galicia, was intercepted at the Lwów post-office and deciphered by the Polish underground, supposedly revealing the surname [...] "Kaczkowski" [...] (encoded with a <b>monoalphabetic</b> substitution cipher, without the first name being indicated) {{in the context of}} certain payments to be made to a person of that name. Although ready to defend himself, Kaczkowski was put on trial in absentia by the provincial Lwów organs of the insurrectionist Provisional National Government of Polandhis judges unwilling to confront him face to face and thereby to reveal their identitiesin seeming violation of the principle audi alteram partem of natural justice. By this authority, and in this way, he was declared guilty of espionage and sentenced to banishment from all Polish lands ("on pain of death") in January 1864, at the age of 38. Kaczkowski complied and left Polish territory within four days, as commanded by the writ of the sentence, but he never ceased to maintain his innocence, vigorously denying the charges levelled against him even in print, that the degree of harm caused by defamation was [...] "exponentially proportional to the degree of fame originally enjoyed by the victim". Indeed, the verdict against him was itself very promptly rescinded on appeal by the highest organs of the (underground) national government in Warsaw, and although a review of the case never took place, he lived out his days, chiefly in Paris, a man exonerated by default. [...] After his death, on his tombstone at the Champeaux cemetery in Montmorency there were inscribed, in Polish and in French, the words: [...] "A combattu toute sa vie par la plume pour la cause de sa Patrie" [...] (All his life fought with his pen for his Fatherland). [...] However, {{after the collapse of the}} Habsburg Monarchy in the following century, during the interbellum period when the secret archives of the state by then no longer in existence were finally opened to researchers, his role as a secret agent for the Austrians was indeed unequivocally demonstrated by the documents in his dossier examined by Eugeniusz Barwiński, the results of whose investigations were published in book form in 1920. [...] There is a consensus of opinion that this accomplished writer is today a forgotten figure of Polish literature, virtually erased from national consciousness (one of the [...] "absent greats"wielcy nieobecni), on account of the non-literary aspects of his biography.|$|E
