5|$|The Mississippi ships had poor {{seakeeping}} qualities, {{making them}} poor gunnery platforms underway in Atlantic waters. Their motion was irregular, and their low length-to-beam ratio caused excessive rolling and pitching, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> keep the guns on target. The reduced length, significantly cut {{away from the}} aft, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> keep the ships on a consistent course, even in smoother waters.|$|E
5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{political}} developments <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> hold large organised rallies at the site. Catalan political gatherings were banned during the 1923–1930 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, travel was difficult during the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War, and political gatherings were again banned during (and {{for some time}} after) the Franco dictatorship of 1939–1975.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the scholar}} István Boná, Thurisind's {{rise to power}} is a typical example of the {{conflicts}} among the leading families for the kingship that plagued Gepidia in the 6th century and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> maintain the succession within the king's family. To contain these obstacles Thurisind made Turismod, his oldest son, commander of the Gepid forces in Sirmium, an important position that made Turismod the king's heir apparent (in early Germanic custom the eldest son was not necessarily the first in line of succession). After Turismod died, his younger brother Cunimund became commander in Sirmium and thus heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|Bethesda Softworks {{developed}} a spin-off iOS game, Dishonored: Rat Assassin, which it released {{free of charge}} on 30 August 2012. The game requires players to use a knife and crossbow to kill rats while avoiding bombs. Rat Assassin was well received for the variety and quantity of content provided, but received some criticism for dark visuals, that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> see the rats. The game drew frequent comparisons to another mobile game, Fruit Ninja.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers was {{released}} for Windows in February 2016, after being greenlit for release on digital distribution platform Steam. OS X and Linux versions were released in July and September 2016 respectively. The game received a positive reception from reviewers, with praise directed towards its sound design, unique visual style and challenging gameplay. However, some reviewers noted {{that during the}} latter stages of the game, the overwhelming number of enemies and visual style <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> understand what was happening. Critics likened the aesthetics, movement and shooting mechanics of Devil Daggers to Doom, Quake and other first-person shooters of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b's {{existence}} was first suggested after observations by the six-telescope HATnet collaboration, {{a project that}} searches the sky for planets in transit of, or crossing in front of, their host stars. The presence of a planet in HAT-P-33's orbit had been suspected as early as 2004, although high levels of jitter were detected. This jitter, or a random and shaky appearance that clouds the accuracy of measurements, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> easily verify the radial velocity of the planetary candidate's host star, which usually leads summarily to the planet's confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Most nuthatches {{breed in}} the {{temperate}} or montane woodlands of the Northern Hemisphere, although two species {{have adapted to}} rocky habitats in the warmer and drier regions of Eurasia. However, the greatest diversity is in Southern Asia, and similarities between the species have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> identify distinct species. All members of this genus nest in holes or crevices. Most species are non-migratory and live in their habitat year-round, although the North American red-breasted nuthatch migrates to warmer regions during the winter. A few nuthatch species have restricted ranges and face threats from deforestation.|$|E

5|$|Overall, Hurricane Mitch killed about 7,000people in Honduras, with 11,000missing in {{the months}} after the storm. There were 8,000people listed as missing about ten days after Mitch struck, {{although}} problems with record-keeping <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine the exact total. Choluteca Department in the southern portion of the country had the most deaths, with 1,200 fatalities. Francisco Morazán Department, which includes Tegucigalpa, had about 1,000deaths, and Yoro Department had 911fatalities. There were deaths in every department, however. Many of the dead were buried in mass graves or were cremated. The storm injured 12,272people nationwide, mostly in Choluteca and Cortés departments.|$|E

She struggled professionally and, because of the loss of her mother, she suffered personally. The career that she relied upon kept her forever traveling, which had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> establish long-standing relationships.

5|$|The Party Play mode was {{inspired}} by recognizing that past Guitar Hero games <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> jump into without maneuvering {{through a number of}} menus and selection screens. The mode was designed to be used at social gatherings, and was adopted to use whatever instrument controllers that players already had available, thus allowing for various other combinations beyond the standard four-person band. This aspect of the game was then brought to the other band modes to allow the game to remain flexible.|$|E

5|$|The city of Nagasaki {{had been}} one of the largest {{seaports}} in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of , ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry. Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar.|$|E
5|$|The {{foggy weather}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> see {{positions}} from either side, but Frederick and his commanders used the fog to their advantage. Leaving a cavalry unit and {{a cluster of}} infantry {{in front of the}} northernmost end of the Austrian line (the Austrian right), Frederick deployed the remainder (and bulk) of his forces toward Leuthen itself; Charles saw them start their redeployment, and may have interpreted the maneuver as withdrawal, at least for a while.|$|E
5|$|This battle {{occurred}} on September 21–22, 1864. General Sheridan considered this battle {{a continuation of}} the Battle of Opequon near Winchester. General Early's Confederate army was pursued from Winchester to Fisher's Hill, where the rebels had strong fortifications and an advantageous location given the terrain. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment was still part of the 2nd Brigade led by Colonel Powell, who reported to General Averell. In this battle, the regiment initially engaged in some skirmishing while dismounted—the terrain <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> fight while mounted.|$|E
