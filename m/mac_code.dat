40|$|Abstract. Consider a {{collection}} of unsynchronized, half-duplex wireless nodes, communicating over a shared spectrum with local affine clocks. The clocks are unsynchronized {{in the sense that}} they do not tick at the same rate, called skew, and have different offsets. The nodes also do not know each others rates or offsets. In order for this collection of wireless nodes to even begin to perform any coordinated activity the nodes must first have the fundamental capability to communicate reliably in the presence of half-duplex constraints as well as packet collisions which occur when two or more nodes simultaneous transmit to a common receiver. Both scenarios are also known as primary and secondary conflicts, respectively. We present an orthogonal <b>MAC</b> <b>code</b> that allows any pair in this collection to exchange a message of size W within a bounded time, subject only to the restriction that the ratios of skews have a known upper bound. The orthogonal <b>MAC</b> <b>code</b> described and proved to function in this paper is an essential part of a larger protocol suite. The larger protocol suite addresses the problem of enabling {{a collection}} of unsynchronized, half-duplex wireless nodes to also form a fully functioning and indeed optimized wireless network even while under attack from any subset of unknown malicious agents. 1.

It is impossible that an outside attacker joins easily and successfully their trip in the V 2 I mode. During the period of applying for a new virtual group, to deliver the Req# from a vehicle to the Root through a RSU can achieve data integrity, source authentication, and non-repudiation of transmission. If the RSU uses a secret key shared with the Root to encrypt their operations with a <b>MAC</b> <b>code,</b> then delivering Req# or Resp# between them will achieve data confidentiality and integrity. In addition, any two BSUs communicate securely each other using a secret key or their public keys. In this case, the communication achieves data confidentiality and integrity.|$|E

3000|$|Before {{communicating}} with NCC, the mobile user computes a {{message authentication code}} (MAC) and sends it to NCC. Upon receiving the <b>MAC</b> <b>code,</b> NCC recovers the user master key to verify the received MAC. If it holds, NCC deduces the session key shared with the user from the user master key and the corresponding temporary identity. Then NCC generates a new temporary identity used in the next authentication phase by the user. The new temporary identity of the user is encrypted with the old one using the deduced session key. This encrypted message {{is sent to the}} user with its MAC as a response. Once the user has checked the validity of received MAC, the scheme ends.

Subsequently we present a simple suboptimal code for a class of MACs with arbitrarily varying sub-gaussian noise that uniformly requires O (k (N) { k, N }) channel uses for solving the activity detection problem.

40|$|This work {{considers}} space-time block coding for the Rayleigh fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{multiple access}} channel (MAC). If we {{suppose that the}} receiver is performing joint maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding, optimizing a MIMO <b>MAC</b> <b>code</b> against a fixed error event leads to {{a situation where the}} joint codewords of the users in error {{can be seen as a}} single user MIMO code. In such a case pair-wise error probability (PEP) based determinant criterion of Tarokh et al. can be used to upper bound the error probability. It was already proven by Lahtonen et al. that irrespective of the used codes the determinants of the differences of codewords of the overall codematrices will decay as a function of the rates of the users. This work will study this decay phenomenon further and derive upper bounds for the decay of determinants corresponding any error event. Lower bounds for the optimal decay are studied by constructions based on algebraic number theory and Diophantine approximation. For some error profiles the constructed codes will be proven to be optimal. While the perspective of the paper is that of PEP, the final part of the paper proves how the achieved decay results can be turned into statements about the diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off (DMT).

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{efficient}} privacy-preserving {{routing protocol}} USOR that achieves content un-observability by employing anonymous key establishment based on group signature. The setup of USOR is simple: In privacy-preserving communications can largely {{be divided into}} two categories: cryptosystem-based techniques and broadcasting-based techniques. The cryptosystem-based techniques include mix-based systems and secure multiparty computation-based systems, originating from mix net and DC-net respectively. Broadcasting based schemes provide communication privacy by mixing the real messages with dummy packets so that it is infeasible for the adversaries to identify the real packets and track the message source. First, an anonymous key establishment process is performed to construct secret session keys. Then an unobservable route discovery process is executed to find a route to the destination. This process is done by establishing session keys between two nodes. After verifying the signature between themselves, the anonymous key is established between these two nodes which mean the two nodes establish this key without knowing who the other party is. It can effectively prevent replay attacks and session key disclosure attack, and meanwhile, it achieves key confirmation for established session keys. This key establishment protocol uses elliptic curve Diffie- Hellman (ECDH) key exchange to replace Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and uses group signature to replace <b>MAC</b> <b>code.</b> In this protocol, both control packets and data packets look random and indistinguishable from dummy packets for outside adversaries. Only valid nodes can distinguish routing packets and data packets from dummy traffic with inexpensive symmetric decryption. I...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to seek the general solution of the complete Navier-Stokes equations governing heterogeneous, time-dependent, incompressible, viscous, laminar fluid dynamics through digital simulation. In particular, two-layered stratified flows are treated by using a numerical algorithm called the Marker-and-Cell extended method (MACE), which is an extension of the <b>MAC</b> <b>code</b> originated by the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. To provide the necessary background, the paper begins with a mathematical description of stratified flows. The controlling equations are the Navier-Stokes equations, the continuity relation, and the incompressible condition. These equations and various alternative formulations are presented in axiomatic form; care has been taken in this exposition so as to exhibit the hypotheses involved in analytical hydrodynamics. Necessary boundary conditions characterizing the physical states of the stratified fluids are also stated. The finite difference scheme of MACE algorithm is discussed in detail, and specific boundary conditions are derived for the MACE code allowing inflow and outflow capabilities, no-slip and free-slip boundary-layer considerations, and free-surface formulation. In order to place the MACE method on a solid mathematical foundation, a discussion of numerous aspects of stability and error are derived for the Navier-Stokes equations. The stability of the MACE numerical scheme and the convergence of the numerical solution to the theoretical solution are proven. An example involving two-layered stratified fluid flow with inflow and outflow is presented to show how the previously non-realizable solutions of the general Navier-Stokes equations can be computed systematically through this algorithm. The example was simulated digitally to obtain movie-frames illustrating various stages of the transient state of stratified flow patterns. A complete set of flow diagrams demonstrating the logical sequence of calculations by the MACE method is provided; a FORTRAN IV program listing is appended. Natural extensions of the MACE method are proposed to handle general heterogeneous fluids of both the continuum and the discrete layered stratification. The MACE method has great potential, for continuations of this method may lead to discover whether or not viscous, laminar fluid flow can be fully described by the fundamental Navier-Stokes equations...|$|E
