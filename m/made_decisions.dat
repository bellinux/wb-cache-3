5|$|The first {{member of}} the class to wear a star was Esteves, who was {{appointed}} adjutant general of Puerto Rico with the rank of brigadier general in February 1939. During World War II, Eisenhower and Bradley rose to four-star rank. They <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> that dramatically affected the careers of their classmates. Concerned that Major General Roscoe Woodruff, whose VII Corps was scheduled to spearhead the Normandy landings, had no amphibious experience, Bradley replaced him with Major General J. Lawton Collins. Woodruff returned to the United States. He later distinguished himself {{in command of the}} 24th Infantry Division in amphibious operations in the Philippines campaign.|$|E
5|$|This {{degree of}} control was {{reflected}} in negotiations held at various times between Croatian authorities and the RSK, as the Serbian leadership under Milošević was regularly consulted and frequently <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> {{on behalf of the}} RSK. The Erdut Agreement that ended the war was signed by a RSK minister on instructions from Milošević. The {{degree of control}} Serbia held over SFR Yugoslavia and later the RSK was evidenced through testimonies during the Milošević trial at the ICTY.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} the party leadership had split into pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese and moderate factions. Under Hồ {{the party had}} followed a policy of neutrality between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China {{in the aftermath of}} the Sino–Soviet split. This policy continued until reunification. In the aftermath of the war, a power struggle began between Lê Duẩn's pro-Soviet and its rival pro-Chinese factions. Former rivals Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ formed a coalition and purged the pro-Chinese faction. Their first victims were Hoàng Văn Hoan and Chu Văn Tấn. While the Politburo <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> through consensus, Lê Duẩn, through his post as General Secretary, was the most powerful figure and was able to increase his power via his alliance with Lê Đức Thọ, Trần Quốc Hoàn and Võ Nguyên Giáp. Together with Lê Đức Thọ, Lê Duẩn controlled personnel appointments in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the General Political Directorate of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), the General Logistics Department of the VPA and the Ministry of Transport.|$|E

5|$|Representation at the League {{was often}} a problem. Though it was {{intended}} to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919. Ruth Henig has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the Nazi Party less likely. Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with international incidents. The structure of the US federal government might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> on behalf of the executive branch without having the prior approval of the legislative branch.|$|E

50|$|A Ulysses pact or Ulysses {{contract}} is a freely <b>made</b> <b>decision</b> {{that is designed}} and intended to bind oneself in the future.

25|$|In 1999, however, ward {{boundaries}} were redrawn but {{management area}} boundaries were not.

Sheena sought new members to replace them, and asked pianist Ichiyo Izawa, who she had known since 2004, and Ryosuke Nagaoka, a gutiarist Sheena had met through her brother Junpei Shiina who often collaborated on her demo takes. The band began to record their second album Adult in July 2005.|$|E
25|$|The third {{step from}} {{political}} economy to economics was {{the introduction of}} marginalism and the proposition that economic actors <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> based on margins. For example, a person decides to buy a second sandwich based on how full {{he or she is}} after the first one, a firm hires a new employee based on the expected increase in profits the employee will bring. This differs from the aggregate decision making of classical political economy in that it explains how vital goods such as water can be cheap, while luxuries can be expensive.|$|E

25|$|The {{system of}} {{government}} in Spain was constituted by a polisynodial system of Councils which advised the monarch and <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> on his behalf about specific matters of government. In 1524 the Council of the Indies was established. Based in Castile, with the assignment of the governance of the Indies, it was thus responsible for drafting legislation, proposing the appointments to the King and pronouncing judicial sentences; as maximum authority in the ultramarine territories, the Council of The Indies took over both the institutions in the Indies as {{the defense of the}} interests of the Crown and of the aborigens.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the 1930s, {{automobile}} travel had begun to cut into the rail passenger market, somewhat reducing economies of scale, {{but it was the}} development of the Interstate Highway System and of commercial aviation in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as increasingly restrictive regulation, that dealt the most damaging blows to rail transportation, both passenger and freight. General Motors and other were convicted of running the streetcar industry into the ground purposefully in what {{is referred to as the}} Great American Streetcar Scandal. There was little point in operating passenger trains to advertise freight service when those who <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> about freight shipping traveled by car and by air, and when the railroads' chief competitors for that market were interstate trucking companies.|$|E
25|$|For many years, {{he wrote}} a monthly column for the {{bodybuilding}} magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 {{a year to the}} Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California. Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005. American Media Inc., which owns Muscle & Fitness and Flex, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.|$|E

25|$|During the Revolutionary War, four of {{the then}} six Iroquois nations were allied with the British, {{although}} bands <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> on fighting in a highly decentralized way. Conflict with the rebel colonists was fierce throughout the Mohawk Valley and western New York. In retaliation for conflicts to the east, the 1779 Sullivan Expedition was conducted against the Iroquois peoples in {{the west of the}} state, destroying more than 40 villages and stored winter crops. It destroyed the Tutelo village of Coregonal, located near what is now the junction of state routes 13 and 13A just south of the Ithaca city limits. Most Iroquois were forced from the state after the Revolutionary War, but some remnants remained. The state sold off the former Iroquois lands to stimulate development and settlement by European Americans; lands were also granted as payment to veterans of the war.|$|E
25|$|Each {{confederation}} {{had a key}} document explaining its goals, {{known as}} the act of the confederation, which was deposited with the court (usually the local court for the region the confederation was formed). Additional resolutions of the confederates, known as sanctia, would also be deposited with the court. Membership of the confederation was voluntary, and required an oath. The executive branch of a confederation was headed by a marshal, {{and a group of}} advisers, each known as konsyliarz konfederacji. A marshal and associated konsyliarze were known as a generality (generalność). A confederation would also have a larger council, similar to a parliament (walna rada), which <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> by majority vote. Until around the mid-18th century, resolutions of the council had to be unanimous, but afterwards, majority voting became more common. The chief military commanders of confederations were known as regimentarze.|$|E
25|$|Both William and Anne {{appointed}} {{and dismissed}} Cabinet members, attended meetings, <b>made</b> <b>decisions,</b> and {{followed up on}} actions. Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was {{an essential part of}} evolution of the Premiership. This process began after the Hanoverian Succession. Although George I (1714–1727) attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak fluent English and was bored with the discussions. George II (1727–1760) occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his grandson, George III (1760–1820), is known to have attended only two during his 60-year reign. Thus, the convention that Sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal indifference to the everyday tasks of governance. The Prime Minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, taking notes, and reporting to the Sovereign. These simple executive tasks naturally gave the Prime Minister ascendancy over his Cabinet colleagues.|$|E

25|$|Taishi Ci {{was from}} Huang County (黃縣), Donglai Commandery (東萊郡), {{which is in}} present-day Longkou, Shandong. As a youth, he was known for being studious. He served as a zoucaoshi (奏曹史; a minor official) in the local commandery office. Around 186, the commandery {{administration}} had a dispute with their superiors, the provincial administration of Qing Province. Both sides wrote to the imperial court in the capital Luoyang to complain about each other. At the time, since the imperial court often <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> on a first-come, first-served basis, it meant that the court would tend to rule in favour of the party whose document it received first. Since the provincial administration had already sent a courier to deliver their complaint letter, the Administrator (太守) of Donglai Commandery began to feel anxious and started {{looking for someone to}} help him deliver his letter. Taishi Ci, then 20 years old, was chosen for the task.|$|E
25|$|When Edsel Ford died prematurely in 1943, Henry Ford {{nominally}} resumed {{control of}} the company, {{but a series of}} strokes in the late 1930s had left him increasingly debilitated, and his mental ability was fading. Ford was increasingly sidelined, and others <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> in his name. The company was in fact controlled by a handful of senior executives led by Charles Sorensen, an important engineer and production executive at Ford; and Harry Bennett, the chief of Ford's Service Unit, Ford's paramilitary force that spied on, and enforced discipline upon, Ford employees. Ford grew jealous of the publicity Sorensen received and forced Sorensen out in 1944. Ford's incompetence led to discussions in Washington about how to restore the company, whether by wartime government fiat, or by instigating some sort of coup among executives and directors. Nothing happened until 1945 when, with bankruptcy a serious risk, Edsel's widow led an ouster and installed her son, Henry Ford II, as president. The young man took full control, and forced out Harry Bennett in a purge of the old guard in 1947.|$|E
25|$|During Wetz's lifetime, {{his works}} {{remained}} little known outside {{the circle of}} his devotees and music-lovers in his home region, {{to the point that}} he became nearly unknown after his death. Since that time, his compositions have continued to draw few fans despite the eagerness of his enthusiasts and his reputation as a great music pedagogue. Politically, Wetz <b>made</b> <b>decisions</b> towards {{the end of his life}} that may have had an effect on his standing after his death: after the end of the First World War, he became a confessed nationalist who saw the position of his vanquished Germany as a humiliation and longed for resurgence of national greatness, which seemed possible to him in 1933 with the seizure of power by the National Socialists (the Nazis). In May of that same year he enrolled into the Nazi Party and took over the leadership of the music department of the Erfurt branch of the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur, where he hoped he could thereby gain the goodwill and the support of the Nazi rulers. This, however, had little influence on his ability to spread his work, leaving him the role of composing primarily propaganda pieces.|$|E
