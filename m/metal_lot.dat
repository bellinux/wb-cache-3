What distinguishes “Singen Copper” from other coeval copper types? (i) is it a discrete <b>metal</b> <b>lot</b> with a uniform provenance (if so, can its provenance be constrained) ? (ii) was it manufactured by a special, unique metallurgical process that can be discriminated from others? Trace element concentrations can give clues on the ore types that were mined, {{but they can be}} modified (more or less intentionally) by metallurgical operations. A more robust indicator are the ratios of chemically similar elements (e. g. Co/Ni, Bi/Sb, etc.), since they should remain nearly constant during metallurgical operations, and are expected to behave homogeneously in each mineral of a given mining area, but their partition amongst the different mineral species is known to cause strong inter-element fractionations. We tested the trace element ratio pattern predicted by geochemical arguments on the Brixlegg mining area. Brixlegg itself is not compatible with the Singen Copper objects, and we only report it because it is a rare instance of a mining area for which sufficient trace element analyses are available in the literature. We observe that As/Sb in fahlerz varies by a factor 1. 8 above/below median; As/Sb in enargite varies by a factor of 2. 5 with a 10 times higher median. Most of the 102 analyzed metal objects from Singen are Sb-Ni-rich, corresponding to “antimony-nickel copper” of the literature. Other trace element concentrations vary by > 100 times, ratios by factors > 50. Pb isotopic compositions are all significantly different from each other. They do not form a single linear array and require > 3 ore batches that certainly do not derive from one single mining area. Our data suggest a heterogeneous provenance of “Singen copper”. Archaeological information limits the scope to Central European sources. LIA requires a diverse supply network from many mining localities, including possibly Brittany. Trace element ratios show more heterogeneity than LIA; this can be explained either by deliberate selection of one particular ore mineral (from very many sources) or by processing of assorted ore minerals from a smaller number of sources, with the unintentional effect that the quality of the copper would not be constant, as the metallurgical properties of alloys would vary with trace element concentrations...|$|E

Evaluations were conducted on two base <b>metal</b> <b>lots,</b> two filler <b>metal</b> <b>lots,</b> two heat input levels, and two welding processes. The material form was 0. 125 -inch (3. 175 -mm) alloy 718 sheet. Prior to welding, sheets were treated to either the ST or STA- 1 condition. After welding, panels were left as welded or heat treated to the STA- 1 condition, and weld beads were left intact or machined flush. Statistical analyses were performed on yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and high cycle fatigue (HCF) properties for all the post welded material conditions. Analyses of variance were performed on the data to determine if there were any significant effects on UTS or HCF life due to variations in base metal, filler metal, heat input level, or welding process. Statistical analyses showed that the GTAW-P process does produce welds with room temperature structural performance equivalent to current SSME welds manufactured by the GTAW process, regardless of prior material condition or post welding condition...|$|R

5000|$|The Show with No Name was {{a long-running}} (1995-2005) and highly popular public-access {{television}} cable TV show in Austin, Texas, hosted by Charlie Sotelo and the mysterious [...] "Cinco." [...] Each show featured clips of TV, film and music ephemera along with commentary by the hosts and calls from a predictably unruly public-access television audience. The clips were usually video snippets that captured a crazy moment of ephemeral history, such as Ed McMahon drunk on The Tonight Show, an early live TV appearance by Frank Zappa playing the bicycle and other found instruments, or the famously disastrous Andy Kaufman appearance on Fridays. Often they were obscure cult favorites only circulated underground, such as Heavy <b>Metal</b> Parking <b>Lot,</b> the profane bloopers {{of an actor}} in a Winnebago sales video, or Corey Haim's Me, Myself, and I. Many other clips simply presented a zeitgeist gone by: a trailer for an Akira Kurosawa or Sam Peckinpah film, a Bill Hicks comedy set, or Bob Dylan appearing on the Johnny Cash show.|$|R
