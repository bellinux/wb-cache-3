500|$|The End of the Road is in a {{realistic}} style that <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> surprise to those familiar only with Barth's later books. [...] The narrator avoids naturalistic descriptions of his surroundings, {{and most other}} details, and describes the physical aspects of life (especially of women) with disgust or contempt. [...] He indulges in occasional bursts of eloquence: [...] "A turning down of dinner damped, in ways subtle past knowing, manic keys on the flute of me, least pressed of all, which for a moment had shrilled me rarely". [...] The realism is not a conventional everyday realism: the situations themselves are fantastic, though plausible.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is also a}} repeating binary {{fraction}} 0.0... It <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{surprise that}} terminating decimal fractions can have repeating expansions in binary. It {{is for this reason}} that many are surprised to discover that 0.1 + ... + 0.1, (10 additions) differs from 1 in floating point arithmetic. In fact, the only binary fractions with terminating expansions are of the form of an integer divided by a power of 2, which 1/10 is not.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, this {{retrospective}} {{comparative study}} has demonstrated {{the impact of}} different femoral stem lengths in THA on gait at differing speeds and inclines. It has revealed the near symmetrical function of patients with a new short femoral stem THA and encouragingly demonstrates no disadvantage when compared to a well-established long femoral stem device. It confirms that the Evolution short stemmed THA is safe in human hips {{in the short term}} and <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attraction to long stemmed user who is interested in maintaining the flexibility of the proximal femur in the long term.|$|R

2500|$|There is no {{difficulty}} whatsoever in obtaining models of static spherically symmetric stellar models, {{in which a}} perfect fluid interior is matched across a spherical surface, {{the surface of the}} star, to a vacuum exterior which is in fact a region of the Schwarzschild vacuum. [...] In fact, it is possible to write down all these static stellar models in a way which makes clear that they exist in plenitude. [...] Given this success, it <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nasty shock that it seems to be very difficult, mathematically speaking, to construct rotating stellar models in which a perfect fluid interior is matched to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior. [...] This observation is the basis of the most prominent technical objection to the notion of asymptotic flatness in general relativity.|$|E
6000|$|The {{necessity}} for this variety of occupation {{is shown by}} {{a letter from a}} gentleman named Charles Gordon, living near Plainfield, to his brother, Dr. John Gordon, in England, in which he says, [...] "If you design to come hither, you <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> planter or merchant; but as a doctor of medicine I cannot advise you, for I hear of no diseases to cure but some agues and some cutted legs and fingers." [...] Other physicians gave up their professions {{at the beginning of the}} Revolution, and became prominent in military matters.|$|E
60|$|We see, then, {{that there}} is an {{intimate}} connection between the two subjects--human associations in the colouring of flowers and in the voices of birds; and that in both cases this association constitutes, or is a principal element in, the expression. This connection, {{and the fact that the}} present subject was suggested and appeared almost an inevitable outcome of the one last discussed, must be my excuse for introducing a chapter on flowers in a book on birds--or birds and man. But an excuse is hardly needed. It must strike most readers that a great fault of books on birds is, {{that there is}} too much about birds in them, consequently that a chapter about something else, which has not exactly been dragged in, <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> positive relief.|$|E

40|$|Hölderlin’s {{interest}} in Geography is not widely known and <b>may</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> surprise to some readers of his works. Hölderlin’s writing is more {{commonly associated with}} idealism and spiritual themes rather than with scientific positivism. However, many of Hölderlin’s Poems and his Novel Hyperion describe geographic features such as rivers, mountains, landscapes and cityscapes. Hölderlin, {{like many of his}} generation, was inspired by the recent discovery of new Worlds and Lands, and fascinated by the descriptions of new Civilizations and Cultures, which opened up new horizons for the old Europe. This paper analyses some of Hölderlin’s own landscape descriptions and reveals the importance of places in his works and the impact of new geographic discoveries on his writing generally...|$|R
25|$|It is also {{suggested}} that Päts's bad health and loneliness did not let him realistically analyze the situation. Furthermore, {{it is suggested that}} Päts and his cabinet lacked the necessary knowledge in international affairs and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany <b>may</b> have <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shock to the Päts cabinet.|$|R
60|$|The {{practical}} person, to {{whom this}} <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new idea and who wishes not to waste {{any time in}} experiments, would doubtless like to hear how the plan works. He will say that he certainly wants all the happiness to be {{got out of his}} rambles, {{but it is clear that}} without the book in his pocket he would miss many interesting things: Would the greater degree of pleasure experienced in the others be a sufficient compensation? I should say that he would gain more than he would lose; that vivid interest and pleasure in a few things is preferable to that fainter, more diffused feeling experienced in the other case. Again, we have to take into account the value to us of the mental pictures gathered in our wanderings. For we know that only when a scene is viewed emotionally, when it produces in us a shock of pleasure, does it become a permanent possession of the mind; in other words, it registers an image which, when called up before the inner eye, is capable of reproducing a measure of the original delight.|$|E
