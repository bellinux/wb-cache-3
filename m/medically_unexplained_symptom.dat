50|$|AFP {{has also}} been {{described}} as a <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptom,</b> which are thought by some to be largely psychogenic in nature. However, true psychogenic pain is considered to be rare. Some sources have assigned or categorized AFP as a psychosomatic manifestation of somatoform disorder, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association. Distinction should be made between somatoform disorder, where affected individuals are not inventing the symptom for some benefit, and other conditions like factitious disorder or malingering.|$|E
50|$|The main {{features}} of AFP are: no objective signs, negative results with all investigations/ tests, no obvious {{explanation for the}} cause of the pain, and a poor response to attempted treatments. AFP has been described variably as a <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptom,</b> a diagnosis of exclusion, a psychogenic cause of pain (e.g. a manifestation of somatoform disorder), and as a neuropathy. AFP is usually burning and continuous in nature, and may last for many years. Depression and anxiety are often associated with AFP, which are either described as a contributing cause of the pain, or the emotional consequences of suffering with unrelieved, chronic pain. For unknown reasons, AFP is significantly more common in middle aged or elderly people, and in females.|$|E

40|$|Aims Paediatricians {{often see}} {{children}} and young people with emotional difficulties manifesting as physical illness, sometimes called <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Mental health training for general paediatricians is often lacking which can result in over-medicalisation of the problem. Recent political and media attention has been focused on the need to improve mental health provision for child and young people. Given the demands on Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, attempts at improving the skills of paediatricians in assessing and treating children with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> could help ease pressure and improve care. Methods We evaluated the impact on paediatric trainees’ confidence of a series of workshops about <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Five workshops were facilitated by a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychotherapist and took the form of case discussions.

Many {{have a history}} of trauma, which complicates the therapeutic relationship between doctor and patient. Because diagnosis is an expected outcome of a medical interaction, doctors and patients can feel frustrated and lost without one. Objective This article provides practical management strategies that general practitioners (GPs) can use when patients present with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Discussion Three types of common presentations are discussed. Enigmatic illnesses occur when the doctor and patient believe that a bio-medical disease is likely, but a diagnosis is not forthcoming. Contested illnesses occur when a patient is committed to a diagnosis the doctor does not accept. Chaotic illnesses occur when symptoms are over-determined; there are many possible diagnoses, but none fully explain the complex web of distress the patient experiences. Common strategies for managing <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> are discussed, and specific approaches to each presentation are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{relationship}} between symptom attitudes and negative affect has consistently {{been found in}} a range of different symptom domains. Little is known, however, about the role of different aspects of the self in this rela-tionship. We explored the mediating role of in-terferences of symptom with the self-concept in the association of menstrual symptom attitudes and depressive mood. Methods: Eighty-one women completed an online survey on men-strual symptom attitudes, perceived interfer-ences of symptoms with various self-aspects and negative mood states. We tested our hy-pothesis in a mediation analysis. Results: We found a complete mediation of the relationship of symptom attitudes and depressive mood by interferences of symptoms with self-aspects. However, interferences with self-aspects did not {{play a role in the}} association of anxious mood and symptom report. Conclusion: The self- concept should receive greater attention in re-search on symptom attitudes and psychological well-being. This would be particularly important in research on <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptom</b> report...|$|E

When the symptoms of pain and physical problems do not respond to various therapeutic approaches such as medication, physiotherapy, and psychotherapy, they are often called medically unexplained symptoms. As such, these symptoms are reported to be a response to stressful situations or emotional states, often unknown to patients themselves. To explore the effectiveness of noninvasive radioelectric brain stimulation in the amelioration of symptoms of pain and physical problems, we administered a neuropsychophysical optimization protocol using a REAC device. Methods: The PSM, a self-administered questionnaire, was used to measure psychological stress and pain and physical problems in a group of 888 subjects. Data were collected immediately prior to and following a 4 -week REAC treatment cycle. Results: There was a significant reduction in scores measuring subjective perceptions of stress for subjects treated with one cycle of neuropsychophysical optimization REAC-BS. At the end of the study, the number of treated subjects reporting symptoms of stress-related pain and physical problems on the PSM test was significantly reduced, whereas there was no difference in placebo-treated subjects. Conclusion: One cycle of neuropsychophysical optimization REAC-BS appears to reduce subjective perceptions of stress as measured by the PSM, particularly on the pain and physical problems cluster.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in adults with SSD. However, no studies have been conducted yet into CBT for SSD in later life. Objectives: We explored the feasibility of CBT for SSD in the elderly. Methods: This is a prospective pilot study comparing two outpatient specialty mental health settings for adults (< 60  years; n= 13) and for elderly patients (≥ 60  years; n= 9) with SSD. Intervention was 18 structured, protocoled, and supervised CBT sessions. Outcomes were somatic symptoms, pain intensity, pain disability, quality of life, depressive symptoms, and generalized anxiety symptoms. Feasibility of the CBT intervention was explored with self-developed questions, both for the therapists and the patients. Results: Both therapists and elderly patients evaluated the treatment as positive. Somatic symptoms improved significantly in the adult group but not in the elderly group. There was a large, significant decrease in pain intensity and pain disability in elderly patients compared to the adults. Social functioning, vitality, and anxiety symptoms improved significantly in the adults. Presence of chronic medical conditions did not influence these results. Conclusion: This study shows that CBT is feasible as a treatment for SSD in older adults and has encouraging results. Replication in an RCT is warranted.

40|$|In Australia, little {{research}} has been undertaken on the developtnent of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to assist with the impact of postdeployment ill-health including <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> (MUS) and it, has been unclear whether such a development is desired by Australian primary care practitioners. In response an empirical investigation into the perceptions and experiences of 24 medical officers from the Australian military with regard to postdeployment ill-health, <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and the potential development of CPGs in this area was undertaken. The analysis suggests that although MUS are accepted as common in general practice they are not perceived by practitioners to be as prevalent in the Australian Defense Forces.

40|$|Fibromyalgia (FM) {{is defined}} as a widely {{distributed}} pain. While many rheumatologists and pain physicians have considered it to be a pain disorder, psychiatry, psychology, and general medicine have deemed it to be a syndrome (FMS) or psychosomatic disorder. The lack of concrete structural and/or pathological evidence has made patients suffer prejudice that FMS is a <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptom,</b> implying inauthenticity. Furthermore, FMS often exhibits comorbidity with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or spondyloarthritis (SpA), both of which show similar indications. In this study, disease specific biomarkers were sought in blood samples from patients to facilitate objective diagnoses of FMS, and distinguish it from RA and SpA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients and healthy donors (HD) were subjected to multicolor flow cytometric analysis. The percentage of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in PBMCs and the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of cell surface antigen expression in MAIT cells were analyzed. There was a decrease in the MAIT cell population in FMS, RA, and SpA compared with HD. Among the cell surface antigens in MAIT cells, three chemokine receptors, CCR 4, CCR 7, and CXCR 1, a natural killer (NK) receptor, NKp 80, a signaling lymphocyte associated molecule (SLAM) family, CD 150, a degrunulation marker, CD 107 a, and a coreceptor, CD 8 β emerged as potential biomarkers for FMS to distinguish from HD. Additionally, a memory marker, CD 44 and an inflammatory chemokine receptor, CXCR 1 appeared possible markers for RA, while a homeostatic chemokine receptor, CXCR 4 deserved for SpA to differentiate from FMS. Furthermore, the drug treatment interruption resulted in alternation of the expression of CCR 4, CCR 5, CXCR 4, CD 27, CD 28, inducible costimulatory molecule (ICOS), CD 127 (IL- 7 receptor α), CD 94, NKp 80, an activation marker, CD 69, an integrin family member, CD 49 d, and a dipeptidase, CD 26, in FMS. Combined with the currently available diagnostic procedures and criteria, analysis of MAIT cells offers a more objective standard for the diagnosis of FMS, RA, and SpA, which exhibit multifaceted and confusingly similar clinical manifestations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{successful}} {{introduction of}} new methods for managing <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> in primary care is dependent {{to a large degree}} on the attitudes, experiences and expectations of practitioners. As part of an exploratory randomised controlled trial of reattribution training, we sought the views of participating practitioners on patients with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and on the value of and barriers to the implementation of reattribution in practice. Methods A nested attitudinal survey and qualitative study in sixteen primary care teams in north-west England. All practitioners participating in the trial (n = 74) were invited to complete a structured survey. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with a purposive sub-sample of survey respondents, using a structured topic guide. Interview transcripts were used to identify key issues, concepts and themes, which were grouped to construct a conceptual framework: this framework was applied systematically to the data. Results Seventy (95 %) of study participants responded to the survey. Survey respondents often found it stressful to work with patients with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms,</b> though those who had received reattribution training were more optimistic about their ability to help them. Interview participants trained in reattribution (n = 12) reported that reattribution increased their confidence to practice in a difficult area, with heightened awareness, altered perceptions of these patients, improved opportunities for team-building and transferable skills. However general practitioners also reported potential barriers to the implementation of reattribution in routine clinical practice, {{at the level of the}} patient, the doctor, the consultation, diagnosis and the healthcare context. Conclusion Reattribution training increases practitioners' sense of competence in managing patients with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms.</b> However, barriers to its implementation are considerable, and frequently lie outside the control of a group of practitioners generally sympathetic to patients with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> and the purpose of reattribution. These findings add further to the evidence of the difficulty of implementing reattribution in routine general practice. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: As {{patients}} with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> physical <b>symptoms</b> may present frequently to hospital settings and receive potentially unnecessary investigations and treatments, we aimed {{to assess the}} frequency and type of <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> physical <b>symptoms</b> presentations to clinical services and estimate the associated direct healthcare costs. Methods: This study was undertaken at the largest district health board in New Zealand. All {{patients with}} a diagnosed presentation of <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> physical <b>symptoms</b> in 2013 were identified using the district health board’s clinical coding system. The clinical records (medical and psychiatric) of 49 patients were examined in detail to extricate all <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> physical symptoms–related secondary care activity within 6 [*]months before or after their <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> physical <b>symptoms</b> presentation. Standardised national costing methodology was {{used to calculate the}} associated healthcare costs. Results: In all, 49 % of patients attended hospital settings at least twice during 2013. The majority of presentations were for neurological or respiratory concerns. The total cost for the sample was GBP 89, 636 (median: GBP 1, 221). Costs were most significant in the areas of inpatient admissions and emergency care. Conclusion: <b>Medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> physical <b>symptoms</b> result in frequent presentations to hospital settings. The costs incurred are substantial and comparable to the costs of chronic medical conditions with identifiable pathology. Improving recognition and management of <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> physical <b>symptoms</b> has potential to offer more appropriate and cost-effective healthcare outcomes...|$|R
50|$|<b>Medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> {{physical}} <b>symptoms</b> (MUPS or MUS) are symptoms {{for which}} a treating physician or other healthcare providers have found no medical cause, or whose cause remains contested.

Typically, the possibility that MUPS are caused by prescription drugs or other drugs is ignored. However, in practice, most physicians and authors who use the term consider that the symptoms most likely arise from psychological causes. It is estimated that between 15% and 30% of all primary care consultations are for <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms.</b> A large Canadian community survey revealed that the most common <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> are musculoskeletal pain, ear, nose, and throat symptoms, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, and dizziness.

40|$|Background: Patients {{presenting}} {{in primary}} care frequently exhibit physical symptoms that may be unrelated to organic pathology. Such symptoms are commonly regarded as products of psychological or emotional problems, and their legitimacy as ‘medical’ matters is often called into question. Objectives: Our aim was to explore GPs' attitudes to the management of patients that present with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{in primary care}}. Methods: Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 15 GPs in North-West England. Interviews were audio-taped and subsequently transcribed and analysed using a constant com-parison technique. Results: Subjects conceptualized patients presenting with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> as the presentation of psychological distress. They presented problems of control and authority in the consultation, and difficulties in managing this had a negative impact on the doctor–patient relationship. Such consultations were frustrating for the GP and potentially harmful to the patient. Conclusion: Patients with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> were seen to be presenting with inappropriate symptoms that were a manifestation of emotional or social distress. GPs felt ill-equipped to deal with the presentations and the frustrations they felt and may need help in actively and productively managing these patients. <br/...|$|R

This is frequently the case in patients with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms.</b> It is hypothesized that these patients {{are more likely than}} patients from other groups to incorrectly recall the likelihoods of medical explanations provided by doctors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Thirty-three patients with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms,</b> 22 patients with major depression, and 30 healthy controls listened to an audiotaped medical report, as well as to two control reports. After listening to the reports, participants were asked to rate what the doctor thinks the likelihood is that the complaints are caused by a specific medical condition. Although the doctor rejected most of the medical explanations for the symptoms in his verbal report, the patients with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> complaints remembered a higher likelihood for medical explanations for their symptoms. No differences were found between patients in the other groups, and for the control conditions. When asked to imagine that the reports were applicable to themselves, patients with multiple medical complaints reported more concerns about their health state than individuals in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be aware that patients with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> recall the likelihood of medical causes for their complaints incorrectly.

We will explain why the foundational assumptions following the biomedical model do not work well when approaching patients that suffer from MUS. Further we will describe the prevalence, management and suggested pathology of NSCLBP and relate this to stress-physiology and allostatic load.

Cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy have proven effective in these patients. However, there are few studies {{on the effectiveness of}} psychosocial interventions by primary health care. The project aims to determine whether a cognitive-behavioral group intervention in patients with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms,</b> is more effective than routine clinical practice {{to improve the quality of}} life measured by the SF- 12 questionary at 12 [*]month. Methods/design This study involves a community based cluster randomized trial in primary healthcare centres in Madrid (Spain). The number of patients required is 242 (121 in each arm), all between 18 and 65 of age with <b>medically</b> <b>unexplained</b> <b>symptoms</b> that had seeked medical attention in primary care at least 10 times during the previous year. The main outcome variable is the quality of life measured by the SF- 12 questionnaire on Mental Healthcare. Secondary outcome variables include number of consultations, number of drug (prescriptions) and number of days of sick leave together with other prognosis and descriptive variables.
