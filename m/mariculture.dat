5|$|Because {{of their}} rapid growth rate, short life span, and {{tolerance}} to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids {{are regarded as}} one of the most promising species for <b>mariculture.</b> Although there have been several studies about this, there have been no reported commercial-scale cultures, as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Production of bivalve {{molluscs}} by <b>mariculture</b> in 2010 was 12,913,199 tons, up from 8,320,724 tons in 2000. Culture of clams, cockles and ark shells {{more than doubled}} over this time period from 2,354,730 to 4,885,179 tons. Culture of mussels {{over the same period}} grew from 1,307,243 to 1,812,371 tons, of oysters from 3,610,867 to 4,488,544 tons and of scallops from 1,047,884 to 1,727,105 tons.|$|E
5|$|The diet of bigfin reef squids {{comprises}} mainly crustaceans {{and small}} fish. They {{are found in}} the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are fished in vast quantities for human food in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, short life span, and tolerance to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are {{regarded as one of the}} most promising species for <b>mariculture.</b> They are also a valuable source of giant axons for medical research.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and <b>mariculture</b> has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated <b>mariculture</b> has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|Land-based or {{near-shore}} sites {{can also}} support <b>mariculture</b> or chilled water agriculture. Tanks or lagoons built on shore allow workers {{to monitor and}} control miniature marine environments. <b>Mariculture</b> products can be delivered to market via standard transport.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mariculture</b> is {{the culture}} of marine organisms in seawater. The islands in the Maldives {{are too small to}} have inland fisheries, nor are there land based {{aquaculture}} activities at present. Fishing occurs in reef, coastal and offshore waters. However, various forms of <b>mariculture</b> are being experimentally trialled, such as {{the culture of}} pearls, giant clams, spiny lobsters, bêche-de-mer and grouper.|$|E
25|$|Aquaculture is {{the general}} term given to the {{cultivation}} of any fresh or salt water plant or animal. It takes place in New Zealand in coastal marine areas (<b>mariculture)</b> and in inland tanks or enclosures.|$|E
25|$|Marine aquaculture, <b>mariculture,</b> {{occurs in}} the sea, {{generally}} in sheltered bays along the coast. In New Zealand, about 70 percent of marine aquaculture {{occurs in the}} top of the South Island. In the North Island, the Firth of Thames is productive.|$|E
25|$|After graduation, Sadkin {{worked with}} Jim Hendee at a sea turtle farm called <b>Mariculture,</b> Ltd. on Grand Cayman Island, where they both lived on Seven Mile Beach, {{a few miles}} from the town of Hell. During their six months of living and SCUBA diving there, they got their first taste of playing reggae at several clubs around the island.|$|E
25|$|Biofouling is {{also found}} in almost all {{circumstances}} where water-based liquids are in contact with other materials. Industrially important impacts are on the maintenance of <b>mariculture,</b> membrane systems (e.g., membrane bioreactors and reverse osmosis spiral wound membranes) and cooling water cycles of large industrial equipment and power stations. Biofouling can occur in oil pipelines carrying oils with entrained water, especially those carrying used oils, cutting oils, oils rendered water-soluble through emulsification, and hydraulic oils.|$|E
25|$|Fish farming or {{pisciculture}} involves raising fish commercially {{in tanks}} or enclosures such as fish ponds, usually for food. It {{is the principal}} form of aquaculture, while other methods may fall under <b>mariculture.</b> A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally {{referred to as a}} fish hatchery. Worldwide, the most important fish species produced in fish farming are carp, tilapia, salmon, and catfish.|$|E
25|$|Potential {{development}} {{areas for}} freshwater aquaculture include 960,000 hectares of agricultural water bodies, 143,000 hectares of ponds, plus other areas in big lakes and water reservoirs suitable for cage farming. The National Project on Agricultural Sector development (Federal Agency of Fishery, 2006) {{has set a}} target for 2020 of 1.4 million tonnes from freshwater aquaculture and 400 thousand tonnes from <b>mariculture.</b> The federal government is considering a subsidy of two-thirds of the credit needed to construct and modernise aquaculture facilities.|$|E
25|$|Land-based and {{near-shore}} facilities offer {{three main}} advantages over those located in deep water. Plants constructed {{on or near}} land do not require sophisticated mooring, lengthy power cables, or the more extensive maintenance associated with open-ocean environments. They can be installed in sheltered areas {{so that they are}} relatively safe from storms and heavy seas. Electricity, desalinated water, and cold, nutrient-rich seawater could be transmitted from near-shore facilities via trestle bridges or causeways. In addition, land-based or near-shore sites allow plants to operate with related industries such as <b>mariculture</b> or those that require desalinated water.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s {{brought a}} breakthrough, with self-polishing paints which used seawater's ability to hydrolize the paint's {{copolymer}} bond and release the stored toxin at a slow, controlled rate. These paints employed organotin chemistry ("tin-based") biotoxins such as tributyltin oxide (TBT) and were effective {{for up to}} 4 years. The discovery that these biotoxins have severe impact on <b>mariculture,</b> with biological effects to marine life at a concentration of 1 nanogram per liter, led to their worldwide ban by the International Maritime Organization in October 2001. TBT in particular {{has been described as}} the most toxic pollutant ever deliberately released in the ocean.|$|E
25|$|Ryther and {{co-workers}} created modern, integrated, intensive, land <b>mariculture.</b> They originated, both theoretically and experimentally, the integrated use of extractive organismsshellfish, microalgae and seaweedsin {{the treatment of}} household effluents, descriptively and with quantitative results. A domestic wastewater effluent, mixed with seawater, was the nutrient source for phytoplankton, which in turn became food for oysters and clams. They cultivated other organisms in a food chain rooted in the farm's organic sludge. Dissolved nutrients in the final effluent were filtered by seaweed (mainly Gracilaria and Ulva) biofilters. The value of the original organisms grown on human waste effluents was minimal.|$|E
25|$|Farming {{in the sea}} (<b>mariculture)</b> for {{king salmon}} is {{sometimes}} called sea-cage ranching. Sea-cage ranching takes place in large floating net cages, about 25 metres across and 15 metres deep, moored to the sea floor in clean, fast-flowing coastal waters. Smolt (young fish) from freshwater hatcheries are transferred to cages containing several thousand salmon, and remain there {{for the rest of}} their life. They are fed fishmeal pellets high in protein and oil. Most of this fishmeal is imported from Australia. The salmon are harvested when they are about two years old, weighing 2.5 to 4 kilograms. Sea cages are located in the Marlborough Sounds, Akaroa Harbour and Stewart Island.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture and {{fisheries}} industry together account for 5% of GDP. The Bahamas exports lobster and some fish {{but does not}} raise these items commercially. There is no largescale agriculture, and most agricultural products are consumed domestically. The Bahamas imports more than $250 million in foodstuffs per year, representing about 80% of its food consumption. The government aims to expand food production to reduce imports and generate foreign exchange. It actively seeks foreign investment aimed at increasing agricultural exports, particularly specialty food items. The government officially lists beef and pork production and processing, fruits and nuts, dairy production, winter vegetables, and <b>mariculture</b> (shrimp farming) as {{the areas in which}} it wishes to encourage foreign investment.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominantly}} blue-green iridescent {{shell of}} abalone (or paua; genus Haliotis) is one last possible imitation. Abalone shell is inexpensive and plentiful {{owing to the}} commercial <b>mariculture</b> of these gastropods for their meat. The shell's structure is distinctive: sinuous bands of blue, green, and rose iridescence are delineated by dark brown lines of conchiolin, a proteinaceous material that holds the shell together. The luster of abalone shell is silky rather than the near vitreous luster of polished ammolite, and {{the colors of the}} two materials do not closely approximate. However, some abalone shell has been dyed and given a transparent cap of synthetic quartz, forming a doublet in the same fashion as ammolite. These doublets are perhaps the most deceptive, and have also been used to imitate opal. Under magnification most abalone doublets will show dye concentrated along certain areas and air bubbles trapped at the shell-quartz interface.|$|E
500|$|As of 2006, {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 43.5 million people involved in capturing or raising seafood, 85.5% of whom lived in Asia. About [...] were fishers and the remainder fish farmers. In 2012, total global production of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals was a record 158 million metric tons (174 million tons), of which 91.3 million metric tons (100 million tons) {{were caught in the}} wild. This is also a record if ignoring the Peruvian anchovy, whose population can vary dramatically with the El Niño cycle. The overall trend remains increasing, but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and <b>mariculture</b> in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild. The exclusive economic zones around coastal countries under the UNCLOS regime have permitted states to institute quota and other management systems over the most productive regions of the sea, accounting for around 87% of the annual harvest. The results are sometimes dramatic—the lull in fishing {{over the course of the}} First World War saw the North Sea's 1919 catch double 1913's—and sometimes much less so: two decades on, the levels of cod in the Grand Banks remain only 10% of their peak. At present, the species most frequently landed are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, and salmon. A number of these, as well as large predatory fish, remain well below historical levels.|$|E

2500|$|Salmonids {{are usually}} farmed in two stages {{and in some}} places maybe more. First, the salmon are hatched from eggs and raised on land in {{freshwater}} tanks. Increasing the accumulated thermal units of water during incubation reduces time to hatching. [...] When they are 12 to 18 months old, the smolt (juvenile salmon) are transferred to floating sea cages or net pens anchored in sheltered bays or fjords along a coast. This farming in a marine environment is known as <b>mariculture.</b> There they are fed pelleted feed for another 12 to 24 months, when they are harvested.|$|E
2500|$|Worldwide, in 2007, [...] of farmed Chinook salmon were {{harvested}} with a {{value of}} $83 million. New Zealand is the largest producer of farmed king salmon, accounting for over half of world production (7,400 tonnes in 2005).

When the international markets were closed by regulations that did not allow even farm-bred turtle products to be exported internationally, the surviving farm became primarily a tourist attraction, supporting 11,000 turtles. Inintially started as <b>Mariculture</b> Ltd., then Cayman Turtle Farm Ltd and subsequently branded Boatswain's Beach, in 2010 the farm's brandname was changed to Cayman Turtle Farm: Island Wildlife Encounter.|$|E
