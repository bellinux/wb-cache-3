5|$|Sarria and Parker worked {{together}} through both seasons of the New York fair, Expo 67 in Montreal, HemisFair '68 in San Antonio, Texas and Expo '74 in Spokane, Washington, after which Sarria retired. He and Parker moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where Sarria lived until returning to San Francisco in 1977. He remained politically active, endorsing the candidacies of Harvey <b>Milk</b> <b>for</b> the Board of Supervisors. In 1977, Milk {{would win the}} board seat that Sarria had sought in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Females den {{in hollow}} trees. Kits are born blind and helpless. They are {{partially}} covered with fine hair. Kits begin to crawl after about 3 weeks. After about 7 weeks they open their eyes. They start to climb after 8 weeks. Kits are completely {{dependent on their}} mother's <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> the first 8–10 weeks, after which they begin {{to switch to a}} solid diet. After 4 months, kits become intolerant of their litter mates, and at 5 months, the mother pushes them out on their own. After one year, juveniles will have established their own range.|$|E
5|$|Incubation {{takes two}} weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are {{strongly}} altricial, being helpless at hatching {{and covered with}} down. Both parents feed the squabs pigeon's milk (dove's <b>milk)</b> <b>for</b> the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. Fledging takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs are fully grown but after {{they are capable of}} digesting adult food. They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after fledging.|$|E

5|$|Malabi is {{a creamy}} pudding {{originating}} from Turkey prepared with milk or almond <b>milk</b> (<b>for</b> a kosher version) and cornstarch. It is {{sold as a}} street food from carts or stalls, in disposable cups with thick sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving richer and more sophisticated versions using various toppings and garnishes such as berries and fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{take place at the}} end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|Nelson is an {{advocate}} for better treatment for horses and has been campaigning for {{the passage of the}} American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act (H.R. 503/S. 311) alongside the Animal Welfare Institute. He is on its board of directors and has adopted a number of horses from Habitat for Horses. In 2008, Nelson signed on to warn consumers about the cruel and illegal living conditions for calves raised to produce <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> dairy products. He wrote letters to Land O'Lakes and Challenge Dairy, two of the major corporations that use milk from calves raised at California's Mendes Calf Ranch, which employs an intensive confinement practice that {{was the subject of a}} lawsuit and campaign brought by the Animal Legal Defense Fund.|$|E

5|$|Some of Bellerophons timber {{was bought}} at auction by George Bellamy, {{who had been}} Bellerophons surgeon at the Nile. Bellamy {{incorporated}} them into a cottage he was building at Plymstock. Captain Maitland bought part of her figurehead {{and some of her}} stern ornaments, later depositing them in the collections of what eventually became the Royal Naval Museum. The National Maritime Museum holds several relics relating to Bellerophon and the people connected with her, including Captain John Cooke's dirk, sword and pistol, and a trophy presented to Admiral Pasley by Lloyd's of London.

40|$|Heritability estimates, by year of {{freshening}} of daughter, {{were obtained}} from daughter-dam and granddaughter-granddam regressions using 61, 482 triply matched first lactations of artificially sired Holstein cows obtained from the Northeast Dairy Records Processing Laboratory. After adjusting for herd-yearseason effects, residual effects may include additive and other genetic effects of the animal, maternal effects, cytoplasmic effects, and other environmental effects. Analysis of residuals showed that cytoplasmic effects accounted for no variation in milk and fat yield and fat percent. Weighted yearly heritability estimates and standard errors from daughter on dam regressions were. 35 +. 01 <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> yield,. 30 +. 01 <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> fat yield, and. 63 -+. 01 <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> fat percent and from daughter on granddam regressions were. 34 -+. 03 <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> production,. 28 -+. 03 <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> fat production, and. 55 +-. 03 <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> fat percent. The differences between daughter-dam and daughter-granddam heritability estimates, which estimate twice the fraction of variance due to cytoplasmic effects, were negative and not statistically significant <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> fat yield and also were negative but highly significant <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> fat percent...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate genetic parameters <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> yield and milk percentages of fat and protein in Iranian buffaloes. A total of 9, 278 test-day production records obtained from 1, 501 first lactation buffaloes on 414 herds in Iran between 1993 and 2009 were used for the analysis. Genetic parameters for productive traits were estimated using random regression test-day models. Regression curves were modeled using Legendre polynomials (LPs). Heritability estimates were low to moderate <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> production traits and ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 33 <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> yield, 0. 01 to 0. 27 <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> protein percentage and 0. 03 to 0. 24 <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> fat percentage, respectively. Genetic correlations ranged from − 0. 24 to 1 <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> yield between different days in milk over the lactation. Genetic correlations of milk yield at different days in milk were often higher than permanent environmental correlations. Genetic correlations <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> protein percentage ranged from − 0. 89 to 1 between different days in milk. Also, genetic correlations <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> percentage of fat ranged from − 0. 60 to 1 between different days in milk. The highest estimates of genetic and permanent environmental correlations <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> traits were observed at adjacent test-days. Ignoring heritability estimates <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> yield and milk protein percentage in the first and final days of lactation, these estimates were higher in the 120 days of lactation. Test-day milk yield heritability estimates were moderate in the course of the lactation, suggesting that this trait could be applied as selection criteria in Iranian milking buffaloes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of different milking frequencies in the first 6 weeks of lactation on milk production and milk constituents, blood metabolic profiles and reproductive performance of fresh dairy cows. The milking frequencies imposed were three times daily <b>milking</b> <b>for</b> 42 days (3 X), six times daily <b>milking</b> <b>for</b> the first 21 days of lactation and three times daily subsequently (6 X- 3 X) and six times daily <b>milking</b> <b>for</b> 42 days. For this purpose 21 multiparous Holstein dairy cows were allocated to three groups based on BCS, parity, and body weight. Results showed that the mean of milk and FCM production was significantly higher for 6 X than 3 X cows in first and second 21 days and in the entire period. Among milk constituent only fat production was affected by milking frequencies. The milking frequency had no effect on mean DMI. Weight loss of the cows was higher for 6 X cows (- 32 kg) than those the 6 X- 3 X (- 29 kg) and 3 X (- 29. 1 kg). Blood concentration of NEFA was affected by milking frequencies and it was significantly higher for 6 X compared to 3 X. The mean concentration of blood progesterone and reproductive parameters was not affected by milking frequencies. It was concluded that 6 time milking per day in a short term period may inrease Holstein dairy cows’ performance without any adverse effect on their reproductive parameters...|$|R
