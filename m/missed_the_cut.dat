5|$|Amid notable controversy, Sörenstam {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} PGA Tour's Bank of America Colonial golf tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, in May 2003, making her the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias, who {{qualified}} for the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Vijay Singh, fourth in the world rankings at the time, was particularly critical of her presence; he was quoted saying she had no business playing and he hoped she <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut,</b> although this statement was later proven to be misquoted and he later apologized. Cheered through each hole, she shot five over par, tying for 96th out of the 111 who finished the first two rounds, missing the cut. After shooting 1-over-par 71 in the first round, finishing in 73rd and on pace to challenge for a weekend spot, Sörenstam said she was nervous all day but pleased by her performance.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 2014, {{she became}} the {{youngest}} (age 11) {{to qualify for the}} U.S. Women's Open, surpassing Thompson's record (12 years, 4 months, 18 days) from the 2007 Open. Notably, Li not only qualified, but she won her qualifying event by seven strokes at Old Course at Half Moon Bay Golf Links. Thompson <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> in 2007 with a 36-hole 168 total. Li was the second-youngest to compete; nine years prior to the introduction of qualification in 1976, Beverly Klass played in the 1967 Open at age 10 years, 7 months, and 21 days. Although Li's qualification was largely heralded, some were befuddled at the state of the sport when a sixth grader could even qualify {{for one of the most}} prestigious events of the year. Li, who had reached a 1.5 handicap by April, had a handicap better than threshold 2.4, making her eligible to participate in qualifications.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{competed in}} the 1899 Open Championship at Royal St George's Golf Club located in Sandwich, England. He played as an amateur, scored 89 and 90 and <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> by 8 strokes. By 1902 he had become the {{professional}} at the Gog Magog Golf Club near Cambridge. In a friendly match against Tom Vardon at Sandwich on 27 May 1903, Strong made a hole-in-one (likely wind assisted) on a par 4 hole. He entered the 1903 Open Championship held at Prestwick Golf Club, South Ayrshire, Scotland, but failed to advance past the half-way cut. In the 1904 Open Championship, again held on his home course at Sandwich, Strong opened with a first round 93—in windy and cold conditions—but could only improve to 88 in round two when the weather improved. He ended up missing the cut, by 13 strokes, which came at 168.|$|E

Woods took a nine-week hiatus from the PGA Tour {{to be with his}} family. When he returned for the 2006 U.S. Open, the rust was evident—he <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> at Winged Foot, {{the first time he had}} <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> at a major as a professional, and ended his record-tying streak of 39 consecutive cuts made at majors. Still, a tie for second at the Western Open just three weeks later showed him poised to defend his Open Championship crown at Hoylake.|$|E
25|$|Weissmuller was an {{accomplished}} amateur golfer and played in two official PGA Tour tournaments, at the 1937 Western Open at Canterbury Golf Club outside Cleveland (8785=172, <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut)</b> and the 1948 Hawaiian Open (79757976=309) {{to finish in}} 37th place.|$|E

25|$|Lee made six out {{of eleven}} PGA Tour cuts after turning pro, with two top-25 finishes. He tied for 13th at the HP Byron Nelson Championship in May, and {{improved}} on his best finish in a PGA Tour event by finishing in a tie for 7th at the AT National in July. That top ten finish earned Lee {{a spot in the}} following week's John Deere Classic, meaning {{he did not have to}} use one of his two remaining sponsor exemptions. The money from his T-7 finish put him $187,904 away from earning temporary status on tour. Lee <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> by two strokes at the John Deere Classic after bogeying the last two holes of his second round. Lee <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> again three weeks later at the Buick Open.|$|E

Wie's last appearance in a men's professional event was at the 2008 Legends Reno-Tahoe Open, an alternate event on the PGA Tour. Wie shot rounds of 73 and 80, <b>missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> by nine strokes.|$|R
