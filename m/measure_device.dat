The coastal wave basin in the Plymouth University COAST laboratory is used to generate scaled experimental regular and irregular sea states. A suite of sensors are used to <b>measure</b> <b>device</b> performance and loads experienced by the moorings. Full {{6 degrees of freedom}} optical motion tracking is used to <b>measure</b> <b>device</b> response to extreme wave loading. It has been shown that extreme device motions are greatest during the most extreme 50 yr return period wave cases and these motions correspond to the greatest loads experienced by the mooring lines. Peak loads occur at the largest and steepest wave combination due to high rotational velocities in pitch coupled with large surge displacements. Lateral low frequency drift has been shown {{to have an impact on}} peak loads on the mooring line. A low freeboard survival position has been tested and proved to be effective in reducing rotational motions and drift forces in steep waves, resulting in a reduction in peak mooring loads. Device performance remains high in extreme waves at the optimum response frequency and reduces at the peak load RAO. It is suggested that survival response to extreme storm conditions be defined by the wavelength corresponding to peak load RAO to maximise device efficiency...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccording to {{qualitative}} analyses the activation-relaxation-pattern of the grip forces {{seems to be}} a crucial factor of performance in many Badminton techniques. Especially for the backhand net shots it is assumed that experts exert high pressure on the racket handle within {{a short period of time}} to utilize the elasticity of the racket whereas athletes on lower level of performance tend to maintain grip forces over a longer period during the final phase of the smash. This is partly supported by EMG analysis [1]. To analyze the movement coordination by the pressure applied on the racket a specific device has been developed. A specially designed handle bar contains two FSR sensors and an analog amplifier (TLV 2460). The FSR sensors (Ø: 18, 3 mm/ accuracy: 3 – 15 % within a range of 100 to 10 N) were placed at the upper and lower area of the handle bar to allow the player to grip at different positions of the handle bar. Specific pressure points ensure that all pressure applied by the player is transferred to the sensors. The total pressure is then derived by the sum of the pressure measured at each sensor. The <b>measure</b> <b>device</b> is connected via cable and an analog digital converter to a portable data logger, where the data can be stored or transferred via WLan to an external computer [2]. By the integration of the racket device to the mobile system, accelerometic data of the racket and the arm segments can be derived synchronously. A prototyp of the <b>measure</b> <b>device</b> has been established. First data were taken from an expert (national level), an advanced (regional level) and a recreational player. Grip pressure as well as racket acceleration were measured while subjects performed backhand net shots. The results indicate that experts increase pressure at an early stage to support the forward acceleration of the racket and therefore achieve higher velcities of the racket head.
