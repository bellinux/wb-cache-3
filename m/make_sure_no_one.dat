500|$|The {{first day}} of filming for the episode was August 9, 2011, though some cast members were called the day before to begin {{recording}} musical numbers. Murphy realized that The Glee Project runner-up Lindsay Pearce would be ideal for an already-written role in the episode, but the filming needed to take place before the project's finale was broadcast on August 21, 2011, upon which it would be revealed that she had won a two-episode prize. They [...] "kept delaying" [...] the shoot, and [...] "snuck [...] into a soundstage to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> recognized her." [...] In aid of this secrecy, her name was omitted from the Fox press release for the episode. Once Murphy had cast Pearce, he made the musical number she was to appear in bigger.

2500|$|Minos {{justified}} his accession as {{king and}} prayed to Poseidon for a sign. Poseidon sent a giant white bull {{out of the}} sea. Minos was committed to sacrificing the bull to Poseidon, but then decided to substitute a different bull. In rage, Poseidon cursed Pasiphaë, Minos' wife, with zoophilia.

Daedalus and Icarus flew away on wings Daedalus invented, but Icarus' wings melted because he flew too close to the sun. Icarus fell in the sea and drowned.|$|E
