In the 1970s, he founded Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida, which President Ronald Reagan recognized for its growth and influence. As a Republican, Baldwin headed the Florida branch of <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority,</b> which promoted social conservatism. He also hosted {{a radio show}} called Chuck Baldwin Live, which focused on conservative issues. It made its national radio debut on the Genesis Communications Network in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have since}} {{connected}} {{the success of}} Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in political processes. Although forceful Christian involvement had not taken a widespread role in politics in the United States since 1925, within two years the Reverend Jerry Falwell developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named the <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> that influenced the Republican Party to incorporate a social agenda in national politics. Homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), abortion, and pornography were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new determination and consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active.|$|E

Although being {{rejected}} {{by his own}} state stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted a more conservative representative; he and Eleanor felt {{out of touch with}} the country and in some ways liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat the <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> and other new Christian right forces. In 1982, he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. Congressional elections. McGovern shut the committee down when he decided to run for president again.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} how {{the perception that}} separatist groups threaten the <b>majority’s</b> <b>moral</b> identity impacts the latter group’s support for reconciliation in separatist conflict. Two studies were conducted in Indonesia, where separatist conflict is rife. Javanese students (representing the nonseparatist majority) responded surveys regarding separatist conflicts in Aceh (Study 1, N = 679) or West Papua (Study 2, N = 500). As expected, perceived threat to the <b>majority’s</b> <b>moral</b> identity increased this particular group’s reconciliatory attitudes (Study 1), emotions, and behaviours (Study 2), through increased compensatory needs for social acceptance and restoration of moral image. These findings underline the importance of moral identity dynamics in separatist conflict. Moreover, they reveal that the majority, despite its dominant position, can experience morality threat from separatist groups which can foster positive attitudes towards the reconciliation process...|$|R

25|$|Aside from LaRouche, some Democratic leaders {{during the}} 1980s did turn toward {{conservative}} views, albeit {{very different from}} the previous incarnations of southern Democrats. In 1988, Joe Lieberman defeated Republican U.S. Senate incumbent Lowell Weicker of Connecticut by running to the right of Weicker and receiving the endorsements of the <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> and the National Rifle Association. Colorado governor Richard Lamm, and former Minnesota Senator and Presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy both took up immigration reduction as an issue. Lamm wrote a novel, 1988, about a third party Presidential candidate and former Democrat running as a progressive conservative, and Lamm himself would go on to unsuccessfully seek the nomination of the Reform Party in 1996. McCarthy began to give speeches in the late 1980s naming the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Federal Election Commission as the three biggest threats to liberty in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "evolution of dogma" [...] theory (see Development of doctrine), much in {{the manner}} of Luther’s theory of {{salvation}} sola fide ('by faith alone') allows for a constant updating of standards of morality. The phrase sola fide derives from Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium, a Eucharistic hymn by St. Thomas Aquinas: et si sensus deficit, | ad firmandum cor sincerum | sola fides sufficit. Since <b>majority</b> <b>moral</b> standards shifted heavily during the 20th century, Catholics not accepting the theory were placed in the position of having to abstain from receiving Communion if they wished to engage in some of the actions of some of their fellow-religionists. As for the others, the theory that dogma can change enabled them, as they saw it, to “update” Catholic morality while not being concerned with possible contradictions.|$|R

40|$|The {{intention}} of the analysis in this paper was to determine, from interviews with 11 early years’ teachers, what informed their knowledge of children’s learning and teaching strategies regarding moral development. Overall, the analysis revealed four main categories: definitions of moral behaviour, understanding of children’s learning, pedagogy for moral learning, {{and the source of}} knowledge for moral pedagogy. Children’s learning was attributed by five of the teachers to incidental/contextual issues. Nine of the teachers reported using pedagogies that involved discussion of issues, in various contexts, as a way of teaching about social and <b>moral</b> issues. The <b>majority</b> of the teachers (n = 7) described the source of their knowledge of pedagogy as practical/observed as opposed to being theoretically informed. There was no clear relationship between teachers’ definitions, understanding of children’s learning, pedagogy or source of knowledge. These results suggests a strong need for the teaching of moral development to be given more prominence and addressed directly in in-service courses so that teachers are clear about their intentions and the most effective ways of achieving them...|$|R

Gone are the days when philosophers had to read psychology journals covered in discrete bindings so as to hide a perverse interest in the latest sexy results. At least that is true in most areas of philosophy. Lately, the methodological revolution has been gaining ground in ethics.

Psychology and neuroscience are being used to determine what goes on in people’s heads when they decide that something is morally right or morally wrong. Traditionally minded ethicists continue to feel insulated from the onslaught of empirical moral psychology.

40|$|Premarital {{fertility}} {{is defined}} as fertility before first marriage. In South Africa, in 1998, according to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), about 65 % of women under 25 had had a premarital birth and close to 39 % of all births were premarital. Although total fertility rate had decreased drastically (down to 2. 9), trends showed that premarital fertility was increasing. We investigated perceptions and attitudes towards late marriage and premarital fertility to understand this phenomenon better, and to inform programmes pertaining to family welfare, reproductive health and HIV/AIDS. In {{order to understand the}} increase in premarital fertility in South Africa, the qualitative study focused on the perceptions and attitudes in the Shangaan culture in Agincourt, in rural Bushbuckridge. In this society, sexuality, pregnancy and marriage were linked traditionally. Nowadays, parental social control over adolescents has relaxed but premarital births remain stigmatised. Although adolescent fertility has always existed, only recently has it become a social problem because most young mothers are unmarried. The perceptions and attitudes towards premarital fertility reveal social mutations in parental control over adolescent sexuality as well as in <b>moral</b> standards. A <b>majority</b> of persons interviewed expressed negative perceptions towards a birth before first marriage. The reasons varied and included: school drop out for the mother, economic hardship, parental stigmatisation, health risk for the mother because of unprotected sex (STD/HIV), and for the child because of malnutrition (kwashiorkor) ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{extremely}} interesting to observe how critiques {{of economic and}} political crises usually have a moral dimension, while periods of stability, growth, abundance and calm tend to produce debates with an amoral basis. This has also been the case during the recent financial recession, which has uncovered a social, economic and political crisis of deeper, more serious dimensions. Is has affected the very model upon which the social and economic progress of recent years has been based. When it comes to finding the causes of the current crisis, rampant greed and damaging {{the rules of the game}} have been seen from the start as the main triggers. In Barach Obama's solemn inaugural speech as President of the United States of America on the 20 th January 2009, he saw weaknesses in the country's economy as due to a 'consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age'. In other words the recession is not only consequence of the greed of a few, but also the <b>moral</b> weakness the <b>majority.</b> The American president's diagnosis is common among the leaders of those nations that have found themselves affected by this same wave of recession, with the subsequent unmasking of irresponsible behaviour, similar to that found in the US financial system.

40|$|Drawing on a {{large body}} of {{empirical}} evidence, former Harvard President Derek Bok examines how much progress college students actually make toward widely accepted goals of undergraduate education. His conclusions are sobering. Although most students make gains in many important respects, they improve much less than they should in such important areas as writing, critical thinking, quantitative skills, and <b>moral</b> reasoning. Large <b>majorities</b> of college seniors do not feel that they have made substantial progress in speaking a foreign language, acquiring cultural and aesthetic interests, or learning what they need to know to become active and informed citizens. Overall, despite their vastly increased resources, more powerful technology, and hundreds of new courses, colleges cannot be confident that students are learning more than they did fifty years ago. Looking further, Bok finds that many important college courses are left to the least experienced teachers and that most professors continue to teach in ways that have proven to be less effective than other available methods. In reviewing their educational programs, however, faculties typically ignore this evidence. Instead, they {{spend most of their time}} discussing what courses to require, although the lasting impact of college will almost certainly depend much more on how the courses are taught. In his final chapter, Bok describes the changes that faculties and academic leaders can make to help students accomplish more. Without ignoring the contributions that America's colleges have made, Bok delivers a powerful critique [...] one that educators will ignore at their peril.

60|$|The {{pronouncement}} {{of these}} particular doctors {{is very clear}} and uncompromising; in the modern atmosphere, indeed, it even deserves some credit for <b>moral</b> courage. The <b>majority</b> of modern people, of course, will probably agree with it {{in so far as}} it declares that alcoholic drinks are often of supreme value in emergencies of illness; but many people, I fear, will open their eyes at the emphatic terms in which they describe such drink as considered as a beverage; but they are not content with declaring that the drink is in moderation harmless: they distinctly declare that it is in moderation beneficial. But I fancy that, in saying this, the doctors had in mind a truth that runs somewhat counter to the common opinion. I fancy that it is the experience of most doctors that giving any alcohol for illness (though often necessary) is about the most morally dangerous way of giving it. Instead of giving it to a healthy person who has many other forms of life, you are giving it to a desperate person, to whom it is the only form of life. The invalid can hardly be blamed if by some accident of his erratic and overwrought condition he comes to remember the thing as the very water of vitality and to use it as such. For in so far as drinking is really a sin it is not because drinking is wild, but because drinking is tame; not in so far as it is anarchy, but in so far as it is slavery. Probably the worst way to drink is to drink medicinally. Certainly the safest way to drink is to drink carelessly; that is, without caring much for anything, and especially not caring for the drink.|$|R
