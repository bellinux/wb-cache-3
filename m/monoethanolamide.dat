40|$|The thermal and lyotropic liquid {{crystalline}} phase behaviour of {{a series}} of amide and <b>monoethanolamide</b> amphiphiles with isoprenoid-type hydrocarbon chains has been investigated. The amphiphilic nature of these molecules combined with their ability to form nanostructured selfassemblies makes them ideal candidates as delivery vehicles of bioactive molecules. For both families of molecules, increased branching in the hydrophobic chain, associated with increasing chain length, results in a decreased melting point. The melting points of the amides are signiﬁcantly higher than their <b>monoethanolamide</b> homologues. Interestingly, both hexahydrofarnesoyl (H-farnesoyl) and phytanoyl <b>monoethanolamide</b> exhibit a glass transition temperature at around 72 C to 74 C. H-Farnesoyl and phytanoyl <b>monoethanolamide</b> form lyotropic liquid crystalline phases in water, whilst H-farnesoyl and phytanoyl amide form a spontaneous emulsion at the amphiphile-water interface. In particular, at room temperature H-farnesoyl and phytanoyl <b>monoethanolamide</b> form the Schwarz diamond (QII D) and the Schoen gyroid (QII G) bicontinuous cubic phases which are retained down to temperatures as low as 1 C. Furthermore, phytanoyl <b>monoethanolamide</b> displays a QII D, QII G and inverse hexagonal phase (HII) at physiological temperature. Both phytanoyl and H-farnesoyl <b>monoethanolamide</b> form mesoporous cubic phases at room temperature that are easily dispersed into cubosomes. The robust nature of the nanostructured phase formation of these two monoethanolamides over a wide range of temperatures makes them ideal candidates for a variety of applications...|$|E
40|$|The self-assembly, {{solid state}} and lyotropic liquid {{crystalline}} phase {{behavior of a}} series of endogenous n-acylethanolamides (NAEs) with differing degrees of unsaturation, viz., oleoyl <b>monoethanolamide,</b> linoleoyl <b>monoethanolamide,</b> and linolenoyl <b>monoethanolamide,</b> have been examined. The studied molecules are known to possess inherent biological function. Both the <b>monoethanolamide</b> headgroup and the unsaturated hydrophobe are found to be important in dictating the self-assembly behavior of these molecules. In addition, all three molecules form lyotropic liquid crystalline phases in water, including the inverse bicontinuous cubic diamond (QII D) and gyroid (QII G) phases. The ability of the NAE&# 039;s to form inverse cubic phases and to be dispersed into ordered nanostructured colloidal particles, cubosomes, in excess water, combined with their endogenous nature and natural medicinal properties, makes this new class of soft mesoporous amphiphile self-assembly materials suitable candidates for investigation in a variety of advanced multifunctional applications, including encapsulation and controlled release of therapeutic agents and incorporation of medical imaging agents...|$|E
40|$|The n-acylethanolamides (NAEs) are {{a family}} of {{naturally}} occurring <b>monoethanolamide</b> containing lipids that display a variety of interesting biological properties. In this Study, some physicochemical properties {{of a series of}} saturated <b>monoethanolamide</b> lipids with increasing hydrocarbon chain length (lauroyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, and stearoyl) have been investigated. Temperature induced phase transitions for these NAEs indicate that both the <b>monoethanolamide</b> headgroups and the unsaturated hydrophobic tails {{play a role in the}} melting behavior of these lipids. All four lipids examined demonstrate the presence of at least three different polymorphic crystal forms. Transitions in crystal Structure call be induced via heating and Visualized with polarized optical microscopy. At room and physiological temperature, the four NAEs are solid lamellar crystalline materials. All four molecules form lyotropic liquid crystalline phases in water, albeit at relatively high temperatures, including the lamellar liquid crystalline phase and at least two isotropic phases. Lamellar crystalline palmitoyl <b>monoethanolamide</b> was dispersed as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). The cytotoxicity of these SLNs toward human mammary epithelial cells (HMEpiC) and the MCF 7 breast cancer cell line was assessed at physiological temperature. The palmitoyl <b>monoethanolamide</b> SLNs showed little to no toxicity to the HMEpiC even at a concentration of 30 mu M. At concentrations above 3 mu M, the HMEpiC population was reduced by less than 15 %, while the MCF 7 population was reduced by similar to 20 - 30 %. The endogenous nature and natural medicinal properties make this series of lipids ideal candidates for further investigation as solid lipid nanoparticle drug delivery systems...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the comparative analysis of inverse emulsion rheological behavior stabilized by <b>monoethanolamide</b> and diethanolamide of tall oil fatty acids, which are promising reagents for petroleum engineering. Flow curves of emulsions and volume ratio of dispersed phase have been obtained. The {{analysis of the}} dependence of Herschel-Bulkley model parameters on concentration of emulsifiers has been carried out. It is proved that emulsifiers affect weakly on the rheological parameters in high water phase content emulsions, while in cut-back emulsions their impact is registered to be stronger. It {{has been found that}} rheological parameters of the emulsions stabilized by <b>monoethanolamide</b> throughout the range of concentration are considerably higher than the samples on the base of diethanolamide. The experimental data proved the key impact of viscosity of dispersion medium on rheological behavior of cut-back emulsions...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{mechanism for}} in meso crystallisation depends, at least initially, on retention {{of the underlying}} cubic phase. However, a crystallisation trial requires screening across {{a wide range of}} crystallisation conditions, containing polymers, salts, buffers and at varying pH, all of which are known to drive structural changes in lipid phases. We have previously shown that the lipid monoolein (MO) is relatively robust to the components of the PACT crystallization screen. Here we extend our research to determine the susceptibility of the 3 -D ordered cubic phase formed by four different lipids; monoolein, phytantriol, phytanoyl <b>monoethanolamide</b> and H-farnesoyl <b>monoethanolamide,</b> to two different crystallisation screens (the PACT and PEG-ion screens) in situ, within a 96 -well crystallisation plate. Addition of screen is shown to result in rich and varied phase behaviour with the transformation to 1 -D ordered lamellar, 2 -D ordered hexagonal and disordered micellar phases in many wells. We have rationalized the structural changes for each lipid by a consideration of the osmotic stress exerted by the PEG components, and the position of various anions and cations present in the Hofmeister series. The nanostructure of the cubic phase is shown {{to be the most important}} parameter affecting the susceptibility of the cubic phase structure to the components of the screen. In particular, a reduction in lipid bilayer thickness and water channel diameter increases the susceptibility...|$|E
40|$|Mesoporous silicas {{with the}} {{thiourea}} functional group ≡Si(CH 2) 3 NHC(S) NHC 2 H 5 have been synthesized by monotemplate and bitemplate route (bitemplate is cetylpyridinium chloride as micelle-forming surfactant and <b>monoethanolamide</b> of saturated n-aliphatic acid as non-micelle-forming surfactant). The infl uence {{of a number}} of factors on mesoporous silicas structure has been studied: alkoxysilanes and surfactants concentration, and as well as the nature of medium in hydrothermal treatment of mesophases. The optimum conditions under which functionalized mesoporous silicas have possessing highly ordered hexagonal structure have been found. The surface area of mesoporous silicas synthesized using optimum bitemplate solubilization composition reaches 1055 - 1350 m 2 /g and sorption volume and pore diameter are 0. 75 - 0. 95 cm 3 /g and 2. 5 - 2. 9 nm respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{dopamine}} D 2 long (D 2 L) receptor and bacteriorhodopsin (bR), {{which are}} integral membrane proteins, have been incorporated within bicontinuous cubic mesophases {{formed by the}} lipids anandamide and H-farnesoyl <b>monoethanolamide,</b> which have been specifically investigated by us for use as in meso crystallization media. We show that the incorporated membrane protein affects {{the structure of the}} cubic phases with the particular effect observed dependent on the geometry of the underlying cubic phase. The results are complementary to those obtained in Part 1 of this series, where we demonstrated that the structural effects observed depend on the structure of the membrane protein. Importantly protein concentrations commonly used for crystallization can destroy the cubic phase matrix, particularly where there is a large discrepancy between the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic spans of the membrane protein, and the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domain sizes of the cubic phase...|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the location of peptides, proteins, and other biomolecules within the bicontinuous cubic phase is crucial for understanding and evolving biological and biomedical applications of these hybrid biomolecule lipid materials, including during in meso crystallization and drug delivery. While theoretical modeling has indicated that proteins and additive lipids might phase separate locally and adopt a preferred location in the cubic phase, this has never been experimentally confirmed. We have demonstrated that perfectly contrast-matched cubic phases in D 2 O can be studied using small-angle neutron scattering by mixing fully deuterated and hydrogenated lipid at an appropriate ratio. The model transmembrane peptide WALP 21 showed no preferential location in the membrane of the diamond cubic phase of phytanoyl <b>monoethanolamide</b> and was not incorporated in the gyroid cubic phase. While deuteration had a small effect on the phase behavior of the cubic phase forming lipids, the changes did not significantly affect our results...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis of alkyl <b>monoethanolamide</b> from {{palm kernel}} oil was done by two steps {{reaction}} that are esterification and amidation. The esterification, that is the reaction between {{palm kernel oil}} and methanol with mole ratio of 1 : 3 using acid catalyst (H 2 SO 4) 4 % at temperature 60 OC for two hours, results in methyl ester palm kernel oil. The methyl ester product was produced by amidation reaction on any variation of time, temperature, catalyst, catalyst concentration and ratio of the reactan. The best result of the synthesis (amide conversion of 98. 15 %) was obtained at temperature of 160 OC for 6 hours with mole ratio of methyl ester palm kernel oil to ethanol amine (ratio of the reactan) 1 : 1 using KOH catalyst 0. 5 % and H 2 SO 4 catalyst 0. 5 %.   Keywords: alkyl mono ethanol amide, surfactant, palm kernel oil, esterification, methyl ester, emulsifie...|$|E
40|$|One of {{enhanced}} oil recovery techniques to increase oil production is surfactant flooding. Surfactants are considered as effective chemical agents used in oilfield in Thailand. It {{is used to}} reduce the interfacial tension (IFT) of two fluids and to make them flow easier in the reservoir. In this study, <b>Monoethanolamide</b> (MEA) commonly used for carbon dioxide capture, is applied as a surfactant to reduce IFT between oil and brine. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} work is to investigate and measure the IFT based on the conditions of subsurface at the oilfield in Thailand. These parameters such as temperature, pressure, salinity as well as the concentration of surfactant are adjusted to investigate the effects on IFT reduction. From the results, it is reported that pressure from 1000 to 2000 psi and temperature varied from 70 °C to 90 °C can reduce IFT insignificantly. However, salinity and surfactant concentration are the main parameters that impact on the IFT reduction. It can greatly decrease IFT up to 87. 13 % for surfactant concentration and up to 74. 06 % for salinity. Finally, the results can be applied to use in the real field for {{enhanced oil}} production in Thailand...|$|E
