2500|$|Hear'Say began {{recording}} {{their third}} album. During {{the summer of}} 2002, the group toured the UK radio roadshows circuit, where they were constantly booed and abused {{by members of the}} public, with a performance in Brighton being cut short due to the animosity concerned – evidence of the degree of public animosity that had built up. During the tour, the group's vehicle was threatened by an apparently armed man at a <b>motorway</b> <b>service</b> <b>area</b> on the M1 motorway in Leicestershire. The man, later arrested, claimed to have been playing a prank on the group. In August 2002, Hear'Say released their only single with Shentall, entitled [...] "Lovin' Is Easy". The track had a new sophisticated feel in an attempt to regenerate interest in the group's music. The single became Hear'Say's lowest charting single to date when it peaked at number six. Media reports suggested that Polydor Records wanted the single to at least reach the UK Top 5. Following the disappointing sales of the single, it was thought that they would be dropped by the label, though no official word came from Polydor.|$|E
