5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of the Netherlands, one of van Meegeren’s agents sold the Vermeer forgery Christ with the Adulteress to Nazi banker and art dealer Alois Miedl in 1942. Experts could probably have identified it as a forgery; as van Meegeren's health declined, so did {{the quality of his}} work. He chain-smoked, drank heavily, and became addicted to morphine-laced sleeping pills. Fortunately for van Meegeren, there were no genuine Vermeers available for comparison, since most <b>museum</b> <b>collections</b> were in protective storage as a prevention against war damage. Miedl then sold it to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring for 1.65million guilders ($625,000 or $7million today).|$|E

By 1992, all religious buildings in Jajce had been destroyed, save for two mosques whose perilous positioning on a hilltop made them unsuitable for demolition.|$|E
5|$|Metal corsets {{are found}} {{in a number of}} <b>museum</b> <b>collections</b> around the world. Some museums, {{including}} the Museo Stibbert, and the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, present their metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London describes their iron corset (formerly owned by the painter Talbot Hughes) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for orthopaedic purposes. Others, such as the iron corset in the Fashion Institute of Technology, are presented as fakes.|$|E
5|$|No {{subspecies}} are recognised, and {{the degree}} of geographic variation is unclear. Adult male birds which breed on the mainland have been reported as having lighter upperparts and underparts than their Tasmanian relatives, and females are said to be browner, but these differences may also result from worn plumage. Furthermore, migration across the Bass Strait by some birds obfuscates the issue. Mainland and Tasmanian birds are the same size. Ornithologists Richard Schodde and Ian Mason argued that the poor quality of <b>museum</b> <b>collections</b> and partially migratory habits meant that discrete subspecies could not be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} observed variation within the species.|$|E

It is stripped of exterior and internal fittings and most of the torsion bars are broken, but it still has its gearbox and engine in place.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the Pondicherry shark {{was caught}} {{and used for}} meat. Fewer than 20 {{specimens}} have been deposited in <b>museum</b> <b>collections,</b> {{most of which were}} collected prior to 1900. This shark's rarity originally led to fears that it may be possibly extinct. However, in 2016, the Pondicherry shark was rediscovered in the Sri Lankan Menik and Kumbukkam rivers. Two photographs of this species exist; one taken from above by a group of nature enthusiasists, as well as one taken from the side by a freshwater fish survey. Given that artisanal and commercial fishing activity across its range is heavy, unregulated, and intensifying, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the Pondicherry shark as Critically Endangered and placed a high priority on locating any surviving populations.|$|E

5|$|In 1990 {{scientists}} {{preparing the}} skins of the hooded pitohui for <b>museum</b> <b>collections</b> experienced numbness and burning when handling them. It {{was reported in}} 1992 that this species and two other pitohuis contained a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of coturnism caused by consuming quails (although toxicity in quails is unusual), and the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously only been found in Colombian poison dart frogs from the genus Phyllobates (family Dendrobatidae). The batrachotoxin family of compounds are the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than strychnine. Later research found that the hooded pitohui had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A cis-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate.|$|E
5|$|The Ringling, the State Art Museum of Florida, {{is located}} in Sarasota, FL and is Administered by Florida State University It was {{established}} in 1927 as the legacy of Mable and John Ringling {{for the people of}} Florida. The institution offers twenty-one galleries of European paintings as well as Cypriot antiquities and Asian, American, and contemporary art. The museum's art collection currently consists of more than 10,000 objects that include a wide variety of paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints, photographs, and decorative arts from ancient through contemporary periods and from around the world. The most celebrated items in the museum are 16th-, 17th-, and 18th-century European paintings, including a world-renowned collection of Peter Paul Rubens paintings. The Ringling <b>Museum</b> <b>collections</b> constitute the largest university museum complex in the United States.

5|$|Wheeler {{had also}} become President of the Museums Association, {{and in a}} presidential address given in Belfast talked {{on the topic of}} {{preserving}} <b>museum</b> <b>collections</b> in war time, believing that Britain's involvement in a second European conflict was imminent. In anticipation of this event, in August 1939 he arranged for the London Museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Bristol University, and at the award ceremony met the Conservative Party politician Winston Churchill, who was then engaged in writing his multi-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples; Churchill asked Wheeler to aid him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval Britain, to which the latter agreed.|$|E

5|$|While lions do {{not usually}} hunt people, some (usually males) seem {{to seek out}} human prey; one well-publicised case {{includes}} the Tsavo maneaters, where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during {{the construction of a}} bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya in 1898. The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour. The lions were larger than normal, lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in <b>museum</b> <b>collections</b> suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.|$|E
5|$|Since retirement, three early-generation Comet {{airframes}} {{have survived}} in <b>museum</b> <b>collections.</b> The only complete remaining Comet 1, a Comet 1XB with the registration G-APAS, is {{displayed at the}} RAF Museum Cosford. While painted in BOAC colours, it never flew for the airline, having been first delivered to Air France {{and then to the}} Ministry of Supply after conversion to 1XB standard; this aircraft also served with the RAF as XM823. The sole surviving Comet fuselage with the original square-shaped windows, part of a Comet 1A registered F-BGNX, has undergone restoration and is on display at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum in Hertfordshire, England. A Comet C2 Sagittarius with serial XK699, later maintenance serial 7971M, has been on display at the gate of RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire, England since 1987. In 2012, with the planned closure of RAF Lyneham, the aircraft was slated to be dismantled and shipped to the RAF Museum Cosford where it will be re-assembled for display.|$|E
5|$|Tunjos (from Muysccubun: tunxo) {{are small}} votive {{offering}} figures produced in great quantities by the Muisca. They {{are found in}} various places on the Altiplano, mainly in lakes and rivers, and {{are the most common}} object housed in <b>museum</b> <b>collections</b> outside Colombia. The word tunjo was used first in the literature about the Muisca in 1854, by scholar Ezequiel Uricoechea. The figurines are mostly anthropomorphic with other examples being zoomorphic. The tunjos were mostly elaborated using tumbaga; an alloy of gold, copper and silver, some with traces of lead or iron. The majority of ceramic or stone tunjos has been described from Mongua, close to Sogamoso. The tunjos served three purposes; as decoration of temples and shrines, for offering rituals in the sacred lakes and rivers in the Muisca religion, and as pieces in funerary practices; to accompany the dead to the afterlife. Ceramic human Tunjos were kept in the houses (bohíos) of the Muisca, together with emeralds.|$|E
