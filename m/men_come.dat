The {{exposure}} causes Mulder to strip naked, hide in the box, and hallucinate about seeing aliens in the warehouse. Susanne shoots the men and escapes. More men then arrive, led by X, who intimidates the Lone Gunmen. Byers confronts X, asking him about his actions and mentioning the supposed cover-up of the John F. Kennedy assassination. X's unconvincing denial—"I heard it was a lone gunman"—becomes {{the origin of the}} trio's name. X leaves, just as the police arrive and arrest the Lone Gunmen.|$|E

A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; {{and the name of}} the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr.

25|$|Though not {{all women}} are {{politicians}} or war generals, boys are {{raised in the}} domestic sphere. Not only that, but <b>men</b> <b>come</b> back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say “o man {{can be a good}} citizen who is not a good husband and a good father.” Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men’s history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women’s history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men’s and women’s history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.|$|E

500|$|For the U.S. and its allies, {{the victory}} in the Tenaru battle was psychologically {{significant}} in that Allied soldiers, {{after a series of}} defeats by Japanese Army units throughout the Pacific and east Asia, now knew that they could defeat the Imperial Armies in a land battle. [...] The battle also set another precedent that would continue throughout the war in the Pacific, which was the reluctance of defeated Japanese soldiers to surrender and their efforts to continue killing Allied soldiers, even as the Japanese soldiers lay dying on the battlefield. On this subject Vandegrift remarked, [...] "I have never heard or read of this kind of fighting. These people refuse to surrender. The wounded wait until <b>men</b> <b>come</b> up to examine them...and blow themselves and the other fellow to pieces with a hand grenade." [...] Robert Leckie, a Guadalcanal veteran, recalls the aftermath of the battle in his book Helmet For My Pillow, [...] "Our regiment had killed something like nine hundred of them. Most lay in clusters or heaps before the gun pits commanding sandspit, as though they had not died singly but in groups. Moving among them were the souvenir hunters, picking their way delicately as though fearful of booby traps, while stripping the bodies of their possessions." ...|$|E
500|$|The white protagonist in Tarzan, the Ape Man (1932) is the [...] "King of the [...] Jungle".

When Jane's father warns her [...] "e's not like us", she responds, [...] "e's white" [...] as evidence to the contrary. In the racy 1934 sequel, Tarzan and His Mate (the last word meaning both a status and a biological function), <b>men</b> <b>come</b> from the U.S. with fancy gowns and other accoutrements to woo and clothe the bra-less, barely clothed Jane, again played by O'Sullivan, hoping to lure {{her away from the}} savage Tarzan.

Breen, then head of the SRC, objected to the scene, and MGM, the movie's producer, decided to take their case to the appeals review board. The board consisted of the heads of Fox, RKO, and Universal.
