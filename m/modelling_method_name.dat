It {{is widely used}} in elastic reverse time migration (RTM) to analyze source illumination, suppress low-wavenumber noise, correct for image polarity and extract angle-domain common imaging gather (ADCIG). However, the P and S waves are mixed together during wavefield propagation such that the P and S energy fluxes are not clean everywhere, especially at the overlapped points. In this paper, we use a modified elastic wave equation in which the P and S vector wavefields are naturally separated.

In {{spite of the}} huge progress made {{in our understanding of}} the molecular mechanisms controlling the growth rate, fundamental questions concerning its intrinsic limitations are still relevant today. In parallel, systems biology claims that mathematical models could shed light on these questions. Methods: This review explores some possible reasons for the limitation of the growth rate in fast-growing bacteria, using a systems biology approach based on constraint-based <b>modeling</b> <b>methods.</b> Results: Recent experimental results and a new constraint-based <b>modelling</b> <b>method</b> <b>named</b> Resource Balance Analysis (RBA) reveal the existence of constraints on resource allocation between biological processes in bacterial cells. In this context, the distribution of a finite amount of resources between the metabolic network and the ribosomes limits the growth rate, which implies the existence of a bottleneck between these two processes. Any mechanism for saving resources increases the growth rate. General Significance: Consequently, the emergence of genetic regulation of metabolic pathways, e. g. catabolite repression, could then arise as a means to minimise the protein cost, i. e. maximising growth performance while minimising the resource allocation.

The dataset consists of email subject lines and the corresponding IP address of the email sender. A fast and accurate classifier is desirable in such an application. In this research, a highly scalable SVM <b>modeling</b> <b>method,</b> <b>named</b> Granular SVM with Random granulation (GSVM-RAND), is designed. GSVM-RAND applies bootstrapping to extract a number of subsets of samples from the original training dataset. Each training subset is then projected into a feature subspace randomly selected from the original feature space. Here we call a granule such a subset of samples in such a feature subspace. A local SVM is then modeled in each granule. For a new sample, it is firstly projected into each granule in which the local SVM is fired to make a prediction. After that, all SVM predictions are aggregated by Bayesian Sum Rule for a final decision. GSVM-RAND is easy to be parallelized and hence efficient and highly scalable.

Aiming at {{building}} a dialectal Chinese speech recognizer from a standard Chinese speech recognizer {{with a small}} amount of dialectal Chinese speech, a novel, simple but effective acoustic <b>modeling</b> <b>method,</b> <b>named</b> state-dependent phoneme-based <b>model</b> merging (SDPBMM) <b>method,</b> is proposed and evaluated, where a tied-state of standard triphone(s) will be merged with a state of the dialectal monophone that is identical with the central phoneme in the triphone(s). It can be seen that the proposed method has a good performance however it will introduce a Gaussian mixtures expansion problem. To deal with it, an acoustic model distance measure, named pseudo-divergence based distance measure, is proposed based on the difference measurement of Gaussian mixture models and then implemented to downsize the model size almost without causing any performance degradation for dialectal speech. With a small amount of only 40 -minute Shanghai-dialectal Chinese speech, the proposed SDPBMM achieves a significant absolute syllable error rate (SER) reduction of 5. 9 % for dialectal Chinese and almost no performance degradation for standard Chinese.

In a benchmark {{comparison with the}} methods SCWRL, NCN, LGA, SPRUCE, Rosetta, and SCAP, OPUS-Rota is shown to be much faster than all the methods except SCWRL, which is comparably fast. In terms of overall χ 1 and χ 1 + 2 accuracies, however, OPUS-Rota is 5. 4 and 8. 8 percentage points better, respectively, than SCWRL. Compared with NCN, which has the best accuracy in the literature, OPUS-Rota is 1. 6 percentage points better for overall χ 1 + 2 but 0. 3 percentage points weaker for overall χ 1. Hence, our algorithm is much more accurate than SCWRL with similar execution speed, and it has accuracy comparable to or better than the most accurate methods in the literature, but with a runtime that is one or two orders of magnitude shorter. In addition, OPUS-Rota consistently outperforms SCWRL on the Wallner and Elofsson homology-modeling benchmark set when the sequence identity is greater than 40 %.

Specifically, {{in order to deal}} with phonetic-level pronunciation variations in SDPBMM, distance-based pronunciation modeling is proposed based on a small dialectal Chinese data set. With a 40 -minute Shanghai-dialectal Chinese data set, SDPBMM can achieve a significant syllable error rate (SER) reduction of 14. 3 % for dialectal Chinese with almost no performance degradation for standard Chinese. Experimentally, SDPBMM can also outperform the maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) adaptation and the pooled retraining methods with relative SER reductions by 2. 8 % and 10. 6 %, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, {{we present}} an {{individual}} appearance <b>model</b> based <b>method,</b> <b>named</b> face-specific subspace (FSS), for recognizing human faces under variation in lighting, expression, and viewpoint. This method {{derives from the}} traditional Eigenface but differs from it in essence. In Eigenface, each face image is represented as a point in a low-dimensional face subspace shared by all faces; however, the experiments conducted show one of the demerits of such a strategy: it fails to accurately represent the most discriminanting features of a specific face. Therefore, we propose to model each face with one individual face subspace, named Face-Specific Subspace. Distance from the face-specific subspace, that is, the reconstruction error, is then exploited as the similarity measurement for identification. Furthermore, to enable the proposed approach to solve the single example problem, a technique to derive multisamples from one single example is further developed. Extensive experiments on several academic databases show that our method significantly outperforms Eigenface and template matching, which intensively indicates its robustness under variation in illumination, expression, an...|$|R

The accuracy of GMQ was improved by considering larger graphs to include quality information of more surrounding residues. Moreover, we found that using different edge weights in graphs reflecting different secondary structures further improves the accuracy. GMQ showed competitive performance on a benchmark for quality assessment of structure models from the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) ...|$|R
