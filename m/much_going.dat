5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

Humayun was amazed at their work and asked if they would work for him if he were to regain the sovereignty of Hindustan: they agreed. With so <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on Humayun did not even meet the Shah until July, some six months after his arrival in Persia. After a lengthy journey from Herat the two met in Qazvin where a large feast and parties were held for the event.

500|$|Bob Mackey of US Gamer {{was more}} {{critical}} of the game, giving it 2 of 5 stars.

500|$|... "Slow Fade" [...] {{was written}} in the [...] "light of the well publicised falls from grace of several high profile church leaders". According to lead vocalist Mark Hall: [...] "Nobody falls, it's just a slow fade. It's a series of minor compromises until you're in a place you never thought you'd be, doing things you never thought you'd do and rationalising all of it". He {{continued}} by saying that: [...] "As believers, as men, if we're not guarding our relationship with God, we're going down. There's too <b>much</b> <b>going</b> against us.

500|$|The {{scene was}} {{inspired}} by real-life Super Bowl commercials in which, according to Scully, [...] "you don't know what the product is" [...] because there is [...] "so <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on" [...] in Super Bowl commercials. It was also based on the music video for the American rock band ZZ Top's 1983 song [...] "Legs". Although they {{had come up with}} the commercial's premise, they were not sure of what its tagline would be. Eventually, Martin, one of the episode writers, suggested [...] "The Catholic Church... we've made a few changes." [...] It got the biggest laugh from the other writers and was subsequently included in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Infamous 2 was divisive. Sterling McGarvey from GameSpy thought {{the story was}} a [...] "pulpy comic book narrative", Colin Moriarty of IGN found the story well-delivered and [...] "incredible", and Eurogamer's Christian Donlan found the endings of the game to be [...] "genuinely satisfying" [...] and an {{improvement}} on the overarching storyline of the series. Conversely, Andrew Reiner of Game Informer found the story disengaging with confusing narrative threads, Giant Bomb's Brad Shoemaker felt the story was scattered and had too <b>much</b> <b>going</b> to find its center, and Tom Mc Shea from GameSpot described the story as bland and lacking a hook to invest the player in Cole's affairs.|$|E

D'Antonio stated about the cover of Alive or Just Breathing, [...] "I wanted something that looked 'old school cut-and-paste' for the cover. Something with texture that appeared like it was just laid down and photographed. I remember Roadrunner hating the cover, saying there was too <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on and nothing to focus on.

500|$|New York {{magazine}} also {{describe the}} series and how Jenny {{took on the}} whole character traits of the show: [...] "Like Jenny, The L Word was, at any given moment, capricious, obnoxious, patronizing, fabulous, fun, sexy, non sequitur, overreaching, under-reaching, annoying, and yes, unforgettable. Not one other character besides Jenny embodied the whole character of the show." [...] British lesbian magazine Diva call Jenny [...] "the girl we love to hate." [...] They also opined that [...] "poor old Jenny didn't have <b>much</b> <b>going</b> for her from the start." [...] That after her failed romances with Tim and Marina, she [...] "got all pretentious" [...] when she became an author. They also branded her the most hated lesbian character since Joan Ferguson (Maggie Kirkpatrick) on , credited most of the hatred upscaling when she had her dog put down and praised Kirshner for rising {{to the challenge of}} playing her.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic praised the song {{as one of}} the best tracks of the album, calling it [...] "infectious". Sean O'Brien from The People praised [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] as [...] "the best song of the album" [...] and her [...] "one of her best ever". He also said that the song is one of the reasons why Madonna is queen of pop. Jon Pareles from The New York Times considered it as the album's most danceable song. Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, called the song [...] "dazed-sounding". Metro Times described Ahmadzai's programming as [...] "by far the best thing on the album". James Hannaham from Spin compared [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] to Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love", and deemed it as a highlight from the album. Alan Braidwood from BBC Music felt that the song was [...] "insane" [...] with its electronic, chaotic, fast and manic pounding synths. [...] "There is so <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on here several it'll take several plays to really get it, but it's ace." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly described [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] as the [...] "downright thrilling" [...] and [...] "deploys a shrewd little form-versus-content paradox".|$|E

Declan starts a new job and he later lies to his family in front of her. Mullally said [...] "Declan's been pushing Kate away, he has so <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on in his life. He's holding on to these massive pieces of information that he feels he can't share with anyone – not even Kate." [...] When Kate sees Declan lying to his mother, she believes {{that he is not}} the boy she fell for and does not know if she can trust him. Mullally said that Declan is not prepared for the moment Kate breaks up with him and he is confused. Declan goes to Ringo Brown's (Sam Clark) bucks night where he meets Kate's rival, Candace Carey (Sheona Urquhart), who makes it clear that she is attracted to him. Declan and Candace later share a kiss, which Kate sees. Mullally said [...] "Candace gets talking to Declan and is there for him, he wants comfort and makes that split-second decision to kiss her. He doesn't think about the consequences". Declan does not know Kate saw them together and Mullally added that he hoped they could move on as they [...] "really do work as a couple".|$|E
500|$|On his casting in {{the role}} of Fatboy, {{television}} newcomer Ricky Norwood said, [...] "It's an honour to now be a part of [...] show. I am born and bred in the East End [...] it feels like a homecoming." [...] Norwood adapted his own use of slang into the character to [...] "try and bring it and from a true place." [...] Bunmi Mojekwu, who plays Mercy Olubunmi, commented [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square – a dream come true – I'm enjoying every second." [...] Sam Attwater, who previously appeared in five episodes of Hollyoaks, was cast as boxer Leon Small. On his casting, he commented, [...] "It's a great privilege to be working with such great actors and on such an established show. It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes. He said: [...] "As soon as I heard that I was straight down the gym. Lots of crunches. Everyone said don't worry about it, but every time I did one of those scenes I had to watch it back and see how it looked because there will be 10 million people watching it. I {{want to be on the}} best form." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't {{sure what to}} think about [...] "The Bishop Revival", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy working for the US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode [...] "surprisingly meh"; while appreciating [...] "all the weird family revelations about the Bishops", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be [...] "too much" [...] because [...] "we didn't need that extra backstory". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining [...] "Plotwise, there wasn't <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it." [...] Murray did however praise the killer's methods and [...] "Aryan aloofness" [...] as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "delightfully old-school". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained [...] "stupid revelations"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father [...] "just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's work for the government. Obviously, this info about Peter's grandfather {{was supposed to be}} 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point it just seems like a very artificial, unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged." ...|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the music}} Tippett {{composed}} following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli's [...] birth. The Fantasia would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though The Timess critic lamented the [...] "excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writing... there was so <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on that the perplexed ear knew not where to turn or fasten itself". Such comments helped to foster a view that Tippett was a [...] "difficult" [...] composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, {{who had to be}} replaced before the première by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the Sonata for Four Horns (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premièred by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: [...] "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen". The BBC's Controller of Music defended the orchestra in The Times, writing that it [...] "is equal to all reasonable demands", a wording that implied the fault was the composer's.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 21 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Dan Martin of NME gave the record {{a very positive}} review, calling a [...] "defining statement" [...] with the band's [...] "most stylistically hatstand-but-indisputably-best songs yet." [...] He wrote, [...] "We're not saying it's as good as genre watermarks American Idiot or The Black Parade. We're just saying it comes close," [...] closing with calling it a [...] "staggering achievement." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic rated the album {{four out of five}} stars and compared it to labelmate Panic! at the Disco's effort earlier in the year, Pretty. Odd. He wrote that [...] "Fall Out Boy capture the Zeitgeist of {{the latter half of the}} 2000s better than any band: there's so <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on in Folie à Deux, you either choose to take it all seriously or take none of it. Fall Out Boy make as much sense when heard either way." [...] Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press, commending the band for its [...] "creativity, ingenuity and willingness to try just about anything." [...] He compared the meaning of the term folie à deux ("a madness shared by two") to the two very distinct feelings expressed in the different sides of the record, calling the album a good representation of the band's career.|$|E
500|$|Special {{effects and}} {{pyrotechnics}} {{were provided by}} Pyritz Pyrotechnics Group. Terry Ritz, founder of the organization, and his partner Steve Aleff had created various ideas based on the tour soundtrack that was provided {{to them by the}} Wonder World Tour's personnel. They met with the tour's choreographer, band manager, and lighting designer, asking them to bring their [...] "hopes, wishes, and dreams." [...] Out of these meetings, the show was completed and a lighting crew, who monitored the stage with a four-camera monitor system when cues were executed, was selected. The pyrotechnics for the show were described as more elegant and subtle, being composed of pink flames with accentuation of silver and white glitter. Because of the extensive automation executed throughout the concert, two personnel were in charge of running it. Neville Emerton ran the automation from under the stage, and Sean Conner ran all of the flying moves from a position at the front of each venue. Meanwhile, assistant stage manager Seth Posner called cues for each concert. [...] "Normally, in a rock show you don’t need someone calling the show. In this one we had to take a more theatrical approach with someone calling cues {{every step of the way}} because there was so <b>much</b> <b>going</b> on at once between props and automation", explained production manager Omar Abderrahman. One of the props that required much attention on the part of Posner was a car made to resemble a tractor, designed and built by effects designer and stage manager Scott [...] "Stryker" [...] Christensen. Because it came along late in the design process, the main elevator was not built to handle the weight of the car, though it was eventually reinforced to support the weight and movement of the car. The car was also modified; it was made electric, instead of using a combustion engine, for fire-safety and changed to turn around by adjusting its turning radius to automate steering with all four wheels. In order to translate the concert tour overseas to the United Kingdom, the Wonder World Tour paired with Sound Moves, a company that was already providing minor support for the North American leg of the tour.|$|E
