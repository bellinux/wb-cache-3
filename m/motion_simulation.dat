40|$|In this thesis, a {{numerical}} {{program has been}} developed to simulate the wave-induced ship motions in the time domain. Wave-body interactions have been studied for various ships and floating bodies through forced motion and free <b>motion</b> <b>simulations</b> {{in a wide range}} of wave frequencies. A three-dimensional Rankine panel method is applied to solve the boundary value problem for the wave-body interactions. The velocity potentials and normal velocities on the boundaries are obtained in the time domain by solving the mixed boundary integral equations in relation to the source and dipole distributions. The hydrodynamic forces are calculated by the integration of the instantaneous hydrodynamic pressures over the body surface. The equations of ship motion are solved simultaneously with the boundary value problem for each time step. The wave elevation is computed by applying the linear free surface conditions. A numerical damping zone is adopted to absorb the outgoing waves in order to satisfy the radiation condition for the truncated free surface. A numerical filter is applied on the free surface for the smoothing of the wave elevation. Good convergence has been reached for both forced <b>motion</b> <b>simulations</b> and free <b>motion</b> <b>simulations.</b> The computed added-mass and damping coefficients, wave exciting forces, and motion responses for ships and floating bodies are in good agreement with the numerical results from other programs and experimental data...|$|R

Based on {{the theory}} of {{nonlinear}} random dynamic and ship oscillatory motions, by analyzing the spectrum of the random ocean wave and {{the force of the}} ship, the roll and pitch motion equations were erected respectively, then the irregular waves were created according to the superposition theory. Meanwhile, the coupling motion between rolling and heaving was studied, then the time-domain responses were the driving data of the <b>motions</b> <b>simulation.</b> Using VisualBasic, the interaction interface was established. Using MATLAB, the motions were solved. Using OpenGL the 3 -D model of ship was described. We just need input the ship and environment parameters then the results will be displayed with the 2 -D figures and the 3 -D model quickly, then the visualization of ship <b>motions</b> <b>simulation</b> is achieved.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{earthquake}} damage at a particular site depends on the source, the path that the waves travel through and the local geology. The latter is capable of amplifying and changing the frequency content of the incoming seismic waves. In regions of sparse or no strong ground motion records, like Malta (Central Mediterranean), ground <b>motion</b> <b>simulations</b> are used to obtain parameters for purposes of seismic design and analysis. As an input to ground <b>motion</b> <b>simulations,</b> amplification functions related to the shallow subsurface are required. Shear-wave velocity profiles of several sites on the Maltese islands were obtained using the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio (H/V), the Extended Spatial Auto-Correlation (ESAC) technique and the Genetic Algorithm.

This situation gives rise to a velocity inversion. Available borehole data generally extends down till the top of the Blue Clay layer therefore the only way to check the validity of the modelled shear-wave velocity profile is through the thickness of the topmost layer.
