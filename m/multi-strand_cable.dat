40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of high-current super-conducting <b>multi-strand</b> <b>cables</b> often lags behind the pre-dictions extrapolated from the {{performance of}} a single strand. Non-uniform distribution of the transport current among the strands is lively discussed as a possible cause. In order to investigate current distribution phenomena, a comprehensive model has been developed for the coupled analysis of electromagnetic and thermo-hydraulic proc-esses in forced-flow cooled superconducting <b>multi-strand</b> <b>cables.</b> The model has been implemented in PSpice. While this work is focused on cable-in-conduit conductors (CICCs), the technique can readily be adapted to other types of superconducting multi-strand conductors or to multi-filamentary composites. In this article we report on the reproduction of experimental results to verify the model, which showed very good agreement. Furthermore, the influence of the magnetic self-field of a conductor and the impact of possible micro-defects in the super-conducting filaments of a strand on the voltage-current characteristic have been studied by applying the presented model.

40|$|Quench propagration {{velocity}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters for quench protection of superconducting magnets. A larger quench propagation velocity is preferable in order to prevent local temperature from being increased significantly. In a <b>multi-strand</b> <b>cable</b> whose strands are individually insulated, it has been reported that the quench propagation velocity increases by a current redistribution between strands. However, influences of current redistribution on a quench velocity for a cable made of non-insulated strands have not been studied. We examined the relations between the current redistribution and the quench propagation velocity in a Rutherford cable made of non-insulated strands. Measurements were performed in the cables with three contact conditions between strands, and it was found that the quench propagatin velocity and the current redistributions depended on the contact conditions between strands. A measurement was also performed in the cable without polyimide tape for the cable insulation, and we found that the polyimide tape also influenced on the quench propagation velocity. A numerical simulation of current redistribution using a simple model was performed. We made comparisons between the test and the numerical results, and there was good agreement each other. We analyzed the numerical results in detail, and we found that the current redistribution occurred around the quench front caused the incerase of the quench propagation velocity. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Future high-energy physics demands higher {{magnetic}} fields to attain higher beam energies and thus needs novel superconductingmaterials in accelerator magnet applications. Current superconductors {{operate in the}} temperature range between 1. 8 and 4. 2 K and attain 8 T in modern operational machines. Meanwhile, prototypes have been built to operate up to 12 T, which approaches the foreseen maximum attainable practical dipole field of 16 T of modern low temperature superconductors. In {{the framework of the}} long-term European development project Eucard- 2, within the work package ’Future Magnets’, the technology for dipole magnets in the 16 to 20 Tesla range is explored. High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) materials have the ability to provide these high {{magnetic fields}}, but are in an early stage of development. In the recent past, significant improvements have been achieved by increasing current density and reducing cost, which implies the conductors’ future potential. The superconducting regime stretches much higher in both temperature and flux density compared to modern Low Temperature Superconductors (LTS), offering a new range of operating regimes. Higher current densities can be reached at the same operating temperature or, equal current densities can be reached at higher temperatures. The increased operating current density reduces the required conductor volume which leads, consequently, to more compact designs, while a higher operating temperature poses less restraints on the cryogenic cooling facilities. This versatility offers great potential for future magnet applications, however complicates thermal stability. Higher current densities and larger thermal margins result in very local normal zones with high peak temperatures endangering the magnet’s integrity. Adequate protection is therefore essential for safe operation especially in high energy density applications, such as <b>multi-strand</b> <b>cables</b> in accelerator dipoles. A quench should be detected sufficiently in advance, allowing time for the protection measures to take effect. Earlier studies showed traditional voltage detection not to be sufficient, causing permanent damage before the quench is identified. This reportwill explore the possibilities for quench detection for HTS magnets, by studying the underlying quench phenomenon in <b>multi-strand</b> Roebel <b>cables</b> using calculations and experiments to discover new possibilities for robust detection methods. Within this thesis, the multi-physics phenomena preliminary to a quench are analysed using a numerical model and various analytic models. To describe the quench behaviour, the stability of the superconductor is analysed as function of the operating current and cable andmagnet properties. Although this analysis focuses on Roebel cable, the locality of HTS quench reduces the influence of the exact cable geometry at hand. As is shown, a quench is predominantly dependent on the local thermal behaviour at the quench location and the macroscopic magnetic and electric properties of the magnet and cable, such as self-induction and interstrand resistance. LTS quench methods are therefore fairly cumbersome for makingHTS quench calculations. Due to its locality, the quench is difficult to detect especially at high current densities. Detection bymeasuring directly the quench itself, e. g. temperature and/or voltage, cannot cover its entire operating domain. However the effects of a quench, in particular the current redistribution, will be proven to have measurable effects on a much larger scale. Based on the model, a novel quench detection design to identify a quench in a preliminary stage is presented. To demonstrate the quench detectionmethod, a prototype is implemented in Feather-M 0. 4, a HTS racetrack coil with the goal to explore quench behaviour. A compactRIO was used for sensor data acquisition to verify the model and to validate the quench detection. The magnet tests encountered several practical problems for validating the quench detection design, including the ability to reach the higher current densities and artificially quenching themagnet. Although the test only delivered preliminary results, the quench detection design is implemented in FeatherM 2 based on its promising potential.

Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) {{was used to determine}} the trace element composition of numerous lipstick samples.

Numerous strands of a <b>multi-strand</b> speaker <b>cable</b> were analyzed by LA-ICP-MS. The strands in this study are spatially heterogeneous in trace element composition. In actual forensic applications, the possibility of spatial heterogeneity must be considered, especially in cases where only small samples (e. g., copper wire fragments after an explosion) are available. The effects of many unpredictable variables, such as weather, temperature, and human activity, on the retention of gunshot residue (GSR) around projectile wounds were assessed with LA-ICP-MS.

40|$|Current {{distribution}} {{among the}} wires of <b>multi-strand</b> superconducting <b>cables</b> {{is an important}} item for accelerator magnets. A non-uniform distribution could cause additional field distortions in the magnet bore and can as well {{be one of the}} reasons of premature quenching. Since two years electrical measurements on superconducting Rutherford-type cables are performed at CERN as part of the reception tests for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Cable samples of 2. 4 m length are tested at currents up to 32 kA, temperatures around 1. 9 and 4. 3 K, and fields up to 10 T, applied perpendicularly as well as parallel to the broad face of the cable. Last year, an array of 24 Hall probes was installed in the test set-up in order to measure the self-field of the cable samples along one cable pitch. Each of the probes measures the local field generated by the current in the strands close by, and the results of the all probes reflect therefore the distribution of the strand currents. Experiments are done varying the applied field and its direction, the temperature, the cable current ramp-rate, the strand-to-strand contact resistance and the cable joint resistances. In many cases a current imbalance is observed at lower currents, which at higher currents leads to either a current redistribution or to a premature quench. The main aim of the paper is to show the possibilities and importance of this type of measurements, and to present first experiments and results. Many tests are performed to understand the qualitative trends, but are often quantitatively not directly representative for the behavior of the cable in real magnets. (12 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|The Martin Aircraft Company Limited {{has been}} {{developing}} the Martin Jetpack for over 25 years. The recent worldwide launch of the Jetpack has enabled the company to step up its research and development programme. The goal of this project {{was to determine the}} feasibility of an electrically powered version of the Martin Jetpack. The feasibility of the Electric Jetpack was determined by researching energy storage technologies, researching power cable technologies, simulations of flight times, surveys of electric motors, {{and the development of a}} simulation program which was used to optimise some preliminary custom motor designs. The overall conclusion of this project was that the Electric Jetpack was feasible only when it was powered through a tethered power cable, and on-board energy storage was not used. An investigation into current energy storage technologies showed that the Electric Jetpack is not considered feasible when using on-board energy storage, however it is possible to obtain flight for a very short time. The energy storage technologies studied were batteries, fuel cells, and ultra-capacitors. It was found that the best performing technology was the lithium iron nano-phosphate battery. A simulation of flight time showed that this battery type would be able to provide flight for approximately 3. 6 minutes. Future trends indicated that the Electric Jetpack with on-board energy storage may eventually be feasible when using a lithium-ion based battery due to improvements being made in energy density and power density. By using a tethered power cable, the weight of the on-board energy storage could be eliminated. This was shown to be a feasible method for powering the Electric Jetpack for applications where the Jetpack needs to only be operated in a small area. The best cable type to use was a <b>multi-stranded</b> flexible <b>cable</b> operating at a high DC bus voltage. The weight of a 5 meter power cable using a 1000 V bus voltage was shown to be 4. 9 kg. Potential applications for this kind of Jetpack could include thrill rides and rescue operations from multi-storied buildings. A cable made from carbon nanotubes was shown to be a future technology that could offer a lighter cable. A survey of currently available electric motors showed that none met both the power density and speed required by the Electric Jetpack, even when using a tethered power cable to eliminate the energy storage weight. Because of this, a custom motor design was needed. Research into motor technologies showed that the permanent magnet brushless DC (PMBLDC) motor was the most suited type for the Electric Jetpack. The permanent magnet brushless AC (PMBLAC) motor was also suitable. A PMBLDC motor simulation program was developed using MATLAB which could be used to optimise preliminary custom designs. A characterisation of allowable motor time constants for the PMBLDC motor type was made in order to speed up the simulation time. The optimisation results showed that a power density of 5. 41 kW/kg was achievable for the motor when it was located inside the ducted fan tubes, and a power density of 6. 56 kW/kg was achievable when the motor was located outside the ducted fans and operated at a higher speed. The motor designs were shown to be within the expected torque per unit rotor volume (TRV) range for aerospace machines. The best power density figures would leave between 37 kg and 42 kg of weight for the motor driver/controller, cable weight, and miscellaneous motor parts. This was considered to be feasible. An FEM simulation was made on one of the optimised motor designs. The FEM results agreed with the parametric results within reasonable accuracy.
