5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years. Males are gregarious when immature, but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females.

5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} foliage and the roots are longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical shape with a {{well-defined}} shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>of</b> heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|$|E

5|$|Like most felines, the bobcat {{is largely}} solitary, but ranges often overlap. Unusual for cats, males are <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>of</b> overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges. Given their smaller range sizes, {{two or more}} females may reside within a male's home range. When {{multiple}} territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas.|$|E
5|$|Chroniclers Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto were {{generally}} unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard, but <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>of</b> the earliest years of John's reign. Accounts {{of the middle}} and later years of his reign are limited to Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall, neither of whom were satisfied with John's performance as king. His later negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death: Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. The latter claimed that John attempted to convert to Islam, {{but this is not}} believed by modern historians.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>of</b> pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> attitudes <b>of</b> Reform, Reconstructionist and Humanistic Judaism towards both sexual {{diversity}} and interfaith marriage {{may have contributed to}} the rise in their popularity during the 1990s, from about 33% of affiliated households to 38%, making it pass Conservative Judaism as the largest Jewish denomination in the United States.|$|R
5|$|The {{floral emblem}} for its {{home state of}} New South Wales, Telopea speciosissima has {{featured}} prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, particularly since Australian federation. Commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but is vulnerable to various fungal diseases and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. Horticulturists have also developed hybrids with T.oreades and T.mongaensis which are <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>of</b> cold, shade, and heavier soils.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>of</b> males. A male bear may visit a female continuously {{over a period of several}} days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E
5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>of</b> him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican {{affiliates}} to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of Transandinomys extends from eastern Honduras through Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia {{south and east}} to southwestern Ecuador and northern Venezuela, generally west and north of the Andes. The ranges of the two species overlap, but are distinct. T.bolivaris occurs from Honduras mainly on the Caribbean side of Central America south to western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador, up to 1800m (5900ft) above sea level. T.talamancae, which is found up to 1525m (5000ft) above sea level, is less widely distributed in Central America, as {{it is not known}} further north than northwestern Costa Rica, but is more widely distributed in South America, occurring into far southwestern Ecuador and northern Venezuela. It has also been recorded south of the Venezuelan Andes, in the narrow strip of forest between the Llanos and the mountains. Both species are forest rats, but whereas T.bolivaris is restricted to humid forest formations, T.talamancae apparently is <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>of</b> drier forest, which explains its wider South American distribution.|$|E
5|$|Labor's convincing win was not unexpected, {{particularly}} as infighting in the LCL had been ongoing {{for over a}} year. Friction was present throughout the campaign as well as before it, {{particularly as}} much of the donations were given directly to the LM. In the months before the election LCL members had thrown punches in the corridors of Parliament House. Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre-selection were keenly contested. Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets. Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies. There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson's win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick's main policy speech. Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson's dinner after they finished campaigning for the night, but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>of</b> the diverse opinions within the party. Labor ran a sedate campaign, but made much of the internal LCL divisions.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} event {{of his tenure}} in Salisbury occurred very late in his life when Major Robert Pike, a layman and very prominent member of his church, collided with him {{during the winter of}} 1675 to 1676. There may have been multiple reasons for the severe friction between the men, one of them being that Wheelwright was against the Quaker insurgence into New England, whereas Pike was much <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>of</b> their evangelism. Another reason may have been that during the election of 1637, Pike traveled all the way from Newbury to Newtown to vote Governor Vane out of office. A more recent and local cause of dissension was likely over the division of Salisbury when the town of Amesbury was created from it several years earlier. Pike had made certain claims of Wheelwright, to which Wheelwright wrote a petition to the court, and on 10 March 1676 the court sided with Wheelwright. Not easily rebuked, Pike enlisted support from other members of the church and town, following which Wheelwright called for intervention by civil authorities.|$|E
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> types <b>of</b> zooxanthellae.

Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|R
