5|$|Shielding gas <b>mixtures</b> {{of three}} or more gases are also available. <b>Mixtures</b> of argon, carbon dioxide and oxygen are marketed for welding steels. Other <b>mixtures</b> add {{a small amount of}} helium to argon-oxygen combinations, these <b>mixtures</b> are claimed to allow higher arc {{voltages}} and welding speed. Helium also sometimes serves as the base gas, with small amounts of argon and carbon dioxide added. However, because it is less dense than air, helium is less effective at shielding the weld than argonwhich is denser than air. It also can lead to arc stability and penetration issues, and increased spatter, due to its much more energetic arc plasma. Helium is also substantially more expensive than other shielding gases. Other specialized and often proprietary gas <b>mixtures</b> claim even greater benefits for specific applications.|$|E
40|$|As {{far as the}} {{increasing}} number of <b>mixture</b> components in the Gaussian <b>mixture</b> PHD filter is concerned, an iterative <b>mixture</b> component pruning algorithm is proposed. The pruning algorithm is based on maximizing the posterior probability density of the <b>mixture</b> weights. The entropy distribution of the <b>mixture</b> weights is adopted as the prior distribution of <b>mixture</b> component parameters. The iterative update formulations of the <b>mixture</b> weights are derived by Lagrange multiplier and Lambert W function. <b>Mixture</b> components, whose weights become negative during iterative procedure, are pruned by setting corresponding <b>mixture</b> weights to zeros. In addition, multiple <b>mixture</b> components with similar parameters describing the same PHD peak can be merged into one <b>mixture</b> component in the algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed iterative <b>mixture</b> component pruning algorithm is superior to the typical pruning algorithm based on thresholds...|$|R

5|$|Argon-helium <b>mixtures</b> {{are also}} {{frequently}} utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the <b>mixtures</b> are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These <b>mixtures</b> increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E

40|$|A <b>mixture</b> {{experiment}} involves combining {{two or more}} {{components in}} various proportions and collecting data on one or more responses. A linear <b>mixture</b> model may adequately represent {{the relationship between a}} response and <b>mixture</b> component proportions and be useful in screening the <b>mixture</b> components. The Scheffe and Cox parameterizations of the linear <b>mixture</b> model are commonly used for analyzing <b>mixture</b> experiment data. With the Scheffe parameterization, the fitted coefficient for a component is the predicted response at that pure component (i. e. single-component <b>mixture).</b> With the Cox parameterization, the fitted coefficient for a <b>mixture</b> component is the predicted difference in response at that pure component and at a pre-specified reference composition. This article presents a new component-slope parameterization, in which the fitted coefficient for a <b>mixture</b> component is the predicted slope of the linear response surface along the direction determined by that pure component and at a pre-specified reference composition. The component-slope, Scheffe, and Cox parameterizations of the linear <b>mixture</b> model are compared and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. <b>Mixture</b> component effects, Scheffe, linear <b>mixture</b> model, Cox linear <b>mixture</b> model, component-slope linear <b>mixture</b> model,...|$|R
