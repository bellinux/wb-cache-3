40|$|The article {{seeks to}} emphasise {{the need for}} greater {{cooperation}} between toponomasticians and cartographers, since both of these disciplines deal with marking a natural referent {{by way of a}} name or a drawing. The second important issue raised in the present article is the analysis of the toponomastic systems without a permanent linguistic centre which, through speech and linguistic practice, normally regulate the consistency of the toponomastic <b>monovalence</b> (one island = one name). As a centre for research of this phenomenon does not exist in the Kornati Archipelago, numerous communities in the vicinity of this group of islands practice the naming of islands po svoju (in their own way), which results in bi-namedness and tri-namendness. Modern cartography is right in ignoring this fact and offers complete <b>monovalence.</b> However, geographic maps through the history reveal that this has not always been so, and that this region has been characterised by considerable confusion in naming relevant islands. Among those who contributed to this confusion were the cartographers of earlier times...|$|E
40|$|Using the apical oxygen doping mechanism, i. e. {{a partial}} {{substitution}} of divalence O for the <b>monovalence</b> Cl, a p-type oxychloride cuprate superconductor, Sr 2 CuO 2 +xCl 2 -y, was synthesized at high pressure high temperature. The x-ray diffraction refinement suggests the superconductor crystallizes into a 0201 structure with space group I 4 /mmm and lattice parameters being a= 3. 92 A, c= 15. 6 A. The magnetic susceptibility {{as well as}} resistance measurements indicated that the bulk superconductivity with transition temperature 30 K was achieved in the sample.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of Pterocarpus angolensis seed lectin {{is presented in}} complex {{with a series of}} high mannose (Man) oligosaccharides ranging from Man- 5 to Man- 9. Despite that several of the nine Man residues of Man- 9 have the potential to bind in the monosaccharide-binding site, all oligomannoses are bound in the same unique way, employing the tetrasaccharide sequence Manalpha(1 - 2) Manalpha(1 - 6) [Manalpha(1 - 3) ]Manalpha(1 -. Isothermal titration calorimetry titration experiments using Man- 5, Man- 9, and the Man- 9 -containing glycoprotein soybean (Glycine max) agglutinin as ligands confirm the <b>monovalence</b> of Man- 9 and show a 4 -times higher affinity for Man- 9 when it is presented to P. angolensis seed lectin in a glycoprotein context. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|As {{existing}} battery technologies {{struggle to}} meet the requirements for widespread use in the field of large-scale energy storage, new concepts are urgently needed to build batteries with high energy density, low cost, and good safety. Here, we demonstrate two new aqueous batteries based on two <b>monovalence</b> metal ions (Li+/K+ and Na+/K+) as charge-transfer ions, Ni 1 Zn 1 HCF/TiP 2 O 7 and Ni 1 Zn 1 HCF/NaTi 2 (PO 4) (3). These new batteries are unlike the conventional "rocking-chair" aqueous metal-ion batteries based on the migration of one type of shuttle ion between cathode and anode. They can deliver specific energy of 46 Whkg(- 1) and 53 Whkg(- 1) based on the total mass of active materials; this is superior to current aqueous battery systems based on sodium-ion and/or potassium-ion technologies. These two new batteries together with the previously developed Li+/Na+ mixed-ion battery not only constitute a new battery family for energy storage, but also greatly broaden our horizons for battery research...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of the group of}} silver halogenides and <b>monovalence</b> azides of metals on the base of the united methodology of the electron structure has been held in the paper with the aim of the determination of main characteristics of the energy structure and chemical connection as basical ones for the understanding of physical and physical-chemical properties of the compounds investigated. As a result the main calculations of the electron structure of azides of alkali metals and silver azide have been done for the first time. The structure and partial composition of energy zones have been established. The gain of the covalence link intra a complex anion and between subgrids of crystals has been observed. The ordinary dependence of the conduction zone bottom position has been detected for silver halogenides. The method of the self-coordinated calculation of the electron structure of crystals with the complex character of the chemical connection has been developed and realized {{in the form of the}} program complex. The paper results may find their field of application in the {{investigation of}} the electron structure of complex ionic-molecular crystal compounds, in that number with heavy metalsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the enzymatic hydrogen bond forming/breaking (2 H(+) + 2 e reversible arrow H- 2) and the plausible charge and spin states of the catalytic diiron subcluster [FeFe](H) of the H cluster in Fe-only hydrogenases are probed computationally by the density functional theory. It is found that the active center [FeFe](H) can be rationally simulated as {[H](CH 3 S) (CO) (CN-) Fe-p(COb) (mu-SRS) Fe-d(CO) (CN-) L}, where the <b>monovalence</b> [H] stands for the [4 Fe 4 S](H) (2 +) subcluster bridged to the [FeFe](H) moiety, (CH 3 S) represents a Cys-S, and (COb) represents a bridging CO. L could be a CO, H 2 O, H-, H- 2, or a vacant coordination site on Fe-d. Model structures of possible redox states are optimized and compared with the X-ray crystallographic structures and FTIR experimental data. On {{the basis of the}} optimal structures, we study the most favorable path of concerted proton transfer and electron transfer in H- 2 -forming/breaking reactions at [FeFe](H). Previous mechanisms derived from quantum chemical computations of Fe-only hydrogenases (Cao, Z.; Hall, M. B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 3734; Fan, H.; Hall, M. B. J Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 3828) involved an unidentified bridging residue (mu-SRS), which is either a propanedithiolate or dithiomethylamine. Our proposed mechanism, however, does not require such a ligand but makes use of a shuttle of oxidation states of the iron atoms and a reaction site between the two iron atoms. Therefore, the hydride H-b(-) (bridged to Fe-p and Fe-d) and eta(2) -H- 2 at Fe-p or Fe-d Most possibly play key roles in the dihydrogen reversible oxidation at the [FeFe](H) active center. This suggested way of H- 2 formation/splitting is reminiscent of the {{mechanism of}} [NiFe] hydrogenases and therefore would unify the mechanisms of the two related enzymes...|$|E
