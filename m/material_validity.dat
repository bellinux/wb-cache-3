40|$|The essay {{discusses}} {{the import of}} the separability thesis both for legal positivism and for contemporary legal practice. First, {{the place of the}} separability thesis in legal positivism will be explored, distinguishing between “standard positivism” and “post-Hartian positivism. ” Then I will consider various kinds of relations between law and morality that are worthy of jurisprudential interest, and explore, from a positivist point of view, what kind of relations between law and morality must be rejected, what kind of such relations should be taken into account, and what kind of such relations are indeed of no import at all. The upshot of this analysis consists in highlighting the distinction between two different dimensions of legal validity (formal validity and <b>material</b> <b>validity</b> respectively), and in pointing out that the positivist separability thesis can apply to formal validity only. On the other hand, when the ascertainment of <b>material</b> <b>validity</b> is at stake, some form of moral reasoning may well be involved (here and now, it is necessarily involved).

This approach to semantics is motivated in part by Brandom’s pragmatism about the relation between semantics and the more general study of language use—what he calls “pragmatics”: Inferring is a kind of doing [...] The status of inference as something that can be done accordingly holds out the promise of securing an appropriate relation between pragmatics, the study of the practices, and semantics, the study of the corresponding contents.

They acquire their ‘materiality ’ not only through engagements with them as {{finished}} products, but also through processes that make them material, i. e. technology. This ancient field of study in anthropology, rejected from dominant trends because of its deterministic connotations, might be of use to explore processes of materialisation and to investigate the “inbuilt ” relationality of things and activities – in a similar sense that the relationality of personhood was demonstrated elsewhere (Strathern 1988, 1999).

Once harvested, long (and short) yams emerge not solely as phallic symbols, but also as artefacts, representations, living beings, ancestors, artworks, valuables, and mostly, food.

This thesis has four main objectives.   First, {{to assess the impact of}} using electronic communication tools to reach agreement.   Second, to identify some key points that should be considered when examining the formal validity of electronic contracts. Third, to establish a foundation for having a valid contract in which rights and obligations could arise accordingly.   Finally, this thesis aims to identify whether the traditional contract law rules are able to meet the challenges that are brought by the use of electronic communication tools, or whether they require reform. It will be noticed throughout that electronic contracts come in different types.   This leads to difficulty with introducing one rule to cover all types of electronic contracts. Furthermore, some concerns arise when electronic communication tools are used to form contracts as to the exact time of contracting. Other concerns arise when trying to fulfil some legal formalities such as writing and signature.   This is because of the special and dual nature of electronic data and the possibility of using different types of signature methods in cyberspace. Finally, it is important to consider taking steps to update some of the current contract law rules to work alongside the electronic technology revolution.   Some aspects of the traditional contract law rules become challenging when applied to electronic contracts.   For example, the issues of contract formation and the use of electronic and intelligent software require direct attention when considering the issue of e-contracts.   The reference to such challenging well-established contract law rules is necessary throughout this thesis, however, since the current rules which deal with electronic commerce in general and electronic contracts in particular do not cover all the issues that are related to electronic contracts.   Lastly, this thesis will sound the alarm on the need to raise the legal awareness of both online users and website developers when contracting online. Chapter Two will assess the use of electronic communication tools to form such contracts, and the sorts of problems that could arise as a consequence. Chapter Three will highlight whether or not electronic contracts can be considered written and signed when the law imposes such requirement.   This chapter will also seek to determine whether there is a need for such formalities in cyberspace. Chapter Four is designed to deal with selected issues of <b>material</b> <b>validity</b> of electronic contracts.   This chapter is essential when considering all types of electronic contracts, including formal ones.   It will consider issues that are related to mutual assent in cyberspace, and the problems that could arise with web-based contracts in relation to these.

It is well accepted among develop mentalists that motor-perceptual-and cognitive development are fundamentally interrelated.

The objectives of this study were to investigate (i) the validity and reliability of AHEMD-SR in Iran and (ii) the relationship between affordances and level of motor development. The instrument could provide useful information in a wide variety of settings, including applications to intervention and remediation. Approach: Data were collected throughout random sampling from 350 families with children within the age range 18 - 42 months in early childhood centers in Ahvaz, Iran. Families were asked to complete an inventory containing 67 items (AHEMD-SR) which represent five factors: Outside physical space, inside physical space, variety of stimulation, gross motor materials and fine motor <b>materials.</b> <b>Validity,</b> reliability, correlations and regression were examined. Results: The findings of the research suggested that the validity test of AHEMD-SR equals 0. 75 and its reliability test is 0. 89. A significant (0. 01 or 0. 05) positive moderate correlation was found between the five factors of AHEMD and Total AHEMD. Furthermore, there was a multiple relationship between the five factors of AHEMD and total AHEMD.
