5|$|The Wujing Zongyaos first {{recorded}} gunpowder formula {{used in these}} bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and carbonaceous content of 23% to 25.2%. The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and <b>mix</b> <b>together</b> sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine. Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.|$|E
25|$|This {{blending}} may be purely quantitative: various vintages can be blended {{to achieve}} the desired volume. It can also be qualitative; the taster or a team of tasters (cellar master, winemaker, owner of the estate, etc.) {{determine the amount of}} each wine to <b>mix</b> <b>together</b> in the final blend to obtain optimum quality. In winemaking blending is always empirical, it cannot be predicted that the combination of two or more vintages will give the expected product. The only secure values are analytical values (alcoholic strength, acidity, pH, etc.).|$|E
25|$|If {{the action}} of the algebra is isometric, as would be the case for Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian {{manifolds}} endowed with a metric and the symmetry groups SO(N) and SO (P, Q), respectively, one can then contract upper and lower indices (with the metric tensor) to obtain more interesting structures. For the quadratic Casimir invariant, this is the Laplacian. Quartic Casimir operators allow one to square the stress–energy tensor, giving rise to the Yang-Mills action. The Coleman–Mandula theorem restricts the form that these can take, when one considers ordinary Lie algebras. However, the Lie superalgebras are able to evade the premises of the Coleman–Mandula theorem, and can be used to <b>mix</b> <b>together</b> space and internal symmetries.|$|E

25|$|Alternately {{attributed}} to the 16th and 17th centuries, Groote Wafelen from the Belgian Een Antwerps kookboek was published as the first recipe to use leavening (beer yeast): Take white flour, warm cream, fresh melted butter, yeast, and <b>mix</b> <b>together</b> until the flour is no longer visible. Then add ten or twelve egg yolks. Those {{who do not want}} them to be too expensive may also add the egg white and just milk. Put the resulting dough at the fireplace for four hours to let it rise better before baking it. Until this time, no recipes contained leavening and could therefore be easily cooked in the thin moule à oublies. Groote Wafelen, in its use of leavening, was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons (wafelijzers) depicted in the Beuckelaer and Bruegel paintings of the time.|$|E
25|$|Green: At lower altitudes {{the more}} {{frequent}} collisions suppress the 630.0nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7nm emission (green) dominates. Fairly {{high concentration of}} atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common. The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the N2 molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength. (Red and green can also <b>mix</b> <b>together</b> to produce pink or yellow hues.) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100km {{is responsible for the}} abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains. Both the 557.7 and 630.0nm wavelengths correspond to forbidden transitions of atomic oxygen, slow mechanism that is responsible for the graduality (0.7s and 107s respectively) of flaring and fading.|$|E
25|$|The best-known mole {{is named}} after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed {{and there are two}} {{versions}} of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to <b>mix</b> <b>together</b> many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.|$|E

25|$|The SDC {{device is}} {{operational}} immediately after fabrication. Switching {{occurs in the}} Ge2Se3 active layer, where a key feature of the device, Ge-Ge homopolar bonds, are found. The three layers consisting of Ge2Se3/Ag/Ge2Se3, directly below the top tungsten electrode, <b>mix</b> <b>together</b> during deposition and jointly form the silver-source layer. This silver-source layer is not {{in direct contact with}} the active layer. This allows the device to have significantly higher processing and operating temperatures (above 250°C and at least 150°C, respectively) since silver does not migrate into the active layer at high temperatures, and the active layer maintains a high glass transition temperature (~350°C). These processing and operating temperatures are higher than most ion-conducting chalcogenide device types, including the S-based glasses (e.g. GeS) that need to be photodoped or thermally annealed. It is a combination of these factors that allow the SDC device to operate over a wide range of temperatures, including long-term continuous operation at 150°C.|$|E
25|$|HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) are two {{alternative}} {{representations of}} the RGB color model, designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to more closely align with the way human vision perceives color-making attributes. In these models, colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice, around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top. The HSV representation models the way paints of different colors <b>mix</b> <b>together,</b> with the saturation dimension resembling various shades of brightly colored paint, and the value dimension resembling the mixture of those paints with varying amounts of black or white paint. The HSL model attempts to resemble more perceptual color models such as NCS or Munsell, placing fully saturated colors around a circle at a lightness value of 1/2, where a lightness value of 0 or 1 is fully black or white, respectively.|$|E

500|$|The album's title [...] {{is a word}} {{coined by}} Yamaguchi. It {{is related to the}} term , a term {{describing}} the brackish water around river heads, where fresh water and salt water <b>mix</b> <b>together.</b> Yamaguchi replaced the character referring to water with the character referring to sky, applying the concept to mixing air instead. This phrase is used to represent the album's theme: mixing the unmixable. This idea related to how each member had completely different music tastes, but somehow were able to create music together. Similarly, it related to the idea of how Sakanaction as a band mixed rock, club and folk music, but were able to blend different tastes to find an equilibrium that a wide range of people would like. The band created the song [...] "Me ga Aku Aiiro" [...] as a song that would represent the album's theme in a single song. The album's introduction, a mix of recordings taken by Yamaguchi on his iPhone at the recording studio, was similarly created to match this theme.|$|E
500|$|The Kikuuiki album {{sessions}} {{were influenced by}} the commercial success of [...] "Aruku Around", where the band considered what sorts of songs they wanted to make, {{and what sort of}} music they should present to their new audience for the audience to understand what songs Sakanaction create other than [...] "Aruku Around"-style ones. The band did not want to make an album full of songs identical to [...] "Aruku Around", and instead wanted to express to their listeners the breadth of musical inspirations that they could <b>mix</b> <b>together.</b> Yamaguchi felt {{that it was important to}} not release a second similar song immediately after [...] "Aruku Around", as he saw that music consumers in the 2010s were acting as critics on their own Mixi or Twitter accounts. For these people, he believed it was important to exhibit different aspects of the band. He felt this was important for growing Sakanaction as a band, to break the cycle of a musical act becoming popular, then continuing to release the same style of music that made them popular until people grew tired of them. Even before the single's success, the band planned to feature songs on the album that would go against listeners expectations of what Sakanaction was as a band. On the other hand, the band attempted to keep a commercial sound, the same goal of Shin-shiro, or else they felt that their efforts would have been wasted. This led the band trying to create pop art music, blending art with commercialism.|$|E

2500|$|After a hunt, {{the eating}} habits differ from normal meals. When a seal is brought home, the hunters quickly gather around it {{to receive their}} pieces of meat first. This happens because the hunters are the coldest and hungriest among the camp and need the warm seal blood and meat to warm them. The seal is cut in a {{specific}} way directly after a hunt. Borré explains the cutting of the seal is this way [...] "one of the hunters slits the abdomen laterally, exposing the internal organs. Hunters first eat pieces of liver or they use a tea cup to gather some blood to drink." [...] At this time, hunters may also chop up pieces of fat and the brain to <b>mix</b> <b>together</b> and eat with meat.|$|E

2500|$|Incendiary and flaming {{weapons were}} used in warfare for centuries prior to the {{invention}} of Greek fire. They included a number of sulfur-, petroleum-, and bitumen-based mixtures. Incendiary arrows and pots containing combustible substances were used {{as early as the}} 9th century BC by the Assyrians and were extensively used in the Greco-Roman world as well. Furthermore, Thucydides mentions that in the siege of Delium in 424 BC a long tube on wheels was used which blew flames forward using a large bellows. The Roman author Julius Africanus, writing in the 3rd Century AD, records a mixture that ignited from adequate heat and intense sunlight, used in grenades or night attacks:Automatic fire also by the following formula. This is the recipe: take equal amounts of sulphur, rock salt, ashes , thunder stone, and pyrite and pound fine in a black mortar at midday sun. Also in equal amounts of each ingredient <b>mix</b> <b>together</b> black mulberry resin and Zakynthian asphault, the latter in a liquid form and free-flowing, resulting in a product that is sooty colored. Then add to the asphalt the tiniest amount of quicklime. But because the sun is at its zenith, one must pound it carefully and protect the face, for it will ignite suddenly. When it catches fire, one should seal it in some sort of copper receptacle; in this way you will have it available in a box, without exposing it to the sun. If you should wish to ignite enemy armaments, you will smear it on in the evening, either on the armaments or some other object, but in secret; when the sun comes up, everything will be burnt up.In naval warfare, the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518) is recorded by chronicler John Malalas to have been advised by a philosopher from Athens called Proclus to use sulfur to burn the ships of Vitalianus. Greek fire proper, however, was developed in c. 672 and is ascribed by the chronicler Theophanes to Kallinikos (Latinized Callinicus), an architect from Heliopolis in the former province of Phoenice, by then overrun by the Muslim conquests: ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{scholars}} {{of the era}} argue that a single name overshadows all others in 18th-century prose satire: Jonathan Swift. [...] Swift wrote poetry as well as prose, and his satires range over all topics. [...] Critically, Swift's satire marked the development of prose parody away from simple satire or burlesque. [...] A burlesque or lampoon in prose would imitate a despised author and quickly move to reductio ad absurdum by having the victim say things coarse or idiotic. [...] On the other hand, other satires would argue against a habit, practice, or policy by making fun of its reach or composition or methods. [...] What Swift did was to combine parody, with its imitation of form and style of another, and satire in prose. [...] Swift's works would pretend to speak {{in the voice of}} an opponent and imitate the style of the opponent and have the parodic work itself be the satire. [...] Swift's first major satire was A Tale of a Tub (17031705), which introduced an ancients/moderns division that would serve as a distinction between the old and new conception of value. [...] The [...] "moderns" [...] sought trade, empirical science, the individual's reason above the society's, while the [...] "ancients" [...] believed in inherent and immanent value of birth, and the society over the individual's determinations of the good. [...] In Swift's satire, the moderns come out looking insane and proud of their insanity, and dismissive of the value of history. In Swift's most significant satire, Gulliver's Travels (1726), autobiography, allegory, and philosophy <b>mix</b> <b>together</b> in the travels. Thematically, Gulliver's Travels is a critique of human vanity, of pride. [...] Book one, the journey to Liliput, begins with the world as it is. [...] Book two shows that the idealized nation of Brobdingnag with a philosopher king is no home for a contemporary Englishman. [...] Book four depicts the land of the Houyhnhnms, a society of horses ruled by pure reason, where humanity itself is portrayed as a group of [...] "yahoos" [...] covered in filth and dominated by base desires. It shows that, indeed, the very desire for reason may be undesirable, and humans must struggle to be neither Yahoos nor Houyhnhnms, for book three shows what happens when reason is unleashed without any consideration of morality or utility (i.e. madness, ruin, and starvation).|$|E
