The present study argues that {{a high level of}} organizational commitment in prosocial employees is predicted by bipartite synergy between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> and their supervisors&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations,</b> between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> and their organizations&# 039; prosocial orientations, and tripartite synergy among all three. Polynomial regressions and hierarchical regression analyses are undertaken on data collected from a sample of 216 full-time employees in China. The results show that perceived fit between employees and supervisors&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> (i. e., person-supervisor [PS] fit) is positively related to employees&# 039; organizational commitment (i. e., there is bipartite synergy between employees and supervisors&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations).</b> Perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR) moderates the relationship between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> and their organizational commitment such that when employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> and perceived CSR are both high (as opposed to when either or both are low), their organizational commitment is stronger (i. e., there is bipartite synergy between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> and CSR). Furthermore, perceived CSR moderates the relationship between PS fit in relation to prosocial <b>motivations</b> and organizational commitment. Notably, organizational commitment is strongest when there is a strong alignment among employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations,</b> supervisors&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations,</b> and CSR (i. e., there is tripartite synergy among employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations,</b> supervisors&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations,</b> and CSR).

Usually extrinsic <b>motivation</b> is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from intrinsic <b>motivation.</b> Common extrinsic motivations are rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity.

25|$|As the {{workplace}} is changing to include more group-based systems, researching <b>motivation</b> within these groups is of growing importance. To date, {{a great amount of}} research has focused on the Job characteristic theory and the Goal-setting Theory. While more research is needed that draws on a broader range of <b>motivation</b> theories, research thus far has concluded several things: (a) semi-autonomous groups report higher levels of job scope (related to intrinsic job satisfaction), extrinsic satisfaction, and organizational commitment; and (b) developmentally mature teams have higher job <b>motivation</b> and innovation. Further, voluntarily formed work teams report high work <b>motivation.</b> Though research shows that appropriate goal-setting influences group <b>motivation</b> and performance, more research is needed in this area (group goals, individual goals, cohesiveness, etc.). There are inseparable mediating variables consisting of group cohesiveness, commitment, and performance. As {{the workplace}} environment calls for more and more teams to be formed, research into <b>motivation</b> of teams is ever-pressing. Thus far, overarching research merely suggests that individual-level and team-level sources of <b>motivation</b> are congruent with each other. Consequently, research should be expanded to apply more theories of motivation; look at group dynamics; and essentially conclude how groups can be most impacted to increase <b>motivation</b> and, consequently, performance.|$|E

This thesis examines the underlying <b>motivations</b> for providing care home services for older people, drawing data from private, voluntary and local authority homes in eight areas of England. The study explores care home owners'/managers' <b>motivations.</b> The majority of respondents were found to be primarily motivated by meeting the needs of older people and professional achievements. With regards to professional <b>motivations,</b> interviewees reported high levels of job satisfaction. Care home owners/managers were satisfied with their career choice and felt that, through their work, they were contributing to society as a whole. The study identified a range of personal and external factors that could influence owners'/managers' intrinsic <b>motivations</b> and professional aspirations. Local authority commissioners' perceptions of care-home owners'/managers' <b>motivations</b> are also identified as playing an important role. Commissioners' views of care home owners'/managers' <b>motivations,</b> their perceived strengths and weaknesses, and their <b>motivations</b> will have a bearing on commissioning decisions. The results indicate that owners/managers are generally perceived by commissioners as highly altruistic, but also relatively financially motivated individuals. Further analysis revealed significantly different views towards profit maximising, which commissioners perceive as very important, while providers consider it to be of little motivational value. Private sector care home owners/managers are described by commissioners as significantly more motivated by personal income. Associations are found between commissioners' perceptions of <b>motivations</b> and the nature of their relationships with providers. The study also examined changes in owners'/managers' <b>motivations</b> between 1994 and 2003. The findings indicated that, overall, care home owners'/managers' main <b>motivations</b> remained unchanged over time. The policy implications of the main findings are discussed with a specific focus on care home owners'/managers' intrinsic <b>motivations,</b> commissioner- provider relationships, and the role of <b>motivations</b> in social care markets...|$|R
