5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>cases</b> of SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
