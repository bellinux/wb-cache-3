40|$|Abstract: The <b>multi</b> <b>sub-unit</b> <b>protein</b> {{structure}} {{representing the}} chaperonins group is analyzed {{with respect to}} its hydrophobicity distribution. The proteins of this group assist protein folding supported by ATP. The specific axial symmetry GroEL structure (two rings of seven units stacked back to back- 524 aa each) and the GroES (single ring of seven units- 97 aa each) polypeptide chains are analyzed using the hydrophobicity distribution expressed as excess/deficiency all over the molecule to search for structureto-function relationships. The empirically observed distribution of hydrophobic residues is confronted with the theoretical one representing the idealized hydrophobic core with hydrophilic residues exposure on the surface. The observed discrepancy between these two distributions seems to be aim-oriented, determining the structure-to-function relation. The hydrophobic force field structure generated by the chaperonin capsule is presented. Its possible influence on substrate folding is suggested...|$|E

The use of nanoparticles in vaccination has, to date, focused on attaching antigen directly to or within nanoparticle structures to enhance antigen uptake by immune cells. Here we question whether antigen incorporation with the nanoparticle is actually necessary to boost vaccine effectiveness. We show that the immunogenicity of a <b>sub-unit</b> <b>protein</b> antigen was significantly boosted by formulation with silica nanoparticles even without specific conjugation of antigen to the nanoparticle. We further show that this effect was observed only for virus-sized nanoparticles (50. nm) but not for larger (1000. nm) particles, demonstrating a pronounced effect of nanoparticle size. This non-attachment approach has potential to radically simplify the development and application of nanoparticle-based formulations, leading to safer and simpler nanoparticle applications in vaccine development...|$|R

The need for a dengue vaccine is great and several live attenuated dengue candidate vaccines are proceeding through clinical evaluation. The need to induce a balanced immune response against all four DENV serotypes with a single vaccine has been a challenge for dengue vaccine developers. A live attenuated DENV chimeric vaccine produced by Sanofi Pasteur has recently entered Phase III evaluation in numerous dengue-endemic regions of the world.

However, in the {{development}} of vaccines a trade off between safety and efficacy is required with newer vaccines, based on <b>sub-unit</b> <b>proteins</b> and peptides, displaying improved safety profiles yet suffering from low efficacy.

Of the new adjuvants being investigated, particulate systems offer several advantages including: passive targeting to the antigen-presenting cells within the immune system, protection against adjuvant degradation, and ability for sustained antigen release. There has been a range of particulate vaccine delivery systems outlined in recent patents including polymer-based microspheres (which are generally more focused on the use of synthetic polymers, in particular the polyesters) and surfactant-based vesicles. Within these formulations, several patented systems are exploiting the use of cationic lipids which, despite their limitations in gene therapy, clearly offer strong potential as adjuvants.

Here, we investigated the effect of oleandrin on the growth of human and mouse cancer cells in relation to Na,K-ATPase subunits. Olean-drin treatment resulted in selective inhibition of human cancer cell growth but not rodent cell proliferation, which corresponded to the relative level of Na,K-ATPase α 3 <b>sub-unit</b> <b>protein</b> expression. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines were found to differentially express varying levels of α 3 protein, but rodent cancer cells lacked discernable expression of this Na,K-ATPase isoform. A correlation was observed between the ratio of α 3 to α 1 isoforms {{and the level of}} oleandrin uptake during inhibition of cell growth and initiation of cell death; the higher the α 3 ex-pression relative to α 1 expression, the more sensitive the cell was to treatment with oleandrin. Inhibition of pro-liferation of Panc- 1 cells by oleandrin was significantly re-duced when the relative expression of α 3 was decreased by knocking down the expression of α 3 isoform with α 3 siRNA or increasing expression of the α 1 isoform through transient transfection of α 1 cDNA to the cells. Our data suggest that the relative lack of α 3 (relative to α 1) in rodent and some human tumor cells may explain their un-responsiveness to cardiac glycosides. In conclusion, the relatively higher expression of α 3 with the limited expres-sion of α 1 may help predict which human tumors are likely to be responsive to treatment with potent lipid-soluble car-diac glycosides such as oleandrin.

40|$|Vaccination {{remains a}} key {{tool in the}} {{protection}} and eradication of diseases. However, {{the development of new}} safe and effective vaccines is not easy. Various live organism based vaccines currently licensed, exhibit high efficacy; however, this benefit is associated with risk, due to the adverse reactions found with these vaccines. Therefore, in the development of vaccines, the associated risk-benefit issues need to be addressed. <b>Sub-unit</b> <b>proteins</b> offer a much safer alternative; however, their efficacy is low. The use of adjuvanted systems have proven to enhance the immunogenicity of these sub-unit vaccines through protection (i. e. preventing degradation of the antigen in vivo) and enhanced targeting of these antigens to professional antigen-presenting cells. Understanding of the immunological implications of the related disease will enable validation for the design and development of potential adjuvant systems. Novel adjuvant research involves the combination of both pharmaceutical analysis accompanied by detailed immunological investigations, whereby, pharmaceutically designed adjuvants are driven by an increased understanding of mechanisms of adjuvant activity, largely facilitated by description of highly specific innate immune recognition of components usually associated with the presence of invading bacteria or virus. The majority of pharmaceutical based adjuvants currently being investigated are particulate based delivery systems, such as liposome formulations. As an adjuvant, liposomes have been shown to enhance immunity against the associated disease particularly when a cationic lipid is used within the formulation. In addition, the inclusion of components such as immunomodulators, further enhance immunity. Within this review, the use and application of effective adjuvants is investigated, with particular emphasis on liposomal-based systems.

The number of protein se-quences known is about 200, 000 at the highly curated, non-redundant, Swiss-Prot section of the UniProt Knowledgebase release 7. 2 [1], and about 3, 000, 000 at the genomic-based, non-curated TrEMBL section of UniProtKB. On the other hand, {{our knowledge of the}} 3 D structure and function of proteins is much more fragmentary. Thus the number of UniProt release 7. 2 proteins whose structure is known is only about 11, 000 (of those, about 9, 000 are from the Swiss-Prot section). Computational tools, and specifically protein sequence classifications, could help us bridge this gap. The work presented here concerns the computational analysis of protein sequences. Specifically, we are interested in the identification of evolutionary <b>sub-units</b> of <b>proteins,</b> called protein domains, and in their classification. The various definitions of a protein domain suggested by different authors do not always coincide and are not always even precisely stated.

To determine whether AKAP 7 could substitute for a viral 2 =, 5 =-PDE, we inserted AKAP 7 cDNA into anMHV genome with an inactivated ns 2 gene. The AKAP 7 PDE domain or N-terminally truncated AKAP 7 (both lacking a nuclear localizationmotif), but not full-length AKAP 7 or a mutant, AKAP 7 H 185 R, PDE domain restored the infectivity of ns 2 mutant MHV in bone marrowmacrophages and in livers of infected mice. Interestingly, the AKAP 7 PDE domain and N-terminally deleted AKAP 7 were present in the cytoplasm (the site of MHV replication), whereas full-length AKAP 7 was observed only in nuclei.

An alternative approach to identifying genetic risk for AD is the use of quantitative traits or endophenotypes. The use of endophenotypes has proven to be an effective strategy, implicating genetic risk factors in several diseases, including anemia, osteoporosis and heart disease. In this study we identify a genetic factor associated with the rate of decline in AD patients and present a methodology for identification of other such factors. We have used an established biomarker for AD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau 181) levels as an endophenotype for AD, identifying a SNP, rs 1868402, in the gene encoding the regulatory <b>sub-unit</b> of <b>protein</b> phosphatase B, associated with CSF ptau 181 levels in two independent CSF series. We show no association of rs 1868402 with risk for AD or age at onset, but detected a very significant association with rate of progression of disease that is consistent in two independent series. Our analyses suggest that genetic variants associated with CSF ptau 181 levels may have a greater impact on rate of progression, while genetic variants such as APOE 4, that are associated with CSF Aβ 42 levels influence risk and onset but not the rate of progression. Our results also suggest that drugs that inhibit or decrease tau phosphorylation may slow cognitive decline in individuals with very mild dementia or delay the appearance of memory problems in elderly individuals with low CSF Aβ 42 levels.

Initial work concentrated on formulating and characterising, both physico-chemically and immunologically, cationic liposomes based on the potent adjuvant dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium (DDA). These studies demonstrated that addition of the immunomodulatory trehalose dibehenate (TDB) enhanced the physical stability of the system whilst also adding further adjuvanticity. Indeed, this formulation was effective in stimulating both a cell mediated and humoural immune response. In order to investigate {{an alternative to the}} DDA-TDB system, microspheres based on poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) incorporating the adjuvants DDA and TDB, either alone or in combination, were first optimised in terms of physico-chemical characteristics, followed by immunological analysis. The formulation incorporating PLGA and DDA emerged as the lead candidate, with promising protection data against TB. Subsequent optimisation of the lead microsphere formulation investigated the effect of several variables involved in the formulation process on physico-chemical and immunological characteristics of the particles produced. Further, freeze-drying studies were carried out with both sugar-based and amino acid-based cryoprotectants, in order to formulate a stable freexe-dried product. Finally, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) was investigated as a potential alternative to conventional SEM for the morphological investigation of microsphere formulations. Results revealed that the DDA-TDB liposome system proved to be the most immunologically efficient delivery vehicle studied, with high levels of antibody and cytokine production, particularly gamma-interferon (IFN-ϒ), considered the key cytokine marker for anti-mycobacterial immunity.

Here, we present results from light scattering and microscopy for several model protein systems which have been subjected to conditions that induce the formation of particulate aggregates. This has allowed the formation and structure of these aggregates to be examined in detail, which in turn has led {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanism and thermodynamics for their formation. Overall, the work gives us important insights into protein aggregation, which will eventually allow us to control and adapt this process in order to derive a range of benefits...|$|R
40|$|Merkel cell {{carcinoma}} (MCC) {{is a highly}} aggressive skin cancer with a high metastatic potential. The majority of MCC cases are caused by the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), through expression of the virus-encoded tumour antigens. Whilst mechanisms attributing tumour antigen expression to transformation are being uncovered, little is known of the mechanisms by which MCPyV persists in the host. We previously identified the MCPyV small T antigen (tAg) as a novel inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) signalling and a modulator of the host anti-viral response. Here we demonstrate that regulation of NF-B activation involves a previously undocumented interaction between tAg and regulatory <b>sub-unit</b> 1 of <b>protein</b> phosphatase 4 (PP 4 R 1). Formation of a complex with PP 4 R 1 and PP 4 c is required to bridge MCPyV tAg to the NEMO adaptor protein, allowing deactivation of the NF-B pathway. Mutations in MCPyV tAg that fail to interact with components of this complex, or siRNA depletion of PP 4 R 1, prevents tAg-mediated inhibition of NF-B and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Comparison of tAg binding partners from other human polyomavirus demonstrates that interactions with NEMO and PP 4 R 1 are unique to MCPyV. Collectively, these data identify PP 4 R 1 as a novel target for virus subversion of the host anti-viral response...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractSheep scab, {{caused by}} {{infestation}} with the mite Psoroptes ovis, is highly contagious, causing intense pruritus and represents a major welfare and economic concern. Disease control strategies rely upon chemotherapy, however, sustainability is questionable due {{to issues of}} chemical residues, eco-toxicity and acaricide resistance. Control by vaccination is supported by demonstration of protective immunity in sheep previously infested with P. ovis. We identified vaccine candidates for P. ovis based on: (1) antigens selected by their interaction with host signalling pathways and the host immune-response; and (2) those shown to be either immunogenic or involved in mite feeding. This resulted {{in the development and}} validation, in repeated immunisation and challenge trials, of a seven recombinant <b>protein</b> <b>sub-unit</b> cocktail vaccine. Sheep were inoculated on three occasions, 2  weeks apart, along with QuilA adjuvant. Vaccination resulted in highly significant reductions in both lesion size (up to 63 %) and mite numbers (up to 56 %) following challenge. Mean lesion size in vaccinates was significantly smaller than controls from 1  week post infestation (wpi) {{until the end of the}} experiment at 6 wpi. All antigens elicited serum IgG responses following immunisation and prior to infestation, whereas controls did not produce antigen-specific IgG during the pre-infestation period. Vaccinated animals showed an amnestic response, with levels of antigen-specific IgG against muGST, Pso o 1 and Pso o 2 increasing following infestation. This vaccine represents the greatest reduction in lesion size to date with a sheep scab vaccine, providing encouragement for future production of a commercially-viable means of immunoprophylaxis...|$|R
