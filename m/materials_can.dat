5|$|<b>Materials</b> <b>can</b> be {{coated with}} a thin film of niobium(V) oxide {{chemical}} vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition processes, produced by the thermal decomposition of niobium(V) ethoxide above 350°C.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{approach}} is tissue engineering, using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues. Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or agarose and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose. They fall into two categories: hydrogels and nanofibers. These <b>materials</b> <b>can</b> {{also be used as}} a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the electrons in solid <b>materials</b> <b>can</b> be visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique employs the photoelectric effect to measure the reciprocal space—a mathematical representation of periodic structures {{that is used to}} infer the original structure. ARPES can be used to determine the direction, speed and scattering of electrons within the material.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} composite thermoelectric material. The composite thermoelectric <b>material</b> <b>can</b> include a semiconductor material comprising a rare earth metal. The atomic {{percent of the}} rare earth metal in the semiconductor <b>material</b> <b>can</b> be at least about 20 %. The composite thermoelectric <b>material</b> <b>can</b> further include a metal forming metallic inclusions distributed throughout the semiconductor material. The present invention also provides a method of forming this composite thermoelectric material...|$|R
50|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{this means}} that the Laplacian of the energy of a paramagnetic <b>material</b> <b>can</b> never be positive (no stable levitation) and the Laplacian of the energy of a diamagnetic <b>material</b> <b>can</b> never be negative (no instability in all directions).|$|R

5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These <b>materials</b> <b>can</b> thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} where its purchase is legal, BZP products are often produced in small specialist laboratories. The raw <b>materials</b> <b>can</b> be purchased from various chemical supply agencies and formed into tablets or capsules using relatively cheap production techniques.

5|$|Quantities {{of atoms}} {{are found in}} {{different}} states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the conditions, <b>materials</b> <b>can</b> transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. Within a state, a material can also exist in different allotropes. An {{example of this is}} solid carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond. Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.|$|E

5|$|When cooled below a point {{called the}} {{critical}} temperature, <b>materials</b> <b>can</b> undergo a phase transition {{in which they}} lose all resistivity to electric current, in {{a process known as}} superconductivity. In BCS theory, this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. These Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance. (Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100nm, so they can overlap each other.) However, the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Since many <b>materials</b> <b>can</b> form crystals—such as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, as well {{as various}} inorganic, organic, and {{biological}} molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental {{in the development of}} many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the lengths and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale differences among various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or {{serve as the basis for}} designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.|$|E
5|$|Infamous Second Son is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. Players control the main character Delsin Rowe, who can parkour-style climb vertical surfaces like high-rise buildings. Delsin is a Conduit, which allows him to use superpower abilities by manipulating materials such as smoke, neon, video, and concrete. These <b>materials</b> <b>can</b> be weaponized (such that Delsin can perform melee attacks or fire projectiles from his fingertips) or used to deftly navigate the game world (such as using neon to dash up buildings). Using powers depletes a meter in the head-up display (HUD), which can be replenished by drawing from power sources such as smoke from exploded vehicles. Delsin earns new powers as he progresses through the story, which sees him fight against the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) during missions. Each time Delsin gains a new power set he must destroy D.U.P. Core Relays to learn the basic abilities that correspond to it. Delsin upgrades and acquires new abilities by spending Blast Shards that have been collected, they are scattered throughout Seattle. Players become more powerful in combat by expanding Delsin's suite of abilities.|$|E
