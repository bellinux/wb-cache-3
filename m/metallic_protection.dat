Initial upgrades were carried out in 2000 and 2001, which eliminated surface arcing between the <b>metallic</b> <b>protection</b> tiles and reduced plasma-wall interactions at the antenna front surface. A boron nitride septum was added at the antenna midplane to intersect electric fields resulting from radio-frequency sheath rectification, which eliminated antenna corner heating at high power levels. The current feeds to the radiating straps were reoriented from an E||B to E parallel B geometry, avoiding the empirically observed {approx} 15 kV/cm field limit and raising antenna voltage holding capability. Further modifications were carried out in 2002 and 2003. These included changes to the antenna current strap, the boron nitride tile mounting geometry, and shielding the BN-metal interface from the plasma.

40|$|International audienceSince {{its early}} age, civil and {{military}} aviation {{had to face}} atmospheric events of unexpected dangerousness. At that time, lightning was certainly the most unrecognized and misunderstood atmospheric hazard to aviation. How and where an aircraft is struck by lightning, what the expected consequences for flight safety are and what damages could be anticipated, were still open questions {{at the very beginning}} of the 1980 s. Up until this period, lightning safety on aircraft was ensured by oversized <b>metallic</b> <b>protection</b> and by considering the greatest lightning threat known. At the edge of the modern age of aviation, for which performances and safety were about to become of paramount importance, this approach was no longer valid. Awareness of the need for an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the entire physical aspect of the interaction between lightning and aircraft arose at that time. The twelve articles gathered in this special issue are aimed at addressing the entire aspect of the interaction between aircraft, launchers and lightning, from the state of the art on storm electrification and lightning phenomenology, up to the advance lightning zoning method on aircraft and the electromagnetic topology of the threat...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{anticorrosive}} primer paints there is growing interest to find environmentally friendly anticorrosive pigments to replace Cr(VI) pigments which are highly toxic both {{to the environment and}} to human health, with known carcinogenic effects. This has become a major challenge of the last decades for all the sectors involved in <b>metallic</b> <b>protection.</b> One of the alternatives of great scientific interest is the use of ion exchange pigments, which are mostly naturally abundant, easily synthesised, relatively cheap, and above all environmentally friendly. Studies of these pigments have not been conclusive about their anticorrosive efficiency and controversy surrounds their functional mechanisms, exchange capacity and anticorrosive performance. This paper focuses on the anticorrosive protection afforded by one anion-exchange pigment: hydrotalcite/vanadate (HT/V). Alkyd primer coatings formulated with non-toxic HT/V pigment have been applied on carbon steel specimens, and the effect of the pigment on the protective properties of the coatings has been evaluated by means of natural and accelerated corrosion tests (humidity, salt spray and Kesternich, 0. 2 L SO 2). A traditional zinc chromate (ZC) pigment has also been used for comparative purposes. The exchange and inhibitor capacity of the HT/V has also been evaluated. The inhibiting power of the HT/V pigment in solution is seen to be less than that of the traditional ZC pigment, showing also a low exchange capacity and solubility. On the other hand, the behaviour of the HT/V pigmented primers applied on carbon steel is suitable in moderate environments and deficient in aggressive environments, in both natural atmospheres and accelerated tests, and is much poorer than that of the zinc chromate.

40|$|Bowing of <b>metallic</b> thermal <b>protection</b> {{systems for}} reentry of a {{previously}} proposed single-stage-to-orbit {{reusable launch vehicle}} was studied. The outer layer of current <b>metallic</b> thermal <b>protection</b> system concepts typically consists of a honeycomb panel made of a high temperature nickel alloy. During portions of reentry when the thermal protection system is exposed to rapidly varying heating rates, a significant temperature gradient develops across the honeycomb panel thickness, resulting in bowing of the honeycomb panel. The deformations of the honeycomb panel increase the roughness of the outer mold line of the vehicle, which could possibly result in premature boundary layer transition, resulting in significantly higher downstream heating rates. The aerothermal loads and parameters for three locations on the centerline of the windward side of this vehicle were calculated using an engineering code. The transient temperature distributions through a <b>metallic</b> thermal <b>protection</b> system were obtained using 1 -D finite volume thermal analysis, and the resulting displacements of the thermal protection system were calculated. The maximum deflection of the thermal protection system throughout the reentry trajectory was 6. 4 mm. The maximum ratio of deflection to boundary layer thickness was 0. 032.

The analysis was made using mathematical models of two types of thermal protection systems that were under consideration {{for the space}} shuttle: a <b>metallic</b> thermal <b>protection</b> system, and a reusable surface insulation thermal protection system. Optimal entries were generated using maximum orbiter nose temperature as a parameter. Thermal protection system weights were computed for both fixed and variable angles of attack using three-dimensional entry trajectories. Results indicated that variable angle-of-attack entries require less thermal protection system weight than entries at a constant angle of attack (35 deg) for both systems considered.

Deflections are determined by numerical integration of structural rotations along the panel length. The analytical approach was developed for purposes of analyzing thin gage entry vehicle <b>metallic</b> thermal <b>protection</b> system panels subjected to cyclic bending loads at high temperatures.
