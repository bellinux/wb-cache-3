5|$|The role of RNA {{interference}} in <b>mammalian</b> innate immunity is poorly understood, and relatively little data is available.

5|$|Depending on the {{organism}} and experimental system, the exogenous RNA {{may be a}} long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates. In most <b>mammalian</b> cells, shorter RNAs are used because long double-stranded RNA molecules induce the <b>mammalian</b> interferon response, a form of innate immunity that reacts nonspecifically to foreign genetic material. Mouse oocytes and cells from early mouse embryos lack this reaction to exogenous dsRNA {{and are therefore a}} common model system for studying <b>mammalian</b> gene-knockdown effects. Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in <b>mammalian</b> systems by avoiding the direct introduction of siRNA, for example, by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the appropriate sequence from which siRNAs can be transcribed, or by more elaborate lentiviral vector systems allowing the inducible activation or deactivation of transcription, known as conditional RNAi.|$|E

40|$|In the {{observations}} on cells in normal ascites of <b>mammalians</b> (dog, cat, rabbit, rat and mouse) and of birds (chicken, pigeon and rice-bird) in tissue culture, the author obtained the following results: 1. Cells in the ascites of normal animals are consisted of many phagocytes designated commonly by various nomenclatures, and they present such a multiplicity {{that they may}} be classified into three types, large, intermediate, and small. 2. The morphology of these phagocytes in <b>mammalians</b> tends to resemble closely to monocytes in blood in the descending order of mouse, rat, rabbit, cat, and dog. That of chicken also resembles monocytes. 3. Although the motility patterns of phagocytes, especially of pseudopodia in the lower mamalians are variegated, in the higher <b>mammalians,</b> these patterns are mainly consisted of such as ones with membraneous process, projection waving like a flag, and tentacle-like process, and the pseudopodial movement also becomes more active. On the other hand, the motility of these cells in the case of birds, especially of the pseudopodial movement in chicken, resembles quite closely to that in dog and is quite active. 4. Numbers of motile cells are about the same in dog and chicken, while in the case of <b>mammalians</b> the number decreases in the descending order of dog, cat, rabbit, rat and mouse. 5. The wandering velocity of these cells is highest in the case of rabbit, but it is not so great in all the cases and no marked wandering can be observable either. 6. In tissue culture phagocytes are transformed into fibroblast-like or histiocyte-like cells, but the stage of transfermation in culture and numbers of transformed cells differ according to different animals...|$|R

5|$|K–Pg {{boundary}} <b>mammalian</b> {{species were}} generally small, comparable {{in size to}} rats; this small size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments. In addition, it is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple <b>mammalian</b> lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>mammalians</b> retina conveys {{information}} {{by means of}} spike trains. Though, understanding the way these spike trains represent the stimuli is still a challenging issue, especially when considering their non-determinism. Interestingly, the spike-based code of the retina is binary-like, and thus we considered its study in a signal coding fashion. To do so, we specied a coding scheme based on the mean ring rate of spikes simulated by a realistic model of the <b>mammalians</b> retina. We, then, inverted the generated code to reconstruct the original input. Besides, we established some links between the processing occurring in the retina and state-of-the art methods in pure image coding. Finally, we gave a biologically plausible interpretation for the non-determinism in the spike ring timings...|$|R
