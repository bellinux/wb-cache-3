40|$|ABSTRACT: Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} for the multiplex and quantitative analysis of enzyme activities in dried blood spots on newborn screening cards {{has emerged as}} a powerful technique for early assessment of lysosomal storage diseases. Here we report the design and process-scale synthesis of substrates for the enzymes α-L-iduronidase, iduronate- 2 -sulfatase, and N-acetylgalactosamine- 4 -sulfatase that are used for newborn screening of <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>types</b> <b>I,</b> II, and VI. The products contain a bisamide unit that is hypothesized to readily protonate in the gas phase, which improves detection sensitivity by tandem {{mass spectrometry}}. The products contain a benzoyl group, which provides a useful site for inexpensive deuteration, thus facilitating the prepara-tion of internal standards for the accurate quantification of enzymatic products. Finally, the reagents are designed with ease of synthesis in mind, thus permitting scale-up preparation to support worldwide newborn screening of lysosomal storage diseases...|$|R

40|$|Lysosomal storage {{diseases}} (LSD) are a heterogenous {{group of}} more than 40 inborn errors of metabolism that are due to specific defects of lysosomal en-zymes, lysosomal membrane proteins or transporters respectively. All LSD are inherited autosomal recessively {{with the exception of}} MPS II (M. Hunter), Fabry Disease and Danon Disease that are inherited as X chromosomal traits. Although individually rare their cumulative prevalence may be as high as 1 : 800 in certain ethnic populations. LSD in general are progressive multiorgan disorder with about 50 % having significant central nervous involvement. Each LSD comprises a more or less unique clinical spectrum with patients at the more severe end showing in-creased morbidity and mortality whereas patients at the milder end of the spectrum having only subtle clinical signs. Patients with mild disease may of-ten go unrecognized for many years. Therapy of LSD consisted mainly of palliative treatment until the recent de-velopment of enzyme replacement therapies for Gaucher, Pompe and Fabry Diseases as well as <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>types</b> <b>I</b> and II (MPS I/II) Lysosomes are intracellular organelles that encompass numerous hy-drolases and other enzymes that break down different compounds derived from intermediary metabolism such as complex lipids, carbohydrates and others. During the last years the interest for the LSD has significantly increased due to the development of novel therapies including enzyme replacement thera-pies (ERT) and substrate inhibition therapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by deficiency of α-L-iduronidase and {{characterized by a}} progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> is classified into two forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid progressive neurological involvement and attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and Scheie syndromes), which presents with slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant α-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We present here the clinical and laboratory results in an 12 -year-old patient affected by the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> treated by enzyme-replacement therapy {{from the age of}} 5 months, compared with his 17 year old affected sister, who started therapy at 5 years of age. CASE PRESENTATION: Clinical evaluation of these siblings shows that initiation of therapy prior of the onset of clinically detectable disease resulted in considerable improvement in outcome in the young sibling. After 12 years of enzyme-replacement therapy, facial appearance, linear growth rate, and liver and spleen volumes were normal; moreover, the degree of joint disease, vertebral, and cardiac valvular involvement were only minimal compared with those of his sister. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that early diagnosis and early initiation of enzyme-replacement therapy substantially modify the natural history of the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{with varying}} degrees of phenotypic severity caused by mutations in IDUA. Over 200 disease-causing variants in IDUA have been reported. We describe the profile of disease-causing variants in 291 individuals with <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> for whom IDUA sequencing was performed, focussing on the UK subset of the cohort. A total of 63 variants were identified, of which 20 were novel, and the functional significance of the novel variants is explored.

40|$|PURPOSE. TO {{determine}} the versatility of retroviral vector-mediated rat j 3 -glucuronidase cDNA {{expression in the}} normal retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of eyes of various species and in RPE of eyes with three <b>types</b> of <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS <b>types</b> <b>I,</b> VI, and VII) and to evaluate the effect of multiple transductions and long-term stable expression in the RPE. METHODS. A retroviral construct containing a rat j 3 -glucuronidase cDNA (NTK-BGEO) was used to infect RPE cells at subconfluence. The transduced cells were selected in G 418, an antibiotic toxic to normal mammalian cells. j 3 -Glucuronidase activity was measured in transduced cells and media, using a fluorogenic substrate. Glycosaminoglycan profiles were examined by metabolically labeling RPE with Na 2 35 SO 4. RESULTS. Transduced RPE cells, regardless of species or disease status, expressed rat j 3 -glucuronidase. The expressed enzyme restored normal levels of glycosaminoglycans in the RPE cells of homozygous MPS Vll-affected dogs by metabolizing stored glycosaminoglycans. The expressed enzyme failed to metabolize stored glycosaminoglycans of MPS I and MPS VI, indicating that overexpression could not bypass the exoglycosidase restriction.

40|$|Mucopolysaccharidoses are a {{group of}} {{lysosomal}} storage diseases characterized by the build-up of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and severe skeletal abnormalities. As GAGs can regulate the collagenolytic activity of the major osteoclastic protease cathepsin K, we investigated the presence and activity of cathepsin K and its co-localization with GAGs in <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) <b>type</b> <b>I</b> bone. The most dramatic difference between MPS I and wild-type mice {{was an increase in}} the amount of cartilage in the growth plates in MPS I bones. Though the number of cathepsin K-expressing osteoclasts was increased in MPS I mice, these mice revealed a significant reduction in cathepsin K-mediated cartilage degradation. As excess heparan and dermatan sulfates inhibit type II collagen degradation by cathepsin K and the spatial overlap between cathepsin K and heparan sulfate strongly increased in MPS I mice, the build up of subepiphyseal cartilage is speculated to be a direct consequence of cathepsin K inhibition by MPS I-associated GAGs. Moreover, isolated MPS I and Ctsk−/− osteoclasts displayed fewer actin rings and formed fewer resorption pits on dentine disks, as compared with wild-type cells. These results suggest that the accumulation of GAGs in murine MPS I bone has an inhibitory effect on cathepsin K activity, resulting in impaired osteoclast activity and decreased cartilage resorption, which may contribute to the bone pathology seen in MPS diseases...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular disease, a {{progressive}} manifestation of α-L-iduronidase deficiency or <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I,</b> continues in patients both untreated and treated with {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation or intravenous enzyme replacement. Few {{studies have examined the}} effects of α-L-iduronidase deficiency and subsequent glycosaminoglycan storage upon arterial gene expression to understand the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Gene expression in carotid artery, ascending, and descending aortas from four non-tolerized, non-enzyme treated 19 month-old <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> dogs was compared with expression in corresponding vascular segments from three normal, age-matched dogs. Data were analyzed using R and whole genome network correlation analysis, a bias-free method of categorizing expression level and significance into discrete modules. Genes were further categorized based on module-trait relationships. Expression of clusterin, a protein implicated in other etiologies of cardiovascular disease, was assessed in canine and murine <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> aortas via Western blot and in situ immunohistochemistry. Gene families with more than two-fold, significant increased expression involved lysosomal function, proteasome function, and immune regulation. Significantly downregulated genes were related to cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal elements, and calcium regulation. Clusterin gene overexpression (9 -fold) and protein overexpression (1. 3 to 1. 62 -fold) was confirmed and located specifically in arterial plaques of mucopolysaccharidosis-affected dogs and mice.

40|$|Background: Lysosomal protein {{profiling}} {{is being}} developed as a high throughput method to screen populations for lysosomal storage disorders (LSD). Design: 1415 blood spots from patients referred to a metabolic clinic for LSD were screened using a single multiplex assay for 14 proteins in a dried blood spot. Results: All patients with Pompe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) <b>type</b> <b>I,</b> IIIA, IIIB and VI were identified by reduced lysosomal protein. Five samples were identified as possible pseudo-arylsulfatase A deficiency; four were confirmed. One multiple sulfatase deficiency patient was identified with multiple reduced sulfatase proteins. There were 10 MPS II patients identified with reduced iduronate 2 -sulfatase, and one MPS II patient with iduronate 2 -sulfatase in the unaffected range. For Fabry disease, 10 male patients were identified with reduced α-galactosidase and 2 / 6 female Fabry heterozygotes returned α-galactosidase concentrations in the male Fabry range. All 10 mucolipidosis II/III patients were identified with multiple raised proteins. For 79 blood spots with chitotriosidase > 3. 4 mg/l, a follow-up one-plex chitotriosidase assay enabled identification of all nine Gaucher patients. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the sensitivity and specificity of this technology to accurately identify 99 % of LSD patients, {{with the exception of}} one MPS II false negative.

50|$|Monoclonal {{antibody}} Trojan {{horses that}} target the BBB insulin or transferrin receptor {{have been in}} drug development for over 10 years at ArmaGen, Inc., a biotechnology company in Los Angeles. ArmaGen has developed genetically engineered antibodies against both the insulin and transferrin receptors, and has fused to these antibodies different therapeutic proteins, including lysosomal enzymes, therapeutic antibodies, decoy receptors, and neurotrophins. These therapeutic proteins alone do not cross the BBB, but following genetic fusion to the Trojan horse antibody, the therapeutic protein penetrates the BBB at a rate comparable to small molecules. In 2015, ArmaGen {{will be the first}} to enter human clinical trials with the BBB Trojan horse fusion proteins that delivery protein drugs to the brain via the transcytosis pathway. The human diseases initially targeted by ArmaGen are lysosomal storage diseases that adversely affect the brain. Inherited diseases create a condition where a specific lysosomal enzyme is not produced, leading to serious brain conditions including mental retardation, behavioral problems, and then dementia. Although the missing enzyme can be manufactured by drug companies, the enzyme drug alone does not treat the brain, because the enzyme alone does not cross the BBB. ArmaGen has re-engineered the missing lysosomal enzyme as a Trojan horse-enzyme fusion protein that crosses the BBB.

Disease remained stable after treatment initiation with no statistically significant changes in mean FVC, 6 MWT, or height-for-age Z score. At last assessments, mitral and aortic valve function remained stable in 65 % (22 / 34) of patients; corneal clouding remained stable in 78 % (18 / 23); visual acuity remained stable in 33 % (8 / 24) and improved in 42 % (10 / 24) of patients.
