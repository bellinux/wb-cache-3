You weren't as surrounded by your peers as everybody else your age was... In my case it meant tremendous amount of reading at an early age... I read, listened to radio... I became utterly besotted with daytime serials... it enabled <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in an imaginary world where one is comfortable with abstract ideas, dominated by stories, narrative, and characters.|$|E
500|$|The lyric to [...] "Photograph" [...] is centred around lost love, {{with the}} singer having {{only a single}} picture by which to {{remember}} his absent lover. The eponymous photograph reminds him of their former happiness together, while also enforcing the reality that [...] "you're not coming back any more". Author Ian Inglis comments on the familiar subject matter in the conventions of pop songwriting, but identifies an [...] "unusual" [...] aspect in the lyrics' [...] "absence of any hope that love might be rekindled". Starr expresses resignation at what the future holds, in the lines [...] "Now you're expecting <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> without you / But that's not something that I'm looking forward to".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, H.D. started to write three {{projected}} cycles of novels. The first of these, Magna Graeca, consists of Palimpsest (1921) and Hedylus (1928). The Magna Graeca novels use their classical settings {{to explore the}} poetic vocation, particularly {{as it applies to}} women in a patriarchal literary culture. The Madrigal cycle consists of HERmione, Bid <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live,</b> Paint It Today and Asphodel, and is largely autobiographical, dealing with the development of the female artist and the conflict between heterosexual and lesbian desire. [...] Kora and Ka and The Usual Star, two novellas from the Borderline cycle, were published in 1933. [...] In this period, she also wrote Pilate's Wife, Mira-Mare, and Nights.|$|E

500|$|Mourinho {{was pleased}} to have won the final, earning the 21st trophy of his {{managerial}} career: [...] "I am like a kid winning the first one, it's hard for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> without titles. I need to feed myself with them." [...] Terry was optimistic about the club's prospects for the future, saying, [...] "It {{is the start of}} something... we've got a great squad, with some great young players, and hungry and experienced players too. It's a great mix." [...] Although praising the atmosphere at Wembley, Terry ruled out returning to the England team, for whom he had not played since 2012. Despite losing, Pochettino expressed pride in his team's performance.|$|E
500|$|Carroll {{considered}} requesting de Barth's {{appointment as}} bishop, but {{decided against it}} because of de Barth's lack of theological study and reputation for having a quick temper. Carroll died in 1815, and his successor, Leonard Neale, offered de Barth the position of bishop, but de Barth declined it. In a letter to Neale, de Barth wrote {{that if you do}} not forward my objections [...] to the Holy See ... I will not accept, but will kneel down and devoutly put the bulls in the fire ... and then farewell, Monseigneur. Neither you nor anyone else shall ever know the corner of the globe where I shall vegetate the few years still left to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> Neale accepted de Barth's refusal, and the see remained vacant. In 1817, after Neale died, de Barth traveled to Baltimore to participate in the episcopal consecration of Neale's successor, Ambrose Maréchal.|$|E
500|$|Vulović {{underwent}} {{treatment in}} a Prague hospital until 12 March 1972, after {{which she was}} flown to Belgrade. She was offered a hypnotic injection to help her sleep during the flight back to Yugoslavia, but declined, explaining {{that she was not}} afraid of flying because she had no memory of the crash. In Belgrade, Vulović's hospital room was placed under 24-hour police protection because the authorities feared that the perpetrators of the bombing would want to kill her. The guards changed shifts every six hours, and no one was allowed in to see her except for her parents and doctors. Her hospitalization in Belgrade lasted until June 1972, after which she travelled to Montenegro to recuperate at a seaside resort, where her doctors visited her every two or three days. Vulović underwent several operations to restore her movement. At first, she could only move her left leg, and one month thereafter, she was once again able to move her right. Within ten months of her fall, Vulović had regained the ability to walk, but continued to limp {{for the rest of her}} life, her spine permanently twisted by the fall. [...] "Nobody ever expected <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> this long," [...] she recounted. Vulović attributed her recovery to her [...] "Serbian stubbornness" [...] and [...] "a childhood diet that included chocolate, spinach, and fish oil." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gordon {{was first}} {{assigned}} to construct fortifications at Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, Wales. During {{his time in}} Milford Haven, Gordon was befriended by a young couple, Francis and Anne Drew, who introduced him to evangelical Protestantism. Gordon was especially impressed with Philippians 1:21 where St. Paul wrote: [...] "For to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> is Christ, and to die is gain", a passage he underlined in his Bible and often quoted. He attended diverse congregations, including Roman Catholic, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist. Gordon, who once said to a Roman Catholic priest that [...] "the church is like the British Army, one army but many regiments", never allied himself to any church nor {{became a member of}} one.|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, Arthur Janov and {{his second}} wife, Dr. France D. Janov (married 1980), started to offer primal therapy in Paris through an {{organization}} called the European Primal Institute (EPI). According to the UNADFI and Science et Vie, patients had to sign a contract [...] "disengaging the Institute of all responsibility" [...] until the Parisian operation closed down without previous warning in August 1985. According to these sources, some patients were [...] "abandoned" [...] (abandonnés), caught by the sudden closing of the EPI with their therapy unfinished. Janov wrote them a letter saying, [...] "I can not live anymore {{in the midst of}} pain and misery; after 35 years seeing patients, it is time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> my own life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of Christianity, he said: [...] "it is not now true for me.... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother... but if systemically I called {{myself a}} Christian I feel that to most men I should imply {{too much and}} so tell a lie". Of other world {{religions}}, he writes: [...] "All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in them.... They do not work for me". In The Fate of Homo Sapiens, published in 1939, Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating [...] "there is no creed, no way of living {{left in the world}} at all, that really meets the needs of the time… When we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 August 2010, the Russian Islamist website Kavkaz Center claimed Umarov had officially {{announced}} his resignation {{for health reasons}} and appointed his military deputy Aslambek Vadalov as his successor. He appointed Vadalov saying [...] "that jihad should be led by younger and more energetic commanders." [...] Although {{he added that he}} would [...] "continue to wage jihad and will do his utmost to help the new leadership. [...] does not mean that I give up jihad. I will do whatever I can by word and deed." [...] On 4 August, he contradicted the claim issued by him on video saying [...] "Due to the situation in the Caucasus I consider that it is impossible for me to quit my duties. The previous declaration is annulled. It is a falsification. I declare that my health is good to serve Allah. And I will serve the word of Allah and work to kill the enemies of Allah in all the time that he gives <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on this earth." [...] He called the initial video a [...] "fabrication," [...] but did not say why there was a conflict. Later in 2010, Vadalov and the Arab mujahid Muhannad attempted to overthrow Umarov {{as the leader of the}} Caucasus Emirate. The [...] "supreme judge" [...] of the group, Sayfullah and Emir Adam, the [...] "governor of Ingushetia province", continued to support Umarov. Umarov blamed the split in the organization for Muhannad, who was killed by Russian forces in April 2011, paving the way for re-unification. In July 2011, the insurgents' supreme Islamic court ruled in favour of recognizing Umarov as the leader of the Caucasus Emirate. Amir Khamzat, the commander of the Riyad-us-Saliheen Martyr Brigade suicide battalion was named the commander of the western sector; Hussein Gakayev was named to lead the eastern sector. Vadalov and Tarkhan Gaziyev consequently followed suit and re-affirmed their allegiance to Umarov. Umarov then warned Russia that it would be the target of a new strengthened insurgency as he promised a year of [...] "blood and tears" [...] as a result of the new unity.|$|E
