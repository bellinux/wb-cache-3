5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were <b>much</b> <b>better</b> understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E
5|$|Her {{determination}} sometimes caused clashes {{of wills}} with Charles. In most matters of patronage, Mary had {{to defer to}} Charles, which is why his relations in this area were not <b>much</b> <b>better</b> with Mary than with their aunt Margaret. He often criticized her decisions, which negatively affected their otherwise affectionate relationship.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 Briggs and Nedin {{reported}} from South Australia a new specimen of Myoscolex that was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> preserved than previous specimens, {{leading them to}} conclude {{that it was a}} close relative of Opabinia—although this interpretation was later questioned by Dzik, who instead concluded that Myoscolex was an annelid worm.|$|E

5|$|Siwiec's death foreshadowed the <b>much</b> <b>better</b> known {{self-immolation}} of Jan Palach in Prague {{four months}} later. Siwiec {{was the first}} person from Central and Eastern Europe to self-immolate in protest of the invasion, and one of two in Polish history (the other being Walenty Badylak).|$|E
5|$|The {{big change}} is that Billy {{is not being}} the big 'I do this—I do that'. It's <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> The band {{arranged}} a lot of songs for this record, and the song writing process was organic. The circumstances of the last record {{and the way that}} we worked was really bad.|$|E
5|$|As the {{war began}} to draw to a close, the ships of Battleship Division Nine {{remained}} busy. With frequent gunnery drill, the ships showed marked improvement in performance compared to the early days with the Fleet. The average spread for the whole division, including the newcomers Texas and Arkansas, was now less than , which was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than previously, if still {{not as good as}} the British average.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the Tu-80 {{began in}} November 1948, using as many Tu-4 {{components}} {{as possible to}} speed up construction, but the first flight was not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 {{in favor of the}} Tu-85 which was expected to have <b>much</b> <b>better</b> performance. The Tu-80 became a research aircraft, testing reversible-pitch propellers and structural deformation in heavy aircraft. It eventually became a target on a bombing and gunnery range.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos on the African continent, {{and they would have}} been <b>much</b> <b>better</b> runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
5|$|Having now gained {{experience}} with the Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, Final Fantasy V (1992), was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than that of IV. He named this as the primary reason that the soundtrack album was two CDs long, a first for the series. Like IV, the discography of Final Fantasy V included an arranged and a piano album {{in addition to the}} main soundtrack album.|$|E

5|$|In the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, {{financial}} decision-makers {{were able}} to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced {{than they did in}} the 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation and interest rates were <b>much</b> <b>better</b> contained. Oil exporters opted to make most of their investments directly into a diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jerry leaves Elaine {{in charge}} of his {{apartment}} while he goes on tour. When he returns, he finds the apartment has been robbed after Kramer left the front door open. While Kramer promises to find the robbers, George offers him the chance {{to move into a}} <b>much</b> <b>better</b> apartment—a move he accepts, allowing Elaine to move in Jerry's apartment and away from her annoying roommate Tina.|$|E
5|$|Instead, more {{abundant}} remains from Asia have provided more data. Initial remains were not promising; a partial fragmentary ischium from Heilongjiang, China, that Riabinin named S. kryschtofovici. <b>Much</b> <b>better</b> remains were soon recovered, though, but from Mongolia's early Maastrichtian-age Nemegt Formation. The 1946–1949 Russian-Mongolian paleontological expeditions recovered the large skeleton that became S. angustirostris {{as described by}} Anatoly Rozhdestvensky. Other skeletons {{from a variety of}} growth stages have also been discovered, and S. angustirostris is now the most abundant Asian hadrosaurid.|$|E

5|$|The 1866 {{construction}} was considerably stronger, {{compared to the}} two previous spans, due to major renovations. The old cables that snapped {{had been replaced by}} newer, stronger ones. Thomas also gave the span a new deck floor, a bridge railing and new stringers. The bridge was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> cared for this time around, as it also survived a local flood in 1903 and an icestorm in the early months of spring 1904.|$|E
5|$|The German naval {{contingent}} (numbering four, {{compared to}} the United Kingdom's eight) followed the British lead in operational terms. On 11 December 1902, the Gazelle boarded the old gunboat Restaurador in the port of Guanta. The gunboat was towed at anchor and put into service by the German Captain-Lieutenant Titus Türk with crew members of the Gazelle as SMS Restaurador. On 23 February 1903 was the return to Venezuela, where the ship was by the extent of repair work in a <b>much</b> <b>better</b> condition than the removal.|$|E
5|$|The O class' design {{reflected}} {{their intended}} role; a heavy main armament (six 380mm guns in three dual turrets) for possible encounters with escorting -armed heavy cruisers, enough armor {{to defend against}} the same and nothing more, and a high top speed {{so that they could}} get away from slower but <b>much</b> <b>better</b> armored capital ships.|$|E

5|$|The Royalist {{commander}} of the castle, William Edgecumbe, retreated from the castle on 19 April and the defenders blew up part of the site as they left, leaving the remains to the Parliamentary commander Colonel George Fleetwood. Some of the castle's stonework {{appears to have been}} reused {{in the construction of the}} new Cromwell's Castle by the Parliamentarians, just beneath King Charles's Castle, the new fortification being sited in a <b>much</b> <b>better</b> position to defend the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The {{air traffic}} control at Værnes was {{established}} in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training. The Telecommunications Administration took over {{the responsibility for the}} radio installations, and the responsibility for the meteorological services became the responsibility of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving a <b>much</b> <b>better</b> view of the air field.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Olivia were from an {{extended}} area of convection, or thunderstorm activity, that persisted southwest of Mexico in late October. Following {{the development of}} a circulation, the system formed into a tropical depression early on October22 about 430mi (690km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Olivia as it tracked northwestward, although further strengthening was slowed. The circulation became <b>much</b> <b>better</b> defined on October23 and after Olivia turned northeastward, it attained hurricane status that evening.|$|E
