50|$|<b>Moracizine,</b> a {{phenothiazine}} derivative, undergoes extensive first-pass {{metabolism and}} is also extensively metabolized after it has entered the circulation. It may have pharmacologically active metabolites. A clinical study has shown that <b>moracizine</b> is slightly less effective than encainide or flecainide in suppressing ventricular premature depolarizations. Compared with disopyramide and quinidine, <b>moracizine</b> was equally or more effective in suppressing premature ventricular contractions, couplets, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.|$|E
5000|$|The drugs used (encainide, flecainide, and <b>moracizine)</b> {{successfully}} {{reduced the}} amount of PVCs, but consequently led to more arrhythmia-related deaths. Total mortality was significantly higher with both encainide and flecainide at a mean follow-up period of 10 months. Within about two years after enrollment, encainide and flecainide were discontinued because of increased mortality and sudden cardiac death. CAST II compared <b>moracizine</b> to placebo, but was also stopped because of early (within two weeks) cardiac death in the <b>moracizine</b> group, and long-term survival seemed highly unlikely. The excess mortality was attributed to proarrhythmic effects of the agents.Class I antiarrhythmics are proarrhythmic during heart ischemia in animals.|$|E
5000|$|CAST was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, {{controlled}} trial. Patients were randomized to {{drug therapy}} or placebo if they met these criteria: They had a myocardial infarction occurring six days {{to two years}} prior to the onset of the study, and they had asymptomatic ventricular premature beats, detected by Holter monitor, which could be suppressed by either encainide, flecainide, or <b>moracizine</b> in an open-label design. A total of 1727 subjects who responded were randomized, 1455 to encainide, flecainide, or placebo, and 272 to <b>moracizine</b> or placebo. The primary endpoint was sudden cardiac death, and the secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moracizine</b> (INN) or moricizine (USAN) (trade name Ethmozine) is an {{antiarrhythmic}} {{of class}} IC. It {{was used for}} the prophylaxis and treatment of serious and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, but was withdrawn in 2007 for commercial reasons.|$|E
50|$|In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a large study {{testing the}} {{influence}} of antiarrhythmics on mortality, showed a statistically non-significant increase of mortality from 5.4 to 7.2% under <b>moracizine.</b> This {{is in line with}} other class IC antiarrhythmics.|$|E
50|$|Ethacizine (ethacyzine) is a class Ic {{antiarrhythmic}} agent, {{related to}} <b>moracizine.</b> It {{is used in}} Russia and some other CIS countries {{for the treatment of}} severe and/or refractory ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, especially those accompanied by organic heart disease. It is also indicated as a treatment of refractory tachycardia associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
