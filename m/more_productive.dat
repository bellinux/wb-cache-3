5|$|Originating {{from central}} European lowlands, the Funnelbeaker people {{were able to}} utilize large expanses of less fertile soils, {{obtained}} by extensive reduction of forested areas, with the increased role of livestock.

5|$|The {{years before}} the First World War were {{the golden age of}} the inshore fisheries. Landings reached new heights, and Scottish catches {{dominated}} Europe's herring trade, accounting for a third of the British catch. High productivity came about thanks to the transition to <b>more</b> <b>productive</b> steam-powered boats, while the rest of Europe's fishing fleets were slower because they were still powered by sails. However, in general the Scottish economy stagnated leading to growing unemployment and political agitation among industrial workers.|$|E

5|$|Advice on <b>more</b> <b>productive</b> {{techniques}} for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E

When Pam comes back, Jim reveals the job opportunity to Pam, who, despite giving her approval, is upset that Jim did not consult her beforehand.|$|E
