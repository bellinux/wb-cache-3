25|$|It was {{originally}} {{believed that there}} were two major pathways in colorectal cancer formation. The first was a chromosomal instability pathway thought to be responsible for the adenoma to carcinoma progression, which was characterized by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 5q, 17p and 18q. The second pathway was believed to be the <b>microsatellite</b> <b>instability</b> pathway, which is characterized by increases or decreases in the number of tandem repeats of simple DNA sequences. This type of instability is associated with some specific mutations, including genes involved with DNA mismatch repair and surprisingly, transforming growth factor-beta. More recently, those in the field of colorectal cancer have acknowledged that cancer formation is far more complex, but cancer related genes still tend to be categorized as chromosomal or <b>microsatellite</b> <b>instability</b> genes.|$|E
25|$|Frameshift {{mutations}} {{are known}} to be a factor in colorectal cancer as well as other cancers with <b>microsatellite</b> <b>instability.</b> As stated previously, frameshift mutations are more likely to occur in a region of repeat sequence. When DNA mismatch repair does not fix the addition or deletion of bases, these mutations {{are more likely to be}} pathogenic. This may be in part because the tumor is not told to stop growing. Experiments in yeast and bacteria help to show characteristics of microsatellites that may contribute to defective DNA mismatch repair. These include the length of the microsatellite, the makeup of the genetic material and how pure the repeats are. Based on experimental results longer microsatellites have a higher rate of frameshift mutations. The flanking DNA can also contribute to frameshift mutations. In prostate cancer a frameshift mutation changes the open reading frame (ORF) and prevents apoptosis from occurring. This leads to an unregulated growth of the tumor. While there are environmental factors that contribute to the progression of prostate cancer, there is also a genetic component. During testing of coding regions to identify mutations, 116 genetic variants were discovered, including 61 frameshift mutations. There are over 500 mutations on chromosome 17 that seem to play a role in the development of breast and ovarian cancer in the BRCA1 gene, many of which are frameshift.|$|E

30|$|Muir–Torre {{syndrome}} (MTS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal dominant}} genodermatosis characterized {{by the presence of}} both sebaceous skin tumors and internal malignancies; it is also considered a subtype of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [1]. MTS was first reported by Muir et al. in 1967 [2] and Torre in 1968 [3]. The underlying genetic background of MTS is attributed to <b>microsatellite</b> <b>instabilities</b> caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, most commonly MSH 2 and MLH 1 and less commonly MSH 6, which are responsible for base substitution mutations [4, 5].|$|R
50|$|In contrast, loss of MSH3 {{can lead}} to {{mismatch}} repair deficiency and genetic instability which {{have been identified as}} particularly common carcinogenic effects in human colorectal cancer. Mutations causing MSH3 knockdown {{can lead to}} diminished capacity for cells to repair long insertion/deletion loops causing <b>microsatellite</b> <b>instabilities</b> (MSI) in the genome and allowing an increase in the rates of somatic mutation. Elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST) are a type of MSI where loci containing AAAG or ATAG tetranucleotide repeats are particularly unstable. EMAST phenotypes are particularly common, with nearly 60% of sporadic colorectal cancers displaying high levels of EMAST linked to a high-rate of MSH3 deficient cells in tumors.|$|R

2500|$|Overall, {{the most}} common gene {{mutations}} in ovarian cancer occur in NF1, BRCA1, BRCA2, and CDK12. Type I ovarian cancers, {{which tend to be}} less aggressive, tend to have <b>microsatellite</b> <b>instability</b> in several genes, including both oncogenes (most notably BRAF [...] and KRAS) and tumor suppressors (most notably PTEN). The most common mutations in Type I cancers are KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PTEN, PIK3CA, and ARID1A. Type II cancers, the more aggressive type, have different genes mutated, including p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2. Low-grade cancers tend to have mutations in KRAS, whereas cancers of any grade that develop from low malignant potential tumors tend to have mutations in p53. Type I cancers tend to develop from precursor lesions, whereas Type II cancers can develop from a serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma. Serous cancers that have BRCA mutations also inevitably have p53 mutations, indicating that the removal of both functional genes is important for cancer to develop.|$|E

50|$|Over-expression of MSH3 {{can lead}} to drastic changes in the {{relative}} e levels of MutSα and MutSβ. Normally, MutSβ is expressed at relatively low levels throughout all cells while MutSα is present at high levels. While both proteins have redundant function in base-base repairs, MutSα typically effects base-base mispair repairs and also performs repairs on the more common short inertion/deletion loops. When MSH3 is heavily overexpressed, it acts as a sequester for MSH2 and the relative levels of MutSβ and MutSα shift dramatically as unpaired MSH6 proteins degrade and MutSα becomes depleted. MutSβ can compensate somewhat for loss of base-base mispair correction functions, but is not suited for repairing many short, 1-2 base pair insertion/deletion loops. This leads to a heightened rate of <b>microsatellite</b> <b>instabilities</b> and increased rates of somatic mutations.|$|R

40|$|Very {{recently}} a new molecular mechanism in the tumorigenesis of colorectal carcinoma {{has been described}} which is closely linked to hereditary non-polyposis colonic cancer (HNPCC).

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that the p 53 gene is a good target for molecular epidemiological studies to search for risk factors in carcinogenic events. The lung cancer incidence for females in Hong Kong is unusually high, ranking {{among the highest in the}} world despite a low percentage with a history of smoking. To gain insights into possible etiological risk factors responsible for this high incidence, we examined p 53 mutations in 35 lung cancer specimens from Chinese females living in Hong Kong and compared them with 35 matched cases from Japanese women as well as previously reported p 53 mutations in the world literature. p 53 mutations in exons 5 - 8 were present in 20 and 31 % of the Hong Kong and Japanese cases, respectively. Notably, single-base deletions within runs of identical bases were observed in 3 (43 %) of the 7 mutations in the Hong Kong cases, in contrast to the absence of such mutations in the controls and the extreme scarcity in the literature, suggesting that distinct environmental and/or genetic factor(s) might be involved.

40|$|Impeded DNA {{replication}} or {{a deficiency}} of its control may critically threaten the genetic information of cells, possibly resulting in genome alterations, such as gross chromosomal translocations, <b>microsatellite</b> <b>instabilities,</b> or increased rates of homologous recombination (HR). We examined an Arabidopsis thaliana line {{derived from a}} forward genetic screen, which exhibits an elevated frequency of somatic HR. These HR events originate from replication stress in endoreduplicating cells caused by reduced expression of the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase δ (POLδ 1). The analysis of recombination types induced by diverse alleles of polδ 1 and by replication inhibitors allows the conclusion that two not mutually exclusive mechanisms lead to the generation of recombinogenic breaks at replication forks. In plants with weak polδ 1 alleles, we observe genome instabilities predominantly at sites with inverted repeats, suggesting the formation and processing of aberrant secondary DNA structures {{as a result of}} the accumulation of unreplicated DNA. Stalled and collapsed replication forks account for the more drastic enhancement of HR in plants with strong polδ 1 mutant alleles. Our data suggest that efficient progression of DNA replication, foremost on the lagging strand, relies on the physiological level of the polymerase δ complex and that even a minor disturbance of the replication process critically threatens genomic integrity of Arabidopsis cells...|$|R
40|$|Background: Microsatellites {{or simple}} {{sequence}} repeats are repeating sequences of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Mutation in mismatch repair (MMR) genes can cause <b>microsatellites</b> <b>instability</b> (MSI) in some tumors. In familial disorder of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), {{there is a}} defect in the mechanism of MMR and clearly defective MMR cause unstable microsatellites. This study has been conducted for investigating the <b>instability</b> of <b>microsatellites</b> in alleles of BAT- 26 of MSH 2 gene in patients with HNPCC in Isfahan, which is an important prognostic biomarker for the prediction of the treatment outcome. Materials and Methods: DNA extraction from forty HNPCC patients peripheral blood samples were performed by using the DNA extraction kit. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction to amplify BAT- 26 was performed. The PCR products were studied by electrophoresis on agarose gel. Results: The size of specific band was 121 bp out of 40 HNPCC samples {{and based on the}} above method, it was shown that 12 cases (30 %) demonstrated MSI. Chi-square test showed this difference is statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The present study was conducted to evaluate the MSI in HNPCC patients. It was determined that the polymorphisms in BAT- 26 of MSH 2 gene could detect MSI with high sensitivity. Previous reports as well as our results have shown that the use of BAT- 26 alone would be sufficient to identify HNPCC-associated MSH 2 gene. Identifying MSI in these genes as a marker for prognosis, according to the present study and other researches is important to predict the treatment outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Genetic, immune and {{environmental}} interactions are key elements {{for the development}} of COPD. Cigarette smoking is considered the primary risk factor initiating inflammatory cascades in genetically susceptible individuals.

Members of HNPCC families have a predisposition to the of colorectal cancer {{at an early}} age and an increased incidence of extracolonic cancer, e. g-, endometrium, ovaries, small bowel, biliary tract, renal pelvis and ureter. Gerrnline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, in particular MLI-Il and MSH 2, are present in individuals with I-INPCC. Defective DNA mismatch results in genetic instability, which can easily be observed in short repetitive sequences such as <b>microsatellites</b> <b>instability,</b> MSI). MSI has been detected in most MMR-deficient tumours and it is considered the of I-INPCC. An international workshop on MSI held in Bethesda in 1997 proposed a panel of live markers to be used in MSI analysis. This panel, lmown as "Bethesda markers", includes two reats (BAT 25, BAT 26) and three dinucleotide repeats (D 2 Sl 23, D 5 S 346 and Dl 7 S 250). ln our we are currently using a different microsatellite panel composed by three rnononucleotide repeats (BAT 25, BAT 40) and two dinucleoide repeats (D 2 Sl 23 and Dl 8 S 57). Aim of our study is to evaluate the speciticity of r Q Btllhcsda markers, as compared with our panel, to identify MLHI and MSI-I 2 mutation-positive HNPCC. We compared the results of MSI~analysis in tumours from 17 HNPCC families (according to and from 75 families in which not all the Amsterdam criteria were met (Suspected HNPCC), both the Bethesda panel and our alternative panel. MSI-H tumours were defined as having instability at two or markers (out of 5), while MSI-L tumours had instability at only one marker and MSS tumours were stable at all In addition, imrrninohistochemistry of MLH 1 and MSH 2 proteins was performed in all MSI-H and MSI-L to study the correlation between thc two MSI—panels and the expression of MLHI and MSH 2 proteins. Results. Using the Bethesda markers, 27 (36 %) out of the 75 Suspected HNPCC tumours and I 2 (70, 6 %) out of the HNPCC tumours showed MSI. On the other hand, using our alternative panel, 16 (21. 3 %) Suspected HNPCC and 7 (41, 2 %) HNPCC tumours displayed MSI. In Suspected HNPCC tumours we found I 5 (20 %) md 5 (6. 7 %) MSI., using the Bethesda panel and our alternative panel respectively, while in I-INPCC tumours no MSI-L was detected us either panel. Loss of MLHI or MSH 2 was evident in 15 out of 39 (38, 5 %) MSI tumours according to the Beth panel, whereas with our alternative panel 15 out of 23 (65. 2 %) MSI tumours showed no protein expression. Conclusions. Our data suggest that the Bethesda panel is more sensitive to defne MSI tumours, but the propose marker panel is more sensitive to identify MSI tumours lacking expression of MLHI and MSI-I 2 proteins.

40|$|Abstract The limited {{prognostic}} {{value of}} currently used histologic classifications of gastric cancer and {{their failure to}} account for the complexity of the disease as revealed by more recent investigations prompted a combined reinvestigation of histologic, molecular, and clinicopathologic patterns in 294 extensively sampled, invasive gastric cancers representing all main histotypes and stages of the disease and followed for a median of 150 months. Among histologic parameters tested, only cellular atypia, angio-lympho- or neuroinvasion, Ki 67 proliferation index, expansile/infiltrative type growth, and T 8 cell-rich high lymphoid intra-/peritumor response (HLR) proved to be stage-independent predictors of patient survival. Among molecular tests, p 53 gene exon 7 (loop 3) and 8 (loop-sheet-helix motif and S- 10 band), but not p 53 protein overexpression, TP 53 LOH or 18 qLOH, were found to worsen prognosis. <b>Microsatellite</b> DNA <b>instability</b> was a favorable prognostic factor when coupled with HLR. Patient survival analysis of the main histotypes and their subtypes confirmed the favorable prognosis of HLR, welldifferentiated tubular, muconodular, and low grade diffuse desmoplastic cancers, and highlighted the worse prognosis of anaplastic and infiltrative-lymphoinvasive mucinous cancers compared to ordinary cohesive and diffuse cancers. Distinct roles of individual morphologic and molecular factors in tumor progression of the different histotypes have been recognized. The combination of survival-predictive histotypes and individual histologic or molecular parameters allowed us to develop a classification of all gastric cancers into three grades of increasing malignancy which proved to be of high prognostic value...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCOPD is {{a common}} disease and its major risk factor, {{cigarette}} smoking, has been identified. However, {{only a minority of}} smokers develop clinically relevant disease. Although, the current understanding of the pathogenesis includes an “abnormal inflammation” as a response to various noxious agents, its various pathways are not clear. Oxidative stress, inflammation, tissue damage and tissue repair (remodeling) are parts of the complex procedure leading to COPD. This is a review of the available literature concerning the “susceptible” smoker. An epidemiological model is discussed, putting emphasis on the timing of the exposure to cigarette smoke. There are evidences that respiratory adenoviral infection in early life could be also an important factor. Differences in nutrition could also play a role in protecting against the oxidative stress. Airway hyperresponsiveness failed to clarify the whole picture and is still open for debate. Genetic differences are the most likely explanations to describe the “susceptible” smoker.
