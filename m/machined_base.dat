5000|$|The {{engineering}} {{details on}} the Tay Bridge were considerably simpler, lighter, and cheaper than on the earlier viaducts. On these the <b>machined</b> <b>base</b> of each column section docked securely into a machined enlarged section {{of the top of}} the section below. The joint was then secured by bolts through matching holes on lugs (Crumlin) or flanges (Belah) on the two sections. This 'spigot and faucet' configuration was used (apparently without machining) on some Tay Bridge pier columns, but on some the bolts were relied upon to ensure correct alignment. (In the event, the joints were made using undersized bolts. [...] This gave greater tolerances when assembling the column, but the less positive alignment of the column joints as initially assembled and after any subsequent 'working' of the joint would have weakened the column).|$|E
40|$|Support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on {{positive}} feedback are put {{forward with the}} analysis of both {{advantages and disadvantages of}} current support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on Gaussian kernel function(including support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on K-nearest neighbors) and the essence why support vector machines is capable of describing data sets'distribution characteristics, thus the rigor constraint is overcome that maintains "corresponding parameters ofkernel function support vectors should be equal". The learning algorithm of support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on {{positive feedback}} is given. Simulation experiments of artificialand real data proves that support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on positive feedback is be obviously superior to current ones in its generation capabilities. Though, only the support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on positive feedback for pattern recognition is discussed, the idea included in support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on positive feedback is using kernel functions with different corresponding parameters to construct support vector machines, and is adaptive to other types support vector machines...|$|R

40|$|The Shifting Bottleneck (SB) {{heuristic}} {{is among}} the most successful approximation methods for solving the Job Shop problem. It is essentially a <b>machine</b> <b>based</b> decomposition procedure where a series of One Machine Sequencing Problems (OMSPs) are solved. However, such a procedure has been reported to be highly ineffective for the Flow Shop problems (Jain and Meeran 2002). In particular, we show that for the 2 -machine Flow Shop problem, the SB heurisitc will deliver the optimal solution in {{only a small number of}} instances. We examine the reason behind the failure of the <b>machine</b> <b>based</b> decomposition method for the Flow Shop. An optimal <b>machine</b> <b>based</b> decomposition procedure is formulated for the 2 -machine Flow Shop, the time complexity of which is worse than that of the celebrated Johnson’s Rule. The contribution of the present study lies in showing that the same <b>machine</b> <b>based</b> decomposition procedures which are so successful in solving complex Job Shops can also be suitably modified to optimally solve the simpler Flow Shops...|$|R
