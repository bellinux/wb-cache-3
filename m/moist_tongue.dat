40|$|Weather events {{over the}} central {{third of the}} United States {{during the first week}} of August 1970 provide an {{excellent}} example of an upper level summer continental warm anticyclone accompanied by well-defined <b>moist</b> <b>tongues.</b> This type of situation, in which significant amounts of convective precipitation can occur with anticyclonic northwesterly flow aloft, was discovered originally with the help of isentropic analysis and described by Namias (1938) and Wexler and Namias (1938). Since the advent of weather satellites, many cases of the cyclonic cloud vortex have been illustrated in the literature, but to our knowledge, none of the large-scale anticyclonic eddy. As shown by Stark (1970, fig. 7), a narrow band of precipitation in southern Texas was associated with th...|$|R
40|$|The Nimbus 4 temperature-humidity {{infrared}} radiometer (THIR) monitors radiation in the 6. 5 to 7. 2 -micron water vapor absorption region with a 23 -km spatial resolution at the subsatellite point. Radiation monitored in this spectral region results primarily from emission in the 250 to 500 -mb {{region of the}} upper troposphere. The THIR 6. 7 -micron observations are readily available in photofacsimile imagery form which shows very distinctive patterns associated with spatial variations in atmospheric water vapor. These radiometric observations have been combined in several instances with moisture values measured in the upper troposphere by the standard radiosonde network. In each instance, {{the result is a}} much more consistent analysis showing increased spatial detail that agrees with the radiometric observations and does not compromise the conventional data. The improved moisture analyses show relatively dry and <b>moist</b> <b>tongues</b> that are very difficult or impossible to infer from the conventional data alone...|$|R

The skin is thin, dry and translucent {{in some areas of}} the body, to the point that veins beneath the skin are somewhat visible. The face is thin and drawn with a hopeless, vacant and distressed demeanor; the eye sockets are sunken, giving the eyes a bulging appearance. The scalp is bony with dry, withering hair that is lacking. On the torso, the collar bone, chest bone and ribs are quite pronounced; the stomach is bloated, which indicates gastrointestinal distress associated with nutritional depletion. The mouth and tongue may be excessively dry, or <b>moist</b> with the <b>tongue</b> thickly coated; there is usually strong halitosis, or foul breath.|$|R

For a summer trade wind case, with GPS RO refractivity assimi-lated, the trade wind inversion is better predicted. For a winter cold front case, the propagation of the cold front is also better simulated when GPS RO refractivity is assimilated.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} mesoscale variability of the earth-atmosphere system, aircraft-borne Multi-spectral Atmospheric Mapping Sensor (MAMS), 100 -meter-resolution radiometric data, and geostationary-borne VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) 8 -km-resolution radiometric data are used {{together in a}} physical retrieval method to produce 100 -m-resolution depictions of atmospheric moisture, stability, and skin temperature. The VAS, with its IR-sounding capability, provides the vertical information to the retrieval while the MAMS, with its 100 -m resolution, provides the horizontal information. The retrievals show mesoscale features, including a <b>moist</b> <b>tongue</b> intrusion and an urban heat island. Mesogamma-scale gradients are found to exceed mesobeta-scale gradients, and significant mesogamma-scale variability is not captured in current geostationary sounding data. It is suggested that improvements to the spatial resolution of operating sounding data will yield improved information on atmospheric and surface gradients, especially at the mesogamma scale...|$|E
40|$|The ECMWF 2. 5 ° gridded {{analysis}} was used to re-examine the evolution of the synoptic flow patterns and frontal structure of an early summer monsoon trough that occurred during 10 − 15 June 1975. A blocking pattern that began with an omega shape developed into a Rex pattern on 12 June. During 10 − 14 June, the blocking low pressure and associated trough axis were almost stagnant. As a result, the Mei-Yu front was quasi-stationary and affected the Taiwan area for more than four days. Similar to other frontal systems during the early summer rainy season over southern China, this Mei-Yu front exhibited baro-clinic characteristics in the subtropics. In the lower troposphere, appreciable temperature gradients and maximum frontogenesis due to horizontal deformation between the postfrontal northwest-erlies and prefrontal southwesterlies were diagnosed. The western section (~ 115 °E) of this frontal system exhibited a marked northward vertical tilt. An upper-level jet near the tropopause was also present. A <b>moist</b> <b>tongue</b> was located south of the surface cold front within the low-level southwesterlies and extended vertically upward. A thermally direct circulation across the front with ascending motion within the prefrontal warm, moist air and descending motion within the postfrontal cold, dry air underneath the upper-level jet was diagnosed...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Two {{contrasting}} localized {{heavy rainfall}} events during Taiwan's early summer rainy {{season with the}} daily rainfall maximum along the windward mountain range and coast were studied and compared {{using a combination of}} observations and numerical simulations. Both events occurred under favorable large-scale settings including the existence of a moisture tongue from the tropics. For the 31 May case, heavy rainfall occurred in the afternoon hours over the southwestern windward slopes after a shallow surface front passed central Taiwan. The orographic lifting of the prevailing warm, moist, west-southwesterly flow aloft, combined with a sea breeze-upslope flow at the surface provided the localized lifting needed for the development of heavy precipitation. On 16 June before sunrise, pronounced orographic blocking of the warm, moist, south/southwesterly flow occurred {{because of the presence of}} relatively cold air at low levels with an offshore wind component as a result of nocturnal and rain evaporative cooling. This also caused convective systems to intensify as they moved toward the southwestern coast. During the daytime, the cold pool remained over southwestern Taiwan without the development of onshore/upslope flow. Furthermore, with a southsouthwesterly flow aloft parallel to terrain contours, orographic lifting was almost absent, and pre-existing rain cells offshore diminished after they moved inland. Over northern Taiwan on the leeside, a sea-breeze/onshore flow developed in the afternoon hours, resulting in heavy thundershowers. Our results demonstrate the importance of diurnal and local effects on determining the location and timing for the occurrences of localized heavy precipitation during the early summer rainy season over Taiwan. Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate global positioning system (GPS) radio-occultation (RO) soundings were used to depict the prefrontal <b>moist</b> <b>tongue</b> for a heavy rainfall case (16 June 2008) during the early summer season over Taiwan. Cycling model runs assimilate Terrain-influenced Monsoon Rainfall Experiment (TiMREX) data, global telecommunications system (GTS) data and GPS RO sounding data in order to improve the initial conditions for the outermost domain as well as all nested domains. This leads to better representations of the prefrontal <b>moist</b> <b>tongue</b> over the open ocean, a weak 500 -hPa prefrontal trough, and the modifications of the planetary boundary layer structure by the antecedent rains of 14 - 15 June. The GPS RO data have positive impacts on subsynoptic features including the upper-level low/trough location and orientation resulting in a better initial condition for sequence forecast for upward motion and rainfall patterns. The initial air temperature in the boundary layer over southwestern Taiwan in the early morning of 16 June is relatively cold with significant orographic blocking as compared with the control run initialized with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) data. As a result, local circulations over Taiwan as well as rainfall along the southwestern coast and afternoon heavy showers in the wake zone over northern Taiwan are better predicted with cycling runs that start 36 hours before the model forecasts...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of a pilot study of the {{evolution}} of large scale hydrologic processes associated with the first transition of the Asian summer monsoon in conjunction with the launching of the South China Sea Monsoon Experiment (SCSMEX) in May, 1998. Using a combination of satellite-estimated rainfall, moisture, surface wind and sea surface temperature, we present some interesting and hitherto unknown features in large scale atmospheric and oceanic hydrologic processes associated with the fluctuation of the SCS monsoon. Results show that, climatologically, the SCS monsoon occurs during mid-May when major convection zone shifts from the eastern Indian Ocean/southern Indochina to the SCS. Simultaneously with the SCS monsoon onset is the development of a <b>moist</b> <b>tongue</b> and frontal rainband emanating from northern SCS, across southern China and the East China Sea to southern Japan as well as the enhancement of equatorial convection in the western Pacific ITCZ. Analysis of the satellite-derived moisture and rainfall show that the onset of the SCS monsoon during 1997 was preceded by the development of eastward propagating supercloud clusters over the Indian Ocean. The satellite data also reveal a strong onset vortex over the SCS and large scale cooling and warming patterns over the Indian Ocean and western Pacific. These features signal a major shift of the large-scale hydrologic cycle in the ocean-atmosphere system, which underpins the SCS monsoon onset. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the observational platform of SCSMEX and a call for the utility of satellite data, field observations and models for comprehensive studies of the Asian monsoon...|$|E
40|$|In earlier work, a {{three-dimensional}} cloud model {{was used to}} simulate {{the interaction between the}} sea-breeze front (SBF) and front-parallel horizontal convective rolls (HCRs), resulting in the SBF system-atically encountering roll updrafts and downdrafts as it progressed inland. Interestingly, deep convection was spawned above an HCR updraft ahead of the SBF as the front approached, well before the inevitable front–roll merger. Ostensibly, both the sea-breeze and roll circulations were required for deep convection to be present in this case at all because convection was entirely absent when either phenomenon was removed. Further analysis reveals why both circulations were necessary yet not sufficient for the excitation of deep convection in this case. The sea-breeze circulation (SBC) made its upstream (inland) environment more favorable for convection by bringing about persistent if gentle lifting over an extended region stretching well ahead of the SBF. This persistent ascent established a moist and cool tongue of air, manifested by a visible and/or subvisible cloud feature termed the cloud shelf emanating ahead of the front. Though this lifting moistened and destabilized the environment, the roll’s direct and indirect effects on this <b>moist</b> <b>tongue</b> were also required. The former consisted of a moisture plume lofted by the roll updraft, and the latter consisted of obstacle effect gravity waves generated as the roll drafts penetrated through the top of the boundary layer, into the SBC-associated offshore flow farther aloft. These provided the missing spark, which led to rapid growth of cumulus above the roll updraft, drawing first from air located above the boundary layer. Once established, deep convection above the roll updraft modulated cloudiness above the approaching SBF, at first suppressing it but subsequently assuring its reestablishment and eventual growth into deep convection, again prior to the front–roll merger. This resulted from the influence of gravity waves excited owing to heating and cooling within the roll cloud. 1...|$|E
