40|$|International audienceData dependences {{are known}} to hamper {{efficient}} parallelization of programs. <b>Memory</b> <b>expansion</b> is a general method to remove dependences in assigning distinct memory locations to dependent writes. Parallelization via <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> requires both moderation in the expansion degree and efficiency at run-time. We present a general storage mapping optimization framework for imperative programs, applicable to most loop nest parallelization techniques...|$|R

50|$|In March 1988, Apple began {{shipping}} IIGS {{units with}} 512 KB of RAM as standard. This {{was done by}} preinstalling the Apple IIGS <b>Memory</b> <b>Expansion</b> Card (that was once sold separately) in the <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> slot—the card had 256 KB of RAM on board with empty sockets for further <b>expansion.</b> The built-in <b>memory</b> on the motherboard remained at 256 KB and existing users were not offered this upgrade.|$|R

50|$|Memory costs fell, {{so there}} was less reason to have bus-based <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> when one could have plenty on the {{processor}} board.|$|R
50|$|Amstrad CPCs are {{equipped}} with either 64 (CPC464, CPC664, 464plus, GX4000) or 128 (CPC6128, 6128plus) KB of RAM. This base memory can be extended by up to 512 KB using <b>memory</b> <b>expansions</b> sold by third-party manufacturers, and by up to 4096 KB using experimental methods developed by hardware enthusiasts. Because the Z80 processor is only able to directly address 64 KB of memory, additional memory from the 128 KB models and <b>memory</b> <b>expansions</b> is made available using bank switching.|$|R
50|$|The first {{products}} from Skyles Electric Works were <b>memory</b> <b>expansions</b> and keyboards (the first PETs had calculator-style keys which were unsuited to touch-typing).|$|R

50|$|AIX 7.1 fully {{exploits}} systems {{based on}} POWER7 processors include the Active <b>Memory</b> <b>Expansion</b> feature, which increases system flexibility where system administrators can configure logical partitions (LPARs) to use less physical memory. For example, an LPAR running AIX appears to the OS applications to be configured with 80 GB of physical memory but the hardware actually only consumes 60 GB of physical <b>memory.</b> Active <b>Memory</b> <b>Expansion</b> {{is a virtual}} memory compression system which employs memory compression technology to transparently compress in-memory data, allowing more data to be placed into memory and thus expanding the memory capacity of POWER7 systems. Using Active <b>Memory</b> <b>Expansion</b> can improve system utilization and increase a system’s throughput. AIX 7 automatically manages the size of memory pages used to automatically use 4 KB, 64 KB {{or a combination of}} those page sizes. This self-tuning feature results in optimized performance without administrative effort.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the early}} {{complaints}} was the fact, that this phone {{does not have a}} <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> slot; the device only has 80 MB of built-in memory.|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} {{interested}} in this article on the data stuctures generation as part of the polyedric technique designed in PAF (Paralleliseur Automatique pour Fortran). The removal of dependences which are not data flows in a program is generally realized by a total <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> of data structures. We present a new technique which allows to reduce the memory cost by expanding carefully selected parts of code only. It consists in limiting the <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> process in accordance with contraints imposed by the schedule determined for the parallel program...|$|R
5000|$|The Nintendo DSi, a newer model, {{no longer}} {{includes}} the Game Boy Advance slot (SLOT-2), so it cannot use the <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> pak. However, the DSi does have 16 MB of RAM, {{more than that}} of the original Nintendo DS (4 MB) and a <b>Memory</b> <b>Expansion</b> Pak (8 MB) combined. This additional memory is used by the DSi for its DSi Browser, which is not included with the system but can be downloaded for free from the DSi Shop. Tests have shown it to be faster than the DS Browser.|$|R

50|$|Because the Commodore 1541 and Commodore 1571 {{disk drives}} were slow, most BBSs would use <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> module. This {{would serve as}} a RAM disk and allow all modules to be loaded quickly.|$|R
50|$|The C128's RAM is {{expandable}} {{from the}} standard 128kB to 256, 512 or even 1,024kB, either by using commercial <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> modules, or by making one based on schematics available on the internet.|$|R

50|$|Although the <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> {{interface}} connected {{directly to}} the CPU bus and {{could have been used}} for many applications, the edge connector involved had an unusual number of pins and was difficult to obtain.|$|R
