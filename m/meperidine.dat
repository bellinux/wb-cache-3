5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (<b>meperidine),</b> tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a weak {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should not}} be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (<b>meperidine)</b> under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meperidine</b> {{has been}} {{historically}} favored over morphine {{because of the}} belief that morphine caused an increase in sphincter of Oddi pressure. However, no clinical studies suggest that morphine can aggravate or cause pancreatitis or cholecystitis. In addition, <b>meperidine</b> has a short half-life and repeated doses can lead to accumulation of the metabolite normeperidine, which causes neuromuscular side effects and, rarely, seizures.|$|E
25|$|Two small, {{placebo-controlled}} {{trials have}} been conducted to assess the efficacy of ondansetron for postanesthetic shivering, a common occurrence after surgery. Ondansetron {{was found to be}} as effective as pethidine (<b>meperidine,</b> Demerol) when given as a single intravenous dose before anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, {{the search}} for a {{synthetic}} substitute for atropine culminated serendipitously in the discovery of <b>meperidine,</b> the first opiate with a structure altogether different from that of morphine. This was followed in 1947 by the widespread introduction of methadone, another structurally unrelated compound with pharmacological properties similar to those of morphine.|$|E
25|$|Hydrazine sulfate {{is also a}} {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), and is incompatible with alcohol, tranquilizers and sleeping pills (benzodiazepines and barbiturates), and other psycho-active drugs, with pethidine (<b>meperidine,</b> Demerol), and with foods containing significant amounts of the amino acid breakdown product tyramine, such as aged cheeses, raisins, avocados, processed and cured fish and meats, fermented products, and others.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to {{drowsiness}} usually develops over 5–7 days, but if troublesome, {{switching to}} an alternative opioid often helps. Certain opioids such as fentanyl, morphine and diamorphine (heroin) {{tend to be}} particularly sedating, while others such as oxycodone, tilidine and <b>meperidine</b> (pethidine) tend to produce comparatively less sedation, but individual patients responses can vary markedly and some degree {{of trial and error}} may be needed to find the most suitable drug for a particular patient. Otherwise, treatment with CNS stimulants is generally effective.|$|E
25|$|Haloperidol was {{discovered}} in 1958 by Paul Janssen. It was made from pethidine (<b>meperidine).</b> It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is the most commonly used typical antipsychotic. The yearly cost of the typical dose of haloperidol is about 20 to 800 pounds (30 to 1,250 US dollars) in the United Kingdom. The cost in the United States is around 250 US dollars a year.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine, {{also known}} as <b>meperidine</b> and sold under the brand name Demerol among others, is a {{synthetic}} opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (piminodine, anileridine and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, etc.), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl patches {{are on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most}} {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. Fentanyl was first made by Paul Janssen in 1960. Janssen developed fentanyl by testing chemicals similar in structure to pethidine (<b>meperidine)</b> for opioid activity. The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate (the salt formed by combining fentanyl and citric acid in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio), which entered medical use as a general anaesthetic under the trade name Sublimaze in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine's {{apparent}} in vitro efficacy as an antispasmodic agent {{is due to}} its local anesthetic effects. It does not have antispasmodic effects in vivo.

Because of its DAT inhibitory action, pethidine will substitute for cocaine in animals trained to discriminate cocaine from saline.|$|E
2500|$|Use of {{hydroxyzine}} for premedication as a sedative has no {{effects on}} tropane alkaloids, such as atropine, but may, following general anesthesia, potentiate <b>meperidine</b> and barbiturates, and use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified {{depending upon the}} state of the individual.|$|E
2500|$|Death of Karnamaya Mongar, who {{received}} [...] "repeated unmonitored, unrecorded intravenous injections of Demerol" [...] (<b>meperidine</b> hydrochloride, an opioid analgesic which the report describes practice staff using as a cheap but dangerous sedative), and ceased breathing. [...] Staff {{were unable to}} revive her (emergency medications were not used and the defibrillator was not working), and paramedics were unable to revive her after gaining access, {{in part because they}} were deceived by staff as to what had happened and the drugs and dosages responsible.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{procedure}} {{the patient is}} often given sedation intravenously, employing agents such as fentanyl or midazolam. Although <b>meperidine</b> (Demerol) {{may be used as}} an alternative to fentanyl, the concern of seizures has relegated this agent to second choice for sedation behind the combination of fentanyl and midazolam. [...] The average person will receive a combination of these two drugs, usually between 25 and 100µg IV fentanyl and 1–4mg IV midazolam. [...] Sedation practices vary between practitioners and nations; in some clinics in Norway, sedation is rarely administered.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome (also more recently classified as [...] "serotonin toxicity") may occur with venlafaxine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, including {{but not limited to}} SSRIs and SNRIs, many hallucinogens such as tryptamines and phenethylamines (e.g., LSD/LSA, DMT, MDMA, mescaline), dextromethorphan (DXM), tramadol, tapentadol, pethidine (<b>meperidine)</b> and triptans and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination) or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Venlafaxine-induced serotonin syndrome has also been reported when venlafaxine has been taken in isolation in overdose. An abortive serotonin syndrome state, in which some but not all of the symptoms of the full serotonin syndrome are present, has been reported with venlafaxine at mid-range dosages (150mg per day). A case of a patient with serotonin syndrome induced by low-dose venlafaxine (37.5mg per day) has also been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Tramadol may {{interact}} with serotonergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors, other opioid analgesics (pethidine (<b>meperidine),</b> tapentadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl), dextromethorphan, certain migraine medications (triptans, ergots), certain anxiolytics (such as the SSRIs and buspirone), certain antibiotics (namely, linezolid and isoniazid), certain herbs (e.g. St. John's wort, passiflora, etc.), amphetamines, substituted amphetamines, phenethylamine and substituted phenethylamines, phentermine, lithium, methylene blue {{as well as}} numerous other therapeutic agents. As it is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, any agents {{with the ability to}} inhibit or induce these enzymes will likely {{interact with}} tramadol. A pressor response similar to the so-called [...] "cheese effect" [...] was noted in combinations of amphetamine and tramadol, which appears to cause dysfunction of or toxicity to epinephrine/norepinephrine receptors. [...] Cyclobenzaprine, a commonly-used muscle relaxant, atypical analgesic adjunct, as well as a potentiator often used with analgesics like codeine, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone and the like, is structurally related to the tricyclic antidepressants [...] and therefore should not be used with tramadol; this is also the case for trazodone ...|$|E
