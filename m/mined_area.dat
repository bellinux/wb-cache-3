Our country-wide analysis used Landsat 8 satellite data from a select number of <b>mining</b> <b>areas</b> to create a raster layer of potential <b>mining</b> <b>areas.</b> We used this layer to guide a systematic scan of freely-available fine-resolution imagery, such as Google Earth, in order to digitize likely <b>mining</b> <b>areas.</b> During this process, each <b>mining</b> <b>area</b> was assigned a ranking indicating our certainty in correct identification of the mining land use. Finally, we identified <b>areas</b> of recent <b>mining</b> expansion based on the change in albedo, or brightness, between Landsat images from 2002 and 2015. We identified 90, 041 ha of potential <b>mining</b> <b>areas</b> in Myanmar, of which 58 % (52, 312 ha) was assigned high certainty, 29 % (26, 251 ha) medium certainty, and 13 % (11, 478 ha) low certainty.

To alleviate these problems, {{a variety of methods}} were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas.

40|$|Abstract — With {{the rapid}} {{development}} {{of society and}} economy, the increasing demands of coal resources not only caused the over-exploitation, but also damaged the ecological environments. So {{it is important to}} restore the <b>mining</b> <b>areas,</b> which largely means vegetation restoration. This paper takes Heidaigou <b>mining</b> <b>area</b> as the study area {{to get an idea of}} how to monitor and restore the Heidaigou <b>mining</b> <b>area</b> effectively. The data used in the research are Landsat images and CBERS images that taken from 2001 to 2010 between June and October. By analyzing the images of study area with the technologies of remote sensing and geographic information system, we get the interpreted images of typical surface features of Heidaigou <b>mining</b> <b>area.</b> The results show that the area of exposed soil of waste-dump is increasing in Heidaigou <b>mining</b> <b>area,</b> which means the intensity of exploitation is rising.

Whilst the doctor was talking to the other officer present, Wilkinson entered the minefield, and managed to bring out the wounded man single-handed. For these actions, Wilkinson was awarded the George Medal (GM) on 8 July 1941, as was the Royal Engineer officer, Major Arthur Henry Musgrave Norris who subsequently cleared the remainder of the minefield, and Regimental Sergeant Major Ernest Joseph Legg (West Surreys) and Lance-Sergeant Harry Fred Hardy (RE) who assisted., The National Archives (fee required to view full original recommendation).
