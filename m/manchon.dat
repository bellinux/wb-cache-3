He {{had not even}} managed to review the dossiers and minutes of the trial of condemnation. Of the seven witnesses, most denounced the English for their desire for revenge against Joan, and their attempt to dishonor Charles VII's title by associating him with a finding of heresy against Joan. Only one was hostile against Joan – Jean Beaupere, the Canon of Rouen. Interviewed by Bouillé, he refused {{to answer questions about}} the procedure at the trial of condemnation. He stated that Joan was a fraud, believing that if Joan ‘had wise and frank teachers, she would have said many things serving to justify her, and withheld many which led to her condemnation.’ His testimony {{was not included in the}} report which Bouillé wrote up for Charles written later that year after Charles had closed down the inquiry. Circumstances had changed – the war against the retreating English was still occupying much of his attention, and there was trouble brewing with the Papacy over the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges. Charles could afford to wait, but Bouillé made it clear that it was in the king's interest to clear up the matter once and for all.|$|E

Abstract: Gas gun experiments combined with velocity interferomeuic techniques {{have been used}} to experimentally determine the loading behavior of a Coors-AD 995 alumina rod 19 mm in diameter by either 74 mm or 151 mm in length. Graded-density materials were used to impact both bare and sleeved alumina rods, while the velocity interfer-ometer was used to monitor the axial-velocity of the free end of the rods. Results of these experiments and CTH cal-culations will demonstrate a unique feature of this novel test methodology: (1) a time-dependent suess pulse generated during impact allows for a smooth and efficient transition from the initial uniaxial smin loading to a uniax-ial stress state as the stress pulse propagates through the rod. and (2) the intermediate loadin_e rates obtained in this configuration lie between those available From split Hopkinson bar and shock-loading techniques and are not achieved easily by either one of these techniques. 1...|$|R
500|$|His {{second book}} about fashion, L'ombrelle – le gant – le <b>manchon</b> (1883, {{translated}} {{in the same}} year as The Sunshade, Muff, and Glove), was also illustrated in rococo style by Paul Avril; in one of its lines Uzanne emphasized a female clothing accessory: [...] "The muff!", he said, [...] "Its name alone has something adorable, downy, and voluptuous about it." [...] Later he published Les ornements de la femme (1892), that reproduced in one volume the combined texts of L'Éventail and L'ombrelle – le gant – le <b>manchon.</b> His 1898 work Monument esthématique du XIXe siècle : Les Modes de Paris, translated as Fashions in Paris, was according to the review in The New York Times [...] "...the most complete and exhaustive work on the subject of French fashions that has yet appeared". However, in this book he wanted to re-establish the intimate and feminine culture of the rococo—but during his life he became influenced by modernism— and also he criticized the [...] "sartorial severity" [...] of the femme nouvelle.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Société des Amis des Livres, which he found too {{conservative}} and too {{concerned with the}} reissue of old works, he started two new bibliographic societies, the Société des Bibliophiles Contemporaines (1889–1894) and the Societé des Bibliophiles Indépendants (1896–1901). The first consisted of 160 people, including the writers Jules Claretie and Jean Richepin, the artists Albert Robida and Paul Avril, and the journalist and critic Francisque Sarcey. Uzanne also edited two magazines, Conseiller du bibliophile (literally, Adviser of bibliophile, 1876–1877) and Les miscellanées bibliographiques (The Bibliographical Miscellany, 1878–1880), and then ran three consecutive bibliophilic magazines: Le livre : bibliographie moderne (literally, The Book: Modern Bibliography, 1880–1889), Le livre moderne : revue du monde littéraire et des bibliophiles contemporaines (literally, The Modern Book: Journal of the Literary World and Contemporary Bibliophiles, 1890–1891), and L'Art et l'Idée : revue contemporaine du dilettantisme l'littéraire et de la curiosité (Art and Ideas: Contemporary Journal of the Literary Dilettantism and Curiosity, 1892–1893). In the early 1890s, he {{was considered to be}} [...] "...the best authority that book lovers know on subjects specially interesting to book lovers". Nevertheless, such books as Le Miroir du Monde (The Mirror of the World) or L'ombrelle – le gant – le <b>manchon</b> (The Sunshade, Muff, and Glove) received negative reviews from some newspapers for Avril's illustrations.|$|E
60|$|When <b>Manchon</b> {{came home}} that night {{he said he had}} found out why the torture was not applied.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>Manchon</b> {{ventured to}} do a brave thing, too, {{though he did}} it in great fear for his life. He asked Cauchon if he should enter Joan's {{submission}} to the Council of Basel upon the minutes.|$|E
60|$|Evidently Cauchon {{had grown}} afraid of <b>Manchon</b> {{because of his}} pretty {{apparent}} leanings toward Joan, for another recorder was in the chief place here, which left my master and me {{nothing to do but}} sit idle and look on.|$|E
60|$|Twenty-five {{years after}} Joan's death the record was {{produced}} in the great Court of the Rehabilitation and verified under oath by <b>Manchon</b> and me, and surviving judges of our court confirmed the exactness of the record in their testimony.|$|E
60|$|The Twelve {{were to be}} {{submitted}} first to the learned doctors of theology of the University of Paris for approval. They were copied out and ready by the night of April 4th. Then <b>Manchon</b> did another bold thing: {{he wrote in the}} margin that many of the Twelve put statements in Joan's mouth which were the exact opposite of what she had said. That fact would not be considered important by the University of Paris, and would not influence its decision or stir its humanity, in case it had any--which it hadn't when acting in a political capacity, as at present--but it was a brave thing for that good <b>Manchon</b> to do, all the same.|$|E
6000|$|That answer of {{hers was}} quite long, quite frank, wholly free from concealments or palliations. It made me shudder; I {{knew she was}} pronouncing {{sentence}} of death upon herself. So did poor <b>Manchon.</b> And {{he wrote in the}} margin abreast of it: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{attended}} <b>Manchon</b> constantly straight along, out of January {{and into}} February, and was {{often in the}} citadel with him--in the very fortress where Joan was imprisoned, though not in the dungeon where she was confined, and so did not see her, of course.|$|E
60|$|IT WAS {{necessary}} {{for me to}} have some way to gain bread for Noel and myself; and when the Pierrons found that I knew how to write, the applied to their confessor in my behalf, and he got a place for me with a good priest named <b>Manchon,</b> who was to be the chief recorder in the Great Trial of Joan of Arc now approaching. It was a strange position for me--clerk to the recorder--and dangerous if my sympathies and the late employment should be found out. But there was not much danger. <b>Manchon</b> was at bottom friendly to Joan and would not betray me; and my name would not, for I had discarded my surname and retained only my given one, like a person of low degree.|$|E
60|$|I GIVE you {{my honor}} now that I {{am not going}} to distort or discolor the facts of this miserable trial. No, I will give them to you honestly, detail by detail, just as <b>Manchon</b> and I set them down daily in the {{official}} record of the court, and just as one may read them in the printed histories.|$|E
6000|$|Now, then, this daily baiting and badgering of this friendless girl, {{a captive}} in chains, was to {{continue}} a long, long time--dignified sport, a kennel of mastiffs and bloodhounds harassing a kitten!--and I may as well tell you, upon sworn testimony, {{what it was like}} from the first day to the last. When poor Joan had been in her grave a quarter of a century, the Pope called together that great court which was to re-examine her history, and whose just verdict cleared her illustrious name from every spot and stain, and laid upon the verdict and conduct of our Rouen tribunal the blight of its everlasting execrations. <b>Manchon</b> and several of the judges who had been members of our court were among the witnesses who appeared before that Tribunal of Rehabilitation. Recalling these miserable proceedings which I have been telling you about, <b>Manchon</b> testified thus:--here you have it, all in fair print in the unofficial history: ...|$|E
60|$|Meantime Cauchon went to Joan's cell one day, with <b>Manchon</b> {{and two of}} the judges, Isambard de la Pierre and Martin Ladvenue, to see if {{he could}} not manage somehow to beguile Joan into {{submitting}} her mission to the examination and decision of the Church Militant--that is to say, to that part of the Church Militant which was represented by himself and his creatures.|$|E
60|$|About {{the middle}} of the {{afternoon}} came a summons for <b>Manchon</b> and me to go to Joan's dungeon--a summons from Cauchon. But by that time distrust had already taken possession of the English and their soldiery again, and all Rouen was in an angry and threatening mood. We could see plenty of evidences of this from our own windows--fist-shaking, black looks, tumultuous tides of furious men billowing by along the street.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{uplifting}} to {{hear her}} battle-voice once more and see the battle-light burn in her eye. Many there were stirred; every man that was a man was stirred, whether friend or foe; and <b>Manchon</b> risked his life again, good soul, for {{he wrote in the}} margin of the record in good plain letters these brave words: [...] "Superba responsio!" [...] and there they have remained these sixty years, and there you may read them to this day.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{remained}} ill {{more than}} two weeks; then she grew better. She was still very weak, but she could bear a little persecution now without much danger to her life. It seemed to Cauchon {{a good time to}} furnish it. So he called together some of his doctors of theology and went to her dungeon. <b>Manchon</b> and I went along to keep the record--that is, to set down what might be useful to Cauchon, and leave out the rest.|$|E
60|$|<b>Manchon</b> told me {{everything}} that had been happening before my coming. Ever since the purchase of Joan, Cauchon had been busy packing his jury {{for the destruction of}} the Maid--weeks and weeks he had spent in this bad industry. The University of Paris had sent him a number of learned and able and trusty ecclesiastics of the stripe he wanted; and he had scraped together a clergyman of like stripe and great fame here and there and yonder, until he was able to construct a formidable court numbering half a hundred distinguished names. French names they were, but their interests and sympathies were English.|$|E
6000|$|And so <b>Manchon</b> {{refused to}} go. He {{said he would}} not go a step without a {{safeguard}} from Warwick. So next morning Warwick sent an escort of soldiers, and then we went. Matters had not grown peacefuler meantime, but worse. The soldiers protected us from bodily damage, but as we passed through the great mob at the castle we were assailed with insults and shameful epithets. I bore it well enough, though, and said to myself, with secret satisfaction, [...] "In three or four short days, my lads, you will be employing your tongues in a different sort from this--and I shall be there to hear." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the ninth}} of May {{there was a}} summons, and <b>Manchon</b> and I got out {{materials}} together and started. But this time we were to {{go to one of}} the other towers--not the one which was Joan's prison. It was round and grim and massive, and built of the plainest and thickest and solidest masonry--a dismal and forbidding structure. (3) We entered the circular room on the ground floor, and I saw what turned me sick--the instruments of torture and the executioners standing ready! Here you have the black heart of Cauchon at the blackest, here you have the proof that in his nature {{there was no such thing}} as pity. One wonders if he ever knew his mother or ever had a sister.|$|E
6000|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Wednesday, Martin Ladvenu and another friar {{were sent to}} Joan to prepare her for death; and <b>Manchon</b> and I went with them--a hard service for me. We tramped through the dim corridors, winding this way and that, and {{piercing}} ever {{deeper and deeper into}} that vast heart of stone, and at last we stood before Joan. But she did not know it. She sat with {{her hands in her lap}} and her head bowed, thinking, and her face was very sad. One might not know what she was thinking of. Of her home, and the peaceful pastures, and the friends she was no more to see? Of her wrongs, and her forsaken estate, and the cruelties which had been put upon her? Or was it of death--the death which she had longed for, and which was now so close? ...|$|E
60|$|THAT NIGHT <b>Manchon</b> told me {{that all}} through the day's {{proceedings}} Cauchon had had some clerks concealed in the embrasure of a window who were to make a special report garbling Joan's answers and twisting them from their right meaning. Ah, that was surely the cruelest man and the most shameless that has lived in this world. But his scheme failed. Those clerks had human hearts in them, and their base work revolted them, and they turned to and boldly made a straight report, whereupon Cauchon cursed them and ordered them out of his presence with a threat of drowning, which was his favorite and most frequent menace. The matter had gotten abroad and was making great and unpleasant talk, and Cauchon would not try to repeat this shabby game right away. It comforted me to hear that.|$|E
60|$|He {{appealed to}} the Pope, and the Pope {{appointed}} a great commission of churchmen to examine into the facts of Joan's life and award judgment. The Commission sat at Paris, at Domremy, at Rouen, at Orleans, and at several other places, and continued its work during several months. It examined the records of Joan's trials, it examined the Bastard of Orleans, and the Duke d'Alencon, and D'Aulon, and Pasquerel, and Courcelles, and Isambard de la Pierre, and <b>Manchon,</b> and me, and many others whose names I have made familiar to you; also they examined {{more than a hundred}} witnesses whose names are less familiar to you--the friends of Joan in Domremy, Vaucouleurs, Orleans, and other places, and a number of judges and other people who had assisted at the Rouen trials, the abjuration, and the martyrdom. And out of this exhaustive examination Joan's character and history came spotless and perfect, and this verdict was placed upon record, to remain forever.|$|E
60|$|It {{made the}} Bishop's purple face fairly blanch with consternation. If Joan had only known, {{if she had}} only know! She had lodged a mine under this black {{conspiracy}} able to blow the Bishop's schemes to the four winds of heaven, and she didn't know it. She had made that speech by mere instinct, not suspecting what tremendous forces were hidden in it, and there was none {{to tell her what}} she had done. I knew, and <b>Manchon</b> knew; and if she had known how to read writing we could have hoped to get the knowledge to her somehow; but speech was the only way, and none was allowed to approach her near enough for that. So there she sat, once more Joan of Arc the Victorious, but all unconscious of it. She was miserably worn and tired, by the long day's struggle and by illness, or she must have noticed the effect of that speech and divined the reason of it.|$|E
6000|$|No, {{there was}} no {{crushing}} that spirit, and no beclouding that clear mind. Consider the depth, the wisdom of that answer, coming from an ignorant girl. Why, there were not six {{men in the world}} who had ever reflected that words forced out of a person by horrible tortures were not necessarily words of verity and truth, yet this unlettered peasant-girl put her finger upon that flaw with an unerring instinct. I had always supposed that torture brought out the truth--everybody supposed it; and when Joan came out with those simple common-sense words they seemed to flood the place with light. It was like a lightning-flash at midnight which suddenly reveals a fair valley sprinkled over with silver streams and gleaming villages and farmsteads where was only an impenetrable world of darkness before. <b>Manchon</b> stole a sidewise look at me, and his face was full of surprise; and there was the like to be seen in other faces there. Consider--they were old, and deeply cultured, yet here was a village maid able to teach them something which they had not known before. I heard one of them mutter: ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} <b>Manchon</b> and I went early, yet as we {{approached}} the vast fortress we found crowds of men already there and still others gathering. The chapel was already full and the way barred against further admissions of unofficial persons. We took our appointed places. Throned on high sat the president, Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, in his grand robes, and before him in rows sat his robed court--fifty distinguished ecclesiastics, men of high degree in the Church, of clear-cut intellectual faces, men of deep learning, veteran adepts in strategy and casuistry, practised setters of traps for ignorant minds and unwary feet. When I looked around upon this army of masters of legal fence, gathered here to find just one verdict and no other, and remembered that Joan must fight for her good name and her life single-handed against them, I asked myself what chance an ignorant poor country-girl of nineteen could have in such an unequal conflict; and my heart sank down low, very low. When I looked again at that obese president, puffing and wheezing there, his great belly distending and receding with each breath, and noted his three chins, fold above fold, and his knobby and knotty face, and his purple and splotchy complexion, and his repulsive cauliflower nose, and his cold and malignant eyes--a brute, every detail of him--my heart sank lower still. And when I noted that all were afraid of this man, and shrank and fidgeted in their seats when his eye smote theirs, my last poor ray of hope dissolved away and wholly disappeared.|$|E
