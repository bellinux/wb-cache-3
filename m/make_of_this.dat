25|$|All {{indicators}} {{paint the}} same picture. Some 41% of Brazilian PhDs were granted by {{universities in the}} State of São Paulo in 2012 and 44% of all papers with Brazilian authors {{have at least one}} author from an institution based in São Paulo. São Paulo’s scientific productivity (390 papers per million inhabitants over 2009–2013) is twice the national average (184), a differential which has been widening in recent years. The relative impact of publications by scientists from the State of São Paulo has also been systematically higher than for Brazil as a whole over the past decade. Two key factors explain São Paulo’s success in scientific output: firstly, a well-funded system of state universities, including the University of São Paulo, University of Campinas (Unicamp) and the State University of São Paulo, all of which have been included in international university rankings;10 secondly, the role played by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). Both the university system and FAPESP are allocated a fixed share of the state’s sales tax revenue as their annual budgets and have full autonomy as to the use they <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> revenue.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic editor Janet Rosen gave Romance {{three stars}} out of five, {{saying that it}} [...] "features the usual smooth, well-crafted pop ear candy from Luis Miguel, earnestly sung over strings and polite Latin rhythms". However, she noted that the songs in the album booklet {{and the lack of}} liner notes made it {{difficult}} for listeners to know what [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> presentation". Rosen concluded, [...] "It doesn't matter—the title of the release says it all." [...] Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune gave the record four stars out of four, praising Miguel's refusal [...] "to get campy, which gives the effort far more integrity than might have been imagined" [...] and calling his take on boleros [...] "vibrant and real." [...] Mark Holston reviewed the album positively in the magazine Américas, praising Miguel's vocals, the choice of songs and Silvetti's arrangements: [...] "Romance is a reminder of the enduring quality of timeless music".|$|E

Indian newspapers also continued with the criticism, with some suggesting Ponting put himself before the team. Ponting angrily responded to such comments at the post-Test media conference.|$|E
