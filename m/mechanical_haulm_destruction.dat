40|$|Current {{systems of}} potato growing use {{large amounts of}} {{pesticides}} and fertilizers; these inputs are costly and cause environmental problems. In this paper a strategy for integrated low-input potato production is developed {{with the aim of}} reducing costs, improving product quality and reducing environmental damage. The strategy involves crop rotation, the use of cultivars with multiple resistance, modest fertilizer use (preferably based on organic manure) mechanical weed control, <b>mechanical</b> <b>haulm</b> <b>destruction</b> and limited use of pesticides. The prospects for this strategy are discusse...|$|E
40|$|Any {{mechanical}} force exerted on a potato tuber during the harvesting {{may result in}} mechanical damage. A few weeks prior to harvesting, <b>haulm</b> <b>destruction</b> could improve the rheological properties of the tuber and reduce its susceptibility to mechanical damage. The effects of elevator and oscillatory sieve diggers and <b>haulm</b> <b>destruction</b> on potato loss and mechanical damage were studied on a farmer field in Fereidan region of Isfahan. Two <b>haulm</b> management treatments (<b>destruction</b> and non-destruction) along with five potato diggers (elevator digger with a long main web and with agitator, elevator digger with primary and secondary webs and with agitator, elevator digger with a main web and with/without agitator, and reciprocating riddle digger) were {{laid out in a}} strip block design within a randomized complete block design with four replications. The main crop variety, namely Marfona, was planted in the field. The results showed that the percentages of undigged and soil-covered tubers were significantly different among the potato diggers tested. These losses were due to the dices located to the sides of shares or gage wheels and wrong adjustments on the diggers. Comparing the performance of reciprocating riddle with elevator diggers, its sieving capacity was low and the severity of the mechanical damage and the numbers of tubers covered with soil were high. <b>Haulm</b> <b>destruction</b> was effective in reducing the peeler type damage (the less than 3 mm deep damage to flesh). Although the elevator digger with a main web (elevator chain) and without agitator had the least mechanical damage index, the differences among the elevator diggers tested were not significant (5 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Presprouting of seed tubers is {{a measure}} that is often {{recommended}} for organic potato growing. In on-farm field experiments the effect of presprouting was evaluated with respect to virus infection, yield and weed infestation. The effect of presprouting on yield was largely dependent on the year and on the late blight severity. Weeds were not affected significantly by presprouting. In most experiments virus incidence was higher in presprouted potatoes. Presprouting also had a suppressive effect on undesired regrowth after <b>haulm</b> <b>destruction...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aphids are {{the most}} {{important}} vectors of potato viruses during the cropâ€™s growing season. The most widespread and damaging viruses, the potato virus Y and potato leaf roll virus, are transmitted by aphids in non-persistent and persistent manner, respectively. The two viruses cause the greatest concern of potato producers and a great constraint to seed potato production in Serbia, the region and across the world. Potato virus Y is particularly harmful, given its distribution and spreading rate. Seed potato production systems under well-managed conditions involve a series of virus control measures, including the monitoring of outbreaks of winged aphids, their abundance and species composition, in order to forecast virosis, i. e. potential plant and tuber infection periods. Monitoring the aphid vectors of potato viruses enables determination of optimum dates for <b>haulm</b> <b>destruction</b> when higher than normal numbers of winged aphids as vectors of economically harmful diseases have been observed. <b>Haulm</b> <b>destruction</b> in a potato crop reduces the risk of plant infection and virus translocation from the aboveground parts to tubers, thus keeping the proportion of infected tubers within tolerance limits allowed for certain categories of seed potatoes. This practice has positive effects if used in combination with other viral disease control measures; otherwise, it becomes ineffective. This paper provides an integral analysis of the effects and role of monitoring outbreaks of aphids, their abundance and species composition in timing haulm growth termination to prevent plant infection, virus translocation and tuber infestation in potato crops in Serbia and the wider region...|$|R
40|$|As all {{underground}} {{parts of}} a potato plant can be infected with Colletotrichum coccodes it was speculated {{that it may be}} possible to predict black dot development on harvested tubers by assessing stems and stolons for the presence of the disease in the growing crop. In a 3 -year study stems and stolons were assessed for black dot in 123 potato crops and its incidence related to disease on the tubers at harvest. In cvs Estima and Maris Piper, if stems or stolons showed black dot symptoms as the onset of crop senescence then the disease was likely to be present on tubers at harvest. No relationship between black dot on stems and stolons in the growing crop and disease on tubers at harvest was found in the cv. Saxon. To explain these results a series of glasshouse and field experiments were performed to identify when symptoms of black dot developed on underground {{parts of a}} potato plant. Results showed that infection by C. coccodes could occur soon after these plant parts had formed. Visual symptoms did not appear on stems and stolons till just prior to foliage senescence and on tubers until after the start of foliage senescence. Further research considered whether a reduction in black dot symptoms on tubers is achievable through <b>haulm</b> <b>destruction</b> methods in the field. Results indicated that in a crop of cv. Maris Piper, where there was a high incidence of black dot, and no one technique gave a significant reduction in symptom developing on tubers. These inconclusive results are discussed.
