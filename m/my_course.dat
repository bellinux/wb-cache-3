5|$|<b>My</b> <b>course</b> {{has come}} to an end. I have fought your battles, and you have given me that loyalty that led us to victory more often than the party has ever had since the days of Sir John A. Macdonald.

5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on <b>my</b> <b>course.</b> I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
500|$|In June 1896, Bryan's old teacher, {{former senator}} Trumbull died; {{on the day}} of his funeral, Bryan's mother also died, {{suddenly}} in Salem. [...] Bryan spoke at her funeral, quoting lines from Second Timothy: [...] "I have fought a good fight, I have finished <b>my</b> <b>course,</b> I have kept the faith." [...] He also attended, as a correspondent for the World-Herald, the Republican convention that month in St. Louis. [...] The Republicans, at the request of their nominee for president, former Ohio governor William McKinley, included a plank in their party platform supporting the gold standard. [...] Bryan was deeply moved when, after the adoption of the platform, Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller led a walkout of silver-supporting Republicans. [...] Bryan's biographer, Paolo Coletta, suggests that Bryan may have played a part in inciting the silver men's departure; he was in close contact with Silver Republicans such as Teller and South Dakota Senator Richard Pettigrew. [...] Historian James Barnes wrote of Bryan's preparations: ...|$|E

2500|$|I am {{called on}} to lead a {{resistance}} movement against an implacable enemy under conditions that make victory barely possible even under the best circumstances. But I feel that I am indeed a Man of Destiny, that <b>my</b> <b>course</b> is charted and that only success lies {{at the end of}} the trail. I do not envision failure; it is obvious that the odds are against us and we will not consistently win, but if we are to win only part of the time and gain a little each time, in the end we will be successful.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous Dutch and English sailors {{searched for}} the rocks over the centuries. The first attempt was in 1636, when two Dutch ships were sent {{to search for the}} Tryal Rocks at their purported location. Sickness {{prevented}} William Dampier from searching for the rocks in 1700; on 11 June of that year he wrote: [...] "I kept on <b>my</b> <b>course</b> to the westward till the 15th, and then altered it. My design was to seek for the Tryal Rocks; but, having been sick 5 or 6 days without any fresh provision or other good nourishment aboard, and seeing no likelihood of my recovery, I rather chose to go to some port in time than to beat here any longer." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{venture into}} online course {{development}} {{can be a}} daunting journey. Not only must you navigate the nuances and strategies of effective online course facilitation, but this must be accomplished in harnmony {{with the creation of}} an online course structure that allows you to stimulate, inspire, and educate students in the novel environment of the virtual classroom. Typical of many first-time online course developers, I slowly set about the task of uploading electronic imitations of the best practices from my face-to-face classroom into <b>my</b> online <b>course.</b> <b>My</b> first online <b>course</b> consisted of a collection of readings, pictures, lecture notes, and written assignments. I had experienced reasonable success as a traditional instructor, so I modeled <b>my</b> online <b>course</b> after its face-to-face equivalent. Much to my delight, my inaugural class of online students was generally satisfied with the course and demonstrated learning outcomes comparable to their face-to-face counterparts. Inspired by this initial success, I began to embrace the unique benefits available through e-learning and <b>my</b> online <b>course</b> started to evolve. In a matter of three years, m...|$|R

40|$|Two years ago, I {{created a}} {{performance}} piece called Singing Lessons: A Performance about Learning to Sing, in which I tried to demonstrate what I {{had learned about}} singing and about life from six remarkable singing teachers. In it, I {{told the story of}} my quest for voice, using archival audiotapes and photographs, and by telling stories, by demonstrating some technical aspects of singing, and by singing repertoire I had studied with each teacher. Mary Clare Powell (2002), in a chapter titled “Why I send the poet to teach <b>my</b> <b>courses</b> ” explores how being a poet influences her university teaching. It made me think of how being a singer shapes my teaching. This paper is the result. I begin with a segment of the Singing Lessons performance piece which includes the script, photographs, and video clips of the sung material. 1 This ten minute long segment takes place approximately {{in the middle of the}} original hour-long performance. At the end of the Singing Lessons segment, I turn to a reflection on what it means to take my singer to teach <b>my</b> <b>courses...</b>|$|R
