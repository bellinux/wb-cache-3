25|$|Mrs. Coulter takes Lyra {{into her}} home, {{in a big}} city that resembles a retrofuturistic London, and starts taking her to socialite dinners and parties. In her bedroom, Lyra gazes upon the alethiometer and notices that it {{continuously}} points to a lady, a lightning bolt, and a baby. She does not know what to <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> observation, however, and says nothing of it to Mrs.Coulter. Despite initially projecting the image of a free-spirited woman, she reveals herself to be extremely respectful of the Magisterium and its function. One night, Lyra casually mentions Dust; this puts Mrs. Coulter on edge as she warns Lyra never to mention it again, and also insists that she stop carrying around the bag secretly containing the aleithiometer. Mrs.Coulter's dæmon (a golden monkey) attacks Pantalaimon, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pantalaimon discover that Mrs.Coulter is head of the General Oblation Board, also known as the “Gobblers”, who have been kidnapping local children. Lyra also learns that her best friend Roger and her Gyptian friend Billy have been both taken by the Gobblers.|$|E
500|$|Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, {{published}} together posthumously in December 1817, {{were reviewed}} in the British Critic in March 1818 {{and in the}} Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany in May 1818. The reviewer for the British Critic felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the Edinburgh Review disagreed, praising Austen for her [...] "exhaustless invention" [...] and {{the combination of the}} familiar and the surprising in her plots. Overall, Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers {{did not know what to}} <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> novels—for example, they misunderstood her use of irony. Reviewers reduced Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.|$|E

Strengthened by her parents confidence, she never considered the possibility her dream wouldn't come true. If so she'd have quite a problem, having nothing in reserve. The only moment she had her doubts was at the academy. She noticed her teachers did not share her parents' trust. They had no idea what to <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and as a result she had to do the year all over again.
