25|$|Yellow flowers such as primrose, rowan, hawthorn, gorse, hazel, and <b>marsh</b> <b>marigold</b> {{were placed}} at doorways and windows in 19th century Ireland, Scotland and Mann. Sometimes loose flowers were strewn {{at the doors}} and windows and {{sometimes}} they were made into bouquets, garlands or crosses and fastened to them. They would also be fastened to cows and equipment for milking and butter making. It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire. Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.|$|E

25|$|The pools {{provide a}} habitat {{for a wide}} range of {{emergent}} plants, of which the rarest is bog St John's-wort (Hypericum elodes), previously believed to have died out in Cheshire. The locally rare floating club rush (Eleogiton fluitans) has been recorded at the site. Other wetland species observed here include bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), greater spearwort (Ranunculus lingua), lesser celandine (Ranunculus ficaria), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), <b>marsh</b> <b>marigold</b> (Caltha palustris), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), marsh violet (Viola palustris), reedmace (Typha), water violet (Hottonia palustris) and wavy bittercress (Cardamine flexuosa).|$|E
25|$|On Nunivak, most {{indigenous}} {{plants were}} traditionally gathered {{by women and}} children when the men were harvesting other available resources (e.g., caribou, waterfowl, seal). While fresh spring greens provided a welcome addition to the diet, which in winter was based largely on dried and stored foods, other greens were harvested throughout the year as they ripened, and used {{with some of those}} stored for winter use. With the melting of the island's snow pack, local greens and berries not picked during the previous fall's harvest, begin to appear and were added to the local diet. Depending on the time the ice pack began to break up, Cup'ig families would leave their winter villages and move to spring seal camps. Cup'ig men would journey out along the ice to harvest arriving sea mammals (i.e., seals, walrus) while the women would spend much of their time harvesting available plant resources (greens and seaweeds) and shellfish. Early spring plants included: <b>marsh</b> <b>marigold</b> (Caltha palustris), sour dock (Rumex arcticus), wild celery (Angelica lucida), wild lettuce (Draba borealis or D. hyperborea), wild parsnip (Ligusticum hultonii), wild rhubarb (Polygonum viviparum), mountain sorrel (Oxyria digylla), Pallas buttercup (Ranunculus pallasii), and Labrador tea (Ledum pallustre decumbens).|$|E
500|$|Central Marsh and Pool is {{a diverse}} {{area where the}} main flora is common reed, reed sweetgrass, sedges, bulrushes and teasel. Willow trees are {{particularly}} important in this habitat as they have over 250 species of insect associated with them. [...] Alder trees support birds such as redpoll, siskin and various tit species. [...] Beyond Central Marsh lies West Marsh Pool, a small area of water surrounded by reedbed, where a number of dragonfly pools have been dug. [...] Plants which thrive in damp areas, such as <b>marsh</b> <b>marigold</b> and meadowsweet, flourish here.|$|E
50|$|The River Black Bourn {{runs through}} this large nature reserve, which has many bird species, such as barn owls, yellowhammers, linnets, reed {{buntings}} and skylarks. Plants in wet meadows include marsh orchids and <b>marsh</b> <b>marigolds.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the meadows}} and valleys around Tosh are Himalayan blue poppies, irises, <b>marsh</b> <b>marigolds,</b> primulas, buttercups, and Himalayan balsam flowers. Birds {{in the area}} include lamagiers, bull finches, rose finches, Himalayan griffons, white-capped water starts, and brown dippers. Himalayan brown and black bears are {{occasionally}} seen.|$|R
50|$|This site on {{the bank}} of the River Ivel is mainly {{grassland}} with areas of scrub and bushes. There are also some native trees and a stream, which make it an important area for wildlife. Plants include <b>marsh</b> <b>marigolds</b> and there are kingfishers and the river bank has otters and water voles.|$|R
500|$|As {{a result}} of their wetland nature, the Moors and Levels contain a rich {{biodiversity}} of national and international importance. They support a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as <b>marsh</b> <b>marigold,</b> meadowsweet, and ragged robin. The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan, Eurasian curlew, common redshank, skylark, common snipe, common teal, wigeon, and whimbrel, as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon. [...] A wide range of insect species is also present, including rare invertebrates, particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle, Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni, and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important otter population. Water voles (Arvicola amphibius) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10years, by the capture of mink (Mustela vison).|$|E
500|$|Gardens in {{the upper}} park area include Longfellow Gardens, Minnehaha Falls Pergola Garden, and the Song of Hiawatha Garden. The lower glen area offers {{examples}} of a surprisingly large number of trees that are native to Minnesota including basswood, black ash, maples, oaks, willows, and cottonwoods. [...] Unusual plants include the first spring-blooming plant, skunk cabbage, often blooming so early that temperatures are still freezing and snow may still be on the ground. [...] As the name implies, they have a disagreeable odor except to the various insects that prefer to feed on rotting flesh or dung. By consuming carbohydrates stored in its fleshy roots, skunk cabbages can maintain a temperature inside the spathe that is 15–35 degrees warmer than the surrounding air temperature. The warmth helps attract cold-blooded, early-emerging pollinating insects during early spring when temperatures are still chilly. [...] As the spathe dies back the large, showy leaves emerge which die back by mid-August, making the plant difficult to find in late summer. Other wild flowers include wild ginger, trout lilies, anemones, <b>marsh</b> <b>marigold</b> and various ferns and sedges. [...] The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is working to remove invasive species that have been introduced into the park {{in order to promote}} a healthy environment so that native species may survive and grow.|$|E
500|$|The Parrett then {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as <b>marsh</b> <b>marigold</b> (Caltha palustris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), common redshank (Tringa totanus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), common teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), as well as birds of prey including the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the hairy click beetle (Synaptus filiformis), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides), Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important European otter (Lutra lutra) population. 282 American mink (Mustela vison) have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging water voles (Arvicola amphibius) to recolonise areas of the Levels {{where they have been}} absent for 10years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also Special Protection Areas), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In addition, some [...] of the Levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area, while other portions are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential. Despite this, there is currently no single conservation designation covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors.|$|E

5000|$|The name Golborne {{derives from}} the Old English golde and burna, and means [...] "stream where <b>marsh</b> <b>marigolds</b> grow". The {{earliest}} settlements in the present-day town were on banks of the Millingford Brook, hence its name being derived from a water course where calendula grew. Golborne has been recorded in ancient documents as Goldeburn in 1187, Goldburc in 1201, Goseburn and Goldburn in 1212 and Golburne in 1242. Golborne and Gowborne were 16th-century spellings.|$|R
2500|$|The wildflower show {{begins in}} late June when the Jeffrey's {{shooting}} star and white <b>marsh</b> <b>marigold</b> bloom {{in the wet}} meadows and riparian areas.

2500|$|Herbalists of the Renaissance {{recognized}} double {{flowers and}} began to cultivate them in their gardens [...] Rembert Dodoens published a description of double flowers in 1568, and John Gerard created illustrations of many double flowers beside their wild-type counterparts in 1597. A double-flowered variety of <b>Marsh</b> <b>Marigold</b> was discovered and cultivated in Austria in the late 16th century, becoming a valued garden plant.|$|E
2500|$|Common meadow wildflowers include Jeffrey's {{shooting}} star, elephanthead, Gorman's buttercup, alpine asters, American alpine speedwell, Indian paintbrush, small-flowered paintbrush, {{high mountain}} cinquefoil, Gray's ligusticum, green false hellebore, swamp laurel, and white bog orchid (Habenaria dilatata). [...] Also, Jeffrey's shooting star and <b>marsh</b> <b>marigold</b> grow {{close to the}} lake shore. [...] In the moist riparian area near the lake's outlet, there are Gorman's buttercup, yellow monkeyflower, Lewis monkey flower, arrowleaf groundsel, and false asphodel. Oregon saxifrage lives {{in some of the}} boggy areas around the lake.|$|E
50|$|The main rock {{gardens are}} laid out on a south-facing slope and are {{sheltered}} from the elements, allowing {{a great number of}} non-hardy species to thrive in a micro-climate. Small waterfalls run down the rock gardens into a pond which is surrounded by royal ferns, <b>marsh</b> <b>marigolds,</b> skunk cabbage, Gunnera ("giant rhubarb") and irises. The gardens contain wide range of ornamental trees and shrubs, including Chusan palms, tulip trees, mulberry, dawn redwood, swamp cypress, Chinese dogwood, Adam's laburnum, common walnut, Oxydendrum arboreum, and various dwarf conifers.|$|R
60|$|I {{sat on the}} parapet of the bridge, {{and swung}} my feet over the water that frothed and fretted at the central pier below. Above the bridge the stream broadened into a cress-bespangled pool, over which the {{sapphire}} dragon-flies hovered, and its earlier course was hidden by the big oak trees that bent towards each other from either bank. Through their speckled tracery of green one saw the hazy blue depths of the further forest. I was watching the proceedings of some quick-moving brown bird amid the rushes and <b>marsh</b> <b>marigolds</b> of the opposite bank.|$|R
5000|$|... 53% of the forested {{areas of}} the Rostock Heath are {{coniferous}} trees (mainly pine, spruce and larch), of the deciduous trees (47%) the predominant species are beech, oak and birch (as at 1998). 827 hectares of the Rostock Heath are moorland, reedbeds and meadowland.There you will find small reedbeds with spikerushes, home to many insects, <b>marsh</b> <b>marigolds</b> and orchids, kingfisher, crane and white-tailed eagle, old yews, holly and chequer trees. There are marsh gentians on the periodically wet meadows, lousewort and many other plants and animals.The biodiversity of the three nature reserves is particularly great, and parts of them are designated as [...] "total reserves" [...] (Totalreservat).|$|R
6000|$|In pure yellow flowers, as in pure white, human {{interest}} is wanting. It {{is true that}} yellow is a human colour, since in the hair we find yellows of different shades--it is a pity that we cannot find, or have not found, a better word than [...] "shades" [...] for the specific differences of a colour. There is the so-called tow, the tawny, the bronze, the simple yellow, and the golden, which includes many varieties, and the hair called carroty. But none of these has the flower yellow. Richard Jefferies tells us that when he placed a sovereign {{by the side of}} a dandelion he saw how unlike the two colours were--that, in fact, no two colours could seem more unlike than the yellow of gold and the yellow of the flower. It is not necessary to set a lock of hair and any yellow flower side by side to know how utterly different the hues are. The yellow of the hair is like that of metals, of clay, of stone, and of various earthy substances, and like the fur of some mammals, and like xanthophyll in leaf and stalk, and the yellow sometimes seen in clouds. When Ossian, in his famous address to the sun, speaks of his yellow hair floating on the eastern clouds, we instantly feel the truth as well as beauty of the simile. We admire the yellow flower for the purity and brilliance of its colour, just as we admire some bird notes solely for the purity and brightness of the sound, however unlike the human voice they may be. We also admire it in many instances for the exquisite beauty of its form, and the beauty of the contrast of pure yellow and deep green, as in the yellow flag, mimulus, and numerous other plants. But however much we may admire, we do not experience that intimate and tender feeling which the blues and reds inspire in us; in other words, the yellow flower has not the expression which distinguishes those of other colours. Thus, when Tennyson speaks of the [...] "speedwell's darling blue," [...] we know that he is right--that he expresses a feeling about this flower common to all of us; but no poet would make so great, so absurd a mistake as to describe the purest and loveliest yellow of the most prized and familiar wild flower--buttercup or kingcup, yellow flag, sea poppy, <b>marsh</b> <b>marigold,</b> or broom, or furze, or rock-rose, let us say--by such a word--the word that denotes an intimate and affectionate feeling--the feeling one cherishes for the loved ones of our kind. Nor could that word of Tennyson be properly used of any pure white flower--the stitchwort for instance; nor of any white and yellow flower like the Marguerite. But no sooner do you get a touch of rose or crimson in the whitest flower, as we see in the daisy and eyebright, than you can say of it that it is a [...] "dear" [...] or a [...] "darling" [...] colour, and no one can find fault with the expression.|$|E

It is native to western North America from Alaska to New Mexico, where it grows in wet mountain habitats in alpine and subalpine regions. There are two general wild types of this species, one native to the interior and one that grows along the Pacific coast and coastal mountains, {{but these are not}} always treated separately.|$|E
6000|$|As to salmon, Walton {{scarcely}} speaks a true {{word about}} their habits, except by accident. Concerning pike, he quotes {{the theory that}} they are bred by pickerel weed, only as what 'some think.' In describing the use of frogs as bait, he makes the famous, or infamous, remark, 'Use him as though you loved him [...] . that he may live the longer.' A bait-fisher {{may be a good}} man, as Izaak was, but it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. As coarse fish are usually caught only with bait, I shall not follow Izaak on to this unholy and unfamiliar ground, wherein, none the less, grow flowers of Walton's fancy, and the songs of the old poets are heard. The Practical Angler, indeed, is a book to be marked with flowers, <b>marsh</b> <b>marigolds</b> and fritillaries, and petals of the yellow iris, for the whole provokes us to content, and whispers that word of the apostle, 'Study to be quiet.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mystical!" [...] he repeated. [...] "Yes, in {{a certain}} sense, he is so; and it is his {{greatest}} charm. But incomprehensible!--no. The essence of all artistic poetry is in the perfect blending of matter and form, so that the meaning creeps in upon us, but with a certain vagueness, a certain indefiniteness, which reaches us more {{in the shade of}} a dreamy consciousness than through the understanding. May I give you an illustration? We stand upon a low plain and gaze upon a far-off range of hills, from the sides of which thick clouds of white mist are hanging. Gradually, as the sun rises higher in the heavens, they float away, and we begin dimly to see through a clearer atmosphere the yellow corn waving on the brown hillside, the smoke rising from the lonely farmhouse, and, if we have patience and wait still, by-and-by we can even distinguish the brilliant patches of wild flowers, the poppies and the cornflowers in the golden fields, and the <b>marsh</b> <b>marigolds</b> in the meadows at the foot of the hill. It is a question of waiting long enough. So it is with what people call mysticism in poetry." ...|$|R
40|$|An area {{of common}} land between the River Stort and the Stort Navigation. About {{two thirds of}} the site is in Essex and a third in Hertfordshire, and {{it is one of the}} finest {{surviving}} unimproved grassland sites in the two counties. Traditional management at Hunsdon Mead has maintained the conditions required by a wide range of flowering plants. In April and May it is yellow with cowslips and <b>marsh</b> <b>marigolds.</b> As May gives way to June colours continually change, as plants such as yellow rattle, ragged robin, lady's smock, meadowsweet, bugle and many others flower in profusion. There are small colonies of green-winged orchid and adder's-tongue fern. Quaking grass and several uncommon sedge species are also present. Eastwick Mead has been more intensively managed over recent years and as a result does not have the diversity found on Hunsdon Mead. However, it is hoped that through appropriate management the Trust can create the right conditions for species to recolonise. All the typical butterflies of hay meadow are found here and the day-flying small yellow underwing moth is also established. Mayflies and dragonflies are abundant. During the winter, when the Mead floods, large flocks of lapwing and golden plover come to feed along with other winter migrants. Why is Hunsdon Mead so rich in wildlife? For over 600 years Hunsdon Mead has been managed on the ancient Lammas system under which local farmers graze their cattle in late summer, after a July hay cut. If it were cut earlier some of the flowering plants would not have time to set seed for the following year. Grazing by cattle and sheep is allowed only between 1 August and 1 March, after which the vegetation is allowed to grow up. The remarkable abundance of wildlife found on the Mead is a result of that management regime, which we are continuing today. We are working to introduce a similar management regime to Eastwick Mead. l Get driving directions l Find nearby public transpor...|$|R
