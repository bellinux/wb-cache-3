Because the polymeric micelles {{is an associate}} of many <b>block</b> copolymer <b>chains,</b> <b>block</b> copolymers with well-controlled molecular weight can be excreted through kidney filtration after dissociation of the polymeric micelles into <b>block</b> copolymer <b>chains.</b> Therefore, a low risk of chronic toxicity is expected to present itself {{and is expected to}} stem from polymeric micelles complete excretion over a long time period. In addition, micelles are known to mimic the phospholipid structure of the membranes and hence can be good candidates as hepatocyte-specific agents [22].|$|R

Bounded blocking on exclusive resources is achieved by means of a dynamic resource access protocol which also prevents deadlocks and <b>chained</b> <b>blocking.</b> A tunable servicing technique is used to improve aperiodic responsiveness in the presence of resource constraints. The schedulability analysis is also extended to the case in which aperiodic deadlines vary at runtime. The results achieved in this paper can also be used for developing adaptive real-time systems, where task deadlines or periods can change to conform to new load conditions...|$|R
50|$|Sensitivity towards tension {{changes can}} be {{explained}} as result of the hydrophobic coupling between the membrane and TMSs of the channel. Pockets in between TMSs were identified in MscS and YnaI that are filled with lipids. Fewer lipids {{are present in the}} open state of MscS than the closed. Thus, exclusion of lipid fatty acyl chains from these pockets, as a consequence of increased tension, may trigger gating. Similarly, in the eukaryotic MS channel TRAAK it was found that a lipid <b>chain</b> <b>blocks</b> the conducting path in the closed state.|$|R

40|$|Internet {{of things}} (IoT) {{is growing at}} a phenomenal speed and outpacing all the {{technological}} revolutions {{that occurred in the}} past. Together with window of opportunity it also poses quite a few challenges. One of the most important and unresolved challenge is vulnerability in security and privacy in IoT. This is mainly due to lack of a global decentralized standard even though characteristically IoT is based on distributed systems. Due to lack of standard IoT has interoperability issue between different devices and platform suppliers which implicitly creates need of reliance on the suppliers as they store and control user data. There is no decentralized industry wide solution which can offer the control of user data and security back to the user. While experts in IoT are still wondering on solving the challenge, a new <b>Block</b> <b>chain</b> technology has surfaced in past few years and showed signs of disruptive innovation in financial industry. This technology is decentralized, secure and private. Let alone information, <b>block</b> <b>chain</b> innovation has proven to keep assets secure. Recently few forms of <b>block</b> <b>chains</b> have emerged. This research will focus on analyzing the innovative <b>block</b> <b>chain</b> technology, their characteristics specifically the types of <b>block</b> <b>chain</b> to address the privacy and security challenges of IoT. Research proposes a new concept of hybrid <b>block</b> <b>chain</b> as a solution to IoT security and privacy problem...|$|R

50|$|In bicycle chains, skip-link chain has {{the same}} one-inch spacing as the earlier <b>block</b> <b>chain.</b> Due to the asymmetry, the rollers fit over long teeth used with earlier <b>block</b> <b>chain,</b> but due {{to the use of}} rollers, {{efficiency}} is better than <b>block</b> <b>chain.</b> Skip-link chain is typically arranged with the long plates also the wide-spaced outer plates, which mimics the visual effect of <b>block</b> <b>chain.</b> Since sprocket teeth run on rollers, they cannot be usefully wider than the width of the narrow-spaced links, so the tooth can be no wider than with a symmetrical chain. Thus, skip-link chain spreads wear over half the number of teeth and has worse sprocket durability than a symmetrical roller chain. Chain wear is dominated by wear between pins and bushings, and this is the same as a modern roller chain.|$|R

They were all on the comet which was discovered by Rosette a year ago and predicted a collision course with Earth, but no one believed the astronomer, because a layer of thick fog at the time prevented astronomical observations in other places.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{scheduling}} hybrid task sets consisting of hard periodic and soft aperiodic tasks that may share resources in exclusive mode in a dynamic environment, where tasks are scheduled based on their deadlines. Bounded blocking on exclusive resources is achieved by means of a dynamic resource access protocol which also prevents deadlocks and <b>chained</b> <b>blocking.</b> Aperiodic responsiveness is enhanced by an efficient servicing technique which assigns each aperiodic request a suitable deadline. Feasibility conditions are extended to handle tasks with deadlines different than periods and a reclaiming technique is presented to deal with early completions. ...|$|R
