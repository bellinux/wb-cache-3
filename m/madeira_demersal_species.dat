40|$|The present {{information}} on the biomass and catch of <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> which constitute {{a large part of}} the by-catch of the shrimp trawlers on the Sofala Bank (Mozambique), and thus seem to be more vulnerable than the pelagic stocks to an increase in effort is described.

Numbers for trawls 1 to 11 correspond to actual numbers of cumulative species collected in St 1 to St 11 by bottom trawl with all species including pelagic species (grey solid line) and <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> only (black solid line). Dashed line from trawls 12 to 50 corresponds to estimated cumulative <b>species</b> numbers for <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> from extrapolation for additional samplings by bottom trawling with upper and lower 95 % confidence intervals (dotted lines). The number of trawls at which 90 % and 95 % of total expected <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> are collected (i. e. 23 and 30 trawls, respectively) is indicated by vertical lines that meet the respective horizontal lines at the extrapolated species accumulation curve...|$|R
50|$|Straddling {{stocks are}} usually pelagic, rather than <b>demersal.</b> <b>Demersal</b> <b>species</b> move less than pelagic species, since {{they tend to}} relate to bottom topography. Pelagic species are more mobile, their {{movements}} influenced by ocean temperatures {{and the availability of}} zooplankton as food. Example pelagic fish are capelin, herring, whiting, mackerel and redfish, There are, however, a few <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> that are straddling, such as the Greenland halibut migrates in feeding/spawning migrations to Greenland in the west and to the Faeroes in the east.|$|R

40|$|The present work {{identifies}} {{trends in}} the abundance of the main <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> of the South Aegean Sea utilising catch and effort data derived from an international Mediterranean bottom trawl survey (MEDITS). The experimental surveys were accomplished annually from 1994 to 2000 on 61 pre-defined sampling stations. Selection of stations {{was based on a}} depth-stratified random sampling scheme that included five depth strata: 10 - 50, 50 - 100, 100 - 200, 200 - 500 and 500 - 800 m. The results suggest the existence of a general increasing trend in the biomass of the <b>demersal</b> <b>species,</b> particularly at the 10 - 50 m and 500 - 800 m depth strata. Findings are discussed in relation to the fisheries exploitation pattern and productivity of the area...|$|R
40|$|For a fish {{community}} to persist over time, all species {{must be able}} on average to replace themselves on a one-for-one basis over their lifetime. We use this principle and a size-based equilibrium model where asymptotic length {{is used as a}} functional trait to investigate how natural mortality should scale with size within and across pelagic and <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> of North Sea teleosts. The model predicts natural mortality to scale with body length raised to a power of ¿ 1. 66 at current levels of exploitation. Additionally, natural mortality of <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> should be proportional to asymptotic length raised to a power of 0. 80, so generating a higher natural mortality at a given length for large species than for small ones. The model also suggests that the exponent in the scaling of the von Bertalanffy growth parameter K with asymptotic length should be more negative for pelagic than for <b>demersal</b> <b>species.</b> We test our results by analysing independent estimates of predation mortality, the scaling of maximum recruitment per unit of spawning-stock biomass with asymptotic length, and the general relationship between K and asymptotic length for demersal and pelagic families of fish. All tests are consistent with our modelling results...|$|R
