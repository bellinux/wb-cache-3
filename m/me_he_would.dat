25|$|In 1898, Blue Horse {{became friends}} with the noted artist Elbridge Ayer (E.A.) Burbank while he was visiting the Pine Ridge Agency. Burbank painted sitting portraits of the {{greatest}} Native American leaders, including Geronimo, Sitting Bull, Red Cloud and Chief Joseph. Burbank painted more than 1200 portraits of Native Americans from 125 tribes. At the time, Blue Horse was eighty {{years of age and}} rode each day on his horse to pose for Burbank, who he called “Son of the Shadow-Maker.” Burbank was also an historian and his fond recollections illuminate Blue Horse. “Hardly a day passed without Blue Horse coming to my studio to visit <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> sit down and smoke a little, short, strong pipe and gossip with the other Indians present; all the time he was talking he would be fanning himself with the wing of a turkey. His face usually was painted red, and he wore all the Indian clothes he had, with a single feather on his head. He was a thorough Indian, and extremely kind-hearted. His principal object in life was to try to make others happy around him.” Burbank recorded his stories of Blue Horse.|$|E
25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
500|$|In 1835, Clifford {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts legislature, where he sat on a {{committee}} that revised the state's statutes. [...] In 1836 he served as an aide to Governor Edward Everett, a position he held until Everett lost the 1839 election. [...] Everett rewarded Clifford for his service by naming him district attorney for the southern district of the state in 1839, a post he held for ten years. [...] He was concurrently elected state senator representing Bristol County in 1845. [...] In 1849 he was appointed state attorney general by Governor George N. Briggs. [...] He was the only major appointed Whig official retained by Democrat George S. Boutwell after he took office in 1851. [...] Boutwell explained in his memoirs that Clifford [...] "was a good officer and an upright man, but he lacked the quality which enables a man to reach conclusions. [...] This peculiarity made him useful to <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> investigate a subject, give me the authorities and precedents, and leave the conclusions to me. Next, {{there was no one in}} the administration party whom I wished to appoint. Mr. [...] Hallett was the candidate most generally supported. He was full of prejudices and he was not well instructed as a lawyer. In these respects Clifford was his opposite." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A release indeed;--and I {{would become}} that man's wife the next day, {{at the foot}} of the gallows;--if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>me.</b> But <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have me." ...|$|R
500|$|Rotten, meanwhile, {{suffering}} from flu and coughing up blood, felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones, and disgusted by Vicious. On 14 January 1978, during the tour's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, [...] "You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard." [...] That one number was a Stooges cover, [...] "No Fun". At {{the end of}} the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, [...] "This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun—at all. No fun." [...] As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly—"Ah-ha-ha. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Good night"—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage. He later observed, [...] "I felt cheated, and I wasn't going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. The whole thing was a joke at that point.... wouldn't speak to <b>me....</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not discuss anything with me. But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was all my fault because I wouldn't agree to anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Vergne {{argued that}} he could have won the race had he not been {{observed}} speeding in the pit lane which he attributed to a defective speed limit button. Describing the situation as [...] "extremely frustrating" [...] he said: [...] "I was quicker than Rosenqvist and Buemi was quite far behind. Then the energy he would have spent to catch <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have had no extra energy to pass." [...] Mahindra team principal Dilbagh Gill agreed that Buemi's presence would have delayed Vergne, or caused him to use more additional electrical energy, and felt Rosenqvist {{would have been able to}} fend off a challenge from Vergne. Engel was disappointed not to finish the event; he claimed he would have secured a top-ten finishing position had problems not affected his car. He revealed his team had changed his vehicle's battery in the morning: [...] "Our race pace was strong and the energy management was good so I was looking forward to the second stint but it never really came." [...] e.Dams-Renault team principal Jean-Paul Driot revealed that Buemi's five-place grid penalty had been a sporting regulation safety violation, which they had no control over, and believed two wires became detached after Buemi ran over a kerb in qualifying.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, indeed. I don't {{mean that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ever deceive <b>me.</b> But <b>he</b> <b>would</b> let things go on, {{and hope that}} somehow they would come right without any fuss." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a 2013 CNN {{segment on}} {{the origins of}} Festivus, O'Keefe spoke about the real-life {{experiences}} related to the holiday. O'Keefe's father, who originated some of the now-recognized Festivus traditions, used a clock, not an aluminum pole. O'Keefe told CNN: [...] "The real symbol of the holiday was a clock that my dad put in a bag and nailed to the wall every year...I don't know why, I don't know what it means, he would never tell <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> always say, 'That's not for you to know.|$|E
2500|$|A {{clean-up}} {{order was}} placed on the mansion and Bryant's father took long service leave to assist in cleaning the interior. Harvey now invited Bryant to live with her in the mansion and they began spending large amounts of money, which included the purchase of more than thirty new cars in less than three years. The couple began to spend most days shopping, usually after having lunch in a local restaurant. Around this time, Bryant was reassessed for his pension and a note was attached to the paperwork: [...] "Father protects him from any occasion which might upset him as he continually threatens violence ... Martin tells <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to go around shooting people. It would be unsafe to allow Martin out of his parents' control".|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{had given}} up the billiard-table," [...] Frank said. [...] "He promised <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not go there any more, and I am sure he wouldn't." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a great}} puzzle to <b>me</b> why <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go. <b>He</b> {{could not}} say himself. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> stay four or five years, then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come home again to see his father--and his wife and child.|$|R
6000|$|He once {{declared}} to <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> resign his living, if the [...] Athanasian Creed {{were removed from}} the Prayer Book; and I am sure <b>he</b> [...] <b>would</b> have done so.|$|R
2500|$|One {{can easily}} guess what a European {{historical}} and existentialist philosopher might reply [...] You ask <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> say, to 'die to History'; but man is not, and he cannot be anything else but History, for his very essence is temporality. You are asking me, then, {{to give up}} my authentic existence and to take refuge in an abstraction, in pure Being, in the atman: I am to sacrifice my dignity as a creator of History in order to live an a-historic, inauthentic existence, empty of all human content. Well, I prefer to put up with my anxiety: at least, it cannot deprive me of a certain heroic grandeur, that of becoming conscious of, and accepting, the human condition.|$|E
2500|$|... "True Romance" [...] was {{recorded}} {{late into the}} process; drums for the entire album had already been recorded and the group's drummer, Tony Thaxton, was to be leaving town on a plane the very next day; he tracked drums two hours prior to his flight. [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] was described as [...] "just a quirky love song {{about a guy who}} doesn't really get it." [...] Cain's guitar solo was written as a joke of sorts, but was eventually kept on the record which Cain later found amusing. [...] "Timelines" [...] is directly autobiographical, covering Pierre's beginnings in Catholic school, a stuttering problem, and losing his virginity at 17. It was developed from an acoustic guitar lick Cain created while on tour; the initial eight bars of the song were recorded and quickly forgotten about. Taylor later found the file when sifting through his computer, and the band tackled the song from there. The influence behind the lyrics came from Pierre's father. [...] "Something my Dad used to always say to <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> just say, 'J, it's all about timing. Being at {{the right place at the}} right time.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2004, the Washington Post {{reported}} evidence given by Ameen Saeed Al-Sheik, detainee No. 151362. It quoted him as saying; [...] "They said {{we will make}} you wish to die {{and it will not}} happen [...] They stripped me naked. One of them told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rape me. He drew a picture of a woman to my back and made me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks." [...] "'Do you pray to Allah?' one asked. I said yes. They said, ' you. And [...] him.' One of them said, 'You are not getting out of here health, you are getting out of here handicapped. And he said to me, 'Are you married?' I said, 'Yes.' They said, 'If your wife saw you like this, she will be disappointed.' One of them said, 'But if I saw her now she would not be disappointed now because I would rape her.' [...] " [...] "They ordered me to thank Jesus that I'm alive." [...] "I said to him, 'I believe in Allah.' So he said, 'But I believe in torture and I will torture you.'" ...|$|E
