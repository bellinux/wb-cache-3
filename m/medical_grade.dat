25|$|Before {{putting on}} the dry suit, the male diver puts on a condom catheter, {{which is similar to}} a condom except that it is made of thicker {{material}} with a cuff or adhesive ring to prevent it from slipping off, and its end connects to a built-on drain tube. After putting it on, he attaches the end of the tube to a drain hose in the crotch of the suit. This hose leads to a fitting through the front of one thigh of the suit, either with a screw-down outlet valve (P-valve), opened for use, or a non-return valve to prevent water from flowing back in if the hose gets disconnected. There may also be a non-return equalisation valve allowing gas from inside the suit to flow into the hose to avoid squeeze during descent The female diver puts on an external catching device {{in the form of a}} wide-rimmed, low-profile, elongated cup.

25|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>grade</b> linacs {{accelerate}} electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, {{in which}} the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines {{tend to have a}} horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease. The LINAC produces a reliable, flexible and accurate radiation beam. The versatility of LINAC is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the treatment room itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of scattered radiation. Prolonged use of high powered (>18MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an active source and the necessary precautions must be observed).|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether high school <b>grades</b> can predict <b>medical</b> school <b>grades</b> {{after controlling for}} the effects of demographics and entrance examination scores. Material and Method: The authors used hierarchical multiple regression analyses to predict <b>medical</b> school <b>grades</b> of 223 <b>medical</b> students in the 1997 entering class of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Thailand, using age, gender, entrance examination scores, and high school grades as predictors. Results: After controlling for demographics and entrance examination scores, high school grades provided significant prediction only for premedical grades. The type of entrance examination that students took and the type of high school curriculum that the students studied were significant predictors of <b>medical</b> school <b>grades</b> in every level. Conclusion: Measures of cognitive abilities in academic content were good in predicting short-term aca-demic achievement. Long-term academic achievement in the medical school could be better predicted from academic orientation, commitment to the medical study, and demographic traits...|$|R
2500|$|An ocular prosthesis, {{artificial}} eye or glass eye {{is a type}} of craniofacial prosthesis that replaces an absent natural eye following an enucleation, evisceration, or orbital exenteration. The prosthesis fits over an orbital implant and under the eyelids. [...] Though often referred to as a glass eye, the ocular prosthesis roughly takes the shape of a convex shell and is made of <b>medical</b> <b>grade</b> plastic acrylic. A few ocular prostheses today are made of cryolite glass. A variant of the ocular prosthesis is a very thin hard shell known as a scleral shell which can be worn over a damaged or eviscerated eye. Makers of ocular prosthetics are known as ocularists. An ocular prosthesis does not provide vision; this would be a visual prosthesis. Someone with an ocular prosthesis is totally blind on the affected side and has monocular (one sided) vision.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the most}} common type of ozone {{generator}} for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the [...] "hot spark" [...] coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including <b>medical</b> <b>grade</b> and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a corona discharge tube. They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3–6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce nitrogen oxides as a by-product. Use of an air dryer can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. Use of an oxygen concentrator can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.|$|E

2500|$|Ozone {{offers many}} {{advantages}} as a sterilant gas; ozone {{is a very}} efficient sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties (E = 2.076 vs SHE) capable of destroying {{a wide range of}} pathogens, including prions without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the sterilizer from <b>medical</b> <b>grade</b> oxygen. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH immediately dangerous to life and health limit for ozone is [...] smaller than the [...] IDLH for ethylene oxide. Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95) and OSHA has set the PEL for ozone at [...] calculated as an [...] time weighted average (29 CFR 1910.1000, Table Z-1). The Canadian Center for Occupation Health and Safety provides an excellent summary of the health effects of exposure to ozone. The sterilant gas manufacturers include many safety features in their products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring to below the OSHA PEL to provide a rapid warning {{in the event of a}} leak. Monitors for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.|$|E
2500|$|In {{some regions}} where iodized salt is not available, iodized poppyseed oil is the {{standard}} for preventing iodine deficiency and its complications including goiter. [...] It may be given by mouth or by injection, injection being markedly more effective. [...] The origin of this use is attributed to Paulo Campos. [...] Usually it is given to adults and children by intramuscular injection, one injection delivering enough iodine to last 2 or 3 years. [...] Poppyseed oil is used because it is already manufactured and it very rarely causes an allergic reaction. [...] Also, injections are more expensive {{and more difficult to}} administer than oral medications, thus there is interest in giving iodized oil by mouth. [...] Use by mouth requires only food grade, not <b>medical</b> <b>grade,</b> quality control. [...] A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial on giving infants iodized poppyseed oil together with an oral polio vaccine had good results. [...] A randomized, double-blind, fully controlled trial in which lipiodol was given by mouth to children had disappointing results. [...] A recent clinical trial in which iodized oil was given by mouth found that the amount of iodine taken up (see bioavailability) varied with the amount of oleic acid in the oil. [...] Poppyseed oil has relatively little oleic acid. [...] Peanut oil and rapeseed oil have far more oleic acid and are less expensive, and may be superior to poppyseed oil for giving iodine by mouth.|$|E

40|$|Background: During {{the last}} decade, {{academic}} {{life at the}} medical school of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile has been thoroughly affected by a curricular reform process. Changes started in 1993 and have continued up until now. This reform {{did not have an}} experimental design to allow for a scientific evaluation of its effects. However, it seems interesting to study the evolution of indices of academic performance of our students during this period. Aim: To evaluate the academic performance of medical students between 1989 and 1999. Subjects and Methods: All undergraduate students enrolled between 1989 and 1999. Academic performance was evaluated by 1) failure to pass one or more courses, 2) delay to complete the third year of studies, 3) withdrawal from school and 4) <b>medical</b> school <b>grades.</b> Results: All indices of academic performance changed during the period of study. Failure to pass, delay and withdrawal from school significantly decreased, whereas <b>medical</b> school <b>grades</b> improved, particularly in basic and pre-clinical subjects. Conclusions: Academic performance of medical students improved consistently between 1989 and 1999. While specific causal relationships cannot be established, we believe that this improvement is likely related to the curricular reform. This reform included horizontal and vertical integration of academic contents, greater emphasis in problem-based learning and additional instances of evaluation such as the repetition exam (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 437 - 445...|$|R
