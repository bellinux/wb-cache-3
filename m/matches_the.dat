5|$|In chess {{tournaments and}} <b>matches,</b> <b>the</b> {{frequency}} with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In <b>matches,</b> <b>the</b> players' colors {{in the first game}} are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks; with an even number of players, each receives one extra white or black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites, or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent.|$|E
