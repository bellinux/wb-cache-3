Loggerheads Caretta caretta (Linnaeus, 1758) can be incidentally captured by surface longlines. A number of captured individuals die during the fishing operation, which we consider direct mortality due to fishing. We analysed the relative loggerhead by-catch and direct mortality associated with each type of boat and gear from April to December during the period 1999 - 2004 in the Spanish surface longline fleet that fishes in the western Mediterranean Sea, an important fishing area for this fleet. We used different indices to compute the catch per unit effort (CPUE) according {{to the number of}} hooks and to the number of fishing operations for each type of boat and gear. Both by-catch and direct mortality differed significantly according to the type of boat and gear.

Instead, characters have a fourth Saving Throw called the Toughness Save ("Damage Save" [...] {{in the previous}} edition) {{which is based on}} their Constitution scores (just like Fortitude). Weapons and powers that do lethal and subdual damage do not roll any dice to determine damage. Instead, damaging attacks are ranked based upon their overall power. For example, a fairly fit but normal human may throw a punch that inflicts +1N (non-lethal) damage, while the irradiated simian mastermind with enhanced strength and razor-sharp claws throws out +12L (lethal) damage. When a character is struck by an attack, he or she rolls a Toughness Save against a target number equal to the rank of the attack plus 15. Success allows the character to shrug off the attack with minimal effect, while failure results in injury according to the degree of failure and the type of damage. Accumulated damage applies a penalty to further saves, increasing the chances of any given attack taking the character down.|$|R

In this paper we give a new characterization of Dilworth k graphs, for each value of k, exactly defining their structure. Moreover, we put these graphs in relation with pairwise compatibility graphs (PCGs), i. e. graphs on n nodes that can be generated from an edge-weighted tree T that has n leaves, each representing a different node of the graph; two nodes are adjacent in the graph if and only if the weighted distance between the corresponding leaves in T is contained between two given non-negative real numbers, m and M. When either m or <b>M</b> are <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to eliminate edges from G, the two subclasses leaf power and minimum leaf power graphs (LPGs and mLPGs, respectively) are defined. Here we prove that graphs that are either LPGs or mLPGs of trees obtained connecting the centers of k stars with a path are Dilworth k graphs, and the opposite is true when k= 1, 2, but not when k≥ 3. Finally, we show that the relations we proved between Dilworth k graphs and chains of k stars hold only for LPGs and mLPGs, but not for PCGs...|$|R

40|$|A general {{procedure}} was devised for {{the determination of}} growth factor requirements of heterotrophic bacteria based upon identification of individual nutrients as they are successively depleted from a limited quantity of complex medium. By using this approach, {{it was possible to}} develop a defined medium for growth of Moraxella nonliquefaciens that contained nine amino acids and three vitamins. Three of the amino acids, proline, serine, and cysteine, were required in unusually high concentrations to obtain optimal growth. Methionine had a sparing action on the requirements for serine and cysteine. Glycine could substitute for serine. Although a required nutrient, cysteine was inhibitory for growth, but this inhibitory action was antagonized by valine or leucine. The requirement for cysteine was satisfied by cystine, glutathione, or sodium sulfide. <b>M.</b> nonliquefaciens could <b>not</b> <b>use</b> ammonia as a nitrogen source but could use glutamate or aspartate for this purpose.

This amplifier {{is designed to}} function at a supply potential {{less than or equal}} to 5. 5 V, at any temperature from - 180 to + 120 C.

The design incorporates several innovations to achieve this, the main ones being the following: NMOS transistor channel lengths below 1 <b>m</b> are generally <b>not</b> <b>used</b> because research showed that this change could reduce the adverse effect of hot carrier injection on the lifetimes of transistors at low temperatures. To enable the amplifier to withstand the 5. 5 -V supply potential, a circuit topology including cascade devices, clamping devices, and dynamic voltage biasing was adopted so that no individual transistor would be exposed to more than 3. 6 V. To minimize undesired variations in performance over the temperature range, the transistors in the amplifier are biased by circuitry that maintains a constant inversion coefficient over the temperature range...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the phase behavior and microstructure {{for a series}} of salt-free catanionic surfactants of the type Cm+Cn- with varied chain length mismatch (<b>m</b> <b>not</b> equal n), <b>using</b> light microscopy, DSC, turbidity, surface tension, SAXS and SANS. The compounds consist of alkyltrimethylammonium alkylsulfonates, denoted by TA(m) So(n). Depending on the asymmetry between both ions, three regimes can be identified: (i) weakly asymmetric; (ii) approximately symmetric; and (iii) highly asymmetric. For the TA(16) So(n) compounds, with n = 8 and 9 (weakly asymmetric), the surfactant forms a lamellar phase in water, however, with a striking miscibility gap. This miscibility gap is a consequence of the concentration dependent bilayer charge density. For n = 8, also a temperature-dependent vesicle-to-micelle transition at low surfactant concentration is observed. When the mismatch is low (n = 10) only a non-swelling lamellar phase is formed (approximately symmetric regime). For high mismatch, (n = 6 and 7) an extensive micellar phase is obtained - highly asymmetric regime. Conversely, for the TA(m) So(8) compounds, where m = 12 and 14, the unconventional lamellar miscibility gap and vesicle-micelle transition are again present. These findings are rationalized by considering the effect of film charge density-arising from the chain solubility difference-on the spontaneous curvature and balance of colloidal forces. The type of phase behavior reported here should be extensive to other families of salt-free catanionic amphiphiles, where an appropriate tuning of the solubility mismatch can allow the control of self-assembly...|$|R

40|$|In Mediterranean {{ecosystems}} vegetation overlying shallow, transient aquifers {{is often}} dominated by woody phreatophytes, {{trees and shrubs}} that {{have been shown to}} be dependent on groundwater for their water requirements. Natural and anthropogenic alterations of groundwater tables (abstraction) are of clear importance to phreatophytic vegetation as reduction of water tables may sever these plants from their natural water sources. Seasonal water sources were determined for species growing on a coastal dune system that overlies a shallow sandy aquifer in south-western Australia. The plants studied grew over groundwater that ranged in depth from 2. 5 to 30 m. The naturally occurring stable isotope of hydrogen (deuterium, δ 2 H) was used to distinguish potential water sources. Isotopic ratios from vascular water of the dominant species of the study area (Banksia ilicifolia R. Br. and Banksia attenuata R. Br. trees) were compared with those of potential sources of precipitation, soil moisture and groundwater. A relatively shallow- rooted perennial shrub, Hibbertia hypericoides Benth., was also included as an isotopic reference.
