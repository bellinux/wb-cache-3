2500|$|Mead {{varieties}} include drinks called <b>metheglin</b> (with spices or herbs), melomel (with fruit juices, such as grape, specifically called pyment), hippocras (with cinnamon), and sack mead (high {{concentration of}} honey), {{many of which}} have been developed as commercial products numbering in the hundreds in the United States as of 2014. Honey is also used to make mead beer, called [...] "braggot".|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now so's,' remarked {{the fifth}} ringer, as {{pertaining}} to the last allusion, 'we'll finish this drop o' <b>metheglin</b> and cider, and every man home--along straight as a line.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And, Voss," [...] {{said the}} tranter terminatively, [...] "you keep house here till about half-past two; then heat the <b>metheglin</b> and cider in the warmer you'll find turned up upon the copper; {{and bring it}} wi' the victuals to church-hatch, as th'st know." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the hunt}} a great banquet was given, which surpassed all the other feasts in munificence. They had on the tables of this banquet a great variety of drinks--not only rich wines from the {{southern}} countries, but beer, and <b>metheglin,</b> and also sherbet, which the army had learned to make in Persia.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is goodish mead,' assented Mrs. Fennel, with {{an absence}} of enthusiasm which seemed {{to say that it}} was {{possible}} to buy praise for one's cellar at too heavy a price. 'It is trouble enough to make--and really I hardly think we shall make any more. For honey sells well, and we ourselves can make shift with a drop o' small mead and <b>metheglin</b> for common use from the comb-washings.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, now--that's too much!" [...] {{said the}} timid man, {{becoming}} {{a man of}} brazen courage all of a sudden. [...] "I didn't say SIR. I'll take my oath I didn't say 'Joseph Poorgrass o' Weatherbury, sir.' No, no; what's right is right, and I never said sir to the bird, knowing very well that no man of a gentleman's rank would be hollering there at that time o' night. 'Joseph Poorgrass of Weatherbury,'--that's every word I said, and I shouldn't ha' said that if 't hadn't been for Keeper Day's <b>metheglin....</b> There, 'twas a merciful thing it ended where it did." ...|$|E
6000|$|Montesinos.--Coffee in {{the seventeenth}} century, {{inoculation}} in that which followed; since which we have had {{now and then a}} new dance and a new game at cards, curry and mullagatawny soup from the East Indies, turtle from the West, and that earthly nectar to which the East contributes its arrack, and the West its limes and its rum. In the language of men it is called Punch; I know not what may be its name in the Olympian speech. But tell not the Englishmen of George the Second's age, lest they should be troubled for the degeneracy of their grandchildren, that the punchbowl is now become a relic of antiquity, and their beloved beverage almost as obsolete as <b>metheglin,</b> hippocras, chary, or morat! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 11. And {{the more}} I {{think the more}} I bewilder myself; for these bushes, which are pruned and clipped by the deathless Gardener into these lowly {{thickets}} of bloom, do not strew the ground with fallen branches and faded clippings in any wise,--it is the pining umbrage of the patriarchal trees that tinges the ground and betrays the foot beneath them: but, under the heather and the Alpine rose.--Well, what is under them, then? I never saw, nor thought of looking,--will look presently under my own bosquets and beds of lingering heather-blossom: beds indeed they were only a month since, a foot deep in flowers, and close in tufted cushions, and the mountain air that floated over them rich in honey like a draught of <b>metheglin.</b>|$|E
6000|$|His more earnest {{poems are}} {{somewhat}} tainted with that cardinal fault of his school, {{of which he}} steered so clear in prose--fine words; yet he never, like the Corn-Law Rhymer, falls a cursing. He is evidently not a good hater even of [...] "priests and kings, and aristocrats, and superstition;" [...] or perhaps he worked all that froth safely over and off in debating-club speeches and leading articles, and left us, in these poems, the genuine <b>metheglin</b> of his inner heart, sweet, clear, and strong; for there is no form of lovable or right thing which this man has come across, which he {{does not seem to}} have appreciated. Besides pure love and the beauties of nature--those on which every man of poetic power, and a great many of none, as a matter of course, have a word to say--he can feel for and with the drunken beggar, and the warriors of the ruined manor-house, and the monks of the abbey, and the old mailed Normans with their [...] "priest with cross and counted beads in the little Saxon chapel"--things which a Radical editor might have been excused for passing by with a sneer.|$|E
60|$|The smith, though reluctantly, {{was obliged}} to defer to the {{reasoning}} of his proposed father in law, and, once determined to accept the honour destined for him by the fathers of the city, he extricated himself from the crowd, and hastened home {{to put on his}} best apparel; in which he presently afterwards repaired to the council house, where the ponderous oak table seemed to bend under the massy dishes of choice Tay salmon and delicious sea fish from Dundee, being the dainties which the fasting season permitted, whilst neither wine, ale, nor <b>metheglin</b> were wanting to wash them down. The waits, or minstrels of the burgh, played during the repast, and in the intervals of the music one of them recited With great emphasis a long poetical account of the battle of Blackearnside, fought by Sir William Wallace and his redoubted captain and friend, Thomas of Longueville, against the English general Seward--a theme perfectly familiar to all the guests, who, nevertheless, more tolerant than their descendants, listened as if it had all the zest of novelty. It was complimentary to the ancestor of the Knight of Kinfauns, doubtless, and to other Perthshire families, in passages which the audience applauded vociferously, whilst they pledged each other in mighty draughts to the memory of the heroes who had fought {{by the side of the}} Champion of Scotland. The health of Henry Wynd was quaffed with repeated shouts, and the provost announced publicly, that the magistrates were consulting how they might best invest him with some distinguished privilege or honorary reward, to show how highly his fellow citizens valued his courageous exertions.|$|E

50|$|Common drinks during Calan Mai festivities were <b>metheglin</b> or mead. Sometimes it {{was made}} of herbs, {{including}} woodruff, a sweet-smelling herb which was often put in wine in times past to make a man merry and act as a tonic for the heart and liver. Elderberry and rhubarb wines were popular and the men also liked various beers.|$|E

5000|$|Metheglin: <b>Metheglin</b> is {{traditional}} mead with herbs or spices added. Some {{of the most}} common metheglins are ginger, tea, orange peel, nutmeg, coriander, cinnamon, cloves or vanilla. Its name indicates that many metheglins were originally employed as folk medicines. The Welsh word for mead is , and the word [...] "metheglin" [...] derives from , a compound of , [...] "healing" [...] + , [...] "liquor".|$|E

[...] Staples include traditional meads like Lagrimas de Oro (a semi-sweet traditional mead), melomels like the berry-based Marion and mango-based Ragnarok, a vanilla <b>metheglin</b> called Tahitian Honeymoon, and grape-based pyments like Aphrodisia. Superstition also produces heavier dessert meads, like the White Series: barrel aged meads with one of four berry juices and white chocolate.|$|E
50|$|The {{family of}} O'Carroll, {{according}} to the Irish antiquaries, are descended from Kean, the third son of Olioll Olum, King of Munster. Teige, the eldest son of this Kean, was a distinguished warrior, who by killing in battle his three rivals, procured for Cormac Mac Art, King of Ulster, the Monarchy of Ireland. Cormac rewarded him with a grant of land in Connaught called Lurgny Gallen and Culavin, he paying to the King of Connaught and his successors, 150 milch cows in May; 100 beeves and 100 barrels of mead or <b>Metheglin</b> at Alhallontide yearly, forever.|$|E
5000|$|Mead {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} flavors {{depending}} on the source of the honey, additives (also known as [...] "adjuncts" [...] or [...] "gruit") including fruit and spices, the yeast employed during fermentation and the aging procedure. [...] Some producers have marketed white wine sweetened and flavored with honey after fermentation as mead, sometimes spelling it [...] "meade." [...] This is closer in style to a Hypocras. Blended varieties of mead may be known by the style represented; for instance, a mead made with cinnamon and apples may be referred to as either a cinnamon cyser or an apple <b>metheglin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mead is {{featured}} in many Germanic myths and folktales such as Beowulf, {{as well as}} in other popular works that draw on these myths. Notable examples include books by Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, T. H. White, and Neil Gaiman. It is often featured in books using a historical Germanic setting and in writings about the Viking age. Mead is mentioned many times in Neil Gaiman's 2001 novel, American Gods; it {{is referred to as the}} drink of the gods. In The Inheritance Cycle series by Christopher Paolini, the protagonist, Eragon, often drinks mead at feasts. It is also referenced in The Kingkiller Chronicle novel series by Patrick Rothfuss. The protagonist Kvothe is known to drink <b>metheglin.</b> The non-existent [...] "Greysdale Mead" [...] is also drunk, although it is merely water.|$|E
