500|$|During {{his first}} year at the Liverpool College of Art, Sutcliffe worked as a bin man on the Liverpool Corporation's waste {{collection}} trucks. Lennon was introduced to Sutcliffe by Bill Harry, a mutual friend, when all three were studying at the Liverpool College of Art. According to Lennon, Sutcliffe had a [...] "marvellous art portfolio" [...] and was a very talented painter {{who was one of the}} [...] "stars" [...] of the school. He helped Lennon to improve his artistic skills, and with others, worked with him when Lennon had to submit work for exams. Sutcliffe shared a flat with Murray at 9 Percy Street, Liverpool, before being evicted and moving to Hillary Mansions at 3 Gambier Terrace, where another art student lived, Margaret Chapman, who competed with Sutcliffe to be the best painter in class. The flat was opposite the new Anglican cathedral in the rundown area of Liverpool 8, with bare lightbulbs and a <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor in the corner. Lennon moved in with Sutcliffe in early 1960. (Paul McCartney later admitted that he was jealous of Sutcliffe's relationship with Lennon, as he had to take a [...] "back seat" [...] to Sutcliffe). Sutcliffe and his flatmates painted the rooms yellow and black, which their landlady did not appreciate. On another occasion the tenants, needing to keep warm, burned the flat's furniture.|$|E

5000|$|... "You've {{probably}} {{never heard of}} my movies," [...] Panna told the Bangkok Post in a 2004 interview. [...] "They are popular among taxi drivers and som tam vendors and security guards and Isan coolies. My loyalest fans are folk people in the far-out tambons, where they lay out <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and drink moonshine whisky while watching my outdoor movies." ...|$|R

Carlsen founded The Sleep Train Mattress Center in 1985, and {{has guided}} {{the company to}} become the largest {{retailer}} of <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> West Coast, {{and one of the}} top three in the United States. In 2002, Dale purchased 54 of Mattress Discounters' stores in California during that company's bankruptcy—more than doubling Sleep Train's size. In August 2006, Dale purchased Sleep Country USA from Simmons Bedding in a move to re-enter the northwestern market.|$|R
2500|$|Bilancia {{was born}} in Potenza, Basilicata, in 1951. When he was about five years old, {{his family moved to}} {{northern}} Italy, first to Piedmont and then to Genoa in the Liguria region. [...] He was a chronic bedwetter until age 10 or 12, and his mother shamed him by placing his wet <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> balcony where it could be seen by the neighbors. [...] When undressing him for bed, his aunt would shame him by pulling down his underwear in front of his cousins to show his underdeveloped penis. [...] At age 14, he decided to start calling himself Walter. [...] He {{dropped out of high school}} and worked at jobs such as mechanic, bartender, baker and delivery boy.|$|E
2500|$|Born in 1941 and ailing, Gulen resides at the Golden Generation Worship and Retreat Center, a 25-acre wooded estate near Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, in the Poconos. Never married, Gulen's living {{quarters}} and study are {{a pair of}} very small rooms with a <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, prayer mat, desk, bookshelves, and treadmill, within a within one of the estate's several modest houses, which are accompanied by a hall used as a mosque and a small pond.

2500|$|... 11-year-old Charlie Bucket {{lives in}} poverty {{in a tiny}} house with his parents and four {{grandparents}}. His grandparents share the only bed in the house, located in the only bedroom. Charlie and his parents sleep on a <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. One day, Grandpa Joe tells him about the legendary and eccentric chocolatier, Willy Wonka and all the wonderful candy he made until the other candymakers sent in spies to steal his secret recipes, which led him to close the factory forever. The next day, the newspaper announces that Mr Wonka is reopening the factory and has invited five children to come on a tour, after they find a golden ticket in a Wonka Bar. Each ticket find is a media sensation and each finder becomes a celebrity. The first four golden tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled and petulant Veruca Salt, the gum-addicted Violet Beauregarde, and the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee.|$|E
50|$|Even tighter {{control was}} imposed when {{regulation}} of common lodging houses was {{transferred from the}} police to the London County Council in 1894, resulting in the imposition of higher standards and regular inspection of the premises by council officials. The new regulations required the landlords to limewash the walls and ceilings twice a year and the mixed sex accommodation, which was frequently a cover for a brothel, was abolished. Proper beds and bedding had also to be provided instead of <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor and worse.|$|R

2500|$|Rockfield Studios was in {{its infancy}} and the {{environment}} {{at the time was}} spartan, Lemmy explaining that they [...] "recorded it at the barn, before they modernised it, with <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls and things." [...] Some band members have expressed concerns with the quality of the production, Simon King feeling that [...] "It sounded as if all the bass was turned off, your amp wasn’t working properly and your stereo was bunged up all at the same time." [...] and Lemmy adding [...] "It was just not very well recorded. It was all thin and tinny." ...|$|R

500|$|In early February 2000, Mihdhar and Hazmi rented an {{apartment}} at the Parkwood Apartments {{complex in the}} Clairemont Mesa area of San Diego, and Mihdhar purchased a used 1988 Toyota Corolla. [...] Neighbors thought that Mihdhar and Hazmi were odd because months passed without the men getting any furniture, and they slept <b>on</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, yet they carried briefcases, were frequently on their mobile phones, and were occasionally {{picked up by a}} limousine. Those who met Mihdhar in San Diego described him as [...] "dark and brooding, with a disdain for American culture". [...] Neighbors also said that the pair constantly played flight simulator games.|$|R
50|$|Women {{prisoners in}} Western Australia were housed at Fremantle Gaol until a Women’s Rehabilitation Centre was opened in 1969. Bandyup Training Centre, the {{precursor}} to Bandyup Women’s Prison, was opened in 1971. It was originally built to hold 68 women. In 1998, following civil society agitation, an urgency motion and debate {{was held in}} state parliament about the conditions at Bandyup. The prison was so overcrowded that women were sleeping <b>on</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. A major refurbishment of the prison {{with the addition of}} new units, completed in 2003, brought the total design capacity to 180. Not long after, however, overcrowding again became an issue and continues to this day.|$|R
25|$|The Tent Division also {{provided}} immediate {{treatment for the}} wounded, redressing all wounds, and performing emergency surgery. The division ran the Field Hospital, consisting of between one and four hospital tents, each accommodating up to 14 patients, where men lay <b>on</b> <b>mattresses</b> either <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground or <b>on</b> light, wicker supports, or on stretchers.|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} part of a garret, with a sloping side and a dormer window. Opposite was a large brick chimney with an open fireplace. Near it lay a <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, and upon this rested a man.|$|E
60|$|Tommy {{was still}} waiting {{faithfully}} when {{the letter was}} concluded, and when Lena dropped it out she saw him {{pick it up and}} start up the steep hillside. Without undressing she blew out the candle and curled herself upon the <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor.|$|E
60|$|Stretched upon a <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep. Towards him {{the old man}} {{sometimes}} {{directed his}} eyes for an instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Women {{are still}} {{sleeping}} <b>on</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor in 2015. Despite the Minister for Corrective Services assuring {{this was not}} the case in Parliament <b>on</b> 19 February, <b>the</b> prison will continue this practice while there is no cap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number of women that can be held there.In early 2015, the Department of Corrective Services stopped using the phrase ‘operational capacity’ and starting using the phrase ‘total capacity’, which includes beds that have been added to <b>the</b> design capacity <b>on</b> an ad hoc basis. The total capacity published <b>on</b> <b>the</b> DCS website <b>on</b> 23 January 2015 was 321, though the total population at Bandyup on any one day is consistently higher than this.Bunk beds have been installed in various units and are planned to be installed in most cells of the prison, including cells designed for single occupancy. The beds added in unit 4 are so close to the ceiling that the occupant is not able to sit upright in bed and a ceiling light is about 10 cm away from the head of the bed. As there is no desk or chair in these units, these occupants are not able to sit down in the cell. The increase in beds comes without a corresponding increase in other infrastructure, such as showering facilities, or services, such as nursing services or access to phones. While waiting for bunk beds, women have been sleeping <b>on</b> plastic-covered <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. In units 1 and 2, women that sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor have their head next to the toilet. These units are mostly occupied by Aboriginal women.|$|R

60|$|We slept {{that night}} in {{a room at the}} extreme top of the hotel. It couldn't have been a first class accommodation, for the frame of the bed fell in the moment we got into it, but we made no complaint--we would not have had the clerk know of our mishap for twice our bill. We merely spread the <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor and slept till morning.|$|E

"We were {{so afraid}} you didn't sleep, Tom and I," [...] {{she said with}} a little tone of anxiety; [...] "we saw a light in your room till so very late, and Tom opened the door a wee bit once or twice to see if you were sleeping; but he said you seemed to have pulled the <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. I do hope you weren't ill." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{opening of}} the Market & Castro Street Cable Car line in 1886 opened Eureka Valley to {{development}} — primarily small wood-frame cottages and two-story flats.

6000|$|... "The bed first," [...] whispered Fred; {{and in a}} trice {{the boys}} had taken off the bed {{clothing}} and turned up the <b>mattress.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> springs they placed one of the bedsheets and {{on the top of}} this they distributed all of Nappy's choice neckties and also his fancy-colored socks. Then to this they added his cuffs, his fancy underwear, and all of his loose jewelry. The articles were spread over the bed with care, so that they rested as flat as possible.|$|E
60|$|Accompanied by the professor, {{the three}} cadets {{hurried to the}} second floor of the Hall and then to the rooms {{occupied}} by Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell. The door to each was locked, but one of them was opened for the crowd by an assistant janitor. A hasty search revealed nothing in the shape of a firearm in either room, and the Rover boys were much disappointed. But then Randy thought of the bed, and quickly raised the <b>mattress.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> springs rested a shotgun.|$|E
