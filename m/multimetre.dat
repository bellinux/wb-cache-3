40|$|A {{microscale}} apparatus for {{electrochemical cell}} in which plaster (CaSO 4) {{was used as}} liquid junction has been developed. A glass tube (0. 5 cm ID x 5. 0 cm) was used to prepare each half-cell. The potentials of the resulting galvanic cells were measured by a <b>multimetre</b> and were compared {{to those of the}} galvanic cells in which agar was used as liquid junction. It was found that the potentials produced by the galvanic cells with plaster as liquid junction are not significantly {{different from those of the}} cells with agar as liquid junction and close to the theoretical values. In addition, when the developed apparatus was used for the study of electrolysis of potassium iodide solution, it was found that the electrolytic cell made from the microscale apparatus with plaster liquid junction can distinctly separate the reactions occurring at the anode and the cathode. Moreover, the lifetime of the plaster liquid junction is much greater than that of the agar liquid junction...|$|E
