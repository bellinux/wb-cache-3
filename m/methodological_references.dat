40|$|This {{paper is}} divided into three {{different}} sections. The first section considers the annotations of Manuel Marzal, an anthropologist and professor at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú who passed away in the year 2005, about ethics as a concern coming form an anthropological perspective. Secondly, the article presents a balance on the bibliography about this issue, contrasting Marzal’s preoccupations with the latest bibliography, mainly Peruvian, which deals with ethics and morals in an explicit or implicit sort of way. Finally, living in the post-political violence and Commission for Truth and Reconciliation Final Report period, in order to make an anthropology on ethics one has to consider two <b>methodological</b> <b>references</b> and four dimensions to explore the people’s behaviors in relation to others. The <b>methodological</b> <b>references</b> require a «dense description » on morality to try to understand the simplicity of the relations and investigate and reflect on a multidisciplinary perspective. The four dimensions in which to explore ethics are daily life, religiosity, economics and politics...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{knowledge}} representation framework (KRF) {{which accounts for}} the characteristics of knowledge for a generic artificial problem solving system. KRF is intended as a <b>methodological</b> <b>reference</b> for a knowledge engineer during the conceptualization, formalization, and implementation phases {{of the process of}} building the problem solving system. KRF is structured in three levels corresponding to those phases. Furthermore, it accounts for the use of different kinds of expert knowledge in building knowledge-based systems, namely knowledge about domain, classes of application, and reasoning methods. In particular, KRF proposes a solution to cope with the existence of an epistemological level between conceptualization and formalization, missed by most of the current knowledge engineering models, but needed to define an effective methodology...|$|R
