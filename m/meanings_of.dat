40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze the will to meaning and the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life of Lara Cameron in Sidney Sheldon’s The Stars Shine Down novel. The {{analysis}} uses intrinsic and existential psychology method, that is logoterapy. Basic concepts of Logoterapy {{that are used in}} this analysis are the will to meaning, freedom, responsibility, spirituality, and <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life. In Logotherapy by Victor Frankl, there are three sources <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life. In intrinsic method, the writer analyzes theme, plot, character and setting that are supports the analysis <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life of Lara Cameron.

In every condition, people always look for their <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life to live their life. Logotherapy helps people to understand the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life deeper...|$|R

5|$|Around 1924 Whorf {{first became}} {{interested}} in linguistics. Originally he analyzed Biblical texts, seeking to uncover hidden layers of meaning.

40|$|The Hairy Ape and The Emperor Jones are {{two plays}} {{that are similar}} in their idea, that is about the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life. This thesis {{examines}} the reasons that make the protagonists' look for the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life {{and the process of}} the searching <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life through the conflicts that the protagonists faced. For Yank, the protagonist in The Hairy Ape, the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> his life is in his sense of belonging. When he loses his sense of belonging, he also loses his <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life that he makes hard efforts to find it again. And his efforts make him to face conflicts that later lead him to his death. Whereas, In The Emperor Jones, Jones regards that the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> his life is his wealth and power. When he loses them, he also loses his <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life that he tries to search for them again. And this efforts also make him to face conflicts and lead him to face his death. Wealth, power and sense of belonging are the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life that the two protagonists search for. The efforts of the protagonists search for the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life is very important since without the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life, their lives will mean nothing and they will feel empty. In these plays, the writer of this thesis can see how important for Jones and Yank to find their <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life, even they do not care that their efforts to find the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life can lead them to face their final downfall, the death...|$|R

5|$|Philitas was {{the first}} major Greek writer who was both a scholar and a poet.

His poetry, notably his elegiac poem Demeter, was highly respected by later ancient poets. However, almost all his work has since been lost.|$|E
5|$|Social pragmatic theories, also in {{contrast}} to the constraints view, focus on the social context in which the infant is embedded.

Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E

5|$|The {{meaning of}} a reconstructed root is {{conventionally}} that of a verb; the terms root and verbal root are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from {{a limited number of}} so-called root nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in verbal inflection through well-established morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their meanings are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in the <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> reflexes in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verbal roots via suffixes and ablaut.|$|E
5|$|British {{archaeologist}} and anthropologist Katherine Routledge {{undertook a}} 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui {{with her husband}} to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an idiosyncratic mnemonic device that did not directly represent language, in other words, proto-writing, and that the <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> the glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the kohau rongorongo could not be read by someone not trained in that specific text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly tapu, that recorded the island's history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had been forgotten, and the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.|$|E

5|$|The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy {{adventure}} novel written by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer, published in 1961 by Random House (USA). It {{tells the story}} of a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth one afternoon and, having nothing better to do, drives through it in his toy car, transporting him to the Kingdom of Wisdom, once prosperous but now troubled. There, he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to restore to the kingdom its exiled princesses—named Rhyme and Reason—from the Castle in the Air. In the process, he learns valuable lessons, finding a love of learning. The text is full of puns and wordplay, such as when Milo unintentionally jumps to Conclusions, an island in Wisdom, thus exploring the literal <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> idioms.|$|E
5|$|This pyramid was {{the last}} pyramid ever built {{as part of a}} {{mortuary}} complex in Egypt. The pyramid would be abandoned by subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom, for both practical and religious reasons. The Giza plateau offered plenty of room for building pyramids; but {{this was not the case}} with the confined, cliff-bound geography of Thebes and any burials in the surrounding desert were vulnerable to flooding. The pyramid form was associated with the sun god Re, who had been overshadowed by Amun in importance. One of the <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> Amun's name was the hidden one, which meant that it was now theologically permissible to hide the Pharaoh's tomb by fully separating the mortuary template from the actual burial place. This provided the added advantage that the resting place of the pharaoh could be kept hidden from necropolis robbers. All subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom would be buried in rock-cut shaft tombs in the Valley of the Kings.|$|E
