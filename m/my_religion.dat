His comments were widely trumpeted in Catholic newspapers, which cited it as the reason why he was able to stop a communist takeover of South Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|Here's {{the thing}} with me and the {{religious}} thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like [...] "Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain" [...] or [...] "I Saw the Light"—that's <b>my</b> <b>religion.</b> I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any {{of this kind of}} entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.|$|E

It's just a great thing when you can make a kid smile that's going through some hard times in life... I wish more people, not just athletes, would give people {{just a little bit of}} their time.

500|$|Religion was a {{paramount}} {{force in}} Romney's life. [...] In a 1959 essay for the Detroit Free Press he said, [...] "My religion is my most precious possession. ... Except for <b>my</b> <b>religion,</b> I {{easily could have}} become excessively occupied with industry, social and recreational activities. Sharing personal responsibility for church work with my fellow members has been a vital counterbalance in my life." [...] Following LDS Church practices, he did not drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages, smoke, or swear. [...] Romney and his wife tithed, and from 1955 to 1965, gave 19percent of their income {{to the church and}} another 4percent to charity.|$|E
500|$|Lydia Hand was an {{involved}} and protective mother, {{who had been}} influenced by a Calvinist aunt as a child; and she passed on {{a strong sense of}} duty and guilt to her only son. Learned Hand eventually came to understand the influences of his parents as formative. After his father's death, he looked to religion to help him cope, writing to his cousin Augustus Noble Hand: [...] "If you could imagine one half the comfort <b>my</b> <b>religion</b> has given to me in this terrible loss, you would see that Christ never forsakes those who cling to him." [...] The depth of Hand's early religious convictions was in sharp contrast to his later agnosticism.|$|E

500|$|Anne's {{stepmother}} {{gave birth}} to a son, James Francis Edward, on 10 June 1688, and a Catholic succession became more likely. Anne was still at Bath, so she did not witness the birth, which fed the belief that the child was spurious. Anne may have left the capital deliberately to avoid being present, or because she was genuinely ill, but {{it is also possible that}} James desired the exclusion of all Protestants, including his daughter, from affairs of state. [...] "I shall never now be satisfied", Anne wrote to her sister Mary, [...] "whether the child be true or false. It may be it is our brother, but God only knows... one cannot help having a thousand fears and melancholy thoughts, but whatever changes may happen you shall ever find me firm to <b>my</b> <b>religion</b> and faithfully yours." ...|$|E

She was asked at one point to fetch water from a nearby well; she complied but stopped to take a drink with an old metal cup she had found lying next to the well. A neighbor of Noreen, who had been involved in a running feud with Noreen's family about some property damage, saw her and angrily told her that it was forbidden for a Christian to drink [...] water from the same utensil from which Muslims drink, {{and some of the other}} workers considered her to be unclean because she was a Christian. Some arguments ensued. Noreen recounts that when they made derogatory statements about her religion, she responded, [...] "I believe in <b>my</b> <b>religion</b> and in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for the sins of mankind. What did your Prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind?" ...|$|E

I don't want them to look at my flaws and be like, 'oh, that's the flaws of Islam'." [...] His mixtape series Fahrenheit 1/15 featured a remix of Kanye West's [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] entitled [...] "Muhammad Walks", which went on to become very popular in the Muslim community. He can be heard using Islamic recitals in [...] "Hurt Me Soul", [...] "Little Weapon", [...] "Hi-Definition" [...] as well as the intro and outro tracks to Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor.

500|$|Motivated {{by her own}} {{battle to}} gain {{credibility}} as {{a woman in a}} field dominated by male astronomers, [...] Rubin encouraged girls interested in investigating the universe to pursue their dreams. She faced discouraging comments on her choice of study throughout her life, but persevered, supported by family and colleagues. In addition to astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of women in the sciences and for scientific literacy. She and Burbidge advocated together for more women in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on review panels, and in academic searches. She said that despite her struggles with the NAS, she continued to be dissatisfied with the number of women who are elected each year, and called it [...] "the saddest part of [...] life". Rubin was Jewish, and saw no conflict between science and religion. In an interview, she stated: [...] "In my own life, my science and <b>my</b> <b>religion</b> are separate. I'm Jewish, and so religion to me is a kind of moral code and a kind of history. I try to do my science in a moral way, and, I believe that, ideally, science should be looked upon as something that helps us understand our role in the universe." ...|$|E
500|$|Livingstone {{describes}} himself as a socialist. In 1987, he stated that [...] "politics is <b>my</b> <b>religion.</b> It's my moral framework. I believe a socialist society is inherently the best thing, and that's like an act of faith." [...] In 2007, he stated that [...] "I still believe one day that the idea that the main means of production are owned by private individuals... will be considered as anti-democratic as the idea serfs could be tied to the land. But I will not be alive when that day comes." [...] Livingstone had always worked towards a unified socialist front on the British left, and disliked the tendency towards splintering and forming rival factions, usually over issues of political theory, among the socialist community. Although rejecting Marxism, throughout his political career he has worked alongside Marxist far-left groups and has become involved with the [...] "politics of the street". He has not worked with those Marxist groups, such as the Socialist Workers Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party, who advocate the destruction of the Labour Party as the way forward for socialism, seeing their beliefs as incompatible with his own. Livingstone has consistently opposed the actions of the Israeli government. In a 2005 interview {{he said that he was}} not against the existence of Israel, but rather Ariel Sharon's government; he recalled that on his 1986 visit to the country he got on well with its left-wing politicians.|$|E
