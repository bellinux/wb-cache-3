40|$|Abstract Objectives: This {{retrospective}} study examines the differences of the fibrotic stage of sarcoidosis with idiopathic interstitial fibrosis using High-resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT), imaging features and quantification of the severity {{and extent of}} the disease. Methods: 81 patients with biopsy diagnosed pulmonary sarcoidosis and 81 patients with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) were included. All underwent HRCT scan. Findings were evaluated per lung lobe. The severity of disease was quantified per feature and overall with the Gay-Watters score. Results: Respectively, the two groups recorded: 52 (64. 20 %) vs 60 (74. 07 %) presented a reticular pattern, 62 (76. 54 %) vs 74 (91. 36 %) thickened septal lines, 24 (29. 63 %) vs 56 (69. 14 %) honeycomb pattern, 52 (64. 20 %) vs 43 (53. 09 %) ground glass attenuation, 7 (8. 64 %) vs 27 (33. 33 %) ground glass with traction bronchiectasis, 47 (59, 26 %) vs 25 (30. 86 %) <b>micronodular</b> <b>pattern,</b> 48 (60, 49 %) vs 1 (1. 23 %) hilar / mediastinal lymph node enlargement. The <b>micronodular</b> <b>pattern</b> showed a statistically significant association with sarcoidosis (p = 0. 03), whereas ground glass opacities associated with bronchiectasis was statistically significant for UIP (p = 0. 0021). Honeycomb was statistically significant for UIP (P = 0. 0037). Lymph node enlargement was associated with sarcoidosis (p = 0. 0001).

40|$|Aims: Antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} (APS) is {{a systemic}} autoimmune disorder characterized by vascular thrombosis. Pulmonary changes regarding interstitium and airways {{have not been}} described in APS. Our aim {{was to determine the}} prevalence of nonthrombotic pulmonary CT manifestations in patients with APS. Study Design: Prospective study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Pneumonology, First Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Cardiology, Department of Radiology Medicine, between June 2009 and May 2011. Methodology: Ten patients who met criteria for APS (5 primary and 5 secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus) were prospectively identified. All patients underwent chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and functional assessment including spirometry and 6 -minute walking distance. Patients were free of respiratory symptoms. HRCT scans were evaluated for presence of air-trapping, subpleural reticular pattern, centrilobular nodules of ground-glass opacity, cysts, emphysema, atelectasis, consolidation and pleural effusion. Extent of air-trapping was estimated based on a HRCT scoring system. Results: All patients exhibited radiological and functional pattern compatible with smallairway disease, irrespective of smoking status. HRCT findings were negatively correlated with reduced levels of maximum midexepiratory flow (MMEF) 25 / 75 %pred (r=- 0. 936, p< 0. 0001). Subpleural basal reticular pattern consistent with fibrosis was seen in 3 patients. Thin-walled cysts and upper-lobe hazy <b>micronodular</b> <b>pattern</b> were detected in 4 patients. Conclusion: CT findings of patients with APS may include air-trapping, subpleural reticular pattern, centrilobular nodules of ground-glass opacity and lung cysts irrespective of smoking history and SLE coexistence. HRCT and functional assessment may be valuable tools in evaluating APS patients...|$|E

40|$|The enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, {{the most}} {{frequent}} endocrine cells of the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach, are under the trophic stimulus of gastrin. These cells undergo a hyperplastic increase in variety of hypergastrinemic diseases. The most widely accepted nomenclature for the description of hyperplastic proliferation has been retrospectively arranged in a sequence presumed to reflect a temporal evolution of the proliferative process. A comparative, prospective study aimed to verify, in human hypergastrinemic diseases such as atrophic body gastritis (ABG), Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) and antral gastrin cell hyperfunction (AGCH), the effect of exposure of ECL cells to different pattern of gastrin hypersecretion, is lacking. To this purpose, we studied a series of consecutive patients with ABG, ZES and AGCH {{at the time of}} first diagnosis. Material and Methods: The patients included in this study (124 ABG, 18 ZES and 10 AGCH) were {{selected on the basis of}} two previously performed screening studies aimed to diagnose these diseases. All patients at the time of diagnosis underwent gastroscopy, with multiple biopsies of the gastric body mucosa for the evaluation of qualitative pattern of ECL cells hyperplasia, and basal fasting gastrin determination. A sample of hypergastrinemic patients from each group was further investigated by meal-stimulation of gastrin secretion and quantitative morphometry for CgA positive gastric body endocrine cells. Results: AGCH patients showed only the normal or simple hyperplasia pattern. In the ZES group, simple and linear grades accounted for 38. 4 percent and 46. 1 percent, respectively. MEN-I patients showed only these two patterns. The majority of ABG patients showed the presence of <b>micronodular</b> <b>pattern</b> (59. 7 percent). A correlation analysis between fasting gastrin levels and grade of hyperplasia (r = 0. 5580, p < 0. 0001), indicates that the greater the gastrin levels, the higher is the degree of severity of ECL hyperplasia pattern. In conclusion, our data support the role of gastrin as the selective contributor to the progression of ECL cell hyperplasia in humans...|$|E

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. Gray {{scale and}} power Doppler {{sonography}} {{are commonly used}} to evaluate cervical lymph nodes. This study was undertaken to identify which of the features used in ultrasound of cervical lymph nodes is readily applicable in routine clinical practice. METHODS. Two hundred and eight-six patients diagnosed with cervical lymphadenopathy {{were included in the}} study. The largest node in each patient was included in the study {{and the nature of the}} node was assessed by fine-needle aspiration cytology. Lymph nodes were assessed for their gray scale and Doppler sonographic features. RESULTS. Metastatic, lymphomatous, and tuberculous nodes were round (63 – 94 %) and without echogenic hilus (57 – 91 %). Sharp borders were found in metastatic and lymphomatous nodes (56 – 100 %), but uncommon in tuberculosis (49 %). Capsular or mixed vascularity is common in metastatic, lymphomatous, and tuberculous nodes but not found in reactive nodes. Except metastatic nodes from papillary carcinoma of the thyroid that showed low resistance, metastatic nodes had a higher vascular resistance than reactive nodes. <b>Micronodular</b> echo <b>pattern</b> is common in lymphomatous nodes. Hyperechogenicity and punctate calcification are typical features for metastatic nodes from papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Intranodal cystic necrosis, adjacent soft tissue edema, matting and displaced hilar vascularity are common features in tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS. Using gray scale and power Doppler sonography, metastatic, lymphomatous, and tuberculous nodes can be differentiated from reactive nodes. Metastatic nodes from papillary carcinoma, lymphoma, and tuberculosis can be identified. However, it is difficult to differentiate metastatic nodes from squamous cell carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and infraclavicular carcinomas, and differentiate metastatic nodes (nonthyroid primary) from tuberculous lymphadenitis.

40|$|Thesis (M. Med. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2006. Infiltrative {{morphological}} mimicry {{at sites}} of biopsy-proven nodular {{basal cell carcinoma}} has been described. The immunoprofile of scar BCCs (scar BCCs,SBCCs) has not been documented. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the histopathological spectrum, stromal (fibronectin, laminin, actin, desmin and vimentin) response and proliferation (bcl- 2, MIB 1 and p 53) status of SBCCs. Twenty nine BCCs occurring in scars, unrelated to previous malignancy (de novo scar BCCS, DN-SBCCs), 27 BCCs that were incompletely excised and regrew at the same site (regrowth scar BCCs, RG-SBCCs) and 25 BCCs that were completely excised with tumour free margins, but recurred at the same site (recurrent scar BCCs, R-SBCCs) were accessed from the files of the Department of Pathology and Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the Faculty of Medicine, University of KwaZulu Natal, and formed the basis of this study. The morphological features of DN-SBCCs was pure (3 %), predominantly nodular (79 %), micronodular (7 %) and infiltrative (11 %). RG-SBCCs were predominantly nodular (82 %), micronodular (7 %) and infiltrative (11 %). RSBCCs were predominantly nodular (80 %), micronodular (4 %) and infiltrative (16 %). The majority of DN-SBCCs, RG-SBCCs and R-SBCCs showed intact basement membrane laminin staining, while two (7 %) DN-SBCCs showed 1 + and 2 + loss of basement membrane laminin staining. Three (11 %) and two (8 %) RG-SBCCs and R-SBCCs,respectively, showed 2 + or 3 + basement membrane laminin discontinuity. The majority of DN-SBCCs (83 %), RGSBCCs (75 %) and R-SBCCs (88 %) were actin negative. No desmin immunopositivity was demonstrated in the epithelial or stromal components of DN-SBCCs, RG-SBCCs and R-SBCCs. All BCC groups showed high 3 + or 4 + vimentin immunopositivity. The majority (> 50 %) of the SBCCs showed low (2 +) bcl- 2 immunopositivity. There was no significant difference in p 53 immunopositivity in all SBCCs. SBCCs demonstrate phenotypic and immunophenotypic heterogeneity. That DN-SBCCs with the infiltrative and <b>micronodular</b> <b>patterns</b> have not recurred implies that the histomorphology is a pseudo-aggressive pattern. A similar view could pertain to RG-SBCCs, but because the scar did not cicatrise the incompletely excised BCC implies that the histomorphology of RG-BCC may be a potentially more aggressive phenotype. The recurrence of a completely excised basal cell carcinoma may be viewed as a feature of an aggressive tumour, especially when the recurrent BCC contains micronodular and infiltrative components. However, as most R-SBCCs occurred at head and neck sites that are exposed to ultraviolet light, it is also possible that these are simply new BCCs occurring within scars in head and neck sites prone to BCCs. Furthermore, these R-SBCCs were not destructive tumours. CONCLUSION: None of the infiltrative foci of DN-SBCCs demonstrated laminin loss. Three of 5 with intra-epithelial actin immunopositivity also demonstrated low bcl- 2 and high p 53 staining, immunoprofiling these with an aggressive infiltrative component. Of 11 RG-SBCCs with high p 53 staining, 4 had high p 53 staining in the infiltrative component, but only one had a low bcl- 2 composite score and low bcl- 2 score in the infiltrative focus. In addition, these infiltrative foci demonstrated intraepithelial MSA positivity and a "VA" immunophenotype of the stromal cells, indicating one RG-SBCC with an established, aggressive immunophenotype. Those positive with one or more, but not all, aggressive immunostains, are hypothesised to be RG-SBCCs evolving/developing an aggressive immunophenotype. Only one R-SBCC, with a predominantly infiltrative pattern, had a "full-house" of aggressive immunostaining in the infiltrative foci: low bcl- 2, high p 53, 2 + laminin discontinuity and intra-epithelial and stromal MSA positivity. Of significance is that 7 with a predominant nodular pattern had a high p 53 score. Of these, 5 had high bcl- 2 scores. Hence, while high p 53 may be a feature of aggressive growth, it is important that this staining be complemented with that of bcl- 2, laminin and MSA...|$|R
