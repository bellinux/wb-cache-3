In this paper, we develop a novel SOAP engine called SOAPExpress, which adopts two key techniques for improving processing performance: SCTP data transport and dynamic early binding based data mapping. Experimental results show a significant and consistent performance improvement of SOAPExpress over Apache Axis...|$|E

This topology {{consists of a}} MOSFET transistor positioned underneath an integrated inductor with both elements placed on the same silicon die so as to form a three-dimensional integrated structure. The advantage of this structure is that it uses the vacant area underneath the inductor so as to minimize the actual surface it occupies and <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> more economic and area efficient for analog integrated circuit design...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{design and}} {{engineering}} of original cryptographic solutions {{is a major}} concern to provide secure information systems. In a previous study, we have described a generator based on chaotic iterations, which uses the well-known XORshift generator. By doing so, we have improved the statistical performances of XORshift and make it behave chaotically, as defined by Devaney. The speed and security of this former generator have been improved in a second study, to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> more relevant in the Internet security context. In this paper, these contributions are summarized and {{a new version of the}} generator is introduced. It is based on a new Lookup Table implying a large improvement of speed. A comparison and a security analysis between the XORshift and these three versions of our generator are proposed, and various new statistical results are given. Finally, an application in the information hiding framework is presented, to give an illustrative example of the use of such a generator in the Internet security field...|$|E
40|$|Automatic {{dependency}} {{analysis is}} a useful addition to a system like CM, our compilation manager for Standard ML of New Jersey. It relieves the programmer from the tedious and error-prone task of having to specify compilation dependencies by hand and thereby <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> more user friendly. But dependency analysis is not easy, as the general problem for Standard ML is NPcomplete. Therefore, CM has to impose certain restrictions on the programming language to recover tractability. We prove the NP-completeness result, discuss the restrictions on ML that are used by CM, and provide the resulting analysis algorithms...|$|R
40|$|International audienceData are {{traditionally}} represented using native format such as integer or floating-point numbers in various flavor. However, some applications rely on more complex representation format. This {{is the case}} when uncertainty needs to be apprehended. Fuzzy arithmetic {{is one of the}} major tools to address this problem, but the execution time of basic operations such as addition or multiplication <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> prohibitive. In this article, thanks to a new representation format and modern GPU characteristics we show that it is possible to greatly reduce the execution time of those operations. These techniques have been implemented in fuzzyGPU, a freely distributed library of common operations over fuzzy number...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{core of a}} {{cooperative}} game {{on a set of}} players N {{is one of the most}} popular concepts of solution. When cooperation is restricted (feasible coalitions form a subcollection of 2 ^N), the core may become unbounded, which <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> questionable in practice. Our proposal is to make the core bounded by turning some of the inequalities defining the core into equalities (additional efficiency constraints). We address the following mathematical problem: can we find a minimal set of inequalities in the core such that, if turned into equalities, the core becomes bounded? The new core obtained is called the restricted core. We completely solve the question when is a distributive lattice, introducing also the notion of restricted Weber set. We show that the case of regular set systems amounts more or less to the case of distributive lattices. We also study the case of weakly union-closed systems and give some results for the general case...|$|R

Our goal is to enable rapid creation of various body models that are immediately usable for animation. In doing so, we aim to carry out realistic deformations on the human body models as well as <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> simple. Our system is composed of several modules: (1) Skin attachment to an H-Anim skeleton is carried out first {{in order to get}} deformation in skeletal shape modification as well as in animation. (2) Volumetric deformation module deals with the volumetric scale of body parts such as breast, belly and bottoms. These deformation operators, together with the skeletal deformation allow the automatic adaptation of the body model to different sizes and proportions to accommodate anthropometrical variations. (3) Surface optimization is used to simplify the model in consideration of not only geometric features but also the animation aspect of it. (4) Finally, the BDP generation module describes the geometry of the model as well as how to animate it according to the MPEG- 4 BDP specifications...|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of the CMS computing system requires a complex monitoring system to cover all its aspects: central services, databases, the distributed computing infrastructure, production and analysis workflows, the global overview of the CMS computing activities and the related historical information. Several tools are available to provide this information, developed {{both inside and outside}} of the collaboration and often used in common with other experiments. Despite the fact that the current monitoring allowed CMS to successfully perform its computing operations, an evolution of the system is clearly required, to adapt to the recent changes in the data and workload management tools and models and to address some shortcomings that <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> less than optimal. Therefore, a recent and ongoing coordinated effort was started in CMS, aiming at improving the entire monitoring system by identifying its weaknesses and the new requirements from the stakeholders, rationalise and streamline existing components and drive future software development. This contribution gives a complete overview of the CMS monitoring system and a description of all the recent activities that have been started with the goal of providing a more integrated, modern and functional global monitoring system for computing operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of sustainable chemical processes is a long-standing challenge. Carbon dioxide represents a renewable C 1 building block for organic synthesis and industrial applications {{as an alternative}} to other common feedstocks which are based on natural gas, petroleum oil, or coal. Apart from the advantages associated with the nontoxicity and abundance of CO 2, its utilization further enables the reduction in its atmospheric content, which contributes significantly to the greenhouse effect. Although widespread application of CO 2 in organic synthesis - even on an industrial scale - {{will not be able to}} fully compensate for the steadily increasing atmospheric quantities produced (mainly by the combustion of fuels), ecological and economical factors <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> highly desirable. Therefore, tremendous efforts toward activation and utilization of CO 2 have been made by the scientific community over the last 30 years, and, as a result, the number of highly efficient transition metal-catalyzed CO 2 -incorporative reactions has increased dramatically, especially within the last decade. The achievements in the {{development of}} sustainable and economic chemical processes for the carboxylation of organic molecules with CO 2 are presented in detail in this chapter...|$|E
40|$|In mobile robotics, {{the ability}} to acquire {{three-dimensional}} information from an environment and to have color information about surrounding objects makes the robot vision system more suitable for complex tasks such as environment modeling. We present a simple 3 -D color-range scanner- CRS, which is able to capture the geometry and color of the measured object. The CRS utilizes a scanning laser sheet and the triangulation principle to acquire the geometry of the measured object. The pro-jected laser stripe is detected using a matrix array pixel processor MAPP 2200, which makes the scan-ner system compact and {{eliminates the need for}} any additional signal processing hardware. The color values for each 3 -D point are acquired using a standard color CCD camera. For accurate range measurements and color value acquisition the physical geometry of the scanning system has to be de-termined and camera-to-camera calibration made between MAPP 2200 and CCD camera. In-house camera calibration toolbox for MATLAB is used for both of these tasks. To maximize portability the CRS is connected to the RS- 232 port of the host computer and can be easily controlled by using simple ASCII commands. Among other sensors CRS is a part of our distributed robotics architecture and it can be controlled using CORBA interface, which <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> effortless in various applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{translation}} of research findings from laboratory to agricultural fields {{is essential for}} the success of biocontrol or growth promotion trials employing beneficial microorganisms. The rhizosphere is to be viewed holistically as a dynamic ecological niche comprising of diverse microorganisms including competitors and noxious antagonists to the bio-inoculant. This study was undertaken to assess the effects due to the soil application of an endophytic bacterium with multiple pathogen antagonistic potential on native bacterial community and its sustenance in agricultural soil. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was employed as a model system considering its frequent isolation as an endophyte, wide antagonistic effects reported against different phytopathogens and soil pests, and that the species is a known human pathogen which <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> in agriculture precarious. Employing the strain ‘GNS. 13. 2 a’ from banana, its survival in field soil and the effects upon soil inoculation were investigated by monitoring total culturable bacterial fraction as the representative indicator of soil microbial community. Serial dilution plating of uninoculated control versus P. aeruginosa inoculated soil from banana rhizosphere indicated a significant reduction in native bacterial cfu soon after inoculation compared with control soil as assessed on cetrimide- nalidixic acid selective medium against nutrient agar. Sampling on day- 4 showed a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa cfu in inoculated soil and a continuous dip thereafter registering > 99 % reduction within one week while the native bacterial population resurged with cfu restoration on par with control. This was validated in contained trials with banana plants. Conversely, P. aeruginosa showed static cfu or proliferation in axenic-soil. Lateral introduction of soil microbiome in P. aeruginosa established soil under axenic conditions or its co-incubation with soil microbiota in suspension indicated significant adverse effects by native microbial community. Direct agar-plate challenge assays with individual environmental bacterial isolates displayed varying interactive or antagonistic effects. In effect, the application of P. aeruginosa in rhizospheric soil did not serve any net benefit in terms of sustained survival. Conversely, it caused a disturbance to the native soil bacterial community. The findings highlight the need for monitoring the bio-inoculant(s) in field-soil and assessing the interactive effects with native microbial community before commercial recommendation...|$|R
30|$|There {{are roughly}} {{two ways to}} {{minimize}} the ohmic loss surging at lower operating temperatures. One {{is to reduce the}} thickness of the electrolyte, and the other is to synthesize materials with higher ionic conductivities. First, the strategy to reduce in electrolyte thickness has been carried out by many research groups [6 – 10]. Shim et al. demonstrated that a fuel cell employing a 40 -nm-thick yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) can generate a power density of 270 mW/cm 2 at 350 °C [11], while Kerman et al. demonstrated 1, 037 mW/cm 2 at 500 °C from a 100 -nm-thick YSZ-based fuel cell [12]. Another approach of minimizing ohmic loss is using electrolytes with higher ionic conductivities. Gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) has been considered as a promising electrolyte material due to its excellent oxygen ion conductivity at low temperatures [13, 14]. However, the tendency of GDC being easily reduced at low oxygen partial pressures <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> as a fuel-cell electrolyte less attractive because the material will have a higher electronic conductivity as it is reduced. For this reason, many studies have been performed to prevent electronic conduction through GDC film by placing an electron-blocking layer in the series [15 – 17]. Liu et al. demonstrated the electron-blocking effect of a 3 -μm-thick YSZ layer in a thin-film fuel cell with a GDC/YSZ bilayered electrolyte [18]. If the GDC electrolyte thickness was reduced down to a few microns, another problem emerges, i.e., oxygen gas from the cathode side starts to permeate through the thin GDC electrolyte [13, 19]. For the reasons mentioned, the application of a protective layer is essential for GDC-based thin-film fuel cells. Recently, Myung et al. demonstrated that a thin-film fuel cell having a 100 -nm-thick YSZ layer deposited by pulsed laser deposition onto a 1.4 -μm-thick GDC layer actually prevented both the reduction of ceria at low oxygen partial pressures and oxygen permeation across the GDC thin layer [20]. For the development of large-scale thin-film fuel cells, an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template has been considered as their substrate due to its high scalability potential. However, commercially available AAO templates have a considerably rough surface unlike silicon-based substrates, which have been used for conventional thin-film fuel cells. For this reason, atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was employed to deposit a highly conformal and dense YSZ layer to minimize uncontrolled pinholes and/or morphological irregularities.|$|R
40|$|High Performance Computing (HPC) {{clouds are}} {{becoming}} {{an alternative to}} on-premise clusters for executing scientific applications and business analytics services. Most research efforts in HPC cloud aim to understand the cost-benefit of moving resource-intensive applications from on-premise environments to public cloud platforms. Industry trends show hybrid environments are the natural path {{to get the best}} of the on-premise and cloud resources [...] -steady (and sensitive) workloads can run on on-premise resources and peak demand can leverage remote resources in a pay-as-you-go manner. Nevertheless, there are plenty of questions to be answered in HPC cloud, which range from how to extract the best performance of an unknown underlying platform to what services are essential to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> easier. Moreover, the discussion on the right pricing and contractual models to fit small and large users is relevant for the sustainability of HPC clouds. This paper brings a survey and taxonomy of efforts in HPC cloud and a vision on what we believe is ahead of us, including a set of research challenges that, once tackled, can help advance businesses and scientific discoveries.

40|$|Quantifiable data {{produced}} {{in a national}} report by the Environment Agency of England and Wales entitled ‘Water pollution incidents in England and Wales 1997 ’ and published by the Stationery Office in 1998, identifies that of over 3, 723 substantiated pollution incidents across England and Wales in 1997. Within the generic sector classed as ‘Industry’ the construction industry was the most frequent polluter responsible for 22 % of all substantiated water-related pollution incidents in that sector. The report also identified {{that a significant number}} (28 %) of all substantiated pollution incidents across England and Wales are directly attributable to mineral-based fuels and oils many of which are used extensively within the construction industry. This paper seeks to locate the possible causes and effects for some of that oil-based pollution, discuss the issues and identifies a unique and radical Client-motivated solution within the UK to reduce and mitigate the undesirable impacts upon the environment. Evidence produced by the oil industry shows the enormous amount of one particularly aggressive pollutant –hydraulic oil, – which remains annually, unaccounted for. Hydraulic oil is used in most tracked earthmoving machinery; the sort of machinery most closely associated with construction work carried out near to watercourses. Biodegradable hydraulic oil is much more considerate to the environment, but is more expensive and not usually installed in new plant and machinery. The paper argues that on a life cycle basis the use of biodegradable oil is viable and feasible and that there are many external factors that <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> desirable...|$|E
40|$|Model {{checking}} {{has become}} a widely adopted approach for the verification of hardware designs. The ever increasing complexity of these designs creates a continuous need for faster model checkers {{that are capable of}} verifying designs within reasonable time frames to reduce time to market. IC 3, the recently developed, very successful algorithm for model checking safety properties, introduced a new approach to model checking: incremental, inductive verification (IIV). The IIV approach possesses several attractive traits, such as stability and not relying on high-effort reasoning, that <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>usage</b> in model checking very appealing, which motivated the development of another algorithm that follows the IIV approach for model checking ω-regular languages. The algorithm, Fair, {{has been shown to be}} capable of dealing with designs beyond the reach of its predecessors. This thesis explores IIV as a promising approach to model checking. After identifying IIV 2 ̆ 7 s main elements, the thesis presents an IIV-based model checking algorithm for CTL: the first practical SAT-based algorithm for branching time properties. The algorithm, IICTL, is shown to complement state-of-the-art BDD-based CTL algorithms on a large set of benchmarks. In addition to fulfilling the need for a SAT-based CTL algorithm, IICTL highlights ways in which IIV algorithms can be improved; one of these ways is addressing counterexamples to generalization, which is explored in the context of IC 3 and is shown to improve the algorithm 2 ̆ 7 s performance considerably. The thesis then addresses an important question: for properties that fall into the scope of more than one IIV algorithm, do these algorithms behave identically? The question is answered negatively, pointing out that the IIV framework admits multiple strategies and that there is a wide spectrum of possible algorithms that all follow the IIV approach. For example, all properties in the common fragment of LTL and CTL—an important class of properties—can be checked with Fair and IICTL. However, empirical evidence presented in the thesis suggests that neither algorithm is always superior to the other, which points out the importance of being flexible in deciding the strategy to apply to a given problem...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of tiles or blocks {{in mathematics and}} thus computer science cannot be overstated. From a high level point of view, they are the natural way to express many algorithms, both in iterative and recursive forms. Tiles or sub-tiles are used as basic units in the algorithm description. From a low level point of view, tiling, either as the unit maintained by the algorithm, or as a class of data layouts, {{is one of the}} most effective ways to exploit locality, which is a must to achieve good performance in current computers given the growing gap between memory and processor speed. Finally, tiles and operations on them are also basic to express data distribution and parallelism. Despite the {{importance of}} this concept, which <b>makes</b> inevitable <b>its</b> widespread <b>usage,</b> most languages do not support it directly. Programmers have to understand and manage the low-level details along with the introduction of tiling. This gives place to bloated potentially error-prone programs in which opportunities for performance are lost. On the other hand, the disparity between the algorithm and the actual implementation enlarges. This thesis illustrates the power of Hierarchically Tiled Arrays (HTAs), a data type whic...|$|R
