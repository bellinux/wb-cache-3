5000|$|Buck Hill {{was named}} in the 1960s by Clearwater sheep rancher and guide, Ida DeKelver, for the {{numerous}} deer in the region. Emil and Ida DeKelver arrived in the Clearwater Valley in 1959 and settled on an 80-acre farm beside Candle Creek. At first, the DeKelvers raised dairy cattle. In 1962, they purchased a Trophy <b>Mountain</b> <b>grazing</b> lease and 100 ewes and rams from the Ronacher brothers. They soon expanded the herd to 300 and were very successful with the lush Trophy meadows. Their trail to the alpine followed Third Canyon Creek and passed just south of Buck Hill. Each spring and fall, it took three days to move their herd between the farm and the meadows. In 1969, mounting government pressure against grazing lease-holders persuaded the DeKelvers to switch to guiding and trail-riding on Trophy Mountain. They built a new trail up Spahats Creek which was much shorter than the Third Canyon route, although strenuous compared to today’s stroll to the meadows. When logging started on Trophy Mountain in 1979 and roads were built almost to treeline, the DeKelvers’ business was ruined and they retired to their Candle Creek farm. Ida DeKelver became the unofficial historian of the Clearwater Valley and created the Yellowhead Museum (now closed).|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} the carbon sequestration issue calls the researchers to investigate if the agri-environmental support (AES) to extensive <b>mountain</b> <b>grazing</b> granted under Regulations 2078 / 92, 1257 / 99 and 1698 / 2005 is still efficient. AES {{may have contributed to}} the maintenance of low carbon stocks in extensive grazing areas, which might otherwise have been abandoned and revegetated by species that assist carbon sequestration. We evaluate benefits and costs of supporting the maintenance of pastureland through cattle grazing in an Italian Alpine pasture for 2004. We focus on three non-commodity outputs of Alpine grazing –landscape-recreation amenities, carbon sequestration and contribution to economic vitality of the area- and three groups of agents: visitors, local community and EU households. The efficiency of supporting <b>mountain</b> <b>grazing</b> is demonstrated by a net benefit of euro 228, 613. Landscape-recreational benefits are the key variable, as their value (euro 205, 377) is large enough to justify the grazing activity and the related support. The value of carbon sequestration achievable with reforestation (euro 62, 491) could not compensate the loss in tourism benefits. Net beneficiaries of the agri-environmental policy are not the farmers but the visitors and the local community. Transforming of the intangible goods (both landscape-recreational amenities and carbon sequestration) into tangible ones would favour the local community. The overall convenience of supporting the maintenance of Alpine pastureland through cattle grazing depends on the number and the types of benefits and costs we consider. When a complete evaluation of all the benefit and cost flow is impossible or when an aspect, previously considered as irrelevant, suddenly increases its importance (such in the case of carbon sequestration), an approach inspired by the precautionary principle is absolutely necessary and wise. agri-environmental support, <b>mountain</b> <b>grazing,</b> carbon sequestration, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E

The Herger Feinstein Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery Act of 1997 (H.R. 858 and S. 1028) was aimed at reducing fire hazard by implementing defensive fuel profile zones (DFPZs), the creation of which would ideally result in a steady supply timber to mills, more jobs, and increased revenues to the local community.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to examine how supplements of rapeseed oil or palm oil fatty acids would affect milk production and composition, body lipid stores, and energy balance in 30 multiparous goats of Norwegian dairy goat breed. The experiment lasted 230 d, with 1 to 120 d in milk (DIM) for indoor feeding (P 1), 120 to 200 DIM for <b>mountain</b> <b>grazing</b> (P 2), and 200 to 230 DIM for indoor feeding (P 3). Grass silage was fed according to appetite during indoor feeding periods. After an adjustment period (1 - 60 DIM) when the control diet {{was given to the}} goats, the animals were subdivided into 3 groups of 10 goats. Treatments (60 - 230 DIM) were (1) basal concentrate (control; no added fat); (2) control concentrate with 8 % (added on air-dry basis) hydrogenated palm oil enriched with palmitic acid (POFA); and (3) control concentrate with 8 % (added on air-dry basis) rapeseed oil (RSO). Individual energy balances based on energy intake and milk production were estimated on 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 200, and 230 DIM. At the same times, body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), body mass index, and body tissue stores using computed tomography were monitored. Silage intake was depressed by POFA throughout the experimental period. Reduced BW and body mass index were observed in the POFA and RSO groups, whereas no effect on BCS or body composition was observed throughout lactation. Generally, a minor decrease in BW was observed from 10 to 120 DIM (only 0. 6 kg on average) and the total amount of body lipid was reduced by 4. 4 kg. During the <b>mountain</b> <b>grazing</b> period, a further reduction in body lipid stores (2. 7 kg) was observed, and BW was reduced by 3. 9 kg in the same period. The goats mobilized, on average, 72 % of their fat reserves during the first 200 DIM. In this period, dietary fat supplementation did not reduce the mobilization of adipose tissue but resulted in greater milk fat yield (2 kg more, on average, compared with the control group). Milk yield was not affected by POFA or RSO supplementation. Milk fat content was higher in the POFA group than in the control and RSO groups. Milk protein and lactose contents were not affected by lipid supplements. In late lactation, a rapid accumulation of fat deposits followed the intense mobilization during the grazing period. Dietary lipid supplements had no effect on milk fat yield at this stage. Milk production depends heavily on the ability to mobilize body lipid stores, and neither POFA nor RSO supplements at rates used in our study affected this mobilization...|$|E
40|$|Coyotes (Canis latrans) prey upon {{domestic}} sheep. The Animal Damage Control (ADC) program currently {{relies heavily}} on aerial gunning in winter to control coyote depredations on <b>mountain</b> <b>grazing</b> allotments. Some people claim that winter aerial gunning is not effective because coyotes migrate to lower elevations during winter, following herds of big game animals, {{and may not be}} on the allotments where summer depredations occur. I studied the seasonal movement patterns of coyotes in the Bear River Range of Utah and Idaho to determine if coyotes in montane habitats move on a seasonal basis. Radio-collared coyotes were located from fixed-wing aircraft from 13 November 1987 to 15 September 1989. I used 3 parameters to assess interseasonal movement patterns: overlap in seasonal home ranges, distance between harmonic mean centers of activity, and seasonal differences in mean elevation. All mature coyotes showed overlapping seasonal home ranges, which suggests they did not move substantially between seasons. In contrast, none of the sub-adult coyotes had seasonal home ranges that overlapped. Distances between harmonic centers of seasonal activity were easily assigned to one of two groups (≤ 5000 m and ≤ 10, 000 m). These corresponded precisely with coyotes that did and did not display overlap in seasonal home ranges. Significant changes in the elevations of seasonal locations were not evident for any age or sex group. I conclude (1) that movement of sub-adult coyotes in the Bear River Range is part of dispersal behavior and is not motivated by seasonal change and (2) that these sub-adult coyotes generally cease wandering during their second years. My findings are similar to other studies where nomadic wandering was more common among sub-adult coyotes and was not correlated with season. I saw no movement of coyotes from the mountains to valley locations. Adult coyotes were in the same location in summer as in winter...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the alpine}} {{zone of the}} Snowy <b>Mountains,</b> <b>grazing</b> by mammals is limited. However, {{introduced}} European hare numbers have increased since the 1970 s. Aims: To estimate the density of hares and hence grazing pressure among years. To assess the response of biomass, vegetation height and composition to a cessation of hare grazing. Methods: We used indices of hare abundance based on spotlighting and counts of hare pellets on a transect. The effect of hare grazing on tall alpine herbfield was assessed by using 15 paired exclosure and control quadrats for six years. Results: The indices of hare abundance suggested densities {{similar to those in}} upland areas of Britain. Grazing did not affect the composition, cover of herbs or graminoids or, for 2010, vegetation height or biomass. Variation in vegetation and hare numbers among years was not correlated with climatic variables. Observations of selective grazing suggested that impacts on vegetation may be localised and restricted to certain species. Prior analyses of hare pellets indicated that hares might spread seed of native and exotic species. Conclusions: Hares are having no general effect on tall alpine herbfield but may affect certain plant species via selective grazing or by spread of viable seed. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effect of grazing on {{mountain}} (M) versus cultivated lowland pasture (C) on the performance and meat quality of suckling calves (Experiment 1 and 2). In addition, the effect of finishing on C after M on growth and meat quality was assessed (Experiment 2). Animals on C and M had on average similar live weight gain and carcass weight in the first experiment. However, the performance depended on year as gain and carcass weight was higher on C than on M in the first year and vice versa in the second year. In the second experiment the calves on M had lower gain and carcass weight than on C. Three week finishing on C after M compensated to some extent for the lower growth rate on M. Overall, the results indicate that <b>mountain</b> <b>grazing</b> may yield similar growth rates and slaughter weights as improved lowland pasture depending on year. There were only small effects of pasture type on carcass and meat quality traits like conformation, fatness, intramuscular fat and protein content, and fatty acid (FA) composition. The variation in FA composition could to a large extent be explained by difference in fatness with increase in monounsaturated and decrease in polyunsaturated FA with increasing intramuscular fat content, in turn varying between pasture type, experiment and year. There was a tendency that M led to higher proportion of C 18 : 1 n- 9 and lower proportion of C 18 : 1 n- 7 than C, which may be due to difference in milk and forage intake.

40|$|To {{provide further}} {{insights}} into ruminant lipid digestion and metabolism, and into cis 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 synthesis, 12 growing Engadine lambs grazing either mountain pasture (2, 250 m above sea level; n = 6) or lowland pasture (400 m above sea level; n = 6) were studied. Both pastures consisted exclusively of C- 3 plants. Before the experiment, all animals grazed a common pasture for 6 wk. Grasses and perirenal adipose tissues {{of the sheep}} were analyzed for fatty acids by gas chromatography. Stable C-isotope ratios (delta C- 13 values in % vs. the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard) were determined in the composite samples by elemental analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The delta C- 13 of the individual fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The delta C- 13 value of the entire mountain pasture grass was - 27. 5 % (SD 0. 31), whereas that of the lowland pasture grass was - 30. 0 % (SD 0. 07). This difference {{was reflected in the}} perirenal adipose tissues of the corresponding sheep (P < 0. 05), even though the delta C- 13 values were less in the animals than in the grass. The delta C- 13 values for cis- 9 16 : 1 and cis- 9 18 : 1 in perirenal fat differed between mountain and lowland lambs (P < 0. 05). The 16 : 0 in the adipose tissue was enriched in C- 13 by 5 % compared with the dietary 16 : 0, likely as a result of partly endogenous synthesis. The d 13 C values of cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 (cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA) in the adipose tissue were smaller than those of its dietary precursors, cis- 9, cis- 12 18 : 2 and cis- 9, cis- 12, cis- 15 18 : 3; conversely, the delta C- 13 values of trans- 11 18 : 1 were not, suggesting that large proportions of perirenal cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 were of endogenous origin and discrimination against C- 13 occurred during Delta(9) -desaturation. The same discrimination was indicated by the isotopic shift between 16 : 0 and cis- 9 16 : 1 in the <b>mountain</b> <b>grazing</b> group. Furthermore, the delta C- 13 values of cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 were smaller relative to the precursor fatty acids in the mountain lambs compared with the lowland group. This result suggests a reduced extent of biohydrogenation in lambs grazing on mountain grass in comparison with those grazing on lowland grass. This was supported by the smaller cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 concentrations in total fatty acids found in the adipose tissues of the lowland lambs (P < 0. 001). The results of this study demonstrate that natural differences between delta C- 13 values of swards from different pastures and the adipose tissue fatty acids could be used as tracers in studies of lipid metabolism in ruminants...|$|E
