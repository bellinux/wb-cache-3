5|$|In 1525, the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés passed {{within a}} few {{kilometres}} of the ruins of Tikal but did not mention them in his letters. After Spanish friar Andrés de Avendaño became lost in the Petén forests in early 1696 he described a ruin that <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Tikal.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare makes {{reference}} to Birnam Wood {{being used as}} camouflage for Malcolm Canmore’s army before the battle at Dunsinane with MacBeth. There is an ancient tree, the Birnam Oak, standing a few hundred metres from the centre of Birnam. It <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> part of Birnam Wood {{at the time of}} the battle 900 years ago, and remains part of the legend.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} some of Tyrannosauruss {{potential}} prey could move quickly, evidence that it walked instead of ran could indicate that it was a scavenger. On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that Tyrannosaurus, while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> fast enough to prey on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians.|$|E

5|$|If the Annals of Inisfallen {{is to be}} believed, Toirdelbach {{acquired}} {{possession of}} Dublin when the Dubliners themselves offered him its kingship. Although this record may be mere Uí Briain propaganda, it could instead reveal that the Dubliners preferred a distant overlord from Munster rather than one from neighbouring Leinster. Within the year, the kingship was held by Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill (died 1075). The latter {{appears to have been}} a kinsman of Echmarcach, and <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> handed the kinship by Toirdelbach, perhaps on account of the considerable distance between the kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau {{was removed}} from {{political}} influence and retired {{to live in the}} Hôtel Saint-Pol with her brother's second wife, Catherine of Alençon. She was accompanied by her ladies-in-waiting Amelie von Orthenburg and Madame de Moy, the latter of whom had traveled from Germany and had stayed with her as dame d'honneur since 1409. Isabeau died there in 1435. Her death and funeral were documented by Jean Chartier (member of St Denis Abbey) who <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an eyewitness.|$|E
5|$|It <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> these Inquisitors who, in 1543, {{decided that}} Mercator was eminent {{enough to be}} sacrificed. His name {{appeared}} {{on a list of}} 52 Lutheran heretics which included an architect, a sculptor, a former rector of the university, a monk, three priests and many others. All were arrested except Mercator who had left Leuven for Rupelmonde on business concerning the estate of his recently deceased uncle Gisbert. That made matters worse for he was now classified as a fugitive who, by fleeing arrest, had proved his own guilt.|$|E

50|$|Still Bankim Chandra's {{achievement}} was great {{and he knew}} that for his story to be accepted by the conservative society around him, he has to make compromises. That compromise <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> his own view, being a neo-conservative advocating changes to the society but none too drastic. In a complimentary way, he thought a woman's job of keeping a home together is more difficult than the challenges of the outside world. Women all across India in the next decades successfully handled their homes and still actively participated in the freedom struggle.|$|R

5|$|The Sicilian {{historian}} Diodorus Siculus, {{writing in}} the 1st century BC in his Bibliotheca Historica, also provides {{an account of the}} Battle of Plataea. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's, but given that it was written much later, it <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> derived from Herodotus's version. The Battle is also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias of Cnidus, and is alluded by other authors, such as the playwright Aeschylus. Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.|$|E
5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the 1940s. It {{began with}} what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5000|$|Although he <b>may</b> very <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> guilty, his {{execution}} surprised some people, {{as he was}} seen as a [...] "flower of chivalry", <b>having</b> acquitted himself <b>well</b> in battle against the Saracens in the past.|$|R

5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. At that time the anti-Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was installed in Salzburg. Conrad came to Salzburg accompanied by his brothers, the counts Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate. Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 and gave him the pallium.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{maintain}} {{that given the}} massive reductions in US military aid to South Vietnam after 1973, any major PAVN offensive was bound to succeed. However, the ARVN's soldiers were hardened veterans, and South Vietnam maintained vast stockpiles of ammunition and equipment (as demonstrated by the massive quantities of war materiel captured by the PAVN when the war ended). The final collapse of the ARVN <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> inevitable, but the end {{would have been much}} bloodier and much longer in coming had the PAVN chosen a more direct, conventional plan of attack. In fact, the most damaging blow of the entire PAVN campaign may have been the crushing psychological blow their skillful and unexpected strategy dealt to the mind of the ARVN's commander-in-chief.|$|E
5|$|Ruler 4 was {{succeeded by}} K'inich Ich'aak Chapat in 723. Around 725 Toniná fought {{a war against}} Piedras Negras, a city on the north bank of the Usumacinta River, now in Guatemala. A series of events during his reign were marked on monuments between 726 and 729 and in 730 he rededicated the tomb of his {{predecessor}} K'inich B'aaknal Chaak. The mother of K'inich Ich'aak Chapat is named as Lady Winik Timan K'awiil and his father <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> K'inich B'aaknal Chaak himself. The reign of K'inich Ich'aak Chapat is notable {{for the absence of}} the usual sculptures depicting bound war captives, although {{the reason for this is}} unknown.|$|E

5|$|Sarah {{was about}} fifteen when Churchill {{returned}} from the Continent in 1675, and {{he appears to have}} been almost immediately captivated by her charms and considerable good looks. Churchill's amorous, almost abject, missives of devotion were, it seems, received with suspicion – his first lover, Barbara Villiers, was just moving her household to Paris, feeding doubts that he <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> looking at Sarah as a replacement mistress rather than a fiancée. However, his persistent courtship over the coming months eventually won over the beautiful, if relatively poor, Maid of Honour. Although Winston wished his son to marry the wealthy Catherine Sedley (if only to ease his own burden of debt), Colonel Churchill married Sarah sometime in the winter of 1677–78, possibly in the apartments of the Duchess of York.|$|E
5|$|The first botanical {{collection}} {{of this species}} <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Claude Riche, naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's 1791 expedition {{in search of the}} lost ships of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. During a visit to Esperance Bay, Riche explored an area in which B.speciosa is extremely common. However, he got lost and was forced to abandon his collections. The species was eventually collected by Robert Brown in 1802, and published by him in 1810. Alex George selected an 1802 specimen collected at Lucky Bay to be the lectotype in 1981. An early common name was handsome banksia. Common names include showy banksia and ricrac banksia, from the zigzag shape of its long thin leaves.|$|E
5|$|The singers are {{accompanied}} by an instrumental group consisting of oboe, bassoon, violin, two violas and basso continuo. As {{in the case of}} the singers, the question arises as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that there <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.|$|E

5|$|Vilhelm Moberg, in {{his history}} of the Swedish people, {{provides}} a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by {{both sides in the}} struggle over the border provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame the peoples' passions to continue the struggle. These lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, Moberg compares the history texts he grew up with in Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by Gustavus Adolphus celebrating the 24Scanian parishes he had helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will, behavior that <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mirrored equally on the Danish side. Skåneland was a rather unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period.|$|E
5|$|While Alvarado was {{consolidating}} {{his power}} in the Ulúa valley, Juan de Chávez's expedition in southern Higueras had met stiff resistance. They had marched up the Naco valley to the Peñol de Cerquín ("Rock of Cerquín"), which had been bypassed by Alvarado on his initial incursion. The Peñol de Cerquín was a formidable rocky butte that had been fortified by the natives. A great number of Indians had amassed at the fortress, which dominated the whole of southern Honduras. The natives were entrenched in the fortress, and determined to resist any Spanish attempt to pass. It is not known who led the indigenous resistance at this time, but it <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Lempira, a war leader who would later distinguish himself against the invading Spanish.|$|E
5|$|Ímar's {{reign in}} Dublin spanned {{at least eight}} years, from 1038 to 1046. Although he began by seizing the kingship from Echmarcach in 1038, he {{eventually}} lost it to him in 1046. As king, Ímar is recorded to have overseen military operations throughout Ireland, and seems to have actively assisted the family of Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, King of Gwynedd overseas in Wales. After Echmarcach's final expulsion from Dublin 1052, Ímar <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reinstalled as King of Dublin by Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster. Whatever the case, Ímar died in 1054. He {{may have been an}} ancestor or close kinsman of Gofraid Crobán, King of Dublin and the Isles, the progenitor of a family that ruled in the Isles until the mid thirteenth century.|$|E
