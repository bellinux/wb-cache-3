40|$|The {{arrangement}} and proportion of collagen fibres and fibre bundles in the dermis of the pig {{have been investigated}} with light microscopical (Nomarski's interference contrast, polarization optics) and scanning electron <b>microscopical</b> methods. Skin <b>samples</b> were obtained from different body regions of wild boars, domestic pigs and miniature pigs. All the methods used have demonstrated {{that the bulk of}} the dermis is dominated by a massive three dimensional network of collagen fibres and fibre bundles, which cross each other in two main directions. Several smaller fibre bundles pass through the network in various other directions, constructing a densely interwoven fibre pattern. Differences were obvious between the body regions and the animals investigated...|$|R
40|$|Diet of the European hare (Lepus europaeus Pallas) {{living on}} a fescue (Festuca novae-zelandiae) {{grassland}} in central high country Canterbury was examined using <b>microscopical</b> gut <b>sample</b> analysis. Availability of food plants was estimated by a monthly vegetation survey. Major dietary items were analysed for calorific value, neutral detergent fibre content (digestibility) and secondary metabolites (phenols, condensed tannins and monomeric tannins). Hares in this area relied heavily on Hieracium pilosella as the major constituent of their diet. Grasses and tussocks made {{up the majority of}} the remaining food. The diet of females, males, juveniles and adults were all significantly different. Diet also varied throughout the year, although it largely reflected the availability of the various food items, except Rhacomitrium lanuginosum which was avoided. Food plant selection did not correlate with calorific value or secondary metabolite content. However, there was some correlation between the neutral detergent fibre content or digestibility of the plants measured and their level of consumption by the hares. It appears from {{the results of this study}} that the diet of hares in the study area is influenced predominantly by the availability of the various potential food plants but is also influenced by the digestibility of those plants available...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 180 samples, 119 from {{pheasant}} (Phasianus colchicus) and 61 mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) were collected during two consecutive years (from 2011 to 2012). All samples were examined {{for the presence}} endoparasite using the flotation method according Sheather. In samples from pheasants were detected these types of parasites: Capillaria spp., Eimeria spp., Heterakis spp., and Trichostrongylus spp. In addition, Syngamus spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were detected in the duck <b>samples.</b> <b>Microscopical</b> examination of aniline-carbol-methyl violet stained fecal smears revealed to Cryptosporidium spp. 12 positive samples originating from Anas platyrhynchos. DNA was extracted from Cryptosporidium positive samples and all microscopically negative samples. Nested PCR was performed to amplify the partial SSU rRNA gene of Cryptosporidium. The sequence analyses of PCR-positive specimens identified 10 samples as Cryptosporidium avian genotype III and 4 samples as C. muris. No clinical signs were detected in any Cryptosporidium positive animals. This is the first report of Cryptosporidium avian genotype III in the Czech Republic and also in Anas platyrhynchos...|$|R
40|$|In {{automated}} cell counting of {{edetic acid}} (EDTA- 2 K) anticoagulated blood, thrombocytopenia is occasionally seen which bears {{no relation to}} any underlying disease. In this study a heparin and soluble theophylline mixture {{was used to measure}} accurately platelet numbers in patients with such pseudothrombocytopenia. In four normal volunteers, a theophylline concentration of more than 7 mg/ml produced no significant difference in platelet numbers between theophylline and heparin and EDTA- 2 K anticoagulated bloods. When blood treated with EDTA- 2 K was used in seven patients with pseudothrombocytopenia, falsely low platelet counts were observed in three patients immediately after sampling; in blood treated with theophylline, white cell and platelet counts remained unchanged for up to six hours after <b>sampling.</b> <b>Microscopical</b> examination of the EDTA- 2 K anticoagulated blood showed massive platelet clumping, but no aggregates were seen in theophylline anticoagulated blood. It is concluded that theophylline can be useful in the investigation of pseudothrombocytopenia when an automated cell counter is used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} examine the {{prevalence}} of Cryptosporidium in wild Arvicolinae in the Czech Republic and understand the role that wild rodents play in the transmission of this parasite to humans and livestock, 152 faecal samples from 129 common voles (Microtus arvalis) and 23 bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) were collected on 9 localities in 2012. All samples were examined for presence of Cryptosporidium sp. using both the aniline-carbol-methyl violet staining method and molecular tools. The age, sex and faecal consistency were noted {{at the time of}} <b>sampling.</b> <b>Microscopical</b> examination revealed the presence Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts in 2 samples originated from common voles and 2 samples from bank voles. Genotyping was done through PCR amplification and characterization of the SSU rRNA and actin loci. Cryptosporidium specific DNA was detected in 10 samples (4 from common voles and 6 from bank voles) including those microscopically positive. Cryptosporidium infection was not linked to diarrhoea. Sequence and following phylogeny analyses revealed two new Cryptosporidium genotypes originated from bank voles and two new genotype from common vole, phylogeneticaly distinct from known species and genotypes. The host specificity needs to be verified by experimental infection in the future...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the effects}} of the {{addition}} of powdered activated carbon (PAC) into the aeration zone of an activated-sludge (AS) system for treating Tehran Oil Refinery effluent, was investigated during more than 12 months in a PACT pilot-scale model. Besides the evaluation of organics removal efficiency and determination of basic design factors kinetic coefficients, a series of experiments were conducted in order to study the variations in biological growth (especially bacteria and monocellular organisms) related to PAC addition. After sampling from mixed liquor and <b>microscopical</b> studies, adequate <b>samples</b> were filtered, dewatered and fixed. The samples were then coated by 100 A films of (Au) and were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed significant improvement of bacteria and monocellular organisms in the presence of PAC, which may be raised from providing more contact surface and better nutrient availability for microorganisms, decreasing {{the effects of}} toxic shock loads and providing better conditions for microorganisms against intensive mixing. Electronic photomicrographs by SEM confirmed good attachments of ciliate to PAC particles, along with appropriate efficiency of bacteria diffusion into its meso and microspores. Also, the comparison between the count number of protozoa in two pilots of PACT and AS, showed better conditions for growth of microorganisms, using PAC...|$|R
40|$|Our group {{provides}} experimental platforms {{to simulate}} the conditions of microgravity on ground. Clinostats, a Random Positioning Machine and a Rotating Wall Vessel have been adapted to allow investigations employing {{a variety of different}} model organisms like larval fish, plants, algae, and unicellular organisms as well as adherent or suspended cells in culture. Different types of clinostats have been developed which meet a broad variety of scientific requirements in providing various kinds of experimental applications such as parallel operation of up to ten sample containments in a defined environment, direct <b>microscopical</b> observations of <b>sample,</b> their fixation during clinorotation, bioluminescence kinetic measurements within cell cultures and submersion of aquatic systems during rotation. Correspondingly, various centrifuge devices complete our experimental scenario, enabling hypergravity studies from cells to humans. Ground-based data should ideally be validated in the course of experiments carried out under real microgravity, which is regularly performed by us. Currently, our studies focus on the effects of simulated microgravity on macrophage signaling and stem cell development and differentiation. Simulation of microgravity as well as increased gravitational stimulation provide new insights how Biosystems cope with altered gravity conditions, showing changes in signaling pathways. Our results support the necessity of a ground-based facility program, which – at low costs in comparison to space flight – give scientists the opportunity to intensively prepare their space experiments and get sufficient and statistically reliable and relevant data...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Ocean Margin Exchange project, a multi-disciplinary study has been conducted at the shelf edge and slope of the Goban Spur {{in order to determine the}} spatial distribution, quantity and quality of particle flux, and delineate the transport mechanisms of the major organic and inorganic components. We present here a synthesis view of the major transport modes of both biogenic and lithogenic material being delivered to the open slope of the Goban Spur. We attempt to differentiate between the direct biogenic flux from the surface mixed layer and the advective component, both biogenic and lithogenic. Long-term moorings, instrumented with sediment traps, current meters and transmissometers have yielded samples and near-continuous recordings of hydrographic variables (current direction and speed, temperature and salinity) and light transmission for a period of 2. 5 years. Numerous stations have been occupied for CTD casts with light transmission and collection of water samples. The sedimenting material has been analysed for a variety of marker compounds including phytoplankton pigments, isotopic, biomineral and trace metal composition and <b>microscopical</b> analyses. These <b>samples</b> are augmented by seasonal information on the distribution and composition of fine particles and marine snow in the water column. The slope shows well-developed bottom nepheloid layers always present and intermediate nepheloid layers intermittently present. Concentrations are mainly in the range 50 - 130 mg m - 3 in nepheloid layers and 6 - 25 mg m - 3 in clear water. A seasonal variability in the concentration at the clear water minimum is argued to be related to seasonal variations in vertical flux and aggregate break-up in transit during summer months. It is suggested that the winter sink for this seasonal change in particulate matter involves some reaggregation and scavenging, and some conversion of particulate to dissolved organic matter. This may provide a slow seasonal pump of dissolved organic carbon to the deep ocean interior. Differences in trapped quantities at different water depths are interpreted as due to lateral flux from the continental margin. There is a major lateral input between 600 and 1050 m at an inner station and between 600 and 1440 m at an outer one. The transport is thought to be related to intermediate nepheloid layers, but those measured are too dilute to be able to supply the flux. Observed bottom nepheloid layers are highly concentrated very close to the bed (up to 5 g m - 3), with a population of large aggregates. Some of these are capable of delivering the flux seen offshore during intermittent detachment of nepheloid layers into mid-water. Concentrated bottom nepheloid layers are also able to deliver large particles with unstable phytoplankton pigments to the deep sea floor in a few tens of days. Calculated CaCO 3 fluxes are adjusted for dissolution, which is inferred from Ca/Al ratios to be occurring in the CaCO 3 -saturated upper water column where up to 80 % of the CaCO 3 resulting from primary production is dissolved...|$|R
