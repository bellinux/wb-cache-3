40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difference between arterialized and venous blood lactate concentrations [La] during constant-load exercises at different intensities. Methods: Fifteen physically active men cycled for 30 <b>minutes</b> (<b>or</b> <b>until</b> exhaustion) at <b>the</b> first lactate threshold (LT 1), at 50 % of the difference between the first and second lactate threshold (TT 50 %), at the second lactate threshold (LT 2), and at 25 % of the difference between LT 2 and maximal aerobic power output (TW 25 %). Samples of both arterialized and venous blood were collected simultaneously at rest and every 5 minutes during the exercise. Results: The arterialized blood [La] was higher at minute 5 than venous blood [La] for all exercise intensities (p    0. 05). The arterialized-venous difference during the first 10 minutes was greater for the two highest exercise intensities (LT 2 and TW 25 %) compared with the two lowest (LT 1 and TT 50 %, p    0. 05). Conclusion: These results suggest a delayed lactate appearance in the venous blood, which is accentuated at higher exercise intensities. The lactate measured in arterialized and venous blood is interchangeable only when blood samples are collected at least 10 minutes after the exercise starts...|$|R

30|$|Participants read {{a pair of}} vignettes almost {{identical}} to those used by Strough et al. (2008). Vignettes {{are the most common}} method used to evaluate the sunk cost effect (Arkes and Blumer 1985; Staw 1976). Typically, participants are told about a hypothetical scenario wherein they previously invested in a service or commodity which sets up a choice or decision scenario that is the dependent variable of interest. In the current study participants were asked, based on the context provided by the initial scenario, whether or not they will make an investment of time and how much of that investment they will make [for a review of the various forms of sunk cost, see Roth et al. (2014)]. In the current study, each participant experienced two initial hypothetical scenarios wherein {{the only difference is that}} in one of them you have paid for the activity and in the other scenario you did not. Specifically, the first of these two vignette options entailed paying to watch the movie (i.e., “You paid $ 10.95 to see a movie on pay TV. After 5  min, you are bored and the movie seems pretty bad”), whereas the second vignette entailed watching the movie for free (i.e., “You are watching a movie on TV. After 5  min, you are bored and the movie seems pretty bad”). After reading each vignette, the participants indicated how much longer they would watch the movie (i.e., stop watching entirely, watch for 10 more minutes, watch for 20 more minutes, watch for 30 more <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> watch <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end). A participant would demonstrate the sunk-cost fallacy by indicating that they would be willing to watch the movie longer after being told that they had already paid for it.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To compare {{early and}} delayed blood administrations in animals {{subjected}} to near-fatal hemorrhage {{in the presence}} of a vascular injury and resuscitated to different mean arterial pressures (MAPs). Methods: Fifty-four immature swine with 4 -mm infrarenal aortic tears were bled to a pulse pressure of 5 torr and then resuscitated (estimated blood loss 40 to 45 mL/kg). Groups I, II, and III were resuscitated with shed blood at a rate of 2 mL/kg/min, followed by normal saline at a rate of 6 mL/kg/min. Groups IV, V, and VI received the same fluids in reverse order. The fluids were infused intermittently to maintain MAPs of 40, 60, and 80 torr. The animals were observed for 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> death. Results: <b>The</b> animals resuscitated to a MAP of 80 torr experienced significantly higher intraperitoneal hemorrhage volumes and mortality than did the animals intentionally maintained hypotensive, regardless of whether blood or normal saline was administered first. There was no significant difference in mortality or hemorrhage volumes between any of the groups intentionally maintained hypotensive. The animals maintained at a MAP of 60 torr were significantly less acidotic than were the animals resuscitated with the same fluid regimen but to a MAP of 40 torr. Early blood administration also minimized the acidosis associated with hypotensive resuscitation. Conclusion: In this model of near-fatal hemorrhage with a vascular injury, maintenance of the hypotensive state produced comparable improvements in one-hour survival and reductions in hemorrhage volume regardless of whether blood or saline was administered first. Although hypotensive resuscitation resulted in improved outcome, it was associated with significant acidosis. This effect was minimized with moderate rather than severe underresuscitation and early blood administration...|$|R

Exposures lasted 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> one of <b>the</b> safety criteria (Tre 39 °C, 90 % HRmax) was met. Physiological responses to the heat and work stress were subsequently analysed {{for the effects of}} the individual characteristics, in relation to the different work intensity types and the climate types. For this purpose, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were used. The analyses showed clear effects of individual characteristics, explaining between 10 and 72 % of the variance (adjusted r²) depending on the test condition, _VO 2 max and/or mass being the most relevant parameters. In parallel, individual characteristics were incorporated in a simulation model, using control functions from literature. Subsequently, the model was validated with the experimental data. The model was shown to produce results with similar accuracy, to that of the regression model derived from the data used. As the model was not derived from these same data, the validation result was considered successful. Over all, the results showed that individual characteristics {{play a significant role in}} the determination of body core temperature response in all conditions tested, but their contribu-tion is low for relative work loads when evaporative heat loss is not restricted...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the U. S. and Russian cycle ergometers {{focusing}} on the mechanical differences of the devices and the physiological differences observed while using the devices. Methods: First, the mechanical loads provided by the U. S. Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS) and the Russian Veloergometer were measured using a calibration dynamometer. Results were compared and conversion equations were modeled to determine the actual load provided by each device. Second, ten male subjects (32. 9 +/- 6. 5 yrs, 180. 6 +/- 4. 4 cm; 81. 9 +/- 6. 9 kg) experienced with both cycling and exercise testing completed a standardized submaximal exercise test protocol on CEVIS and Veloergometer. The exercise protocol involved 8 sub-maximal workloads each lasting 3 minutes for a total of 24 <b>minutes</b> per session, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end of the stage when the subject reached 85 % of peak oxygen consumption or age-predicted maximum heart rate (220 - age). The workload started at 50 Watts (W), increased to 100 W, and then increased 25 W every 3 minutes until reaching a peak workload of 250 W. Physiological variables were then compared at each workload by repeated measures ANOVA or paired t-tests (p< 0. 05). Results: While both CEVIS and Veloergometer produced significantly lower workloads than the displayed workload, CEVIS produced even lower loads than Veloergometer (p< 0. 05) at each indicated workload. Despite this fact, the only physiological variables that showed a significant difference between the ergometers were VE (125 - 250 W), VO 2 (175 and 250 W), and VCO 2 (175 W). All other physiological data were not statistically different between CEVIS and Veloergometer. Conclusion: Although workloads were different between ergometers, relatively few physiological differences were observed. Therefore, CEVIS workloads of 87. 5 - 262. 5 W can be rounded to the nearest 25 W increment and performed on the Veloergometer...|$|R

50|$|The {{basic premise}} of hoc-soc, was to combine {{several of the}} rules of hockey with small-side soccer. The playing surface was AstroTurf and the field {{dimensions}} were the same as a standard NHL hockey rink (200 feet by 85 feet), surrounded by dasher boards. The goals were set into the end boards and essentially cut in half (12 feet across by 8 feet high). As in hockey, the dasher boards were in play. Rosters were nine players strong, with six a side taking the field at the start of play. Free substitutions were permitted on the fly at the substituting team’s own risk. Most fouls committed would result in a two-minute, sending-off penalty being assessed to the offending player, which would also give the opposition a hockey-style power play. The offending player’s team would play short handed for two <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> other team scored a goal -whichever occurred first. As there were no assistant referees, the standard offside rules of soccer did not apply to hoc-soc. This caused many at the time to predict that the scoring would be much higher than that of a conventional match.|$|E

40|$|The {{multimodal}} {{friction ignition}} tester (MFIT) is a testbed for experiments on the thermal and mechanical effects of friction on material specimens in pressurized, oxygen-rich atmospheres. In simplest terms, a test involves recording sensory data while rubbing two specimens {{against each other}} at a controlled normal force, with either a random stroke or a sinusoidal stroke having controlled amplitude and frequency. The term multimodal in the full name of the apparatus refers to a capability for imposing any combination of widely ranging values of the atmospheric pressure, atmospheric oxygen content, stroke length, stroke frequency, and normal force. The MFIT was designed especially for studying the tendency toward heating and combustion of nonmetallic composite materials and the fretting of metals subjected to dynamic (vibrational) friction forces {{in the presence of}} liquid oxygen or pressurized gaseous oxygen test conditions approximating conditions expected to be encountered in proposed composite material oxygen tanks aboard aircraft and spacecraft in flight. The MFIT includes a stainless-steel pressure vessel capable of retaining the required test atmosphere. Mounted atop the vessel is a pneumatic cylinder containing a piston for exerting the specified normal force between the two specimens. Through a shaft seal, the piston shaft extends downward into the vessel. One of the specimens is mounted on a block, denoted the pressure block, {{at the lower end of}} the piston shaft. This specimen is pressed down against the other specimen, which is mounted in a recess in another block, denoted the slip block, that can be moved horizontally but not vertically. The slip block is driven in reciprocating horizontal motion by an electrodynamic vibration exciter outside the pressure vessel. The armature of the electrodynamic exciter is connected to the slip block via a horizontal shaft that extends into the pressure vessel via a second shaft seal. The reciprocating horizontal motion can be chosen to be random with a flat spectrum over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 1 kHz, or to be sinusoidal at any peak-to-peak amplitude up to 0. 8 in. (. 2 cm) and fixed or varying frequency up to 1 kHz. The temperatures of the specimen and of the vessel are measured by thermocouples. A digital video camera mounted outside the pressure vessel is aimed into the vessel through a sapphire window, with its focus fixed on the interface between the two specimens. A position transducer monitors the displacement of the pneumatic-cylinder shaft. The pressure in the vessel is also monitored. During a test, the output of the video camera, the temperatures, and the pneumatic-shaft displacement are monitored and recorded. The test is continued for a predetermined amount of time (typically, 10 <b>minutes)</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> either (1) <b>the</b> output of the position transducer shows a sudden change indicative of degradation of either or both specimens, (2) ignition or another significant reaction is observed, or (3) pressure in the vessel increases beyond a pre-set level that triggers an automatic shutdown...|$|R
