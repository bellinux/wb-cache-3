Out to step protections are very useful to disconnect generators when genuine conditions of loose of synchronism arise and especially if the load loci crosses the impedance characteristics of the generators or their GSU transformers. Proper settings of out of step has been widely discussed and appropriate methods to simulate their effectiveness have are being proposed. This paper analyzes {{the benefits of the}} existing setting procedure and proposes efficient and practical methods to obtain results from stability programs, translated into COMTRADE formats to be applied to relays via modern testing equipment. The results help to confirm or propose modifications to current practices aiming the best possible protection of generation facilities.

It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left the European Economic Area (EEA), citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also face <b>more</b> <b>stringent</b> rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship.

40|$|To support QoS for {{multicast}} with {{dynamic and}} distributed member joining, {{in this paper}} we present a receiver-initiated multicast protocol with multiple QoS constraints (RIMQoS). Assuming link-state information and QoS unicast routing protocol are available, a receiver computes a path to join the multicast tree rooted at the source. It then sends join request along the path to join the group. Our protocol specifies under what conditions the new member can be accepted into the group without affecting the QoS of other members and how to adjust the existing tree if necessary. It attempts to minimize the cost of the tree by letting a node to join the tree via a low-cost path and may later switch to a highercost but <b>more</b> QoS <b>stringent</b> path when necessary. The proposed scheme allows fully distributed operation and supports multiple QoS metrics and requirements. It greatly reduces number of messages and simplifies message processing to join members compared with some other approaches. Simulat [...] ...|$|R

This study aims at evaluating the performance of wireless access networks implemented in the multihop mesh architecture based on IEEE 802. 11 standards.

On the other hand, the EDCA mechanism for QoS support from IEEE 802. 11 e has been considered in the evaluation on both STAs and MAPs.
