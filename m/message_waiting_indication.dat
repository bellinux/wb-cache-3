40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the problem of packet {{scheduling}} in a single-hop multichannel system, {{with the goal of}} minimizing the average <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> time. Such an objective function represents the delay incurred by the users before receiving the desired data. We show that the problem of finding a schedule with minimum <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> time is NP-complete, by means of polynomial time reduction of the time table design problem to our problem. We present also several heuristics that result in outcomes very close to the optimal ones. We compare these heuristics by means of extensive simulations...|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of random access CSMA {{protocols}} for time-constrained applications such as packetized voice, the distribution of <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> times is of critical importance. It is shown that the ordering or scheduling imposed on message transmissions by a particular random access protocol greatly affects the <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> time distribution. We present a random access protocol which can provide a large class of distributed message scheduling disciplines based on message arrival times. Moreover, this protocol can adaptively vary to provide an optimal service discipline in response to changing system demands. Analytic models are derived for the waiting time distribution for the cases of FCFS, LCFS and RANDOM scheduling and the analytic results are compared with simulation. Other possible scheduling disciplines are discussed {{and the impact of}} the distributed scheduling discipline on the performance of time-constrained applications is examined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The Java {{messaging}} service (JMS) {{is a means}} to organize communication among distributed applications according to the publish/subscribe principle. If the subscribers install filter rules on the JMS server, JMS {{can be used as}} a message routing platform, but it is not clear whether its message throughput is sufficiently high to support large-scale systems. We perform measurements for the FioranoMQ JMS server and derive a simple model for its message processing time that takes message filters and the message replication grade into account. Then, we analyze the JMS server capacity and the <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> time for various application scenarios. We show that the <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> time is not an issue as long as the server throughput is sufficiently high. Finally, we assess the capacity of two different distributed JMS architectures whose objective is to increase the capacity of the JMS beyond the limit of a single server. I...|$|R
50|$|This {{feature is}} also {{frequently}} called (and abbreviated) as visual <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> indicator (VMWI). A VMWI, {{as defined in}} Telcordia GR-1401-CORE, is a stored program controlled switching (SPCS) system feature that activates and deactivates a visual indicator on customer-premises equipment (CPE) to notify the customer that new <b>messages</b> are <b>waiting.</b> VMWI differs from existing features that use other message indicators, such as audible stuttered dial tone, in that it activates a visual indicator on the CPE. The visual indicator may {{be as simple as}} lighting or flashing a light-emitting diode (LED), or as advanced as displaying a special message on a liquid-crystal display (LCD).|$|R

50|$|Channels may be {{synchronous}} or asynchronous. In {{the case}} of a synchronous channel, the agent sending a <b>message</b> <b>waits</b> until another agent has received the message. Asynchronous channels do not require any such synchronization. In some process calculi (notably the π-calculus) channels themselves can be sent in messages through (other) channels, allowing the topology of process interconnections to change.

PhoneMail offered impressive recording quality of its digitized messages. ROLM's digital PBX (called a CBX, for Computerized Branch eXchange) {{was the first to}} enable PhoneMail to illuminate a <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> light on ROLM phones equipped with <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> lights (also a stutter dialtone is used with analog and digital phones). Rolm was sold to IBM, who later sold it to Siemens who offer PhoneMail in various configurations/sizes (including a micro-sized version) and its unified messaging successor, Xpressions 470. ROLM was purchased by IBM in the mid 1980s (which was a financial disaster for the profitable ROLM, as IBM clearly could not grasp the laid back, [...] "think outside the box" [...] attitude of ROLM, which was the #2 PBX supplier in the US from the mid 70s to late 80s), then sold half interest to the German company Siemens. In 1992, Siemens bought ROLM entirely from IBM and the original ROLM product line was done for, except for PhoneMail (the only product Siemens did not destroy). VMX suffered from poor product and ineffective management and was about to fold when Opcom merged with it. The surviving company was called VMX, but VMX was all but erased by Opcom except for its name and patent portfolio.|$|R

30|$|In {{this type}} of protocols, the {{decision}} of whether to rebroadcast a message or not depends on {{the distance between the}} transmitter and the receiver. Hence, only the vehicles located at a distance greater than a given threshold rebroadcast the message. These protocols are highly dependent on the threshold, which often causes a variable performance. In [25], the authors propose a protocol where the vehicles attempting to retransmit a <b>message</b> <b>wait</b> t seconds, where t depends on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver {{as well as on the}} communication range. In [26], a protocol that selects the relay by partitioning the communication range is proposed; here, the vehicle located in the farthest partition retransmits the message.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) systems offer a {{solution}} for broadband access and high data rate transmission of multimedia services with distinct Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements through a wireless medium. IEEE 802. 16 Standard specifies the PHY and MAC layers for BWA systems. However, in spite of including the possibility for QoS support, the standard does not define how to schedule different types of traffic. This article propose a new MAC protocol for BWA systems that incorporates a traffic scheduling mechanism based on messages and/or stations priorities. An analytical model to evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed protocol is also developed and results obtained for the <b>messages</b> <b>waiting</b> times of different traffic classes are presented.
