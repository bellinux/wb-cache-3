The Atlantic Cod Genomics and Broodstock Development Project (www. codgene. ca) aims to generate an extensive set of molecular tools for cod, including a database containing approximately 160, 000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). To date approximately 25, 000 ESTs have been generated from normalized cDNA libraries representing various tissues (e. g. gonad, liver, heart, gill, brain), and suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries are being created {{for the purpose of}} identifying cod genes responsive to immunogens or environmental stress.

Although the physiological mechanisms for detoxification of Al and the roles of Al in blue hydrangea sepals have been reported, the molecular mechanisms of Al tolerance and accumulation are poorly understood in hydrangea. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of Al-response genes in the roots and leaves of hydrangea by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The assembly of hydrangea transcriptome provides a rich source for gene identification and <b>mining</b> molecular <b>markers,</b> including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR). A total of 401, 215 transcripts with an average length of 810. 77 bp were assembled, generating 256, 127 unigenes.

From a non-redundant (NR) EST set of 5, 534 potential unigenes, 6. 8 % SSR-containing sequences were identified, with an average density of one SSR every 7. 73 kb of EST sequences. Trinucleotide repeats {{were found to be}} the most abundant (34. 34 %), followed by di- (25. 75 %) and hexa-nucleotide (22. 04 %) motifs. The development of unique genic SSR markers was optimized by a computational approach which allowed us to eliminate redundancy in the original EST set and also to test the specificity of each pair of designed primers. Twenty-five EST-SSRs were developed and used to evaluate cross-species transferability in the Coffea genus. The orthology was supported by the amplicon sequence similarity and the amplification patterns. The > 94 % identity of flanking sequences revealed high sequence conservation across the Coffea genus. A high level of polymorphic loci was obtained regardless of the species considered (from 75 % for C. liberica to 86 % for C. canephora). Moreover, the polymorphism revealed by EST-SSR was similar to that exposed by genomic SSR. It is concluded that Coffea ESTs are a valuable resource for microsatellite <b>mining.</b> EST-SSR <b>markers</b> developed from C. canephora sequences can be easily transferred to other Coffea species for which very little molecular information is available.

However, owing to genetic recombination, the genetically linked markers may give rise to false positives (Frisch et al. 1999).

Selective breeding has been suggested as an effective long-term strategy to manage viral disease, though more information on gene function is needed to help inform breeding programs. The study of cultured banana shrimp (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis) infected with hepatopancreatic parvo-like virus (HPV) provides a unique opportunity to explore the host response to viral infection independent of challenge testing. To gain insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying resistance to high levels of HPV, we examined hepatopancreas tissue from six full-sib groups of banana shrimp with differing levels of HPV infection for differences in gene expression. A total of 404 differentially expressed genes were identified with 180 being over-expressed and 224 under-expressed among high-HPV full-sib groups. Based on homology analysis, a large proportion of these genes were associated with processes reported to be involved in the immune response of crustaceans, including pattern recognition proteins, antimicrobial peptides, components of the prophenoloxidase system, and antiviral activity. The results indicate shrimp from high-HPV full-sib groups appear to have a lower presence of important immune response elements, yet possess upregulated putative antiviral pathways. Within the differentially expressed genes, over 4000 sequence variants were identified to be exclusive to either the high- or low-HPV full-sib groups. To our knowledge, this is the first report of differential expression analysis using RNA-Seq to explore differences in viral load among high- and low-HPV full-sib groups of cultured shrimp. This research has provided additional insight into our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the response of this shrimp species to a naturally occurring viral pathogen.

Genes associated with disorders using the Multi-threaded Clinical Vocabulary Server (MCVS) Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine, whose output was represented as an ontology-network incorporating the semantic encodings of the literature. Metabolic functions were used to identify potentially novel relationships between (genes or proteins) and (diseases or drugs). In an effort to identify genes important to transformation of normal tissue into a malignancy, we went on to identify the genes linked to multiple cancers and then mapped those genes to metabolic and signaling pathways. FindingsTen Genes were related to 30 or more cancers, 72 genes were related to 20 or more cancers and 191 genes were related to 10 or more cancers. The three pathways most often associated with the top 200 novel cancer markers were the Acute Phase Response Signaling, the Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling and the Hepatic Fibrosis/Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation pathway.

Slipped-strand mispairing (SSM) {{was assumed to be}} a mechanism for generating repeat units in cpDNA. However, research on the employment of different small repeated sequences through SSM events, which may induce the accumulation of distinct types of repeats within the same region in cpDNA, has not been documented. Here, we sequenced two chloroplast genomes from the endemic species Heloniopsis tubiflora (Korea) and Xerophyllum tenax (USA) to cover the gap between molecular data and explore “hot spots” for genomic events in Melanthiaceae. Comparative analysis of 23 complete cpDNA sequences revealed that there were different stages of deletion in the rps 16 region across the Melanthiaceae. Based on the partial or complete loss of rps 16 gene in cpDNA, we have firstly reported potential molecular markers for recognizing two sections (Veratrum and Fuscoveratrum) of Veratrum. Melathiaceae exhibits a significant change in the junction between large single copy and inverted repeat regions, ranging from trnH_GUG to a part of rps 3. Our results show an accumulation of tandem repeats in the rpl 23 -ycf 2 regions of cpDNAs. Small conserved sequences exist and flank tandem repeats in further observation of this region across most of the examined taxa of Liliales. Therefore, we propose three scenarios in which different small repeated sequences were used during SSM events to generate newly distinct types of repeats. Occasionally, prior to the SSM process, point mutation event and double strand break repair occurred and induced the formation of initial repeat units which are indispensable in the SSM process. SSM may have likely occurred more frequently for short repeats than for long repeat sequences in tribe Parideae (Melanthiaceae, Liliales). Collectively, these findings add new evidence of dynamic results from SSM in chloroplast genomes which can be useful for further evolutionary studies in angiosperms.

Daphnia magna is, especially in Europe, intensively used to study stress responses of natural populations to pollutants, climate change, and antagonistic interactions with predators and parasites, which have all been demonstrated to induce micro-evolutionary and adaptive responses. Although its ecology and evolutionary biology is intensively studied, little is known on the functional genomics underpinning of phenotypic responses to environmental stressors. The aim {{of the present study was}} to find genes expressed in presence of environmental stressors, and target such genes for single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) marker development. Results We developed three expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries using clonal lineages of D. magna exposed to ecological stressors, namely fish predation, parasite infection and pesticide exposure. We used these newly developed ESTs and other Daphnia ESTs retrieved from NCBI GeneBank to <b>mine</b> for SNP <b>markers</b> targeting synonymous as well as non synonymous genetic variation. We validate the developed SNPs in six natural populations of D. magna distributed at regional scale.

Using archived material and existing molecular markers may provide a cost-effective way to assess population connectivity. Genetic connectivity studies are increasingly in demand in the deep sea in response to mounting anthropogenic pressures, including seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) mining. The feasibility of using archived material was assessed using the New Zealand-endemic vent mussel Gigantidas gladius, which inhabits areas licensed for the prospecting phase of SMS <b>mining.</b> Four molecular <b>markers</b> were tested, but only one (mitochondrial COI) provided suitable sequences. Of 942 specimens, only 150 individuals were informative, largely due to poor tissue quality of archived samples. Seven populations spanning the distributional range of G. gladius were assessed.

The re-sequencing data together with the reference genome sequence data were used in marker development, which revealed 180, 596 to 795, 735 SNP markers from pairwise comparisons among the cultivars. A total of 207, 887 markers were anchored on the lupin genetic linkage map. Marker mining obtained an average of 387 SNP markers and 87 InDel markers for each of the 24 genome sequence assembly scaffolds bearing markers linked to 11 genes of agronomic interest. Using the R gene PhtjR conferring resistance to phomopsis stem blight disease as a test case, we discovered 17 candidate diagnostic markers by genotyping and selecting markers on a genetic linkage map. A further 243 candidate diagnostic markers were discovered by <b>marker</b> <b>mining</b> on a scaffold bearing non-diagnostic markers linked to the PhtjR gene. Nine out from the ten tested candidate diagnostic markers were confirmed as truly diagnostic on a broad range of commercial cultivars. Markers developed using these strategies meet the requirements for broad application in molecular plant breeding. Conclusions We demonstrated that low-cost genome sequencing and re-sequencing data were sufficient and very effective in the development of diagnostic markers for marker-assisted selection. The strategies used in this study may be applied to any trait or plant species. Whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing provides a powerful tool to overcome current limitations in molecular plant breeding, which will enable plant breeders to precisely pyramid favourable genes to develop super crop varieties to meet future food demands...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background With the {{increasing}} availability of EST databases and whole genome sequences, SNPs {{have become the}} most abundant and powerful polymorphic markers. However, SNP chip data generally suffers from ascertainment biases caused by the SNP discovery and selection process in which {{a small number of}} individuals are used as discovery panels. The ongoing International Citrus Genome Consortium sequencing project of the highly heterozygous Clementine and sweet orange genomes will soon result in the release of several hundred thousand SNPs. The primary goals of this study were: (i) to estimate the transferability within the genus Citrus of SNPs discovered from Clementine BACend sequencing (BES), (ii) to estimate bias associated with the very narrow discovery panel, and (iii) to evaluate the usefulness of the Clementine-derived SNP markers for diversity analysis and comparative mapping studies between the different cultivated Citrus species. Results Fifty-four accessions covering the main Citrus species and 52 interspecific hybrids between pummelo and Clementine were genotyped on a GoldenGate array platform using 1, 457 SNPs mined from Clementine BES and 37 SNPs identified between and within C. maxima, C. medica, C. reticulata and C. micrantha. Consistent results were obtained from 622 SNP loci. Of these markers, 116 displayed incomplete transferability primarily in C. medica, C. maxima and wild Citrus species. The two primary biases associated with the SNP mining in Clementine were an overestimation of the C. reticulata diversity and an underestimation of the interspecific differentiation. However, the genetic stratification of the gene pool was high, with very frequent significant linkage disequilibrium. Furthermore, the shared intraspecific polymorphism and accession heterozygosity were generally enough to perform interspecific comparative genetic mapping. Conclusions A set of 622 SNP markers providing consistent results was selected. Of the <b>markers</b> <b>mined</b> from Clementine, 80. 5 % were successfully transferred to the whole Citrus gene pool. Despite the ascertainment biases in relation to the Clementine origin, the SNP data confirm the important stratification of the gene pools around C. maxima, C. medica and C. reticulata as well as previous hypothesis on the origin of secondary species. The implemented SNP marker set will be very useful for comparative genetic mapping in Citrus and genetic association in C. reticulata. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} oil crops; however, a lack of useful molecular markers hinders current genetic research. We performed transcriptome sequencing of samples from different sesame growth and developmental stages, and <b>mining</b> of genic-SSR <b>markers</b> to identify valuable markers for sesame molecular genetics research. Results In this study, 75 [*]bp and 100 [*]bp paired-end RNA-seq was used to sequence 24 cDNA libraries, and 42, 566 uni-transcripts were assembled from more than 260 million filtered reads. The total length of uni-transcript sequences was 47. 99 [*]Mb, and 7, 324 SSRs (SSRs ≥ 15 [*]bp) and 4, 440 SSRs (SSRs ≥ 18 [*]bp) were identified. On average, there was one genic-SSR per 6. 55 [*]kb (SSRs ≥ 15 [*]bp) or 10. 81 [*]kb (SSRs ≥ 18 [*]bp). Among perfect SSRs (≥ 18 [*]bp), di-nucleotide motifs (48. 01 %) were the most abundant, followed by tri- (20. 96 %), hexa- (25. 37 %), penta- (2. 97 %), tetra- (2. 12 %), and mono-nucleotides (0. 57 %). The top four motif repeats were (AG/CT) n [1, 268 (34. 51 %) ], (CA/TG) n [281 (7. 65 %) ], (AT/AT) n [215 (5. 85 %) ], and (GAA/TTC) n [131 (3. 57 %) ]. A total of 2, 164 SSR primer pairs were identified in the 4, 440 SSR-containing sequences (≥ 18 [*]bp), and 300 SSR primer pairs were randomly chosen for validation. These SSR markers were amplified and validated in 25 sesame accessions (24 cultivated accessions, one wild species). 276 (92. 0 %) primer pairs yielded PCR amplification products in 24 cultivars. Thirty two primer pairs (11. 59 %) exhibited polymorphisms. Moreover, 203 primer pairs (67. 67 %) yielded PCR amplicons in the wild accession and 167 (60. 51 %) were polymorphic between species. A UPGMA dendrogram based on genetic similarity coefficients showed that the correlation between genotype and geographical source was low and that the genetic basis of sesame in China is narrow, as previously reported. The 32 polymorphic primer pairs were validated using an F 2 mapping population; 18 primer pairs exhibited polymorphisms between the parents, and 14 genic-SSRs could be integrated into 9 main linkage groups. Conclusions 2, 164 genic-SSR markers have been developed in sesame using transcriptome sequencing. 276 of 300 validated primer pairs successfully yielded PCR amplicons in 24 cultivated sesame accessions. These markers increase current SSR marker resources and will greatly benefit genetic diversity, qualitative and quantitative trait mapping and marker-assisted selection studies in sesame. </p...|$|R
40|$|Gracilaria is a {{red seaweed}} that has been {{cultivated}} worldwide and is commercially used for food, fertilizers, animal fodder and hydrocolloids. However, the high morphological plasticity {{and the lack of}} distinctive reproductive structures often lead to the misidentification in the traditional identification of Gracilaria species. Molecular markers are important especially in the correct identification of Gracilaria species with high economic value. Various types of molecular markers, for example random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) have been used in the study of seaweeds but there are always limitations arising from each technique. Microsatellite markers or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are the markers of choice as they have shown to be more polymorphic, relatively abundant, of multiallelic nature and co-dominant inheritance in the molecular study of plants. The objective of this research is to <b>mine</b> the microsatellite <b>markers</b> from chloroplast genome and expressed sequence tag (EST) database of Gracilaria species deposited at the GenBank using available bioinformatics tools. The genomic SSR markers and EST-SSR markers obtained were then be used to assess their suitability for differentiating between different populations and species of Gracilaria. We also compared the variability of cox 1 gene marker with the microsatellite marker that we developed and examined the polymorphism, number and pattern of SSRs from both genomic and ESTs of Gracilaria tenuistipitata. Most of the Gracilaria specimens were collected at various localities in Malaysia and some of the specimens were provided by the collaborators from other countries. For the analysis on G. tenuistipitata, eight SSRs were obtained from the chloroplast genome of G. tenuistipitata. Two primer-pairs (GT 5 and GT 8) showed iii polymorphisms on the specimens tested and the combinations of these two primer-pairs were able to differentiate G. tenuistipitata from the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia from populations facing the South China Sea. In addition, ten SSRs were obtained from the ESTs of G. tenuistipitata and the combined dataset of two primer-pairs (GT 12 and GT 18) generated four genotypes on the specimens tested and the populations from Kuah (Malaysia) and Pattani (Thailand) were grouped into two distinct clades. For the analysis on Gracilaria species, one (primer-pair P 3) out of 33 primerpairs developed from the ESTs of Gracilaria species was able to distinguish between three different Gracilaria species, namely G. changii, G. fisheri and G. manilaensis which are morphologically indistinguishable. This marker can also differentiate the same species of Gracilaria from different populations, for example G. changii from Morib, Selangor has its unique allele that can be distinguished from other populations. Comparison of two different molecular markers, primer-pair P 3 and cox 1 gene showed that cox 1 gene is more variable than the microsatellite marker that we developed. Six haplotypes (C 1 – C 6) were obtained using cox 1 gene while only three genotypes (M 1 – M 3) were obtained using primer-pair P 3. Our study also showed that the number and polymorphism of SSR markers obtained from ESTs were higher than the genomic SSR markers but more different kind of motifs (mono-, di-, and trinucleotide) were observed in genomic SSR markers. Development of molecular markers, particularly the microsatellite markers in distinguishing different populations and across related species, is essential to select valuable strains of the species for cultivation. Further studies in developing microsatellite markers from seaweeds with high economic value such as Gracilaria sp. will be most beneficial to the seaweed industry...|$|R
40|$|A growing world {{population}} juxtaposed with dwindling phosphorus (P) resources present new challenges to {{current and future}} global agricultural production. The burden of depleting phosphorus resources is particularly felt in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The expected doubling of its population by 2050 and the widespread poor soil fertility will pose an enormous task to future food security in SSA. Plant breeding {{can be considered as}} one major factor to improve agricultural production under these harsh low-input conditions. Nevertheless, until recently there have been no thorough breeding efforts to enhance crop production for low-P soil conditions in SSA. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is the worlds fifth and Africas second most grown cereal crop. Sorghum is a staple crop of SSA and is mostly grown in resource poor regions under low-input cropping conditions, with the largest share in West Africa (WA). Its good adaptation to harsh environmental conditions makes it an important crop for the arid and semi-arid regions, hence a crop vital for food security and increasingly farm income in WA. Breeding sorghum specifically targeting P-limited soils is considered as one of the major challenges for future food production and can serve millions of smallholder farmers in WA. Nevertheless, plant breeders are mostly reluctant to conduct breeding experiments under low-input conditions due to a higher spatial variability of soil properties leading to a lower response to selection. In an unprecedented large scale multi-environment experiment from 2006 - 2012 in three WA countries, namely Mali, Senegal and Niger, 187 WA sorghum genotypes were evaluated for their performance under P-sufficient and P-deficient conditions. The main goal {{of this study was to}} establish a breeding strategy for sorghum targeting P-limited environments. In order to establish such a strategy, the following objectives were defined: (I) to evaluate the impact of spatial models on genotypic selection in low-input field trials, (II) to develop a selection strategy for sorghum targeting P-limited environments, based on quantitative genetic parameters and (III) to identify genomic regions influencing sorghum performance in P-limited environments using modern genomic tools. The major findings of this study can be summarized as follows: Spatial models can increase the precision and efficiency especially of low-input field trials and may lead to different genotype rankings. Hence spatial models and/or adequate field designs are necessary tools for efficient genotype selection under low-input conditions and must be considered in a breeding program targeting P-limited conditions. Sorghum performance is severely impeded by low-P soil conditions and shows large grain yield and plant height reductions and delayed flowering. Nevertheless, WA sorghum is generally well adapted to low-P soil conditions and shows a large exploitable genetic variation for P efficiency. Direct selection under low-P conditions is feasible, necessary and more efficient than indirect selection under high-P conditions and should be pursued in a breeding program targeting P-limited environments. Landrace genotypes are more specifically adapted to low-P conditions and show a higher P acquisition capacity, Durra and Guinea race sorghums show a similar specific low-P adaptation, hence these genotype groups are very promising source germplasm for further breeding efforts. Photoperiod sensitive genotypes show less delay in heading, a higher P acquisition rate and a specific low-P adaptation, hence should be considered for climate and low-P resilience breeding. Selection for low P concentration of grain can be used to enhance internal P use efficiency, therefore decreasing further soil P mining. WA sorghum shows a large genetic diversity, hence providing a valuable source for genetic studies examining the underlying genetics of low-P adaptation. There are many genomic regions involved in sorghum adaptation to low-P soil conditions. Nevertheless, some regions could be identified as major contributors, showing large effects on and strong associations to genotypic performance. Molecular markers in sorghum homologs of the major P efficiency gene PSTOL 1 from rice stably enhanced P uptake and crop performance through an increased root growth of sorghum under low-P soil conditions and can be used in marker assisted selection for grain yield production under P-limited conditions. Furthermore, it was observed that grain yield production under P-limited conditions and Al-tolerance are pleiotropically regulated by the same genomic region and most probably the same gene SbMATE. Molecular markers of this region and within the gene SbMATE should be used for marker assisted selection to simultaneously enhance the tolerance to two of the most serious abiotic stresses for sorghum in WA, Al toxicity and P deficiency. WA Guinea race sorghums are an excellent source not only for low-P specific alleles, but also for Al-tolerance and represent therefore an excellent source germplasm for allele <b>mining</b> and <b>marker</b> assisted selection. Genomic selection appears to be a very promising approach to further increase the response to selection. But methods giving more weight to single molecular markers linked to Al-tolerance should be considered. The laid out results show that breeding sorghum specifically targeting P-limited conditions is necessary and feasible using advanced statistical models and modern genetic tools, and should be pursued as a major selection criterion in WA sorghum breeding programs. Nevertheless, only by combining agronomic and socio-economic measures with plant breeding efforts, millions of WA smallholder farmers can be reached and major yield increases can be expected in the near future. Die Weltbevölkerung wächst, die Phosphor (P) - Lagerstätten verringern sich: damit ist die derzeitige und vor allem zukünftige globale Landwirtschaft vor neue Herausforderungen gestellt. Das Problem der sich erschöpfenden P-Ressourcen wird speziell in Sub-Sahara Afrika (SSA) wahrgenommen. Die dort besonders stark zunehmende Bevölkerung und die weitverbreitete geringe Bodenfruchtbarkeit stellen eine enorme Aufgabe für die zukünftige Ernährungssicherheit in SSA dar. Hier kann die Pflanzenzüchtung potentiell einen großen Beitrag zur Steigerung der landwirtschaftlichen Produktion unter diesen rauen und extensiven Produktionsbedingungen leisten. Trotzdem wurden bis vor kurzem noch keine breiter angelegten Züchtungsvorhaben zur verbesserten Pflanzenproduktion unter P-Mangelbedingungen in SSA durchgeführt. Im Getreideanbau steht Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) in Afrika an zweiter und weltweit an fünfter Stelle. Sorghum ist ein wichtiges Grundnahrungsmittel in SSA und wird vor allem in ressourcenschwachen Regionen, hauptsächlich in West Afrika (WA), unter extensiven Anbaubedingungen kultiviert. Die gute Anpassung an widrige Umweltbedingungen macht Sorghum zu einer lebenswichtigen Kulturpflanze für die ariden und semi-ariden Regionen, und somit leistet speziell dieses Getreide einen entscheidenden Beitrag zur Ernährungssicherung. Außerdem verbessert der Anbau von Sorghum auch zunehmend die Einkommenslage vieler Kleinbauern in WA. Daher könnte eine Sorghum-Züchtung, die speziell auf diese P-Mangelbedingungen ausgerichtet ist, der zukünftigen Nahrungsmittelsicherung und Millionen von Kleinbauern in WA dienen. Jedoch stehen viele Pflanzenzüchter Selektionsexperimenten unter extensiven Anbaubedingungen ablehnend gegenüber, da hier meist eine höhere Variation von Bodeneigenschaften vorherrscht und somit ein geringerer Zuchterfolg zu erwarten ist. In einer beispiellosen, groß angelegten mehr-ortigen Versuchsserie von 2006 - 2012 in drei WA Ländern, namentlich Mali, Niger und Senegal, wurden 187 WA Sorghum Genotypen hinsichtlich ihrer Leistung auf Böden mit P-Mangel sowie auf Böden mit ausreichender P-Düngung untersucht. Hauptziel dieser Studie war die Entwicklung einer effizienten Züchtungsstrategie für eine verbesserte Anpassung von Sorghum an P-Mangelstandorte in WA. Um solch eine Strategie darzulegen wurden folgende Ziele genauer untersucht: (I) Einfluss geostatistischer Methoden zum Ausgleich der Feldheterogenität auf die Güte genotypischer Selektion unter extensiven Anbaubedingungen, (II) Entwicklung einer auf quantitativ-genetischen Parameteren basierenden Selektionsstrategie für Sorghum-Züchtung unter P-Mangelbedingungen und (III) Identifikation von an der Anpassung von Sorghum an P-Mangelbedingungen beteiligten Genomregionen mittels modernster Genotypisierungsmethoden. Die wichtigsten Erkenntnisse dieser Studie können folgendermaßen zusammengefasst werden: Geostatistische Adjustierung kann speziell unter extensiven Anbaubedingungen die Präzision und Heritabilität der genotypischen Unterschiede erhöhen und zu einer unterschiedlichen Rangordnung der Genotypen führen. Daher sind geostatistische Analysen und/oder angepasste Versuchsdesigns notwendige Methoden für eine effiziente genotypische Selektion unter extensiven Anbaubedingungen und sollten auf jeden Fall in einem Zuchtprogramm für P-Mangelbedingungen beachtet werden. Das Wachstum von Sorghum ist unter P-Mangelbedingungen sehr beeinträchtigt, dies zeigt sich in einem stark reduzierten Ertrag, einer verringerten Pflanzenhöhe und einem späteren Blühzeitpunkt. Dennoch zeigt Sorghum aus WA eine sehr gute allgemeine Anpassung an P-Mangelbedingungen und eine breite züchterisch nutzbare genetische Vielfalt für P-Effizienz. Eine direkte Selektion unter P-Mangelbedingungen ist notwendig, durchführbar und effizienter als eine indirekte Selektion unter gut mit P gedüngten Bedingungen und sollte daher in einem Zuchtprogram für P-Mangelbedingungen berücksichtigt werden. Genotypen, welche als Landrassen klassifiziert wurden, zeigten eine bessere Anpassung an P-Mangelbedingungen auf und haben die Fähigkeit mehr P aus dem Boden aufzunehmen. Durra und Guinea Sorghum Rassen weisen eine vergleichbare spezifische Anpassung für P-Mangelbedingungen auf und somit stellen diese Genotyp-Gruppen eine wichtige Quelle für weitere Zuchtarbeiten dar. Photoperiodisch sensible Genotypen hatten eine geringere Blühzeitverzögerung, eine bessere P Aneignungsfähigkeit und eine allgemein spezifischere Anpassung an P-Mangelbedingungen. Demzufolge sollten photoperiodisch sensible Genotypen speziell in einer Züchtung für eine verbesserte Klima- und P-Mangel Resilienz verwendet werden. Durch die Selektion auf eine verringerte P Konzentration im Korn kann die interne P Nutzungseffizienz gesteigert und somit eine weitere Reduktion der Bodenfruchtbarkeit verringert werden. WA Sorghum weist eine sehr breite genetische Vielfalt auf und stellt somit eine wertvolle Quelle für genetische Studien zur Anpassung an P-Mangelbedingungen dar. Eine Vielzahl von genomischen Regionen ist an der Anpassung von Sorghum an P-Mangelbedingungen beteiligt. Trotzdem wurden einige genomische Regionen identifiziert, welche große Effekte auf und eine enge Assoziation zur genotypischen Leistung zeigten. Durch molekulare Marker in Sorghum Homologen des Haupt-P-Effizienz Genes PSTOL 1 aus Reis konnte die verbesserte P-Aufnahme aufgrund eines stärkeren Wurzelwachstums von Sorghum unter P-Mangelbedingungen erklärt werden. Somit können diese Marker zur markergestützten Selektion hinsichtlich Ertragssteigerung verwendet werden. Des weiteren wurde festgestellt, dass Kornertrag unter P-Mangelbedingungen und Aluminium-Toleranz von der gleichen genomischen Region pleiotropisch reguliert sind und höchstwahrscheinlich auch von demselben Gen SbMATE. Molekulare Marker dieser Region und innerhalb des Gens SbMATE sollten daher für eine markergestützte Selektion verwendet werden, um eine simultane Verbesserung der Toleranz gegenüber den zwei wichtigsten abiotischen Stressfaktoren, Al-Toxizität und P-Mangel, in WA Sorghum zu erreichen. WA Sorghum der Guinea Rasse erwies sich als eine Hauptquelle für P-Mangel- als auch für Al-Toleranz spezifischer Allele. Es bietet somit einen exzellenten genetischen Grundstock für das Auffinden von Allelen und zur markergestützen Selektion. Desweiteren erwies sich die genomweite Selektion als eine sehr vielversprechende Methode um den Zuchtfortschritt zu steigern, jedoch sollten Methoden, welche einzelnen molekularen Markern ein größeres Gewicht geben, in Betracht gezogen werden. Die dargestellten Resultate zeigen, dass eine Sorghum-Züchtung speziell für P-Mangelbedingungen notwendig und mit Hilfe von fortgeschrittenen statistischen Modellen und modernen genetischen Methoden effizient durchführbar ist. Eine spezielle Züchtung für P-Mangelbedingungen sollte ein Hauptselektionsmerkmal in WA Sorghum-Züchtungs-programmen sein. Jedoch können große Ertragssteigerungen bei Millionen von Kleinbauern in der nahen Zukunft nur erreicht werden, wenn pflanzenzüchterische Anstrengungen zusammen mit agronomischen und sozio-ökonomischen Maßnahmen realisiert werden...|$|R
