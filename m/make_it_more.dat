5|$|Following {{her success}} with Smack the Pony, Channel 4 gave Pile a fairly free hand with her next project. Their only {{requirement}} {{was that it}} should have enough of a narrative thread to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> of a sitcom than a sketch show.|$|E
5|$|On October 2010, these {{versions}} {{were given}} alphanumeric designations with the INS/GPS version becoming the SBU-38 (SBU=Smart Bomb Unit), the INS/GPS/IIR version becoming the SBU-54 and the INS/GPS/SALH version becoming the SBU-64; {{the system as}} a whole was renamed Hammer to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> appealing to export customers.|$|E
5|$|The Bridgewater Way is {{a scheme}} to redevelop the canal and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> {{accessible}} to users, particularly cyclists. The 40-mile development, which includes a new towpath, will form part of the National Cycle and Footpath Network as Regional Route number 82.|$|E

5|$|There {{were about}} 100 {{reliably}} reported deaths from spider bites in the 20th century, compared to about 1,500 from jellyfish stings. Many alleged cases of spider bites may represent incorrect diagnoses, which would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult {{to check the}} effectiveness of treatments for genuine bites.|$|E
5|$|Without the docking-pit, the {{caissons}} and extremities of {{the arms}} of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotated. The buoyancy of the lower caisson would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult to turn the wheel.|$|E
5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E

5|$|Adams' 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down {{includes}} stories {{where the}} female rabbits {{play a more}} prominent role in the Watership Down warren. It {{has been suggested that}} this might have been an attempt to modernise the story, to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> in tune with the political sensibilities of the 1990s, when it was published.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{incident}} the United States altered tracking procedures for aircraft departing from Alaska. The interface of the autopilot used on airliners was redesigned to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> ergonomic. In addition, the event {{was one of the most}} important events that prompted the Reagan administration to allow worldwide access to the United States Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|E
5|$|At the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allied powers {{agreed to}} create a new body to replace the League: the United Nations. Many League bodies, such as the International Labour Organisation, {{continued}} to function and eventually became affiliated with the UN. The designers of the structures of the United Nations intended to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> effective than the League.|$|E

5|$|Catholic {{efforts to}} win the {{population}} countered the Protestant idea of a national church with Polonization, or nationalization of the Catholic Church in the Commonwealth, introducing a variety of native elements to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> accessible and attractive to the masses. The Church hierarchy {{went along with the}} notion. The changes that took place during the 17th century defined the character of Polish Catholicism for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|England {{declared}} at 8/365 {{after two}} overs {{on the last}} day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> likely to spin. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.|$|E
5|$|For 24-year-old Hanshin Tigers fan Masaya Shitababa, the 2003 celebration was a tragedy. He {{drowned in}} the canal, with all reports being {{that he had been}} shoved in by the revelers. To prevent future incidents, the Osaka city council ordered the {{construction}} of a new Ebisubashi bridge beginning in 2004, which will <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult for fans to take the celebratory leap should the Curse of the Colonel be broken and the Tigers win again.|$|E

5|$|Haas and Creamer {{were cleared}} of the {{plagiarism}} charge by their institutions. The Chicago Field Museum of Natural History’s science advisory council rebuked Haas for press releases and web pages that gave too little credit to Shady and inflated the couple’s role as discoverers. The dispute remains heated. Scholars have concerns {{that it could}} <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult for United States archaeologists to gain permission to work in Peru.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Albert Bridge was rewired {{and painted}} {{in an unusual}} colour scheme {{designed}} to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> conspicuous in poor visibility, and avoid being damaged by ships. At night it is illuminated by 4,000bulbs, {{making it one of}} west London's most striking landmarks. In 2010–2011, these were replaced with LEDs.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the King and his {{marriage}} came from several directions. Edward's desire to modernise the monarchy and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> accessible, though appreciated {{by many of}} the public, was distrusted by the British Establishment. Edward upset the aristocracy by treating their traditions and ceremonies with disdain, and many were offended by his abandonment of accepted social norms and mores.|$|E

5|$|President Reagan {{announced}} on September 16, 1983, that the Global Positioning System (GPS) {{would be made}} available for civilian use, free of charge, once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in the future. Furthermore, the interface of the autopilot used on large airliners was modified to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> obvious whether it is operating in HEADING mode or INS mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} shot through special lenses to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> {{reminiscent}} of the decade. At Peter's funeral, actress Blair Brown wanted her character Nina Sharp to wear sunglasses, because she thought Nina would not share her emotions at the funeral. Unlike Noble, Brown wore a wig. The scenes at Reiden Lake were actually shot on a parking lot, and the crew placed a covering over it to simulate the cracks normally on a lake.|$|E
5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
