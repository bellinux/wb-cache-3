5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is nearly {{the same as that of}} the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E

5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E

The training they provided to Nationalist force proved as valuable, if not <b>more</b> <b>so,</b> <b>than</b> direct actions. Approximately 56,000 Nationalist soldiers were trained by various German detachments in Spain, who were technically proficient; these covered infantry, tanks and anti-tank units, air and anti-aircraft forces, and those trained in naval warfare.|$|E

5|$|Like other abelisaurs where {{material}} from the forelimbs is available, the arms and hands of Limusaurus were considerably reduced, even <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> that of Ceratosaurus. The first finger was smaller than the other fingers and lacked digits entirely. As for the other fingers, the second finger was very robust and had three digits, the third finger only had three digits as opposed to four in other early theropods, and the preserved portions of the fourth finger indicate that it was comparatively long and slender, terminating in a single digit. The claws were short, stout, and expanded at their base.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very high concentrations of copper within the plants, <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> the 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant with the next highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. The results suggest that the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and phytoremediation.|$|E

The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened year for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the remains}} of brain cases found in shell middens are broken {{and many of the}} bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and {{possibly}} for exchange and ceremonial purposes.

5|$|The Loudest Engine {{features}} a sound {{adapted to the}} genres of folk and rock, <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> the previous two Howling Bells records. Juanita explained that the band relied less on the sound technology that was prominent in Radio Wars, instead returning to the more organic state of Howling Bells. For the new album, Joel was inspired by prog rock and krautrock acts such as Amon Düül and Aphrodite's Child. Howling Bells were inspired by The Doors documentary When You're Strange, which the members watched just before beginning to record The Loudest Engine.|$|E

5|$|C. lepophagus was {{a similar}} in weight to modern coyotes, but had shorter limb bones that {{indicates}} a less cursorial lifestyle. The coyote represents a more primitive form of Canis than the gray wolf, {{as shown by}} its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws, which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey in which wolves specialize. This is further corroborated by the coyote's sagittal crest, which is low or totally flattened, thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf's. The coyote is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is, {{as shown by the}} larger chewing surfaces on the molars, reflecting the species' relative dependence on vegetable matter. In these respects, the coyote resembles the fox-like progenitors of the genus <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> the wolf.|$|E
5|$|During {{the pulp}} era, {{explicit}} sexuality {{of any kind}} was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published {{felt that they had}} to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> literary works of the time.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, Howling Bells {{recorded}} Heartstrings at Assault & Battery Studios, in London.

Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band, <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> any of her record producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously.
