5|$|At the <b>microscopic</b> level, {{there are}} three primary {{features}} of the thyroid—follicles, follicular cells, and parafollicular cells, first discovered by Geoffery Websterson in 1664.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{began to}} quickly develop and grow with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's {{dramatic}} {{improvement of the}} microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of <b>microscopic</b> life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of <b>microscopic</b> dissection and staining.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain <b>microscopic</b> diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. <b>Microscopic</b> diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|Comparative anatomy {{relates to}} the {{comparison}} of anatomical structures (both gross and <b>microscopic)</b> in different animals.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{students}} of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross anatomy and <b>microscopic</b> anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers. The study of <b>microscopic</b> anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms can {{be found}} almost {{anywhere}} on Earth. Bacteria and archaea are almost always <b>microscopic,</b> while a number of eukaryotes are also <b>microscopic,</b> including most protists, some fungi, {{as well as some}} micro-animals and plants. Viruses are generally regarded as not living and therefore not considered as microorganisms, although a subfield of microbiology is virology, the study of viruses.|$|E
5|$|The {{discipline}} of anatomy can be subdivided {{into a number}} of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and <b>microscopic</b> anatomy. Gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. <b>Microscopic</b> anatomy is the study of structures on a <b>microscopic</b> scale, including histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of an organism in its immature condition).|$|E
5|$|The {{discipline}} of anatomy {{is divided into}} macroscopic and <b>microscopic</b> anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy. <b>Microscopic</b> anatomy {{involves the use of}} optical instruments {{in the study of the}} tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the storm, a severe {{outbreak}} of fire blight, a bacterial infection, occurred in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, affecting as many as 80 percent of the Valley's apple orchards. The storm was blamed for causing <b>microscopic</b> cracks in leaves, which allowed airborne bacteria to enter the plants.|$|E
5|$|A {{freelance}} killer {{would probably}} {{not be able to}} manufacture polonium from commercially available products in the amounts used for Litvinenko's poisoning, because more than <b>microscopic</b> amounts of polonium can only be produced in state-regulated nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|According to Takahashi, various macro- and <b>microscopic</b> {{features}} {{suggest that}} this species is best classified in the section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél., {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus.|$|E
5|$|Amphidromus {{species are}} {{arboreal}} land snails. Further {{information concerning the}} habits and mode of life of the species of Amphidromus is almost non-existent, however, these snails have generally been collected while they were crawling on trees or shrubs. The diet of Amphidromus is unknown, but Amphidromus atricallosus perakensis is thought to feed on <b>microscopic</b> fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing <b>microscopic</b> characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and <b>microscopic</b> characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|Coal balls often {{preserve}} a remarkable {{record of the}} <b>microscopic</b> tissue structure of Carboniferous swamp and mire plants, which {{would otherwise have been}} completely destroyed. Their unique preservation of Carboniferous plants makes them valuable to scientists, who cut and peel the coal balls to research the geological past.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{scientist}} Antonie van Leeuwenhoek {{first described}} the <b>microscopic</b> appearance of urate crystals in 1679. In 1848, English physician Alfred Baring Garrod identified excess uric acid {{in the blood}} {{as the cause of}} gout.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{diamonds}} {{have been}} found in Arkansas, Colorado and Montana. In 2004, a startling discovery of a <b>microscopic</b> diamond in the United States led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite pipes in a remote part of Montana.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, the micro-world of biology was just {{beginning}} to open up. A few lensmakers and natural philosophers had been creating crude microscopes since the late 16th century, and Robert Hooke published the seminal Micrographia based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But it was not until Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s—ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens—that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the sheer strangeness and diversity of <b>microscopic</b> life. Similar investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and built the basic techniques of <b>microscopic</b> dissection and staining.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus volemus {{is closely}} related to L.corrugis, and {{generally}} similar in appearance. L.corrugis usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The two can be distinguished more definitively by <b>microscopic</b> characteristics: L.corrugis has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8µm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species Lactifluus austrovolemus {{is closely related}}, but has more crowded gills, while L.lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from L.volemus by <b>microscopic</b> characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller. Both L.austrovolemus and L.lamprocystidiatus are known only from Papua New Guinea. Lactifluus hygrophoroides also resembles L.volemus, but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the Pectinidae family, the Antarctic scallop is a {{suspension}} feeder, extracting its nourishment from the sea water that surrounds it. Bands of cilia on the velum, a curtain-like fold of the mantle, waft particles towards the gills. Oxygen is absorbed by the gills and food particles, mostly <b>microscopic</b> algae, are trapped in mucous and transported to the mouth by cilia. There is a seasonal increase in <b>microscopic</b> ice algae which become available to suspension feeders when the sea ice melts in the summer, and most of the annual growth takes place at this time. Research has shown that this is {{as a result of the}} rise in sea temperature and not the greater availability of food.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} animals. Pathogenic bacteria cause diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax. Protozoa cause diseases including malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis. <b>Microscopic</b> fungi cause diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis and histoplasmosis. Pathogenic viruses cause diseases such as influenza, yellow fever and AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Originally, plantar {{fasciitis}} {{was believed}} to be an inflammatory condition of the plantar fascia. However, within the last decade, studies have observed <b>microscopic</b> anatomical changes indicating that plantar fasciitis is actually due to a noninflammatory structural breakdown of the plantar fascia rather than an inflammatory process.|$|E
5|$|Photoluminescence from SWCNT, {{as well as}} optical {{absorption}} and Raman scattering, is linearly polarized along the tube axis. This allows monitoring of the SWCNTs orientation without direct <b>microscopic</b> observation.|$|E
5|$|Pluteus aurantiorugosus is {{very similar}} to P.nevadensis in {{external}} appearance, and the two can only be reliably distinguished by <b>microscopic</b> characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the former has oblong spores, and cystidia that are shorter and less slender. P.aurantiorugosus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.|$|E
5|$|Rotifers are a phylum of <b>microscopic</b> but multi-celled animals, {{typically}} found in freshwater environments. Although the Latin name rotifer means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms {{do not have}} any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating cilia used for feeding and propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} is {{the production}} of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments. For example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their <b>microscopic</b> structure makes them also reflect blue, turquoise, and green light, and they are often iridescent.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually confirmed by a surgical pathologist, {{taking into account}} the clinical presentation, <b>microscopic</b> findings, and other laboratory tests. It may arise from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).|$|E
5|$|The first {{form of life}} {{to develop}} on the Earth were microbes, and they {{remained}} the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear. Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally <b>microscopic,</b> and smaller than the human eye can see. They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.|$|E
5|$|The species Pluteus horakianus {{shares with}} P.nevadensis a fragile fruit body, a red cap, and similar cystidial morphology. It differs in its orange-red gill edges, red stem, and cap cuticle cells that contain pigment. Other species with a roughly similar appearance, {{including}} P.aurantiopustulatus, P.aurantipes, P.flammipes, P.laetifrons, and P.laetus, {{can be distinguished}} by differences in <b>microscopic</b> characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The spore sac {{contains}} the gleba, which {{is composed of}} a pseudocolumella, unbranched threads (the capillitium), the spore-bearing cells (basidia) and the spores themselves; all of these <b>microscopic</b> elements have certain characteristic features that help distinguish G.triplex from other superficially similar earthstars.|$|E
5|$|The spores are ornamented {{with many}} sharp <b>microscopic</b> spines {{and can cause}} severe {{irritation}} of the lung (lycoperdonosis) when inhaled. This condition {{has been reported to}} afflict dogs that play or run where puffballs are present.|$|E
5|$|The terete leaves readily {{distinguish}} Isopogon anethifolius {{from other}} members of the genus, which have flat leaves and are greater than 1mm (in) across. On a <b>microscopic</b> level, the supporting ground tissue of I.anethifolius differs from some of its genus by its irregular misshapen sclereids (thick-walled cells that make up part of the ground tissue) and contorted cell body.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{described}} {{species in the}} Amylostereaceae: A.chailletii (the type), A.areolatum, A.ferreum and A.laevigatum. The species were initially considered part of Stereum until mycologist Jacques Boidin found atypical <b>microscopic</b> differences between them. Forty years after his extensive researches from 1958, Boidin reclassified Amylostereum into its own family.|$|E
5|$|Tremella mesenterica {{may also}} be {{confused}} {{with members of the}} Dacrymycetaceae family, like Dacrymyces chrysospermus (formerly D.palmatus), due to their superficial resemblance. <b>Microscopic</b> examination shows that the Dacrymycetaceae have Y-shaped basidia with two spores, unlike the longitudinally split basidia characteristic of Tremella; additionally, D.chrysospermus is smaller, has a whitish attachment point to its substrate, and grows on conifer wood.|$|E
5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the <b>microscopic</b> scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly understood, due {{to the ability of}} water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E
5|$|Among non-primates, the extinct Chriacus {{exhibits}} <b>microscopic</b> groves on its toothcomb, but the Philippine colugo (Cynocephalus volans) does not. The toothcomb of the colugos {{is generally}} considered {{to function as a}} toothcomb, but {{due to the lack of}} striations on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming, its use seems to be limited to food procurement.|$|E
5|$|As Kupfer explains, Rehm did {{not justify}} why he {{believed}} Urnula craterium should be allied to Geopyxis, or why Podophacidium terrestre {{should be considered}} an Urnula. Kupfer's macro- and <b>microscopic</b> analysis of tissues from these and related genera clearly showed the inconsistency in Rehm's taxonomical choices, and that Urnula craterium represented an entirely different genus not related to Geopyxis; Fries's naming was restored.|$|E
