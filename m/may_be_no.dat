5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{formation}} of Type Ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. There is much variation in this type of event, and in many cases there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> supernova at all, but it is expected that they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal SN Type Ia.|$|E
5|$|Eilífr Goðrúnarson's Christianity-influenced {{account of}} Urðarbrunnr (section 52 of Skáldskaparmál) {{associates}} the {{well with the}} south and Rome. Theories have been proposed that this description may have some relation to notions of the Jordan River due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr, though there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> other causative connection. Eilífr is otherwise known as a pagan skald, and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the well, Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E

5|$|The {{limitations}} on resources available {{in developing countries}} are particularly evident {{in the area of}} emergency transport. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries. Indeed, there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> roads at all. One study found that modes of transport as diverse as motorboats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts were used for emergency transport.|$|E
5|$|By the 1030s Malcolm's sons, {{if he had}} any, were dead. The only {{evidence}} that {{he did have a}} son or sons is in Rodulfus Glaber's chronicle where Cnut is said to have stood as godfather to a son of Malcolm. His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to be accepted as king by the Scots, and he chose the sons of his other daughter, Bethóc, who was married to Crínán, lay abbot of Dunkeld, and perhaps Mormaer of Atholl. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no mention is made of the circumstances. Malcolm's chosen heir, and the first tánaise ríg certainly known in Scotland, was Duncan.|$|E
