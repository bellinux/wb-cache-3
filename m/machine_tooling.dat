40|$|Metals/Manufacturing <b>Machine</b> <b>Tool</b> {{curriculum}} was not serving {{the needs of}} the community. Research was needed to determine modifications to the current <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> curriculum to create an alignment between the school district and the local area. An active advisory committee stressed the importance of updating the district's <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> curriculum to meet local manufacturing and technical college standards. To accomplish this goal, the researcher used an interview and survey to determine what <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> are used in the Sheboygan area, what <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> careers are readily available in theSheboygan area, what <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> proficiencies are expected of entry level <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> employees and technical college students, and what modifications must be made to the current <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> curriculum to align the curriculum with {{the needs of the}} Sheboygan area manufacturers and post-secondary <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> programs.

A highly accurate thermal model of the HSC <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> is presented {{and the necessity of}} including the whole complex of factors affecting <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> behaviour and error compensation is highlighted.

500|$|Initial {{planning}} for the Pinto began {{in the summer of}} 1967; was recommended by Ford's Product Planning Committee in December 1968; and approved by Ford's Board of Directors in January 1969. Ford President Lee Iacocca wanted a 1971 model that weighed less than 2,000 pounds and that would be priced at less than $2,000. The Pinto product development, from conception through delivery, was completed in 25 months, when the automotive industry average was 43 months; the Pinto project was the shortest production planning schedule in automotive history up to that time. Some development processes usually conducted sequentially were conducted in parallel. <b>Machine</b> <b>tooling</b> overlapped with product development, which froze the basic design. Decisions which threatened the schedule were discouraged. The attitude of Ford management was to develop the Pinto as quickly as possible. Iacocca ordered a rush project to build the car, and the Pinto became known internally as [...] "Lee's car." [...] The Pinto's bodywork was styled by Robert Eidschun.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe energy {{consumption}} behavior of installed <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> and manufacturing systems are nowadays well evaluated {{and the field}} of action for comprehensive improvements and optimization activities is open. Despite the possible improvement potential of installed <b>machine</b> <b>tools,</b> its implementation is limited due to constrains such as high investment costs with unknown amortisation time for the <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> reconfiguration. The planned configuration of components tailored to the <b>machine</b> <b>tool's</b> target use {{is seen as a}} promising way to address the expected energetic performance in the configuration phase using detailed multichannel measurements and knowledge of past improvement activities.
