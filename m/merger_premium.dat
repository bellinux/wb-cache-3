Our results confirm the conflict of interests between target and acquirer firms where the investment banks efforts are positively related to shareholders interest. Additionally, this study verifies the endogenous choice of investment banks and provides evidence about the effect of their reputation on the premium.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes two}} essays that examine mergers and acquisitions. In the first essay we examine how pay-for-performance influences {{the quality of}} merger decisions before and after Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX). Pay-for performance has a significant positive effect on acquirer returns of 0. 9 % pre-SOX and 1. 1 % post-SOX around the three day event window. Bidders with high pay-for-performance pay a 23. 3 % lower <b>merger</b> <b>premium</b> in listed target acquisitions. The positive effect of pay-for-performance is more important for public target acquisitions overall, for small acquirers pre-SOX, and for large acquirers post-SOX. In the long-run, bidders with high pre-merger pay-for-performance experience 27. 6 % higher returns after controlling for other merger characteristic. In the second essay we investigate the value of customer/supplier relationships in mergers acquisitions. The findings show that targets (suppliers) with strong customer/supplier relationships obtain higher abnormal returns and higher merger premiums compared to targets with weak customer/supplier relationships. However, targets that have a strong connection with a customer have lower odds of being acquired. Acquirers that purchase targets with strong customer/supplier relationships have negative long-run abnormal returns, suggesting that the acquirers may have overpaid for such targets.

We analyzed a sample of 1309 stock and cash mergers from 1996 to 2004 Q 2 and developed insights into the risk arbitrage process. We found share price reactions for both the acquirer and target companies {{as a result of the}} merger announcement and compared these to factors such as type of <b>merger,</b> <b>premium</b> paid by the acquirer for the target, relative size of the deal to the size of the acquirer and target, and deal consummation time. We utilized this information to develop a merger return prediction model that predicts a merger's return given various deal characteristics. We constructed several portfolios, one using a trading strategy in which we invest equally in every announced deal, one where we invest only in deals that have a predicted return higher than two times the T-Bills rate, one where we invest in deals that have a predicted return higher than 0, and one where we invest in deals with a predicted return higher than one standard deviation of the predicted returns. A subsequent out of sample analysis of' generating a predicted return model using data from 1996 to 1999 and predicting returns from 2000 to 2004 Q 2 produces returns of 4. 96 %, 3. 14 %, and 5. 87 % for our three portfolios compared with 1. 74 % generated from investing in all deals from 2000 to 20) 4 Q 2.

40|$|This Article investigates a {{question}} that has preoccupied corporate law scholarship for nearly 75 years: Do the merits matter in stockholder litigation? We exploit variation in the remedies available to stockholders at merger to show that classic stockholder litigation seems driven largely by factors unrelated to legal merit. Two unique features make the merger setting an especially apt setting to study this question. First, in merger litigation, {{the merits of the}} legal claims are uniquely easy to perceive. Prior work has relied on proxies for litigation merit — the presence of an accounting restatement, a parallel SEC inquiry, and so forth. A merger, however, is an end-period transaction, and the only issue of genuine consequence to a typical stockholder will be the adequacy of the merger consideration. The second unique advantage of studying mergers is that stockholders have two distinct types of legal remedies available to them — filing a class action alleging fiduciary breach or seeking stockholder appraisal. The fiduciary class action shares the same basic structure as other forms of stockholder litigation like federal securities suits and derivative claims: a class comprised of all shareholders, lead plaintiffs with small holdings, and plaintiffs’ attorneys who control of the claims. Appraisal litigation, by contrast, has none of these features. If the fiduciary class actions differ from appraisal in the incidence and intensity of litigation, we can thus conclude that the difference is attributable to the difference in structure. We analyze over 1, 000 mergers from 2004 through 2013, investigating what factors are associated with fiduciary class actions and with appraisal filings. Fiduciary duty class actions challenging mergers are strongly associated with deal size, a variable that has far greater explanatory power than the <b>merger</b> <b>premium.</b> Our findings suggest that the merits count for little in the decision to bring a fiduciary suit and that such suits are brought for their nuisance value. By contrast, appraisal claims appear strongly related to legal merit. We argue that this difference demonstrates that litigation structure has a marked effect on the merits of claims. We also sketch out some preliminary reforms designed to restructure conventional stockholder litigation in ways that will reduce meritless claims and improve the incentive to prosecute strong claims...|$|E

This paper examines the roles and characteristics of U. S. community banks in the past decade, covering the recent economic boom and downturn. We analyze risk characteristics (including the confidential ratings assigned by bank regulators) of acquired community banks, compare pre- and post-acquisition performance and stock market reactions to these acquisitions, and investigate how the acquisitions have affected SBL. Contrary to concerns, {{we find that the}} overall amount of SBL tends to increase after a large bank acquires a community bank. The ratio of SBL to assets does decline in the large acquiring banks but at a slower rate than the decline seen in surviving community banks. Further, community banks that were merged during the financial crisis were mostly in poor financial condition, had been rated as unsatisfactory by their regulators on all risk aspects, and would have been unlikely to continue lending.

40|$|This thesis {{sought to}} {{identify}} {{mergers and acquisitions}} advisors’ perceptions of their own negotiation strategies in a typical negotiation. Additionally, the thesis examined the potential association between the first offer and a negotiator’s perception {{of his or her}} own negotiation strategy. This was researched empirically by presenting the negotiators two different first offer negotiation scenarios. In the first scenario, a buyer presented a first offer that was higher than a negotiator’s reservation value. In the second scenario, a buyer presented a first offer that was lower than a negotiator’s reservation value. The theoretical framework of the thesis was based on the negotiation analytic approach that was theoretically extended to the context of first offers and distributive and integrative negotiation strategies. Additionally, a quantitative and an expert based approach of negotiation research was used. The survey questionnaire, which measured the negotiators’ perceptions of integrative and distributive negotiation strategies and first offers, was created with a theory driven approach. Therefore, the survey questionnaires of previous research, such as the Dutch test, BPA II and five‐factor model was used as an example when this thesis’ questionnaire was created. The research data was gathered from a population of 300 professional advisors of mergers and acquisitions. The cross‐cultural sample of respondents comprised of 30 advisors. The responses were received from Europe, Americas and Asia‐Pacific. The data was analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, reliability analysis, normality test and a paired samples t‐test. In line with the theoretic framework of the thesis and previous research results, this research suggests that a negotiator’s perception {{of his or her own}} negotiation strategy, in a typical negotiation, is more integrative than distributive. However, in terms of counteroffer strategies the thesis resulted in a contradictory descriptive finding. In both high and low offer scenarios, the majority of respondents’ perceived distributive strategy as their preferred strategy. A key finding of the thesis was that a first monetary offer in a negotiation was associated with a negotiator’s perception of his or her own negotiation strategy. This thesis concluded that a negotiator should use more integrative than distributive negotiation strategy. This strategy consist of behavior, which directs a negotiation towards a problem‐solving practice, where information sharing and trust is emphasized. In order to achieve this type of negotiation process, the negotiator should always make the first offer, for example, before the letter of intent phase. However, the negotiator should carefully analyze the potential reference values of the negotiating parties, create alternatives and evaluate consequences, in order to make trade‐offs. The alternatives could comprise of creative earn‐out models, vendors’ notes and third party negotiation models. However, the negotiator should acknowledge the high probability that an integrative first offer is countered with a distributive offer and communication strategy. Concerning negotiation goals, the negotiator should have a high level of aspiration, which in this context is the goal of high <b>merger</b> <b>premium...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects on}} UK audit market concentration and pricing of mergers between the large audit firms and the demise of Andersen. Based on data over the period 1985 – 2002, it appears that mergers contributed to a rise in concentration ratios to levels that suggest concern {{about the potential for}} monopoly pricing. The high concentration ratios have not improved the level of price competition in the UK audit market. Our pooled models suggest that concentration ratios are associated with higher audit fees. The evidence suggests that the effects of mergers between big firms on brand name fee premium and on price competition vary depending on the particular circumstances. The brand name premium is strongest for the largest quartile of companies prior to the mergers. After the Big Six <b>mergers,</b> the <b>premium</b> increases for average‐sized companies but falls for the smallest and largest companies. Following the PricewaterhouseCoopers <b>merger,</b> the <b>premium</b> increases for below median‐sized clients but decreases for above‐median sized clients.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{detailed information}} on the relationships among the activities of acquiring and acquired firms at and near the time of merger for a sample of 94 takeovers undertaken between 1977 - 1982. We focus on takeovers for two reasons. First, takeovers are an important and controversial phenomenon. Second, takeovers allow {{us to look at}} marginal changes, admittedly large ones, in the firm's boundaries. Thus, they provide a useful way of examining relationships among activities of the firm without having to go into great detail regarding the historical decisions that generated the firm's current structure. While the individual establishment is our basic data unit, in this study we aggregate the activities of the firm to the line of business (LOB) level. Each LOB of an acquired firm is classified as to its relationship horizontal, vertical (upstream or downstream), and conglomerate to the LOBs of the acquiring firm. Using these categorizations we aggregate the LOB-level information to the firm level to investigate the degree to which our sample of mergers is specialized to particular types of relationships. While we find a significant group of unspecialized takeovers, most appear to fit a specific category. We also look at the pattern of closed operations immediately following the takeover. Closings are generally concentrated in operations involving horizontal relationships. Finally, we consider the pattern of relationships between hostile and friendly takeovers and whether takeover premiums vary by type of <b>merger.</b> <b>Merger</b> <b>premiums</b> are not related to the type of relationship between the acquiring and acquired firm, but they are tied to whether the takeover is friendly or hostile.

We find that premiums paid in the global market for corporate control are clustered in waves and driven to some extent by the US premium.

Short-run divergent dynamics due to idiosyncratic or country-specific factors have become less severe, which suggests that expected synergies have become increasingly integrated in the global market for corporate control.

Corporate governance and control mechanisms such as independent directors, independent blockholders, and managerial share ownership are usually important predictors of the size and distribution of the incremental wealth generated by M&A transactions. The authors add to this literature by investigating these relationships using a sample of banking organization M&A transactions over the period 1990 - 2004. Unlike research on nonfinancial firms, the impact of independent directors, share ownership of the top five managers, and independent block holders on bank <b>merger</b> purchase <b>premiums</b> in this environment is likely to be measured more consistently because of industry operating standards and regulations.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the primary motivation of the bank merger waves in the 1990 s. Our investigation {{of the factors that}} determine bid premiums paid for target banks focuses on the importance of the financial characteristics of the targets, composition of their boards of directors, and the regulatory environment.; The value of the target bank to the acquiring bank should reflect its present discounted value of future net cash flows. Thus, at a minimum, the bid price should be a combination of the stand-alone value of the net assets of the target bank and the net cash flows from higher-valued deposit insurance {{as a result of the}} proposed merger. Finance literature also suggests that in large transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions, the value of independent outside directors can be very important as internal governance mechanisms for protecting the interest of shareholders and help to mitigate shareholder/management agency problems. In addition, regulation could also play an important role in determining the number and type of bank merger transactions. Prior to the Riegle-Neal Act banks were restricted by federal and state laws from expanding across state lines. We examine whether bank merger prices were higher or lower as a result of these restrictions. We find a variety of interesting and important results. We find that higher performing targets, as measured by return on assets, are offered higher bid premiums. We also find that lower risk targets, as well as those that may provide some diversification benefits, are offered higher prices. > We find that changes in the regulatory environment had a significant impact on bank merger activities in general, and bank merger prices in particular. For example, <b>merger</b> bid <b>premiums</b> increased by approximately 35 percent on average from the pre- to the post-Riegle-Neal periods.

This result suggests that the PwC merger {{is a response to}} increased competition and clients are unwilling to pay higher fees for within-Big 5 re-branding. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{acquisitions}} {{have added}} value to resource companies {{over the past}} two decades. This stems from the results of this research which has analysed 30 transactions and further reviewed 22 transactions with a total value A$ 240 billion. However, this figure is dominated by the 1997 BHP Billiton bid for Rio Tinto and if this attempted takeover is excluded from the list, the total value of the transactions analysed is A$ 60 billion. The consolidation has occurred in three waves since the early 1990 s. These periods are: • First, a period starting in 1995 and ending in 2000; it included the end of the 1992 - 1996 bull run, the Asian Crisis and a period known as the 1998 - 2000 bull run and ending during the start of the Tech Boom drift, • Secondly, a period between 2002 and 2004 which combines the waning stages of the Tech Boom drift and the commencement of the 2002 - 2008 Resources Boom, and, • Thirdly, in a more recent period from 2006 to {{near the end of the}} 2002 - 2008 resources boom. Each of these periods has different characteristics but overall there is a broad trend of foreign bidders acquiring Australian companies during weaker markets except during the 2002 - 2008 Resources Boom. Cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) for both bidders and targets have been estimated using an adapted market model for event analysis. It draws on the strong correlation of absolute resource share with commodity prices. Friendly transactions offer target shareholders a lower final offer price premia to the 30 -day average target share price prior to the announcement (dual listing – 17. 8 per cent, mergers – 12. 9 per cent) and compares to traditional takeovers which average 48. 7 per cent. In traditional takeovers the initial offer to 30 -day average premia was 37. 2 per cent but increases to the final offer to 30 -day average premia of 48. 7 per cent mostly reflecting the impact of competitive bidding. Average increases in the final offer prices in non-competitive bidding were 16. 6 per cent. While both scrip and cash bids offered similar premia to target shareholders, foreign scrip on average offer a 20 per cent higher premia. Elsewhere, there were no material differences between the premia offered in hostile compared to non-hostile takeovers. Bidders offering a 35 per cent premium (whether cash or scrip) to target shareholders are expected to create CAR for the target shareholders at around 24 per cent on the bid announcement. If the bid involves foreign scrip, the premium needs to be raised by 30 per cent but then the CAR for target shareholders will be slightly lower than non-foreign scrip bids at 22. 9 per cent. If, however, the bidder can structure a <b>merger</b> the <b>premium</b> can reduce to zero in a ‘merger of equals’. Overall, the negative bidder CAR during the event window is more than offset by positive CAR during the post-event window, leading to a net positive CAR for acquirers of an average of 7. 1 per cent. The positive net CAR for acquirers using scrip bids is 11. 3 per cent; it falls to 3. 5 per cent for bidders using cash offers. In the alternative investment of exploration there are attractive probability weighted exploration returns but these are dampened by the high levels of expenditure required to achieve satisfactory levels of certainty. This will continue to undermine the investment appeal of junior explorers while greenfield exploration will become solely the domain of the majors...|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} {{is likely to}} introduce its media reform legislation into parliament this week, but what 2 ̆ 7 s not in the Bills might {{be as important as}} what is, writes Jock Given THE two men who will umpire the buying and selling of Australia’s media are taking different approaches to the tasks that loom as parliament prepares to consider changes to ownership laws. One is keeping pretty quiet. The other is publicly brainstorming the future of media regulation. Chris Chapman is the quiet one. The agency he heads, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, was formed last year by merging the broadcasting and communications regulators. It administers the existing cross-media limits and the foreign ownership rules covering commercial and pay TV. If the government gets its way, these rules will go, though Chapman and ACMA will still have work to do. The rules preventing anyone controlling more than one commercial TV station in a market or two commercial radio stations will remain. A new rule will require at least five independent commercial media groups in metropolitan markets and four in non-metropolitan markets (the “ 5 / 4 voices test”). Foreign ownership will still be subject to the general law of foreign acquisitions and takeovers, overseen by the Treasurer. But because the detail of the proposed amendments has not yet been publicly released, Chapman has not said much about how ACMA will approach any mergers and takeovers that result. Graeme Samuel at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has had a lot to say. The {{government is}} not proposing any changes to the Trade Practices Act, which he administers, but he has been making speeches, and his agency published a paper in August setting out the framework it intends to use to assess future media mergers. The telecommunications branch was renamed the communications branch in March, with a wider brief, more staff and a “convergence section’ dedicated to emerging communications technologies and services. Government backbenchers and others nervous about how much consolidation will occur if the laws change need to look beyond the detail of the 5 / 4 voices test. As well as listening carefully to Samuel and reading closely the recently-released Media Mergers paper, they might find it useful to look at the competition regulator’s form over {{the last decade or so}} in using its existing powers to limit concentration and anti-competitive conduct in the media industry. It is these largely unchanged powers that will need to be relied on if the ACCC is to resist mergers spurred by liberalisation of media ownership laws. There is no plan to give Samuel’s ACCC a “media specific public interest test” for merging parties to satisfy, as recommended in the Productivity Commission’s March 2000 review of broadcasting legislation. This is very different to what was done when the telecommunications market was opened up to competition in 1997 and big “industry-specific’ chunks were added to the Trade Practices Act. The competition regulator got detailed schemes and special powers to manage interconnection, access and anti-competitive conduct in telecommunications. The government was worried the incumbent Telstra would be able to frustrate competition if the ACCC retained only the normal powers available to regulate other industries. Extensive use has been made of these schemes - Telstra thinks too much, though some in the industry think not enough. But the competition regulator has a solid record of testing the edges of its powers over media ownership. It surprised many, soon after commercial radio ownership was liberalised in 1992, by asserting that, although a merger might satisfy the new two-to-a-market rule under broadcasting legislation, it could still amount to a reduction in competition sufficient to infringe the test for mergers under section 50 of the Trade Practices Act. The Federal Court supported this interpretation, and it seems that this relationship between broadcasting and competition law will not be disturbed by the government’s planned changes. Mergers satisfying the 5 / 4 -voices test, if it becomes law, will not necessarily satisfy the competition test. Hence the recent flurry of ACCC thinking and talking about media mergers, anticipating the market analyses that will be needed when it considers whether or not to take court action to prevent or unravel particular media mergers prompted by the removal of cross-media and foreign ownership limits. The thinking and talking suggest that changes in the communications industry demand new approaches to defining individual media markets, and deciding which markets matter most. Samuel’s speeches and the Media Mergers paper stress that concentration in the control of content “will become more important and will be an increasingly strong focus of the ACCC when assessing <b>mergers.</b> ” <b>Premium</b> content like sport and movies are singled out as likely targets. As the number of ways of getting content to consumers increases - the “pipes,” as Samuel is fond of calling them - it will be harder to argue that this part of the media landscape is not competitive. Telstra’s copper network, turbo-charged with DSL technologies to deliver higher-speed broadband; the hybrid fibre-coaxial cable networks of Telstra and Optus that reach some parts of the major cities; satellite and terrestrial wireless broadband; 3 G mobile phone networks; and perhaps, in the longer-term, fibre-to-the-node or the home, amount to a “cornucopia of possible networks,” says Samuel. If the ACCC is to be anything other than a turnstile for the aspirant aggregators of media power, it will have to identify other markets within which competition is likely to be substantially lessened. Markets for media content are not wholly new terrain for the competition regulator. In 1996, it stepped in to break up exclusive program supply agreements between the Nine and Seven networks and their affiliates in Darwin and regional Western Australia. The ACCC thought these deals were designed to hinder the chances of any new commercial stations in these markets. Additional, competitive licences were granted in both those markets after the ACCC’s court action. When the ACCC examined the 2002 Foxtel/Optus content sharing agreement, two of the markets where it thought a substantial lessening of competition might occur were those for the acquisition of content and for the supply of whole TV channels to third party pay TV operators, like TransACT in Canberra and Neighbourhood Cable in country Victoria. The ACCC now says it is going to focus on three content markets: the supply of advertising to advertisers; the supply of content to consumers; and the acquisition of content from content providers. Despite the proposed emphasis on content markets, Samuel is not suggesting control of the “pipes” will be unimportant. Indeed, the ongoing public battle between the ACCC and Telstra seems likely to stay one of the fixtures of communications policy. This erupted most recently over the terms of access to any fibre-to-the-node network that Telstra might build. The ACCC has also stated publicly that Telstra should be forced to divest its 50 per cent shareholding in pay TV operator Foxtel, although the government rejects this. Clearly, the ACCC still thinks control of the pipes matters, but it may not be a central issue when it considers the sorts of mergers between TV and radio stations and newspapers that may follow the proposed removal of cross-media rules. There are two ways the ACCC could get involved in a media merger. The most likely is that parties could seek “informal clearance’ for a transaction - say, a plan for a company controlling a television network, like PBL, to take over a newspaper group, like Fairfax, currently prohibited under the cross-media rules. This is how Foxtel and Optus approached their planned pay TV content sharing agreement. If, after conducting market analyses, the ACCC decides the transaction will not result in a “substantial lessening of competition,” it can advise the parties and the public that it does not oppose the transaction, and will not go to the courts to seek an injunction to stop it. This doesn’t prevent third parties taking action, but in practice, it is close to a guarantee that the transaction can go ahead. If the ACCC decides the transaction may result in a “substantial lessening of competition,” it can seek court-enforceable undertakings from the parties. Typically, these are undertakings to sell some of the assets of the merged entity. If the parties accept them, the regulator may agree not to oppose a restructured proposal. If they don’t, or if the regulator thinks nothing can be done to overcome the substantial lessening of competition, it can decline to give informal clearance. In this case, the parties can still proceed with the transaction, but they do so knowing the ACCC will head to the courts to try stop them. Ultimately, it is the court’s decision, not the ACCC’s, whether the transaction results in a substantial lessening of competition under the legislation, so the parties may still win if the ACCC has got its analysis of the facts and the law wrong. Although this “informal clearance” process is not described in the legislation, it has acquired a degree of formality over time. When considering the Foxtel/Optus content sharing agreement, a good deal of information was published, and public submissions were sought. Samuel now says, “As is the case with all merger analysis, the individual circumstances and competitive implications of a media merger proposal will need to be considered during a comprehensive and public informal clearance process. ” This will provide the opportunity for the parties and the public to express their views. The second way the ACCC can become involved is if the parties seek “authorisation” for the transaction. This is a statutory, public process, much less used, in which the parties have to satisfy the|$|R
