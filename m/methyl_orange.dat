50|$|<b>Methyl</b> <b>orange</b> is a pH {{indicator}} {{frequently used}} in titrations {{because of its}} clear and distinct colour change. Because it changes colour at the pH of a midstrength acid, it is usually used in titrations for acids. Unlike a universal indicator, <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> {{does not have a}} full spectrum of colour change, but has a sharper end point. <b>Methyl</b> <b>orange</b> shows red colour in acidic medium and yellow colour in basic medium.|$|E
50|$|Hierarchically porous {{graphitic carbon}} nitride (hp-g-CN) had a 90% {{photodegradation}} of <b>methyl</b> <b>orange,</b> {{which is an}} improvement over other commercial photocatalysts.

50|$|The {{equivalence}} point, or stoichiometric point, of {{a chemical}} reaction is {{the point at which}} chemically equivalent quantities of bases and acids have been mixed. In other words, the moles of acid are equivalent to the moles of base, according to the equation (this does not necessarily imply a 1:1 molar ratio of acid:base, merely that the ratio is the same as in the equation). It can be found by means of an indicator, for example phenolphthalein or <b>methyl</b> <b>orange.</b>|$|E
50|$|The pH of Davis Run is 6.6 and the {{concentration}} of alkalinity in the stream is 4 milligrams per liter. The alkalinity of the stream was measured using <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> by Graff in 1966 to be 17 milligrams per liter. This value was most likely downstream of the Pumping Station Reservoir, where chemical and biological processes increase the stream's alkalinity significantly. The total concentration of water hardness in the stream is 6 milligrams per liter. The specific conductivity of the stream's waters is 27 umhos.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of п-delocalization, aryl azo compounds have vivid colors, especially reds, oranges, and yellows. Therefore, they are used as dyes, and {{are commonly known as}} azo dyes, an example of which is Disperse Orange 1. Some azo compounds, e.g., <b>methyl</b> <b>orange,</b> are used as acid-base indicators due to the different colors of their acid and salt forms. Most DVD-R/+R and some CD-R discs use blue azo dye as the recording layer. The development of azo dyes was an important step {{in the development of the}} chemical industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} azo compounds {{are often}} useful dyes {{and in fact}} are called azo dyes. The deep colors of the dyes reflects their extended conjugation. For example, the dye called aniline yellow is produced by mixing aniline and cold solution of diazonium salt and then shaking it vigorously. Aniline yellow is obtained as an yellow solid. Similarly, a cold basic solution of Naphthalen-2-ol (Β-naphthol) give the intensely orange-red precipitate. <b>Methyl</b> <b>orange</b> {{is an example of}} an azo dye that is used in the laboratory as a pH indicator.|$|E
50|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is biologically stable, non-toxic, and cheap, {{which makes}} it a very common {{semiconductor}} for dye degradation. Due to its large band gap, some alterations can be made to improve its photocatalytic abilities such as the synthesis of 6,13-pentacenequinone/ TiO2. Titanium dioxide in conjunction with ultraviolet light can be utilized for the decolorization and detoxification of diluted colored water waste such as Alizarin, azo dyes, methyl red, methylene blue, etc. Reduced graphene oxide-TiO2 can act as photocatalyst for the degradation of <b>methyl</b> <b>orange,</b> azo-dye, and pharmaceutical water waste.|$|E
50|$|Acid-base {{titration}} {{is performed}} with a bromothymol blue indicator, {{when it is}} a strong acid - strong base titration, a phenolphthalein indicator in weak acid - strong base reactions, and a <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> indicator for strong acid - weak base reactions. If the base is off the scale, i.e. a pH of >13.5, and the acid has a pH > 5.5, then an Alizarine yellow indicator may be used. On the other hand, if the acid is off the scale, i.e. a pH of <0.5, and the base has a pH < 8.5, then a Thymol Blue indicator may be used.|$|E
50|$|Solvent Yellow 124 is a dye with {{structure}} {{similar to}} Solvent Yellow 56. This dye {{can be easily}} hydrolyzed with acids, splitting off the acetal group responsible for its solubility in nonpolar solvents, and yielding a water-soluble form which is easy to extract to water. Like a similar <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> dye, it changes color to red in acidic pH. It can be easily detected in the fuel at levels as low as 0.3 ppm by extraction to a diluted hydrochloric acid, allowing detection of the red diesel added into motor diesel in amounts as low as 2-3%.|$|E
50|$|If one reagent is a {{weak acid}} or {{base and the}} other is a strong acid or base, the {{titration}} curve is irregular and the pH shifts less with small additions of titrant near the equivalence point. For example, the titration curve for the titration between oxalic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is pictured. The equivalence point occurs between pH 8-10, indicating the solution is basic at the equivalence point and an indicator such as phenolphthalein would be appropriate. Titration curves corresponding to weak bases and strong acids are similarly behaved, with the solution being acidic at the equivalence point and indicators such as <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> and bromothymol blue being most appropriate.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper reaches}} of Crooked Run are {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be impaired for aquatic life by atmospheric deposition due to pH. The stream is infertile and acidic, {{with the potential to}} be affected by acidic precipitation. The pH of the stream ranges from 5.8 to 6.6 and the concentration of alkalinity ranges from 3 to 5 milligrams per liter. An alkalinity concentration of 16 milligrams per liter has been observed using <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> 0.81 mi upstream of the stream's mouth. The total concentration of water hardness in the stream is 5 milligrams per liter 2.75 mi upstream of its mouth and 10 milligrams per liter 0.81 mi upstream of the mouth.|$|E
50|$|After August 2002, all European Union {{countries}} became {{obliged to}} add about 6 mg/L of Solvent Yellow 124, a dye with structure similar to Solvent Yellow 56, to heating fuel. This dye {{can be easily}} hydrolyzed with acids, splitting off the acetal group responsible for its solubility in nonpolar solvents, and yielding a water-soluble form. Like a similar <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> dye, it changes color to red in acidic pH. It can be easily detected in the fuel at levels as low as 0.3 ppm by extraction to a diluted hydrochloric acid, allowing detection of the red diesel added into motor diesel in amounts as low as 2-3%.The European Union has announced that has found a new and better marker to replace Solvent Yellow 124.|$|E
50|$|When {{conducting}} DNA gel electrophoresis, {{crystal violet}} {{can be used}} as a nontoxic DNA stain as an alternative to fluorescent, intercalating dyes such as ethidium bromide. Used in this manner, it may be either incorporated into the agarose gel or applied after the electrophoresis process is finished. Used at a 0.001% concentration and allowed to stain a gel after electrophoresis for 30 minutes, it can detect as little as 16ng of DNA. Through use of a <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> counterstain and a more complex staining method, sensitivity can be improved further to 8 ng of DNA. When crystal violet is used as an alternative to fluorescent stains, it is not necessary to use ultraviolet illumination; this has made crystal violet popular as a means of avoiding UV-induced DNA destruction when performing DNA cloning in vitro.|$|E
5000|$|The method {{consists}} of heating a substance with sulphuric acid, which decomposes the organic substance by oxidation {{to liberate the}} reduced nitrogen as ammonium sulphate. In this step potassium sulphate is added to increase the boiling point of the medium (from 337 °C to 373 °C) [...] Chemical decomposition of the sample is complete when the initially very dark-coloured medium has become clear and colourless.The solution is then distilled with a small quantity of sodium hydroxide, which converts the ammonium salt to ammonia. The amount of ammonia present, and thus the amount of nitrogen present in the sample, is determined by back titration. The end of the condenser is dipped into a solution of boric acid. The ammonia reacts with the acid and {{the remainder of the}} acid is then titrated with a sodium carbonate solution by way of a <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> pH indicator.|$|E

40|$|It is {{of great}} {{interest}} to pharmaceutical technologists to be able to predict interactions between particles in mixtures in order to predict their behaviour during technological processes and to control the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the resulting dosage forms. In our study we used Mg stearate and <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> as model compounds to study the mixing behaviour. As expected, the mixture prepared with mortar and pestle in mass proportion 1 : 1 was slightly coloured since Mg stearate particles (white) are covering the <b>methyl</b> <b>orange.</b> Our results show that Mg stearate has a lower surface free energy than <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> so, theoretically, particles of Mg stearate are expected to spread over the <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> particles. This was confirmed by calculation of spreading coefficients that gave positive spreading coefficients of Mg stearate over <b>methyl</b> <b>orange.</b> FT IR measurements for physical mixtures of Mg stearate and <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> in different proportions substantiate the spreading coefficient calculation. The results suggest that Mg stearate has a higher covering capacity at lower weight ratios in mixtures with <b>methyl</b> <b>orange...</b>|$|E

Maximum decoloration rates appeared when using 200 mg/l TiO 2 in both photocatalysts. At TiO 2 concentration below 130 mg/l, pure TiO 2 could degrade more <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> molecules in the solution than using mixture of TiO 2 and HZSM- 5.

30|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{performance of}} the powders prepared {{in this study was}} evaluated in the following way: 50  mg of powder were initially suspended in an aqueous solution of <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> (10 - 5  M, 100  mL) using a quartz reactor. The suspension, kept under magnetic stirring, was then irradiated using a high-pressure mercury vapour lamp (250  W, HPL-N Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and 4  ml aliquots were taken progressively from the suspension after different irradiation times. The supernatant and the solid particles were separated by centrifugation at 6, 000  rpm. The absorption spectrum of the supernatant solution was measured on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/vis spectrometer (Waltham, MA, USA), and the concentration (degradation) of <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> was determined monitoring the changes in the absorbance at 465  nm. On collecting these data, two side effects must be considered which may lead to a misinterpreted decreased value in the <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> concentration: the self-degradation of the <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> molecule under the irradiation, as well as its incidental (partial) absorption {{to the surface of the}} TiO 2 particles. In this contribution, both scenarios were contemplated as follows: on one hand, a blank solution of <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> with no TiO 2 powder was irradiated under the same experimental conditions; as it was observed, in the absence of our anatase particles, no degradation of <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> was indeed produced. On the other hand, suspensions with <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> and the different TiO 2 powders were prepared as described before but they were not subjected to irradiation: in such dark conditions, no changes in the <b>methyl</b> <b>orange</b> concentration were observed for these suspensions all along the test, so absorption to the TiO 2 surface was discarded in all cases.|$|E
