50|$|TARGET2 {{is also an}} interbank RTGS {{payment system}} for the {{clearing}} of cross-border transfers in the eurozone. Participants in the system are either direct or indirect. Direct participants hold an RTGS account and have access to real-time information and control tools. They are responsible for all payments sent from or received on their accounts by themselves or any indirect participants operating through them. Indirect participation means that payment orders are always sent to and received from the system via a direct participant, with only the relevant direct participant having a legal relationship with the Eurosystem. Finally, bank branches and subsidiaries can choose to participate in TARGET2 as <b>multi-addressee</b> <b>access</b> or addressable BICs (Bank Identifier Code).|$|E
