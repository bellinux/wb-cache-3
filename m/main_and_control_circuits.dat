40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the {{interest}} in reactive power compensation has been growing, {{mainly because of the}} way in which energy supplier charge a customer for reactive power. Moreover, the energy price is growing, what force the industry plants and individual customers to minimize energy consumption, including reactive power. The aim is to minimize reactive power flow in supplying and distribution systems, eliminate or minimize the charge for reactive power as well as aspire to active energy limitation, in result, reducing fare for electrical energy. In the matter of fact, the energy providers wants they customers to compensate reactive power. Energy suppliers determine the value of tgφ which has to be kept in order to avoid paying for reactive power. There are few solutions, that allow handle the problem of reactive power compensation. One of them is reactive power compensator basing on power capacitors. This is the most popular compensating device, mainly because of economical reasons, they are relatively cheap comparing with i. e. active filters or compensation by means of electric motors. That is one of the reasons, for which Elektrotim company proposed the master`s thesis topic – “Design of automatic capacitor bank” They want to launch brand new product to their offer, that is Automatic Capacitor bank. To begin with, the aim of the project was to design automatic detuned capacitor bank for reactive power compensation company with rated power of 200 kVar, rated voltage of 400 V and detuning factor p= 7 %. One out of few assumptions was to find supplier who offers low prices and average quality as well as the one, who offers very good quality of the power factor correction equipment in order to meet the requirements of Elektrotim company customers. The first most important thing before design process get started is to familiarize oneself with standards. Then, knowing what are the requirements regarding capacitor banks in compliance with standards I could proceed to the market survey and compare the elements capacitor bank regarding price, features and quality. Next step is to perform all necessary calculations in order to buy the capacitor bank equipment with proper rating. After that, when all the elements will be ordered I design <b>main</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>circuits</b> as well as equipment layout. As a last steps, technical documentation and test program has to be done...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the optimisations conducted on an existing voltage measurement <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> to allow {{its use in}} a novel imaging electromagnetic flow meter. This flow meter is a multielectrode device that can construct a velocity profile in both single and multiphase flow applications. Voltages are induced in the fluid flowing through the flow meter section due to {{the interaction of the}} fluid and the locally generated magnetic field. These voltages are detected by an array of electrodes and measured by a 7 -channel system, based on the voltage measurement <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>circuit.</b> Each channel measures the potential difference between two electrodes in the flow cross section. The voltage measurement <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> comprises a very high amplification stage and an integral controller. The amplification stage is required to amplify the induced voltages of mV to V, suitable for analogue-to-digital conversion. The integral controller acts to eliminate the DC error component introduced in the amplification stage to prevent the circuit from exceeding its operational dynamic range limit. The existing voltage measurement <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> design has several drawbacks. The very high amplification stage occasionally causes the circuit to exceed its operational dynamic range. In addition, the integral controller has a slow action response which results in a long settling time and offset error. These drawbacks were overcome in the optimised design - discussed in this paper...|$|R
