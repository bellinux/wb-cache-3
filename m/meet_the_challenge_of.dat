5|$|It may be {{inaccurate}} {{though to}} depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aborigines. Although many more Aborigines died than British, this may have {{had more to do}} with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre-existing hunting and fighting practices—using spears, clubs and other primitive weapons. Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main Aborigines failed to adapt to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> the Europeans. Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them. On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than the Europeans.|$|E

25|$|The OLF {{believes}} that solidarity and cooperation among the oppressed peoples led by their respective forces {{is essential for}} realization of their common objectives of liberation. The organization has been working towards unity of struggle among the oppressed peoples to counter the enemy schemes and {{reduce the cost of}} achieving their political objectives of liberation. The OLF believes the alignment of the Ethiopian government with forces resisting genuine change in Ethiopia is posing a real threat to the oppressed and subjugated peoples in the country. The organization declares that there are indications that militaristic and chauvinistic elements who are aspiring to restore the old order are demanding for the reversal of what minimum change Oromo people have achieved through their struggle. It states that the Ethio-Eritrean conflict is going to directly affect the oppressed nations and nationalities economically and in terms of human casualty, and continuation of suppression and violation of human rights by creating pretexts connected with the war situation. The OLF is prepared to revitalize and strengthen previous agreements concluded with some organizations of oppressed peoples and work towards a formation of a platform to co-ordinate and channel their human and material resources to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> the day.|$|E
25|$|Opinions {{differ on}} whether to depict the {{conflict}} as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Indigenous Australians or not.

500|$|Green's {{improvements}} {{came just}} in time to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> the Great Siege of Gibraltar between 1779–83. Despite the siege, the defences were continually improved under Green's supervision. More batteries and bastions were constructed on the North Front, {{all the way up to}} the summit of the Rock. The first of Gibraltar's many tunnels was also constructed, with the original intention of reaching a rocky outcrop called the Notch on the north face of the Rock, to cover a blind angle on the Mediterranean side. As the tunnel was being constructed, an air vent was excavated using explosives. The tunnellers realised that they could use the shaft as an embrasure for a gun. They turned the tunnel into the first of a series of galleries with embrasures at intervals, overlooking the isthmus, which could be used to bombard the enemy lines with impunity. The tunnelling continued after the siege and by 1790 over [...] of tunnels had been excavated, providing bombproof communications routes between the various lines and batteries on the North Front of the Rock. The Notch was also reached and was hollowed out to become a large gallery, called St George's Hall, capable of accommodating five guns.|$|E

2500|$|The JNF's {{engagement}} in developing Israel for Jewish purposes has involved {{a range of}} massive land infrastructure development projects. In the 1980s, the JNF launched a project known collectively as [...] "Operation Promised Land," [...] to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> the massive upsurge of Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union and Ethiopia. In recent years, the JNF has again moved towards the development of towns to accommodate new Jewish immigrants, focusing on the Galilee and Negev regions, the two areas of Israel with a tenuous Jewish demographic majority. In particular, the JNF's 600 million dollar Blueprint Negev aims to attract and build infrastructure for 250,000 new settlers in the Negev desert, which accounts for 60% of the country's land mass but remains sparsely populated. The plan has come under scrutiny as groups such as Bustan, Save the Negev, and Ohalah have expressed concern over the project's lack of transparency {{in light of the}} potential strain on ecological resources and the possible impacts on Bedouin communities nearby.|$|E
2500|$|A report {{released}} in December 2013 by the United States Department of Energy further describes {{the potential benefits}} of energy storage and demand side technologies to the electric grid: “Modernizing the electric system will help the nation <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> handling projected energy needs—including addressing climate change by integrating more energy from renewable sources and enhancing efficiency from non-renewable energy processes. Advances to the electric grid must maintain a robust and resilient electricity delivery system, and energy storage can {{play a significant role in}} meeting these challenges by improving the operating capabilities of the grid, lowering cost and ensuring high reliability, as well as deferring and reducing infrastructure investments. Finally, energy storage can be instrumental for emergency preparedness because of its ability to provide backup power as well as grid stabilization services.” [...] The report was written by a core group of developers representing Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, ARPA-E, Office of Science, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Sandia National Laboratories, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; all of whom are engaged in the development of grid energy storage.|$|E

[...] The Starrs however responded by commissioning Joseph Gates, a well-regarded engineer on Columbia river steamboats, to design and build a steamer which would run faster and cheaper than Olympia. [...] This vessel, which was named the North Pacific, was constructed at the Gates and Colyer shipyard in San Francisco, and launched on May 18, 1871. [...] Capt. Dan Morrison brought North Pacific into the Strait of Juan de Fuca on June 23, 1871. [...] For a few days after that, North Pacific was engage in trial trips.

2500|$|The Welsh of Gwynedd {{remained}} {{conscious of}} their Romano-British heritage and an affinity with Rome survived {{long after the}} Empire retreated from Britain, particularly {{with the use of}} Latin in writing and sustaining the Christian religion. The Welsh ruling classes continued to emphasize Roman ancestors within their pedigrees as a way to link their rule with the old imperial Roman order, suggesting stability and continuity with that old order. According to Professor John Davies, [...] "here is a determinedly Brythonic, and indeed Roman, air to early Gwynedd." [...] So palpable was the Roman heritage felt that Professor Bryan Ward-Perkins of Trinity College, Oxford, wrote [...] "It took until 1282, when Edward I conquered Gwynedd, for the last part of Roman Britain to fall [...] a strong case can be made for Gwynedd as the very last part of the entire Roman Empire, east and west, to fall to the barbarians." [...] Nevertheless, there was generally quick abandonment of Roman political, social, and ecclesiastical practices and institutions within Gwynedd and elsewhere in Wales. Roman knowledge was lost as the Romano-Britons shifted towards a stream-lined militaristic near-tribal society which no longer included the use of coinage and other complex industries dependent on a money economy, architectural techniques using brick and mortar, and even more basic knowledge {{such as the use of}} the wheel in pottery production. Ward-Perkins suggests the Welsh had to abandon those Roman ways which proved insufficient, or indeed superfluous, to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> survival they faced, [...] "Militarized tribal societies, despite their political fragmentation and internecine strife, seem to have offered better protection against Germanic invasion than exclusive dependence on a professional Roman army (that in the troubled years of the fifth century was all too prone to melt away or mutiny)." ...|$|E
