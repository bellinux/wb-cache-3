5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing global challenges, the UN {{has sought to}} improve its accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society and fostering a global constituency. In an effort to enhance transparency, in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for Secretary-General. On January 1, 2017, Portuguese diplomat António Guterres, who previously served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, became the ninth Secretary-General. Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to be <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> and versatile to global needs.|$|E
5|$|During the Han dynasty under Han Wudi (141–87 BCE), the Chinese {{government}} {{united and}} became powerful enough that China began to successfully indulge in imperialistic endeavors with its neighboring nations in East Asia. Han China's imperialism was a peaceful tributary system, which focused mainly on diplomatic and trade relations. The {{growth of the}} Han Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange with {{virtually all of the}} known world as reached from Asia, and Chinese silks spread through Asia and Inner Asia and even to Rome. The early T'ang dynasty saw China as even <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> to foreign influence and the T'ang dynasty becoming a great empire. Overseas trade with India and the Middle East grew rapidly, and China's East and Southern Coasts, once distant and unimportant regions, gradually became chief areas of foreign trade. During the Song Dynasty China's navy became more powerful thanks to technological improvements in shipbuilding and navigation, and China's maritime commerce also increased exponentially.|$|E

The Authors studied the effectiveness of daylight in low-birth-weight newborns.

The very low-birth-weight infants, at higher risk of kernicterus, as they are <b>more</b> <b>responsives</b> to phototherapy, as well they are, probably, more susceptibles to side-effects.

The 8 LMQs are therefore a deliberate strategy to draw the teacher to the nuances of each student and away from ‘the one-size-fits all’ approaches that are characteristic of ‘teaching’ and ‘curriculum planning’ and lesson planning.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{was long}} {{generally}} thought that cats were unresponsive to music, {{recent studies have shown}} that they do in fact respond to music which has been created with species-specific frequencies. Results suggested that cats do benefit from music therapy when the sounds have been composed to target their auditory senses. Other findings include age-related sensitivity (older and younger cats were <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> than middle aged cats).|$|E
25|$|Recently {{this idea}} has regained some {{credibility}} {{under a new}} term, central sensitization. Central sensitization occurs when neurons in the spinal cord's dorsal horn or brainstem become <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> after repeated stimulation by peripheral neurons, so that weaker signals can trigger them. The delay in appearance of referred pain shown in laboratory experiments can be explained due to {{the time required to}} create the central sensitization.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} days of the early music movement, many lutes were {{constructed}} by available luthiers, whose specialty was often classical guitars. Such lutes were heavily built with construction similar to classical guitars, with fan bracing, heavy tops, fixed frets, and lined sides, all of which are anachronistic to historical lutes. As lutherie scholarship increased, makers began constructing instruments based on historical models, which have proven lighter and <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> instruments.|$|E
25|$|The K-MAX {{relies on}} two primary {{advantages}} of synchropters over conventional helicopters: The increased efficiency compared to conventional rotor-lift technology; and the synchropter's natural tendency to hover. This increases stability, especially for precision work in placing suspended loads. At the same time, the synchropter is <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> to pilot control inputs, {{making it possible}} to easily swing a load, or to scatter seed, chemicals, or water over a larger area.|$|E

After a fairly short time, Genie's nonverbal communication skills became exceptional. Everyone who worked with her said she had an indescribable way of eliciting emotions, and she seemed able to communicate her desires without talking.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of patronage networks between local politicians {{and ethnic groups}} {{make it easier for}} politicians to mobilize ethnic groups and instigate ethnic violence for electoral gain since the neighborhood or city is already polarized along ethnic lines. The dependence of ethnic groups on their co-ethnic local politician for access to state resources is likely to make them <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> to calls of violence against other ethnic groups. Therefore, the {{existence of}} these local patronage channels generates incentives for ethnic groups to engage in politically motivated violence.|$|E
25|$|The Poor Law Commission was {{abolished}} {{following the}} Andover workhouse scandal. Tensions among Commissioners {{meant that the}} central administration of the system needed to change.

The Local Government Board took {{over the role of}} the Poor Law Board after the passing of the Second Great Reform Act.

25|$|Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on {{a remote}} server), the browser can respond to user actions quickly, making an {{application}} <b>more</b> <b>responsive.</b> Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. Applications such as Gmail take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. The wider trend of Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.|$|E
