5|$|A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush is a 1958 book by the English travel writer Eric Newby. It is an autobiographical {{account of}} his adventures in the Hindu Kush, around the Nuristan {{mountains}} of Afghanistan, ostensibly to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> mountaineering ascent of Mir Samir. It {{has been described as}} a comic masterpiece, intensely English, and understated. Publications including The Guardian and The Telegraph list it among the greatest travel books of all time. It has sold over 500,000 copies in paperback.|$|E
5|$|Adam Edward Miller (born 19 February 1982) is {{a retired}} footballer. He began his career with Ipswich Town but failed to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> team and played for several non-league teams before joining Queens Park Rangers, where he made his Football League debut in December 2004. He later joined Stevenage Borough, but {{followed}} manager Mark Stimson to Gillingham in late 2007. He has represented the England National Game XI and played at Wembley Stadium in {{the final of the}} FA Trophy.|$|E

5|$|The British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, had forbidden any offensive {{action on}} the Niagara Frontier. This left the local British forces with {{no alternative but to}} wait for the Americans to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> move and try to counter any attempt at invasion. The regular troops were distributed among the defensive outposts and supplemented with militia and Native American forces.|$|E
5|$|The future {{eastern half}} of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence Pass that soon reached Aspen. A private company {{improved}} it into a toll road for stagecoaches, open year-round. The city's rapid growth fostered a race to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> rail connection, which displaced the toll road as the primary route to Aspen within a decade. Later, the railroad's right-of-way would {{serve as the basis}} for the highway.|$|E

5|$|Anime cutscenes are {{included}} in each game, and are a primary focus for the production team as they help <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> impression on players. The series aims to avoid standard anime tropes and common narrative elements with each installment. The first game to feature such cutscenes was Destiny. The cutscenes were animated by Production I.G, which has provided cutscenes for the series until Xillia. For Xillia, aiming to demonstrate a new artistic direction for the series, production of the anime cutscenes was given to Ufotable. For the Nintendo DS release of Hearts, two identical versions of the game were released as an experiment by the production team, with one featuring traditional anime animation by Production I.G., and one featuring computer-generated cutscenes by Shirogumi Ltd. The CGI cutscenes proved less popular with fans than the established anime style.|$|E
5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him {{to stay at the}} White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{returned}} to normal peacetime duties in January 1919, when she arrived in Norfolk on the 4th. She steamed to the Azores to take weather observations for Navy seaplanes that were to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> aerial crossing the Atlantic. In August 1920, Florida was present during the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims' landing at Provincetown, Massachusetts. In December 1920, she made a good-will cruise to South America with US Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby aboard {{and over the next}} three years conducted amphibious operation training with the Marine Corps in the Caribbean. Florida also participated in the normal routine of exercises and midshipman cruises. During this period, she was made the flagship of the Commander, Control Force, US Fleet.|$|E
50|$|Regulars Frankie Avalon, Don Rickles, Annette Funicello, Jody McCrea and Donna Loren all appear (albeit with {{character}} name changes - not <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{time this}} {{happens in the}} series, nor the last); Susan Hart <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of three appearances in the AIP brand of the genre; Buster Keaton <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of four appearances, and Bobbi Shaw <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> appearance of five. In addition, several background players in this film (Patti Chandler, Mary Hughes, Johnny Fain, Mike Nader, Salli Sachse, Luree Holmes, Ronnie Dayton, Ed Garner, Ray Atkinson, Linda Benson, and Laura Nicholson) also appear in three or more films in the AIP brand of the genre.|$|R

5|$|Gatorade, {{now owned}} by PepsiCo, is today sold in some eighty {{countries}} and over fifty various flavors. In contrast to the forty-three dollars that Cade and his team spent to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted {{the evolution of a}} multibillion-dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While he was surprised by its commercial success as a sports drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants and young children. Cade's other research included hypertension, exercise physiology, autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the {{telescope}} observed the coordinates {{of the recently}} discovered pulsar, confirming its existence and investigating the dispersion measure. It was also used to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> detection of polarization of the pulsar's radiation. This marked {{the start of a}} substantial amount of work investigating pulsars at Jodrell, which is still ongoing. In the 30 years following the discovery of pulsars, {{the telescope}} discovered over 100 new pulsars (and astronomers at Jodrell Bank discovered around 2/3 of the total number using the Lovell and other telescopes). 300 pulsars are regularly observed using either the Lovell, or a nearby 42-foot (13-m) dish.|$|E
5|$|Missouri Fox Trotters {{are used}} {{extensively}} by trail riders, who appreciate their gaits, stamina and weight-carrying abilities. They {{are also used}} in handicapped riding programs, and their smooth gait has proven useful for riders with minor physical disabilities. Crosses between Fox Trotter mares and donkey jacks are often made, creating mules with the fox trot gait {{that are used to}} carry hunters and trail riders, especially in the western United States. The US Forest Service also employs Fox Trotters for their speed, stamina and gait, and members of the breed were used to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> horse-back descent of the north rim of the Grand Canyon.|$|E

5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting {{for one to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E
5|$|Other notable figures include Gertrude Bell, an explorer, archaeologist, mapper and spy, who, {{along with}} T. E. Lawrence, helped {{establish}} the Hashemite dynasties {{in what is}} today Jordan and Iraq and {{played a major role}} in establishing and administering the modern state of Iraq; Richard Francis Burton, who travelled in disguise to Mecca and journeyed with John Hanning Speke as the first European explorers to visit the Great Lakes of Africa in search of the source of the Nile; mountaineer Tom Bourdillon, member of the expedition to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> ascent of Mount Everest; and Peter Fleming, adventurer and travel writer and elder brother of Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond.|$|E
5|$|Players receive {{five points}} {{for a first}} team vote, three points for a second team vote, and one point for a third team vote. The five players with the highest point totals <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> team, with the next five making the second team and so forth. In {{the case of a}} tie at the fifth {{position}} of any team, the roster is expanded. If the first team consists of six players due to a tie, the second team will still consist of five players with the potential for more expansion in the event of additional ties. A tie has occurred only once, in 1952, when Bob Davies and Dolph Schayes tied in votes received. From 1946 to 1955, players were selected without regard to position; however, since 1956, each team has consisted of two guards, two forwards, and one center.|$|E

5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture is a {{scavenger}} and subsists {{entirely on}} carrion. It will eat roadkill or other animal carcasses. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{cut into the}} carcass of a larger animal as its beak is {{not strong enough to}} tear into the tough hide. After a few days, the greater yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion, as the meat will begin to decay and become contaminated with microbial toxins. It will drink water from a pool, pond, or any receptacle provided. Like other vultures, they {{play an important role in}} the ecosystem by disposing off carrion which could otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and subsists {{almost entirely}} on carrion. It will eat roadkill or the carcass of any animal, but is also known to hunt for food, especially small aquatic animals in marshes. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> cut into the carcass of a larger animal because its beak is {{not strong enough to}} tear into the tough hide. The lesser yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion once the meat {{is in a state of}} extreme decay, as it becomes contaminated with microbial toxins. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} career playoff series, Davis {{averaged}} 31.5 points and 11.0 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game. Although swept by the overall number one seeded Golden State Warriors, {{who went on}} to win the NBA championship, Davis joined Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Karl Malone as the only players in the past 20 seasons to average 30 points and 10 rebounds in the playoffs. Davis also became the first player in 40 years to average 30 points and 10 rebounds in a player's first playoff series, with the only other players to do so being Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Bob McAdoo. At the end of the season, Davis finished 4th in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting, 5th in the NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting, sixth in the NBA Most Improved Player Award voting. He was selected to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career, becoming the first player to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> team in his first three seasons since Derrick Rose did so in the 2010–11 NBA season. He was also an NBA All-Defensive Team second team selection.|$|E
