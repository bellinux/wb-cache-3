Here, 100 percent indigenous technologies were applied to <b>make</b> <b>flush</b> door shutter of solid core type. Different thermosetting resin adhesives were used as matrix at different stage. The experimental results [as per IS: 2202 (Part I) ] of the physico-mechanical properties like surface finishing, tensile strength, internal bond strength, density, screw withdrawal and glue shear strength etc. of the flush door had a sufficient specific strength (influenced by the dilution of resin matrix) which is equivalent {{to that of the}} conventional wooden flush door. This technique for the production of flush door using fast growing natural fibre is cost effective and could be an ideal solution with ever depleting forest reserves...|$|E

30|$|In two larger randomised, double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} cross-over {{trials in}} post-menopausal patients, {{significant improvements in}} the number, severity and duration of HF were observed: In the first study (n[*]=[*] 100), patients received oral clonidine in doses ranging from 0.025 to 0.075 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks; effects were then compared to placebo (Clayden et al. 1974). In the second study (n[*]=[*] 66), patients received a fixed oral dose of 0.050 mg clonidine or placebo twice daily for 4 weeks (Edington et al. 1980), here however, more adverse events (AEs) were observed in the clonidine vs. placebo groups (dry mouth: 11 vs. 4, insomnia: 8 vs. 4). Since the reduction in HF frequency was small although statistically significant, the authors concluded that clonidine was a medication “that <b>makes</b> <b>flushing</b> more tolerable”.|$|R

40|$|Clonidine, 0. 05 mg twice daily, was {{evaluated}} in a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study in 66 {{patients who had}} had menopausal flushing for less than 1 year. Although the placebo effect was substantial, clonidine reduced the frequency of attacks significantly more than did placebo. In {{three of the four}} trials the patients' comparisons of symptoms before and after crossover indicated significantly greater improvement when the crossover was from placebo to clonidine rather than the reverse. The frequency, severity and duration of attacks were reduced by clonidine in 78 %, 89 % and 88 % of the patients respectively, and by placebo in 50 %, 53 % and 50 %. Side effects were minimal and their pattern was the same for clonidine as for placebo. Clonidine's action as a peripheral vascular stabilizer makes it potentially useful for the treatment of menopausal flushing. It would be prudent to include clonidine at the beginning of treatment so that its efficacy could be assessed in each individual. Its use would enhance the effects of the usual management of the menopausal syndrome, which consists of explanation, reassurance and, sometimes, the use of tranquillizers. Clonidine is a symptomatic medication that <b>makes</b> <b>flushing</b> more tolerable and should reduce the number of patients who would otherwise be exposed to the risks of estrogens...|$|R

50|$|A {{card that}} is fully wild can be {{designated}} by its holder as any card they choose with no restrictions. Under this rule, for example, a hand with any natural pair and {{a wild card}} becomes three of a kind. Without wild cards in play, the best possible hand is a natural royal flush. The common rule in casinos is that a wild card plays as a bug, which is given the rank of ace unless designating it as a different card would complete a straight, flush, or royal flush. Under this rule, a hand such as K-K-Joker-5-2 is just a pair of kings (with an ace kicker), but any four same-suit cards with a bug <b>make</b> a <b>flush,</b> and a hand such as 7-Joker-5-4-3 makes a straight.|$|R

5000|$|Straight flush: The highest {{straight}} flush, A-K-Q-J-10 suited, is {{also called}} a royal flush. When wild cards are used, {{a wild card}} becomes whichever card is necessary to complete the straight flush, or the higher of the two cards that can complete an open-ended straight flush. For example, in the hand 10♠ 9♠ (Wild) 7♠ 6♠, it becomes the 8♠, and in the hand (Wild) Q♦ J♦ 10♦ 9♦, it plays as the K♦ (even though the 8♦ would also <b>make</b> a straight <b>flush).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Starting {{hands with}} three or four cards of one rank are very bad. In fact, the worst {{possible}} hand in the game is [...] Since the only possible combination of two cards from this hand is 2-2, it is impossible to make low. As no deuce remains to appear on the board, it will be impossible to make three deuces or deuces full, and anyone with any matching card to the board will make a higher pair. Likewise, starting with four cards of one suit makes it less likely that {{you will be able to}} <b>make</b> a <b>flush.</b> Starting with four different suits yields no chance for a flush, and starting with four disconnected cards reduces straight possibilities. Computer analysis of the best starting hands has proven that the best starting hand for Omaha is A-A-K-K (double suited). One favorite starting hand for Omaha is A-A-J-10 (double suited), because of its wider range for making the nut straight (J-7, Q-8, K-9, and A-10). For the Hi-Lo variation, the most valuable starting holding is A-A-2-3 (double suited).|$|R

50|$|On average, toilets are flushed 5 {{times a day}} {{per person}} and {{represent}} the single highest use {{of water in the}} average home.

Future reduction in toilet end use will occur as more homes use low-flush toilets (1.6 gpf, or 6 lpf) mandated by the 1992 Energy Policy Act, or high efficiency toilets (1.28 gpf or 4.85 lpf) which meet the EPA WaterSense specifications.

5000|$|In high-low split games one often {{speaks of}} [...] "nut-low" [...] and [...] "nut-high" [...] hands separately.

Similarly, one can sometimes hear the term [...] "nut-nut", which refers to a hand that makes both the best possible high and low.

60|$|It was doubtless {{the voice}} of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as the years at any rate went by {{he found himself in}} regular communion with these {{postponed}} pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his thoughts the Others. He spared them the moments, he organised the charity. Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you, but what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within everybody’s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to these secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces. He had wondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being very sure, and not a little content, that he hadn’t at all events the religion some of the people he had known wanted him to have. Gradually this question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that the religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the religion of the Dead. It suited his inclination, it satisfied his spirit, it gave employment to his piety. It answered his love of great offices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more bedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship was attached. He had no imagination about these things but that they were accessible to any one who should feel the need of them. The poorest could build such temples of the spirit—could make them blaze with candles and smoke with incense, <b>make</b> them <b>flush</b> with pictures and flowers.

5000|$|Played as above, with {{standard}} hand values, {{and with a}} single joker in the deck acting as a bug. It is always played with an ante and no blinds. On the first betting round, no player is allowed to open the betting unless his hand already contains a pair of jacks or a better hand. Other players who checked on the first round may subsequently call or raise if someone else opens. If no player opens, a new deal begins and everyone antes again into the same pot.

40|$|Despite {{the overall}} high {{efficacy}} of cyclodextrins {{to accelerate the}} treatment of soil aquifer remediation by in-situ soil flushing, the use in practice remains limited {{because of the high}} costs of cyclodextrin and high concentrations needed to significantly reduce the treatment time. The current study tested the potential of activated carbon to treat washing water originating from soil flushing in order to selectively separate hydrocarbon contaminants from washing water containing cyclodextrin and subsequently reuse the cyclodextrin solution for reinfiltration. A high recovery of the cyclodextrin from the washing water would reduce the costs and would make the technique economically feasible for soil remediation. This study aimed to investigate whether cyclodextrin can pass through the activated carbon filter without reducing the cyclodextrin concentration when the contaminated washing water is treated and whether the presence of cyclodextrin negatively affects the purification potential of activated carbon to remove the organic pollutants from the pumped soil water. Lab-scale column experiments showed that with the appropriate activated carbon 100 % of cyclodextrin (randomly-methylated-β-cyclodextrin) can be recovered from the washing water and that the effect on the efficiency of activated carbon to remove the hydrocarbon contaminants remains limited. These results show that additional field tests are useful to <b>make</b> in-situ soil <b>flushing</b> with cyclodextrin both a technical and an economical interesting technique.

40|$|In the {{production}} of tomatoes in greenhouses, {{a more or less}} constant number of tomatoes are ready for picking at each harvest time. In {{the production}} of bell peppers, however, large fluctuations exist in number of fruits ready to pick. This major problem in bell pepper production is called `flushing¿: weeks with high yields are alternated by weeks with low yield. This irregular harvest pattern makes it difficult for growers to meet regular weekly demands. As this cyclic production pattern is {{more or less the same}} for all growers, it results in weeks with a high market supply and low prices alternating with weeks with a low market supply and high prices. Flushing also results in strong fluctuations in labour demand in the greenhouses. Hence, avoiding an irregular pattern of sweet pepper production is of great economic importance. <b>Flushing</b> <b>makes</b> it very difficult for the growers to allocate sufficient labour force at a certain time in production. Both allocating too many and too few pickers will have financial consequences for the grower. The aim of this study is to predict the optimal harvest date based on repeated colour measurements of the growing bell peppers. The fruit ripening of bell peppers has been followed by colour imaging in the greenhouse. A commercial digital camera was used to record the development of colour for two cultivars of bell peppers over time. The images were analysed by image processing to obtain the R, G and B values. At the same time the time to harvest was recorded for the same fruits. Using these data a model was developed, on the basis of an exponential function towards a fixed asymptotic end value, to describe the colour development during fruit growth in terms of R/G ratio and to predict the optimal harvest date of the fruits...|$|R

60|$|It was an {{air-tight}} wood-stove, and {{it filled}} the chamber with a heat in which Westover drowsed {{as soon as}} he entered it. He threw himself on the bed, and slept away the fatigue of his railroad journey and the cold of his drive with Jombateeste from the station. His nap was long, and he woke from it in a pleasant languor, with the dream-clouds still hanging in his brain. He opened the damper of his stove, and set it roaring again; then he pulled down the upper sash of his window and looked out on a world whose elements of wood and snow and stone he tried to co-ordinate. There was nothing else in that world but these things, so repellent of one another. He suffered from the incongruity of the wooden bulk of the hotel, with the white drifts deep about it, and with the granite cliffs of Lion's Head before it, where the gray crags darkened under the pink afternoon light which was beginning to play upon its crest from the early sunset. The wind that had seemed to bore through his thick cap and his skull itself, and that had tossed the dry snow like dust against his eyes on his way from the railroad, had now fallen, and an incomparable quiet wrapped the solitude of the hills. A teasing sense of the impossibility of the scene, as far as his art was concerned, filled him full of a fond despair of rendering its feeling. He could give its light and color and form in a sufficiently vivid suggestion of the fact, but he could not <b>make</b> that pink <b>flush</b> seem to exhale, like a long breath, upon those rugged shapes; he could not impart that sentiment of delicately, almost of elegance, which he found in the wilderness, while every detail of civilization physically distressed him. In one place the snow had been dug down to the pine planking of the pathway round the house; and the contact of this woodenness with the frozen ground pierced his nerves and set his teeth on edge like a harsh noise. When once he saw it he had to make an effort to take his eyes from it, and in a sort unknown to him in summer he perceived the offence of the hotel itself amid the pure and lonely beauty of the winter landscape. It was a note of intolerable banality, of philistine pretence and vulgar convention, such as Whitwell's low, unpainted cottage {{at the foot of the}} hill did not give, nor the little red school-house, on the other hand, showing through the naked trees. There should have been really no human habitation visible except a wigwam in the shelter of the pines, here and there; and when he saw Whitwell making his way up the hill-side road, Westover felt that if there must be any human presence it should be some savage clad in skins, instead of the philosopher in his rubber boots and his clothing-store ulster. He preferred the small, wiry shape of Jombateeste, in his blue woollen cap and his Canadian footgear, as he ran round the corner of the house toward the barn, and left the breath of his pipe in the fine air behind him.|$|R
