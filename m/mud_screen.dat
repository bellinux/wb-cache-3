40|$|The U 1 snRNP is {{essential}} for recognition of the pre-mRNA 5 '-splice site and the subsequent assembly of the spliceosome. Yeast U 1 snRNP is considerably more complex than its metazoan counterpart, which suggests possible differences between yeast and metazoa in early splicing events. We have comprehensively analyzed the composition of yeast U 1 snRNPs {{using a combination of}} biochemical, mass spectrometric, and genetic methods. We demonstrate the specific association of four novel U 1 snRNP proteins, Snu 71 p, Snu 65 p, Nam 8 p, and Snu 56 p, that have no known metazoan homologues. A fifth protein, Npl 3 p, is an abundant cellular component that reproducibly co-purifies with the U 1 snRNP, but its association is salt-sensitive. Therefore, we are unable to establish conclusively whether it binds specifically to the U 1 snRNP. Interestingly, Nam 8 p and Npl 3 p were previously assigned functions in (pre-m) RNA-metabolism; however, so far, no association with U 1 snRNP has been demonstrated or proposed. We also show that the yeast SmB protein is a U 1 snRNP component. Yeast U 1 snRNP therefore contains 16 different proteins, including seven snRNP core proteins, three homologues of the metazoan U 1 snRNP-specific proteins, and six yeast-specific U 1 snRNP proteins. We have simultaneously continued the characterization of additional mutants isolated in a synthetic lethal (<b>MUD)</b> <b>screen</b> for genes that functionally cooperate with U 1 snRNA. Consistent with the biochemical results, mud 10, mud 15, and mud 16 are alleles of SNU 56, NAM 8, and SNU 65, respectively. mud 10 and mud 15 affect the in vivo splicing efficiency of noncanonical introns. Moreover, mud 10 p strongly affects the in vitro formation of splicing complexes, and extracts from the mud 15 strain contain a U 1 snRNP that migrates aberrantly on native gels. Finally, we show that Nam 8 p/Mud 15 p contributes to the stability of U 1 snRNP...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper was}} aimed at the {{improvement}} of the resistance to wear of parts of the equipment for enrichment of ore by means of selection of the rational parameters of the technology of surface hardening by gas-thermal coatings of self-fluxing alloys. As a result the statistical models and dependencies of the adhesion, hardness and rate of hydroabrasive wear on the technological parameters of gas-thermal coatings of parts of mining machines were established. The methods for prognostication of physical and mechanical properties as well as the service ones were developed. The technological processes of hardening and restoration of the working wheels of the <b>mud</b> pumps and <b>screens</b> were also developed and introduced into operationAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
