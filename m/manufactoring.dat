40|$|A {{critical}} {{review of the}} available data on QT interval is presented to delineate techniques useful {{to the development of}} a QT-sensitive cybernetic pacemaker. The reason for the development of this unit stems from the ability of QT prolongation to predict the onset of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in some clinical situations; the QT interval is physiologically related to the cardiac cycle length, therefore providing adequate information to drive both ventricular and atrioventricular sequential rate-responsive pacemakers. This unit might also monitor cardiac rhythm and detect the pathophysiologic precursors of advanced grades of ventricular arrhythmias. A therapeutic role, both pharmacologic and electrical, may also be possible in the future. Integration of these concepts and cooperation between interested physicians, technicians and <b>manufactors</b> will be necessary to produce such a unit at a low cost-benefit ratio.

40|$|Background and Aims. The {{study was}} a {{repeated}} evaluation {{of the experience of}} capsule endoscopy (CE) in patients with cardiac pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Patients and Methods. A standardized questionnaire was sent by the <b>manufactors</b> Given Imaging and Olympus to all centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland providing capsule endoscopy service. The questionnaire covers the number of examined patients, monitoring during CE, check of the electric implants before and after CE, occurrence of arrhythmia, quality of CE video, complications, indication of CE, and type of institution. Results. Overall 580 questionnaires were sent to the users. 26 / 5 % (Germany/Austria + Switzerland) of the questionnaires were sent back anonymously to the authors. 114 centers (82 hospitals, 11 surgeries, 21 without specification) replied. In 58 centers (51 %), patients with cardiac pacemaker (n = 300) and ICDs (n = 80) underwent uneventful capsule endoscopy. The predominant indication (patients with CP 97 %, patients with ICD 100 %) was mid gastrointestinal bleeding. Conclusion. The results of our inquiry show that in spite of formal contraindication CE is increasingly applied in bleeding patients with cardiac pacemakers/ICDs and seems to be safe even in a large cohort...|$|R
