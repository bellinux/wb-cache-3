Recent {{work has}} {{established}} that digital {{images of a}} human face, collected under various illumination conditions, contain discriminatory {{information that can be}} used in classification. In this paper we demonstrate that sufficient discriminatory information persists at ultralow resolution to enable a computer to recognize specific human faces in settings beyond human capabilities. For instance, we utilized the Haar wavelet to modify a collection of images to emulate pictures from a 25 pixel camera. From these modified images, a low-resolution illumination space was constructed for each individual in the CMU-PIE database. Each illumination space was then interpreted as a point on a Grassmann <b>manifold.</b> <b>Classification</b> that exploited the geometry on this manifold yielded error-free classification rates for this data set. This suggests the general utility of a low-resolution illumination camera for set-based image recognition problems. ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems in target classification is the extraction of a robust feature, which can effectively represent a specific type of targets. The use of seismic signals in unattended ground sensor (UGS) systems makes this problem more complicated, because the seismic target signal is non-stationary, geology-dependent and with high-dimensional feature space. This paper proposes a new feature extraction algorithm, called wavelet packet manifold (WPM), by addressing the neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE) algorithm of manifold learning on the wavelet packet node energy (WPNE) of seismic signals. By combining non-stationary information and low-dimensional manifold information, WPM provides a more robust representation for seismic target classification. By using a K nearest neighbors classifier on the WPM signature, the algorithm of wavelet packet <b>manifold</b> <b>classification</b> (WPMC) is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed WPMC can not only reduce feature dimensionality, but also improve the classification accuracy up to 95. 03 %.

40|$|International audienceRecognizing human {{actions in}} 3 D video {{sequences}} {{is an important}} open problem that is currently {{at the heart of}} many research domains including surveillance, natural interfaces and rehabilitation. However, the design and development of models for action recognition that are both accurate and efficient is a challenging task due to the variability of the human pose, clothing and appearance. In this paper, we propose a new framework to extract a compact representation of a human action captured through a depth sensor, and enable accurate action recognition. The proposed solution develops on fitting a human skeleton model to acquired data so as to represent the 3 D coordinates of the joints and their change over time as a trajectory in a suitable action space. Thanks to such a 3 D joint-based framework, the proposed solution is capable to capture both the shape and the dynamics of the human body simultaneously. The action recognition problem is then formulated as the problem of computing the similarity between the shape of trajectories in a Riemannian <b>manifold.</b> <b>Classification</b> using kNN is finally performed on this manifold taking advantage of Riemannian geometry in the open curve shape space.
