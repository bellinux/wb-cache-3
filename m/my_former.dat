500|$|Breckinridge refused all {{requests}} – {{including one}} made by President Ulysses S.

[...] Under the terms of section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress would have been needed {{to allow him to}} hold office because he sided with the Confederacy. He never expressed interest in seeking such approval. Speaking as a private citizen in March 1870, he publicly denounced the actions of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1872, he supported passage of a state statute which successfully legalized black testimony against whites in court.|$|E
500|$|Tyndall later {{described}} his membership of these openly Neo-Nazi groups as a [...] "youthful indiscretion". He expressed {{the view that}} while he regretted his involvement in them, he was not ashamed of having done so: [...] "though some of <b>my</b> <b>former</b> beliefs were mistaken, I will never acknowledge that there was anything dishonourable about holding them." [...] As leader of the NF he continued to openly approve of Hitler's social and economic program and well as his policies of German territorial expansion. In his 1988 autobiography The Eleventh Hour, he stated that while he thought that [...] "many of [...] intentions were good ones {{and many of his}} achievements admirable", he did not think [...] "that it is right for a British movement belonging to an entirely different phase of history to model itself on the movement of Hitler".|$|E

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1752, the Journals {{circulation}} was dropping steadily and it was losing popularity. After making the transition to weekly publication on 4 July, it was advertised less, and, in the final months of 1752, its discussion of anything other than court decisions and political actions was minimal. In addition, Fielding's health was deteriorating and his inclination to continue the periodical had declined. The 72nd and final number of The Covent-Garden Journal was published on 25 November 1752; Fielding there confirmed his lack of interest: [...] "I shall here lay down a paper which I have neither inclination nor leisure to carry on any longer." [...] He also directed readers to {{turn their attention to}} The Public Advertiser, a new periodical to be released on 1 December and to replace The Daily Advertiser. His final statement in the Journal was, [...] "I solemnly declare that unless in revising <b>my</b> <b>former</b> Works, I have at present no Intention to hold any further Correspondence with the gayer Muses." ...|$|E
500|$|A mariachi and EDM song, [...] "Aura" [...] {{begins with}} Gaga's {{filtered}} vocal against a Western-style guitar: [...] "I killed <b>my</b> <b>former</b> {{and left her}} in the trunk on highway ten", followed by dissonant laughter. Sam Lansky of Idolator called it a [...] "terrible Nancy Sinatra affectation". A big-sounding EDM production follows the laughter, its beat reminiscent of Gaga's 2011 [...] "Government Hooker" [...] and its vocal [...] "garbled". As the track reaches a crescendo, Gaga sings its hook: [...] "Do you wanna see me naked, lover? Do you wanna peek underneath the cover? Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?" [...] against a spare accompaniment. The song, written in common time in the key of F major, has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Gaga's vocal ranges from F3 to E5, and the track has a basic F–G–F–G–Em7–F chord progression. Described by Michael Cragg of the Guardian as a [...] "slightly muddled insight into gender politics", [...] "Aura" [...] ends abruptly with Gaga uttering the words [...] "Dance. Sex. Art. Pop. Tech".|$|E
500|$|Benbow {{signed a}} three-year lease on Sayes Court in June 1696, a house {{belonging}} to diarist John Evelyn. Six months later, Evelyn {{wrote to a}} friend complaining, [...] "I have let my house to Captain Benbow, and have the mortification of seeing everyday much of <b>my</b> <b>former</b> labours and expenses there impairing {{for want of a}} more polite tenant." [...] In January 1698, Tsar Peter of Russia arrived in London to study British shipbuilding and seamanship. He and his entourage were provided with Sayes Court to reside in during their stay by William III. The Russians spent three months in London before leaving to tour the country. Benbow promptly asked for reparations from the Treasury, {{in order to be able}} to reimburse Evelyn and recover his own losses. He complained that the Russians had caused considerable damage to his house, with [...] "much of the furniture broke, lost or destroyed". Christopher Wren was instructed to survey the property and declared it [...] "entirely ruined". Benbow lost [...] "twenty fine paintings" [...] and [...] "several fine draughts and other designs relating to the Sea" [...] from his personal property. The Treasury eventually allowed payment of £350 9s. 6d. in compensation.|$|E

500|$|Kaushik and {{his team}} taught the crew [...] "all [...] knew about hockey". In an interview, he later said that he [...] "taught him (Sahni) {{everything}} about the game, starting from how the camp is conducted, how the girls come from different backgrounds and cultures, the psychological factors involved. Also how the coach faces pressure to select girls from different states and teams". After Negi was suggested, the latter assembled a team of hockey players to train the actors. He later said that he [...] "trained the girls for six months. Waking up at 4, traveling from Kandivili to Churchgate. We would retire around 11 in the night. It was tiring. But {{we were on a}} mission ... They couldn't run; couldn't hold the hockey sticks. I ensured none of them [...] cut their nails or eyebrows (as the players do). The girls have worked very hard. I salute them". Some of the actors, such as Chitrashi, Sandia, and Raynia, were cast because they were hockey players. Rob Miller was the Sport Action Director, and worked with Negi to train the actors. About working with Khan, Negi recalled that everything was planned [...] "including the penalty stroke that SRK missed. That shot alone took us nearly 20 hours as I was keen that it should be very realistic. I took the help of a lot of <b>my</b> <b>former</b> teammates. But more importantly, it was so easy working with SRK. He is unbelievably modest and was willing to do as many re-takes as we wanted".|$|E
2500|$|The {{rivalry between}} the two clubs {{intensified}} following the hiring of Dusty Baker to manage the Cubs following the 2002 season. In 2002, when Baker was managing the San Francisco Giants, he and Cardinals manager Tony La Russa had run-ins during that year's National League Championship Series, with the animosity carrying over to Baker's tenure with the Cubs. According to Baker, part of the intensity stems from the close relationship of the two. [...] "It's very intense...When you play 18 times against a team that's had a long-time rivalry, and <b>my</b> <b>former</b> manager and <b>my</b> <b>former</b> confidant, that just increases things."
