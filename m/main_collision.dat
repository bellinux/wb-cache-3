40|$|The early optical {{emission}} of the moderately high redshift ($z= 3. 08 $) GRB 060607 A shows a remarkable broad and strong peak with a rapid rise and a relatively slow power-law decay. It is not coincident {{with the strong}} early-time flares seen in the X-ray and gamma-ray energy bands. There is weak evidence for variability superposed on this dominant component in several optical bands that {{can be related to}} flares in high energy bands. While for a small number of GRBs, well-sampled optical flares have been observed simultaneously with X-ray and gamma ray pulses, GRB 060607 A {{is one of the few}} cases where the early optical emission shows no significant evidence for correlation with the prompt emission. In this work we first report in detail the broad band observations of this burst by Swift. Then by applying a simple model for the dynamics and the synchrotron radiation of a relativistic shock, we show that the dominant component of the early emissions in optical wavelengths has the same origin as the tail emission produced after the main gamma ray activity. The most plausible explanation for the peak in the optical light curve seems to be the cooling of the prompt after the <b>main</b> <b>collisions,</b> shifting the characteristic synchrotron frequency to the optical bands. It seems that the cooling process requires a steepening of the electron energy distribution and/or a break in this distribution at high energies. The sharp break in the X-ray light curve at few thousands of seconds after the trigger, is not observed in the IR/optical/UV bands, and therefore can not be a jet break. Either the X-ray break is due to a change in the spectrum of the accelerated electrons or the lack of an optical break is due to the presence of a related delayed response component (Abbreviated).

The results showed that the probability of rear-end crashes increases when the driver is distracted due to the presence of passengers or usage of cell phone. In-vehicle activities increase the probability of collision with fixed objects in comparison with angular crashes.

Such lasers are not available today, but hopefully they will appear by the time when linear colliders will be built. High energy γγ, γe colliders with the luminosity comparable to that in e + e − collisions are beyond the competition in study of many phenomena of particle physics. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} set of {{analytic}} fits to the radii of pre-mainsequence stars in the mass range 0. 1 < M/Msun < 8. 0. We incorporate the formulae in N-body cluster models for evolution {{from the beginning of}} pre-main sequence. In models with 1, 000 stars and high initial cluster densities, pre-mainsequence evolution causes roughly twice the number of collisions between stars than in similar models with evolution begun only from the zero-age <b>main</b> sequence. The <b>collisions</b> are often all part of a runaway sequence that creates one relatively massive star. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, accepted by PAS...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the tracks}} {{straightened}} {{ahead of the}} HST train, the driver observed a Class 59 locomotive a mile in distance, moving [...] "at a funny angle" [...] and realised to his horror that it was crossing the Up Main line. The EWS-operated freight train was coming from London on the Down Relief line, hauling twenty empty bogie hopper wagons, and permitted to cross Southall East Junction on its way into Southall Yard, south of the <b>main</b> lines. A <b>collision</b> was now inevitable. The HST was travelling at 125 mph, and could not stop in time even under emergency braking.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, the Australia-New Guinea {{tectonic plate}} {{collided}} with the Eurasian plate to the north. The collision caused {{the northern part of}} the continent to buckle upwards, forming the high and rugged mountains of New Guinea and, by reverse (downwards) buckling, the Torres Strait that now separates the two <b>main</b> landmasses. The <b>collision</b> also pushed up the islands of Wallacea, which served as island 'stepping-stones' that allowed plants from Southeast Asia's rainforests to colonise New Guinea, and some plants from Australia-New Guinea to move into Southeast Asia. The ocean straits between the islands were narrow enough to allow plant dispersal, but served as an effective barrier to exchange of land mammals between Australia-New Guinea and Asia.|$|R
