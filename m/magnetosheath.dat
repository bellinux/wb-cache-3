5|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. The distance from the magnetopause {{to the center of}} the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ (where RJ=71,492km is the radius of Jupiter) at the subsolar point—the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer. The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130RJ from the planet's center) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the <b>magnetosheath.</b>|$|E

These two trains represent a class of compressive fluctuations in the heliosheath.

The magnetopause distance from the planet's center at the subsolar point varies widely from 16 to 27Rs (Rs=60,330km is the equatorial radius of Saturn). The magnetopause's position depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. The average magnetopause standoff distance is about 22Rs.

40|$|We discuss two {{different}} physical processes that create localized high β plasma regions. One is nonlinear wave-steepening, generating magnetic decreases (MDs) by a ponderomotive force. The {{other is the}} mirror instability generating alternating high and low β plasma regions. It is demonstrated that MDs and mirror modes are observationally quite different structures. MDs spatially occur in interplanetary space and mirror modes primarily in planetary <b>magnetosheaths.</b> MDs are characterized by: 1) variable (exponentially decreasing number with increasing) angular changes, 2) variable (exponentially decreasing) thicknesses, and 3) no characteristic inter-event spacings. In sharp contrast, mirror modes are characterized by: 1) little or no angular changes across the structures, 2) a characteristic scale size, and 3) are quasiperiodic in nature. Arguments are presented for the recently observed magnetic dips in the heliosheath being mirror mode structures. The sources of free energy for instability are discussed.

50|$|Magnetic {{clouds are}} one of the most {{important}} drivers of stormy space weather at Earth. Understanding how they interact with the Earth’s environment in order to predict their effects in the geospace is therefore of paramount importance for space weather forecasting. The orientation of their magnetic field, and in particular the presence of a southward Bz component, which is favourable to reconnection with the Earth’s magnetic field, are key to determining whether a magnetic cloud will trigger a geomagnetic storm.The magnetic field of magnetic clouds is usually measured by spacecraft such as ACE or Wind near the Sun-Earth first Lagrangian point. However, before reaching the magnetopause where their field can reconnect with the terrestrial magnetic field, magnetic clouds first cross the outer regions of the magnetosphere, namely the bow shock and the <b>magnetosheath,</b> which may alter their properties and thus lead to incorrect space weather forecasting.Using an extensive data base of spacecraft observations during magnetic cloud events, extending over the first 14 years of the Cluster mission and including also data from the Double-Star TC1, THEMIS, Geotail and Interball-Tail missions, we have investigated whether the magnetic field of magnetic clouds was altered when crossing the bow shock and the <b>magnetosheath.</b> The analysis of 82 magnetic clouds with simultaneous observations in the solar wind and the <b>magnetosheath</b> shows that their magnetic field direction can be significantly modified when the bow shock is in a so-called quasi-parallel configuration, i.e. when the upstream magnetic field is almost aligned with the bow shock normal. In some cases, the Bz component of the magnetic field can even change sign across the bow shock, with a northward Bz becoming southward in the <b>magnetosheath</b> or vice-versa. Opposite Bz signs in the solar wind and the <b>magnetosheath</b> are observed for about half an hour in some events. Using a semi-analytical model of the <b>magnetosheath,</b> we estimate that the reversed Bz would affect 20% of the dayside magnetopause. This may have strong implications as to where reconnection would take place at the magnetopause. More work is still needed to check whether this could have sizeable effects on the development of magnetic storms triggered by such magnetic clouds.|$|E

Fast survey mode plasma data from the THEMIS satellites are used to solve the puzzle of how mirror structures in the form of dips can be observed in the regions of mirror stable plasma.

With the aim to {{understand}} {{the origin of the}} pressure-balanced magnetic structures in the form of holes and humps commonly observed in the solar wind and planetary <b>magnetosheaths,</b> high-resolution hybrid numerical simulations of the Vlasov-Maxwell (VM) equations using both Lagrangian (particle in cells) and Eulerian integration schemes are presented and compared with asymptotic and phenomenological models for the nonlinear mirror mode dynamics. It turns out that magnetic holes do not result from direct nonlinear saturation of the mirror instability that rather leads to magnetic humps. Nevertheless, both above and below threshold, there exist stable solutions of the VM equations in the form of large-amplitude magnetic holes. Special attention is paid to the skewness of the magnetic fluctuations (that is negative for holes and positive for humps) and its dependency on the distance to threshold and the beta of the plasma. Furthermore, the long-time evolution of magnetic humps resulting from the mirror instability in an extended domain far enough from threshold may, when the beta of the plasma is not too large, eventually lead to the formation of magnetic holes. 1...|$|R

The region between the shock and the obstacle is the sheath, where the {{supersonic flow}} is compressed, heated, decelerated, and deflected. Supersonic flows, obstacles, and thus sheaths are observed on many scales throughout the Universe. We compare three examples seen in the heliosphere, illustrating {{the interaction of the}} solar wind with obstacles of three very different scales lengths. <b>Magnetosheaths</b> form behind planetary bow shocks on scales ranging from tens to 100 planetary radii. ICME sheath form behind shocks driven by solar disturbances on scale lengths of a few to tens of AU.

Despite this range in scales some common features have been observed. Magnetic holes, possibly due to mirror mode waves, have been observed in all three of these sheaths. Plasma depletion layers are observed in planetary and ICME sheaths. Other features observed in some sheaths are wave activity (ion cyclotron, plasma), energetic particles, transmission of Alfven waves/shocks, tangential discontinuities turbulence behind quasi-parallel shocks, standing slow mode waves, and reconnection on the obstacle boundary.

40|$|Abstract. Short {{dropouts}} of {{the magnetic}} field intensity have been frequently observed in the solar wind on interplanetary spacecraft. But so far {{it could not be}} established whether these are caused by kinetic instabilities or whether they can be described as solitary MHD waves. The multi-satellite observations of the Cluster-mission allow {{for the first time to}} measure proton and electron distributions with a sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to tackle this question. We use measurements by the FGM magnetometer, the CIS ion spectrometer, the PEACE electron instrument and the Whisper plasma wave instrument to investigate the role of protons, heavy ions and electrons for the stability of the structures. We also use the 4 -satellite observations of the Cluster magnetic field instrument to determine the proper motion of these structures relative to the solar wind. The presence of foreshock waves close to the Earth bowshock strongly limits the event selection. In the current paper we discuss a 10 s linear wave without sufficient particle data resolution and a 4 min wave for which particle distributions are available. The larger wave shows that the stability of the structure might be caused by changes in the thermal electron distributions while proton and α distributions are unaffected. MAGNETIC HOLES- SOLITONS?

These waves are linearly polarized and they are frequently observed in heliospheric plasma, in particular in different sheath structures. They are the most widely studied in the planetary <b>magnetosheaths,</b> but also found in cometosheaths and in the heliosheath. In addition, mirror mode waves are reported to also occur in CME-driven sheaths. The knowledge of mirror modes in CME-driven sheaths is, however, very limited despite {{of the fact that they}} might contribute to regulating the CME sheath plasma on a global scale, and also a ect the geoeffectivity of CME-driven sheaths as well as the modulation and acceleration of energetic particles. As of yet, no statistical studies of mirror modes in CME-driven sheaths exist. In this thesis, a background to the basic physical plasma phenomena and structures in the heliosphere is given by briegly discussing the solar wind, interplanetary shocks and sheath regions. The central focus of this thesis is however on CME-driven sheath regions and the mirror mode wave occurrence in them. CME-driven sheaths are turbulent plasma regions between the CME ejecta and its preceding interplanetary shock. This thesis discusses the differences between CME-driven sheaths and other heliospheric sheaths. In addition, mirror modes are considered in detail by presenting the theory of mirror instability in both fluid and kinetic descriptions and by discussing the fundamental features of mirror modes in other heliospheric sheaths regions. The previous studies of mirror modes and the methods applied in them are also widely presented. A program that identifies mirror mode structures from the magnetic field data of a spacecraft is constructed for this thesis. In the identification process, the program applies the linear polarization of mirror modes and the knowledge of the angular change of the magnetic field direction across a mirror mode structure. This new, almost fully automatic program combines previous mirror mode identification methods in a novel way, thus creating a new method for detecting and studying mirror modes in CME-driven sheath regions, as well as in other sheath regions. In this thesis, the constructed program is applied to perform a statistical study of mirror mode waves in CME-driven sheaths. Mirror modes were discovered to be common structures, but similar to the planetary <b>magnetosheaths.</b> They occupy only a relatively small part of the CME sheath. The results show that in CME-driven sheaths mirror modes are generally low amplitude structures that typically occur as trains of two or three mirror mode waves.
