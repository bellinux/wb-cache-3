50|$|The need {{to brake}} is {{sometimes}} caused by unpredictable events. At higher speeds, {{there is less}} time to allow vehicles to slow down by coasting.

25|$|In the 1990s, {{thermoelectric}} {{generation has}} come to lead a system that was dominated by hydropower: Hydropower plant capacity has gone from 90 percent to only 30 percent. The reasons for this shift are twofold. First, hydroelectric development became more expensive when funding through interest-free loans for its development from International financial institutions was cut. Second, the lower risks and shorter maturity of thermal generation projects, as perceived by private investors, directed generation expansion towards the use of heavy fuel oil and <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> diesels.|$|E
25|$|Honda's early hybrids {{including}} the first generation Insight used this design, leveraging their reputation for design of small, efficient gasoline engines; their system is dubbed Integrated Motor Assist (IMA). Starting with the 2006 Civic Hybrid, the IMA system now can propel the vehicle solely on electric power during <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> cruising. Another example is the 2005–2007 Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid, a full-size pickup truck. Chevrolet {{was able to get}} a 10% improvement on the Silverado's fuel efficiency by shutting down and restarting the engine on demand and using regenerative braking. General Motors has also used its mild BAS Hybrid technology in other models such as the Saturn Vue Green Line, the Saturn Aura Greenline and the Malibu Hybrid.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a {{simulation}} {{environment for the}} Common Packet Channel has been designed and implemented in Matlab, where the link level performance has been studied. The simulator is restricted to layer 1, and specifically to mapping from transport channel to physical channel, modulation, air interface, demodulation and decoding. It is shown that for <b>medium</b> <b>speeds</b> (50 km/h), long TTI and power control both increases the performance significantly. For higher speeds (120 km/h) the performance gain, using long TTI and power control, is low. Two channel estimation approaches have been studied: one slot based and one symbol based. It is shown that the difference in performance is low for low and <b>medium</b> <b>speeds,</b> whereas high speeds degrades the performance dramatically using the slot based channel estimation. Matlab {{has proven to be}} fast enough for simulating link level performances. The high level programming leading to short implementation time is advantageous while very complex systems may be hard to develop efficiently in Matlab.

This paper presents the experimental results on the lean operational limits of Recardo E 6 engine using gasoline, LPG, NG and hydrogen as fuels. The first appearance of almost motoring cycle was used to define the engine lean limit after the fuel flow was reduced gradually. The effects of compression ratio, engine speed and spark timing on the engine operational limits are presented and discussed in detailed. Increasing compression ratio (CR) extend the lean limits, this appears obviously with hydrogen, which has {{a wide range of}} equivalence ratios, while for hydrocarbon fuel octane number affect gasoline, so it can' t work above CR= 9 : 1, and for LPG it reaches CR= 12 : 1, NG reaches CR= 15 : 1 at lean limit operation.
