60|$|The sign-post {{informed}} him--a statement strenuously {{denied by}} the twin-blisters--that {{the distance to}} Little Weeting was {{one and a half}} miles. Lord Belpher's view of it was that it was nearer fifty. He dragged himself along wearily. It was simpler now to keep Maud in sight, for the road ran straight: but, there being a catch in everything in this world, the process was also messier. In order to avoid being seen, it was necessary for Percy to leave the road and tramp along in the deep ditch which ran parallel to it. There is nothing half-hearted about these ditches which accompany English country roads. They know they are intended to be ditches, not mere furrows, and they behave as such. The one that sheltered Lord Belpher was so deep that only his head and neck protruded above the level of the road, and so dirty that a bare twenty yards of travel was sufficient to coat him with <b>mud.</b> <b>Rain,</b> once fallen, is reluctant to leave the English ditch. It nestles inside it for weeks, forming a rich, oatmeal-like substance which has to be stirred to be believed. Percy stirred it. He churned it. He ploughed and sloshed through it. The mud stuck to him like a brother.|$|E

The <b>mud,</b> <b>rain</b> and tolerant eye of referee Barry Gomersall combined to form an explosive mix. Progress was arduous in the SCG quagmire and handling almost impossible.|$|E

50|$|Tromsø IL drew Galatasaray in {{the first}} round of the UEFA Cup. Former champions Galatasaray, became the second major European club to fall victim to Tromsø's cold Arctic climate. Tromsø IL won 1-0 at home after a goal by Tamas Szekeres in the 77th minute, in a match filled with <b>mud,</b> <b>rain,</b> and snow. Tromsø IL tied Galatasaray 1-1 at the feared Ali Sami Yen Stadium, thanks to many {{important}} saves by Lars Hirschfeld and a goal {{in the first}} half from a fluke shot by Patrice Bernier via Stephen Ademolu which was an obvious offside. Tromsø IL thus advanced to the group stage of the cup. This result was seen by many as a huge upset, and some Tromsø IL fans and players immediately declared it a historic win, likening it to the 1996 Norwegian cup championship and the 1985 promotion.|$|E
40|$|A <b>mud</b> <b>rain</b> {{event is}} {{observed}} in February, 1882 {{across a wide}} area of Japan's main island. Records and articles in several newspapers that written at Kyoto, Mie, Gifu, Aichi, Nagano, Tokyo, Chiba, Ibaraki Prefectures and so on, are transcribed to characterize the <b>mud</b> <b>rain</b> event. The records mostly described that something like ash, sand or mud fallen and accumulated. One article described that the night is like the one without moon. Although there was a rumor that the <b>mud</b> <b>rain</b> {{is caused by a}} volcano eruption, volcano eruption is not officially reported in the period. The point of observation seems to migrate from west to east in three days. The <b>mud</b> <b>rain</b> estimated to be brought by (1) ash fall from a volcano eruption, (2) Asian dust, or (3) local dust storm...|$|E

We analyzed several episodes of <b>mud</b> <b>rain</b> events during the period 2001 - 2005 on two mountainous, background sites. The <b>mud</b> <b>rain</b> events related to Saharan dust outbreaks were identi-fied using Earth Probe/Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aero-sol index (AI) data and backwards trajectories.

30|$|Witness reports {{suggest that}} the depositional {{condition}} was relatively dry at the initial phase. Relatively dry conditions can give rise to dry aggregates such as loosely bound particle clusters, characterized by low densities and irregular morphologies (e.g., Sorem 1982). Moisture, electrostatic attraction, or mechanical interlocking {{may play a role}} in the formation of such dry aggregates (Carey and Sigurdsson 1982). With time, water may arise from the condensation of the water vapor directly onto the ash particles in the eruption plume, or from liquid drops ejected with the rock fragments. The growth of wet aggregates depends critically on the ability of the dynamics of these liquid bridges that dissipate the kinetic energy of particle collisions and promote the capture of finer particles (Iveson and Litster 1998). In the later phases of the Ontake eruption, the products changed to show a feature of wet deposition as exemplified by the <b>mud</b> <b>rain.</b> When water is present, the mixture becomes oversaturated and the aggregates collapse into structureless slurry or <b>mud</b> <b>rain</b> (e.g., Van Eaton et al. 2012) rather than form individual solid spherical particles such as accretionary lapilli. It is unlikely that accumulation of slurry generates distinct textures; however, the grain-size characteristic of the grains composing the aggregates may be reflected in the entire deposit characteristics as FP.|$|E
30|$|On {{the surface}} of a GNSS {{instrument}} (REGMOS) installed by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (Fig.  2), ash fall tracks were recorded as grime formed by droplets of mud or <b>mud</b> <b>rain</b> (Fig.  10 b). The track direction implies that the droplets came from the vent area. From the tracks, the average droplet diameter is estimated to have been approximately 2  mm. Since the fall velocity of a droplet of this size is estimated to be approximately 7  m/s (Beard 1977) and the angle between the ash fall tracks and the vertical line was approximately 60 °, the wind velocity is estimated to have been 12  m/s (=[*] 7 [*]×[*]tan 60 °). We observed no such wind gusts during our stay in the area from 1  h later than this time. Based on this observation, we suspect that the vent proximal area may have been covered by a very dilute base surge, which contained droplets of mud. This is also implied by the sudden droplet fall on the time-lapse camera installed northwest of the vent area, while wind was generally blowing from the north on June 29.|$|E
40|$|The {{aggregation}} {{of volcanic}} ash particles within the eruption column of explosive eruptions {{has been observed}} at many volcanoes. It influences the residence time of ash in the atmosphere and the radiative properties of the umbrella cloud. However, {{the information on the}} processes leading to aggregate formation are still either lacking or very incomplete. We examine the fate of ash particles through numerical experiments with the plume model ATHAM (Active Tracer High resolution Atmospheric Model) {{in order to determine the}} conditions that promote ash particle aggregation. In this paper we describe the microphysics and parameterization of ash and hydrometeors. In a companion paper (this issue) we use this information in a series of numerical experiments. The parameterization includes the condensation of water vapor in the rising eruption column. The formation of liquid and solid hydrometeors and the effect of latent heat release on the eruption column dynamics are considered. The interactions of hydrometeors and volcanic ash within the eruption column that lead to aggregate formation are simulated for the first time within a rising eruption column. The microphysical parameterization follows a modal approach. The hydrometeors are described by two size classes, each of which is divided into a liquid and a frozen category. By analogy with the hydrometeor classification, we specify four categories of volcanic ash particles. We imply that volcanic particles are active as condensation nuclei for water and ice formation. Ash can be contained in all categories of hydrometeors, thus forming mixed particles of any composition reaching from <b>mud</b> <b>rain</b> to accretionary lapilli. Collisions are caused by gravitational capture of particles with different fall velocity. Coalescence of hydrometeor–ash aggregates is assumed to be a function of the hydrometeor mass fraction within the mixed particles. The parameterization also includes simplified descriptions of electrostatics and salinity effects...|$|E
