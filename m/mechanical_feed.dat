50|$|The M2 has varying cyclic {{rates of}} fire, {{depending}} on the model. The M2HB (heavy barrel) air-cooled ground gun has a cyclical rate of 450-575 rounds per minute. The early M2 water-cooled AA guns had a cyclical rate of around 450-600 rpm. The AN/M2 aircraft gun has a cyclic rate of 750-850 rpm; this increases to 1,200 rpm or more for AN/M3 aircraft guns fitted with electric or <b>mechanical</b> <b>feed</b> boost mechanisms. These maximum rates of fire are generally not achieved in use, as sustained fire at that rate will wear out the bore within a few thousand rounds, necessitating replacement. In addition to full automatic, the M2HB can be selected to fire single-shots or at less than 40 rounds per minute, or rapid fire for more than 40 rounds per minute. Slow and rapid firing modes use 5-7 round bursts with different lengths of pause between bursts.|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} thermofluidic pump {{technology that}} is powered by heat, rather than by electrical or mechanical power. The objective {{is to improve the}} performance of heat-recovery by Organic Rankine Cycles, by using a recently-proposed thermofluidic pump. The thermofluidic pump promises low-cost, high-reliability, and, since it does not consume any of the power produced by the expander, improved return on investment. No performance data for the new thermofluidic pump have been reported previously, therefore a thermodynamic model is derived and used to evaluate performance metrics that characterise pump operation {{and its impact on the}} overall cycle efficiency. Improved pump configurations are then developed and analysed. A two-stage pump configuration is presented that enhances the thermal efficiency of the cycle. An economiser is also proposed in order to obtain boiler efficiencies similar to those for <b>mechanical</b> <b>feed</b> pumps. It has been shown that the cycle efficiency with the two-stage pump is maximum when there is no net heat input in the intermediate evaporator. The resulting thermal efficiency exceeds the best-possible efficiency that is obtainable with an ideal mechanical pump. The relative improvement in cycle efficiency achieved with the two-stage thermofluidic pump is greatest for low-temperature cycles operating below 100 °C, for which the back work ratio is usually higher and the efficiencies of electro-mechanical feed pumps are poorer – yielding a relative increase of the cycle efficiency by up to 30 %...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} address key {{technologies}} under {{development at the}} NASA Glenn Research Center designed to provide architecture-level impacts. Specifically, we will describe deployable antennas, {{a new type of}} phased array antenna and novel power amplifiers. The evaluation of architectural influence can be conducted from two perspectives where said architecture can be analyzed from either the top-down to determine the areas where technology improvements will be most beneficial or from the bottom-up where each technology s performance advancement can affect the overall architecture s performance. This paper will take the latter approach with focus on some technology improvement challenges and address architecture impacts. For example, using data rate as a performance metric, future exploration scenarios are expected to demand data rates possibly exceeding 1 Gbps. To support these advancements in a Mars scenario, as an example, Ka-band and antenna aperture sizes on the order of 10 meters will be required from Mars areostationary platforms. Key technical challenges for a large deployable antenna include maximizing the ratio of deployed-to-packaged volume, minimizing aerial density, maintaining RMS surface accuracy to within 1 / 20 of a wavelength or better, and developing reflector rigidization techniques. Moreover, the high frequencies and large apertures manifest a new problem for microwave engineers that are familiar to optical communications specialists: pointing.

At the landing the wood has been differentiated in two types. The type from the yards “fts 1, 3, 5 ” were 2 meters length trunks and the other type from the yards “fts 2, 4, 6 ” were chips for energy production. For the 2 meters length trunks the transport has been done by truck with 16 t of load capacity, and hydraulic crane.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the ITER {{electron}} cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) upper port launcher is to stabilize the neoclassical tearing mode (NTM) by driving currents (co-ECCD) locally inside either the q= 3 / 2 or 2 island 1. A narrow current deposition profile along with a wide steering range is required to deposit current inside all islands forming at relevant flux surfaces over the wide spectra of possible ITER plasma equilibria. The ITER launcher reference design uses a front steering (FS) mirror that provides optimum focusing for NTM stabilisation and the possibility for a wide steering range. A two-mirror system (focusing and steering) decouples the steering and focusing functions of the launcher for enhanced performance 2 over that of a remote steering concept. The steering mechanism uses a frictionless system 3, flexure pivots replace traditional bearings and a gas pneumatic actuator replaces <b>mechanical</b> <b>feeds.</b> Two FS launcher designs are under consideration: an NTM launcher providing access over the region in which the NTMs are expected to occur (0. 64 ≤ρψ≤ 0. 93), and an Extended Physics (EP) launcher increasing the access range (0. 40 ≤ρψ≤ 0. 94) seeking a synergy with the equatorial launcher for an enhanced ECH system for ITER 4.

40|$|Copepods are {{the most}} {{important}} metazoan grazers of phytoplankton in the sea. In order to more fully understand the flow of energy from phytoplankton through copepods (and beyond), it is necessary to know what factors modify their feeding. Contrary to the classical paradigm of passive, <b>mechanical</b> <b>feeding</b> by copepods, copepods are quite selective in their preferred prey. Some of this selectivity appears to be mediated by chemicals produced by their phytoplankton prey. Knowing the time required for selectivity to occur and the persistence of that selectivity should give us a better understanding of copepod sensory and decision-making capabilities. Some members of the marine phytoplankton, particularly some dinoflagellates, produce toxic (or noxious) chemicals. The biosynthesis, biochemical modes of action, and structures of some of these chemicals are known, but virtually nothing is known about the natural function of these toxins. One of the likely functions is chemical defense against herbivores. Chemically-defended dinoflagellates may be selectively avoided, and preferred cells selectively ingested. If true, then chemical defense may provide an ecological advantage over co-occurring undefended cells. Otherwise, all cells may be equally rejected or accepted, thus conferring no advantage on the defended cell. The goal of my doctoral dissertation research was to investigate the physiological and behavioral aspects of the feeding biology of Calanus pacificus vis a vis the presence of noxious dinoflagellates. In addition, I studied the significance of chemical defense to the noxious dinoflagellate Gonyaulax grindleyi...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn tube hydroforming, the {{concurrent}} actions of pressurized fluid and <b>mechanical</b> <b>feeding</b> allows obtaining tube shapes characterized by complex geometries such as different diameters sections and/or bulged zones. Main process parameters are material feeding history (i. e., the punches velocity history), internal pressure path during the process, and (in T- or Y-shaped tube hydroforming) counterpunch action. What is crucial, in such processes, {{is the proper}} design of operative parameters aimed to avoid defects (for instance underfilling or ductile fractures). Actually, the design of tube hydroforming operations is mainly aimed to prevent bursting or buckling occurrence and such issues can be pursued only if a proper control of process parameters is performed. In this paper, a design procedure for Y-shaped tube hydroforming operations was developed. The aim of the presented approach is to calibrate both internal pressure history during the process and counterpunch action in order to reach a sound final component. The approach utilized to optimize the aforementioned parameters is founded on gradient-based techniques and the optimization problem here addressed depends on a considerable number of design variables. In order to reduce the total number of numerical simulations/experiments necessary to reach the optimal values of the design variables, the basic idea {{of this paper is to}} develop a sort of decomposition approach aimed to take into account subsets of design variables in the most effective way. The proposed decomposition approach allows avoiding about 50 % of the numerical simulations necessary to solve the same problem by traditional gradient technique...|$|R

40|$|A new {{conceptual}} framework {{has been developed}} which explains the formation of shear-related casting defects such as porosity, segregation and tears. The theory relates defect formation to the mechanical behaviour of the partially solidified microstructure when shear stresses are developed during the filling of a casting and by the subsequent feeding processes during solidification. Two transition points, the dendrite coherency point and the maximum packing solid fraction, divide the mushy zone into three regions of different <b>mechanical</b> and <b>feeding</b> behaviours. The response of the mush to shear {{is related to the}} presence of these zones during solidification of a casting. The resulting defects are rationalized by considering the governing local shear stress and shear rate, local strength and time available for fluid flow. The design of the casting, the casting process used and the alloy composition all influence the relative importance of shearing on defect formation. (C) 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc.
