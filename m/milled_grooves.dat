40|$|Abstract: In the {{injection}} moulding process, productivity and part quality depend {{largely on the}} cooling system of {{the injection}} mould. Several cooling methods are being adopted by the mould industry, with the straight-drilled cooling channels method being the most popular. Many reported research activities {{have been based on}} this method, but the method has several limitations that prevent it from achieving e¤cient and uniform cooling. In the present work, a U-shape milled groove method was proposed for large and complicated parts, especially for parts with large free-formed surfaces. Simulations were made to compare the cooling eVect of U-shape <b>milled</b> <b>grooves</b> with that of straight cooling channels using COSMOS/DESIGNSTAR, an analysis software based on the ®nite element method (FEM). The heat ¯ux was calculated on a cycle-averaged basis and the natural convection between ambient air and the exterior mould surface was ignored. A mouse cover was used as a case study. The U-shape <b>milled</b> <b>grooves</b> were found to have better temperature control than straight cooling channels. The temperature distributions of the core and cavity with U-shape <b>milled</b> <b>grooves</b> were more uniform than with straight cooling channels. Moreover, the U-shape <b>milled</b> <b>grooves</b> removed the heat e¤ciently; the mould temperature was lower than that with straight cooling channels. The U-shape <b>milled</b> <b>grooves</b> method has demonstrated its advantages in mould cooling. Although U-shape <b>milled</b> <b>grooves</b> need to be machined using computer numerical control (CNC) machines and more machining time is required, making them more expensive than straight cooling channels, their potential bene®ts will be explored for practical applications...|$|E
40|$|Ga {{diffusion}} from focused {{ion beam}} (FIB) <b>milled</b> <b>grooves</b> has been studied using x-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and mirror electron microscopy (MEM). We analyze the surface chemistry of the FIB structures measuring the Ga presence in the top layers of the <b>milled</b> <b>grooves</b> and morphological defects inside the grooves. The Ga is initially strictly confined to the grooves. However, annealing at temperatures as low as 150 degrees C leads to rapid and significant Ga surface diffusion from the FIB structures. The out-diffused Ga forms a thin layer extending up to several microns laterally in a non-regular pattern. The diffusion is significantly enhanced at small crystallites {{at the edges of}} the grooves. We explain the general behavior with an atomic scale model in which interstitial Ga in the milled areas diffuses out and substitutes silanol groups on the surface...|$|E

40|$|Electrochemical {{machining}} (ECM) of carbide metals, e. g. tungsten carbide, {{is highly}} challenging compared to ECM of metals, because these materials are composites of covalently bound carbides {{embedded in a}} metallic binder matrix. In the ECM process dissolving and passivating effects occur simultaneously and dissimilarly. Nora Schubert et al. Investigated a mixed electrolyte consisting of aqueous solutions of sodium nitrate (1. 2 mol/l) and sodium hydroxide (0. 6 mol/l), which is suitable for electrochemical shaping of tungsten carbide with cobalt binder [1]. In this study Jet Electrochemical Machining (Jet-ECM) of three different tungsten carbide alloys applying the mentioned mixed electrolyte is presented. The metallic binder of the hard metals is cobalt {{at a ratio of}} 6 %. The investigated materials differ with regard {{to the size of the}} carbide grains. Machining experiments in Jet-EC milling were accomplished to investigate the influence of the applied voltage as well as and the milling speed on the eroded structures.

40|$|In {{materials}} processing, {{quality and}} productivity are notably important {{and must be}} controlled for each product type produced. In the injection molding process, quality is measured as the extent of warpage of molded parts and productivity is {{measured in terms of}} the molding cycle time. This paper presents a new design of <b>milled</b> <b>grooved</b> square shape (MGSS) conformal cooling channels, which provide more uniformity in cooling with a larger effective cooling surface area compared to circular and other types of cooling channels with a similar cross-section. This study examined the warpage of molded parts, and the cooling time, which affected the molding cycle time. A case study involving a front panel housing was performed, and the performance design of the MGSS conformal cooling channels was compared to that of conventional straight-drilled cooling channels by simulation using Autodesk Moldflow Insight 2013 and validated experimentally. The result of MGSS conformal cooling channels is in a good agreement with the result of simulation. The MGSS conformal cooling channels reduced the warpage in both x and y directions by 14 % to 54 % and improved the cooling time by 65 % compared to straight-drilled cooling channels...|$|R

40|$|Warpage is {{a common}} issue in an {{injection}} moulding process due to non-uniform temperature variation causing differential shrinkage on the moulded parts. In designing moulds for injection molding process, {{it is very difficult}} to achieve efficient cooling with uniform thermal distribution. Most of researchers focus on an optimisation of processing parameters to improve the warpage. However, the conformal cooling channels have advantages with the uniform distance between center of cooling channels and mould surfaces in order to get a better thermal distribution thus reducing the warpage. This paper presents the <b>Milled</b> <b>Grooved</b> Square Shape (MGSS) conformal cooling channels which provide more uniform in cooling and have a bigger effective cooling surface area cross sectional area and comparing to circular and others type of cooling channels with similar cross section. A case study on front panel housing is investigated and the possibility of fabrication the conformal cooling channels on hard tooling for injection moulding process which is easier to design, fabricate and assemble compared to other method are presented. The performance designs of straight drilled are compared to the two types of MGSS conformal cooling channels by using Autodesk Moldflow Insight (AMI) 2012. The analyses show that the both types of MGSS conformal cooling channel suggested can provide a more uniform thermal distribution and able to reduce the warpage on the molded part compared to the straight drilled cooling channels...|$|R

50|$|A {{horizontal}} mill has {{the same}} sort but the cutters are mounted on a horizontal spindle (see Arbor milling) across the table. Many horizontal mills also feature a built-in rotary table that allows milling at various angles; this feature is called a universal table. While endmills and the other types of tools available to a vertical mill {{may be used in}} a horizontal mill, their real advantage lies in arbor-mounted cutters, called side and face mills, which have a cross section rather like a circular saw, but are generally wider and smaller in diameter. Because the cutters have good support from the arbor and have a larger cross-sectional area than an end mill, quite heavy cuts can be taken enabling rapid material removal rates. These are used to <b>mill</b> <b>grooves</b> and slots. Plain mills are used to shape flat surfaces. Several cutters may be ganged together on the arbor to mill a complex shape of slots and planes. Special cutters can also cut grooves, bevels, radii, or indeed any section desired. These specialty cutters tend to be expensive. Simplex mills have one spindle, and duplex mills have two. It is also easier to cut gears on a horizontal mill. Some horizontal milling machines are equipped with a power-take-off provision on the table. This allows the table feed to be synchronized to a rotary fixture, enabling the milling of spiral features such as hypoid gears.|$|R

40|$|Many new {{rotary files}} {{systems have been}} introduced, however, limited {{research}} has been conducted related to the surface irregularities of these files and if these have any effects on the files themselves. Hence, the aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze surface irregularities of the ProTaper® Universal rotary files (PTU) and the ProTaper Next? rotary files (PTN) before and after instrumentation in curved canals. The main objective was to investigate the nature of these irregularities and how they might influence the use and fracture of rotary files during root-canal treatments. The files were examined pre-operatively using a stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) to analyze surface imperfections and the presence of particles. Mesial roots of forty extracted mandibular molars were selected. Each instrument was used to prepare one of the mesial canals. The files were then rinsed with alcohol, and autoclaved and analyzed again. Of the 80 files used in this study, five files fractured, five files unwound and seven files were curved or bent and they all belonged to the PTU group. Irregularities and debris could be visualized with the SEM on both unused PTU and PTN files. Most of the debris was found associated with deeper <b>milling</b> <b>grooves</b> and defects on the surface of the metal. Surface analysis of the files that were used and sterilized were performed and the SEM images demonstrated organic debris, metal flash, and crack formation and initiation of fractures for both file types. All files showed machining grooves, metal flash, debris, and defects on cutting edges. These irregularities appear to be critical in the accumulation of debris and initiation of fatigue and crack propagation within the NiTi alloy. The accumulation of debris could be a concern due to the potential exchange of organic debris between patients...|$|R
