[...] Atlantic Monthly's reviewer said that the book was [...] "excellently written". and Choice Magazine called Angelou a [...] "fine story teller". [...] Cudjoe calls the book [...] "neither politically nor linguistically innocent". Although Cudjoe finds Gather Together a weaker autobiography compared to Caged Bird, he states that Angelou's use of language is [...] "the work's saving grace", and that it contains [...] "a much more consistent and sustained flow of eloquent and honey-dipped writing".|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) {{if you go back to}} 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had nothing to do with my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E
500|$|My Name Is <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> <b>was</b> {{met with}} {{universal}} acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 27 reviews. Mike Powell of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "He's still a witty, quietly vicious rapper, capable of tearing apart spare street tracks like [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and [...] "Numbers on the Board" [...] while barely raising his voice. But {{set in the}} more commercial contexts of Kelly Rowland features and the-Dream's fluorescent R, he can sound like a fish out of some pretty expensive water. Who Pusha was is gone, but who he is still sometimes unclear." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "With Pusha's pen at full force and his performance a proper combination of cold and tense, the album is as if Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury were atom-smashed into something more artful and unstable. My Name Is My Name is a remarkable and vital solo debut." [...] Jesse Cataldo, writing for Slant Magazine, said, [...] "Yet despite its pedigree, the album puts too much overall emphasis on guest spots and not enough on establishing a distinctive identity for the rapper. Full of retrograde lyrical conceits, seemingly at odds with its futuristic backdrops, My Name Is My Name {{is a reminder that}} Pusha T hasn't changed, and his stubborn reliance on maintaining his brand is probably not the wisest strategy in today's shifting hip-hop climate." [...] Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "A few poor production choices and uneven sequencing do slow the album, but it shows flashes of real brilliance. The best tracks here are produced by Kanye and Pharrell, and they're concentrated at the beginning and end. The smattering {{in the middle of the}} tracklist is handled by host of collaborators, not all of them effectively complimenting Pusha's rawness. While not the defining statement it could’ve been, My Name Is My Name shows different sides of Pusha T as he becomes a more multidimensional rapper." ...|$|E

They said, [...] "Push is in fighting form, incorporating a mature {{point of view on}} his drug-dealer past while rapping with the confidence of a man who knows the game is his to lose." [...] NME positioned it at number 48 on their list of the 50 best albums of year. They said, My Name Is <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> <b>was</b> the moment Clipse member Pusha T finally hit the home run he promised for so long. The beats snapped hard, the guests including Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross and 2 Chainz glittered and the overall vibe was dirty but triumphant." [...] Paste ranked it number 34 on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013 saying, [...] "each bar has the ferociousness of a lion smelling the scent of fresh blood. Among his contemporaries, Pusha T is the sharp-witted wordsmith who makes you feel like you’re listening to a master at work, devilishly cooking up something as pure and addictive as he possibly can." [...] It was named the third best hip hop album of 2013 by PopMatters. They commented saying, [...] "My Name Is My Name is easily one of the most impressive displays of lyricism of the year and contains some of 2013's best verses, as Pusha shows off his versatility..... The production is minimalistic and intelligently doesn't overshadow Pusha's performance. The beats are big and full of bass, giving life to the album and forming a unique theme, with a reunion with Pharrell triggering a nice blast of nostalgia..... My Name Is My Name has substance, style, and passion, and no doubt is an album that will still be appreciated a decade from now. [...] " [...] Consequence of Sound positioned it at number 44 on their list of the 50 best albums of the year.|$|E
500|$|... "Thirteen O'Clock", by Kornbluth, is {{generally}} regarded as the best story in {{the first issue of}} Stirring; Knight describes it as [...] "a delightful screwball fantasy", and adds that it made Kornbluth's reputation. [...] Other stories from later issues that have been well-received include [...] "The Long Wall", by Lowndes; [...] "The City in the Sofa", [...] "What Sorghum Says", [...] "The Golden Road", and [...] "The Words of Guru", all by Kornbluth; [...] "The Real Thrill" [...] by Blish; and [...] "The Goblins Will Get You", by Michel. Isaac Asimov contributed a story, [...] "The Secret Sense", which appeared in the March 1941 issue of Cosmic. [...] After Wollheim acquired the story, Asimov met with F. Orlin Tremaine, the editor of Comet—a competing science fiction magazine—and discovered that Tremaine was irate at the idea of a magazine that might [...] "siphon readership from magazines that paid" [...] by taking stories without paying the authors. [...] Tremaine felt that any author who contributed a story to these magazines should be blacklisted. Asimov acknowledged that a story of his would be appearing in Cosmic, but told Tremaine that he had been paid for it. [...] In Asimov's autobiographical anthology The Early Asimov he recalls that after hearing Tremaine's comments he requested a token payment of $5 from Wollheim; in Asimov's autobiography In Memory Yet Green the sequence of events is given slightly differently, with Asimov asking Wollheim for payment, or else for the story to be published under a pseudonym, before the story was published. [...] This was requested on the grounds that [...] "even though the story might be worth nothing, <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> worth something". [...] Wollheim reluctantly agreed to a payment of $5, commenting that it was an effective word rate of $2.50 per word, since he was paying only for the use of Asimov's name. [...] Wollheim later commented that because of the payment he could sue Asimov for royalties whenever the latter's name appeared in print.|$|E
500|$|Closing out the year, My Name Is <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> <b>was</b> {{named to}} {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones {{list of the}} 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks {{because of the way}} it was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. If you were the reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the teaspoon of updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash stuff from the likes of his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough to put any album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level. The worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list. If this is what a post-Yeezus world sounds like, sign us up immediately." ...|$|E

Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult for me in the beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> too long.

2500|$|When {{the strike}} broke out, Ceaușescu {{and his wife}} Elena were on a Black Sea vacation.

At first, despite the charged atmosphere, some shouted [...] "Ceaușescu and the miners!", but others yelled [...] "Lupeni '29! Lupeni '29!" [...] (in reference to the Lupeni Strike of 1929, enshrined in the mythology of the Romanian Communist Party), {{in an effort to}} add legitimacy to their cause. Dobre read the list of grievances to Ceaușescu, presenting 26 demands related to work hours, production targets, pensions, supplies, housing and investments. They asked for a restoration of the status quo ante in social legislation, the guarantee of adequate food supplies and medical care, the establishment of workers’ commissions at the enterprise level empowered to dismiss incompetent or corrupt managers, and a pledge of no reprisals against the strikers. After that, Dobre recalled, [...] "While <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> being shouted, I turned toward Ceaușescu, gave him the list from which I had read and he said to me: 'Thank you for informing me, comrade'. Once in front of the microphones, Ceaușescu was not allowed to speak. Some were booing him, others shouted that they wouldn't go into the mine, and from afar one could hear my name.
