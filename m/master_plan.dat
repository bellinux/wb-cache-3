40|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> estate development has generated considerable debate regarding the exclusive {{nature of these}} developments. <b>Master</b> <b>planned</b> estates appear to find considerable support from planners and governments, {{as well as the}} residents within these new estate areas. The research presented here analysed the constructions of exclusivity for a <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> estate (Glenmore Park) {{and the extent to which}} the constructed identity for Glenmore Park resulted in socio-spatial polarisation within western Sydney. The research concluded that socio-spatial polarisation is intensified through the development of <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> estates. This paper focuses specifically on the future of <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> estate development in Australian cities, particularly given that <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> estates are a favoured form of residential development even though, as is argued in this paper, they have quite obvious implications for social equity. A concluding discussion on the revived urban village concept, the discourse used at Glenmore Park, offers a warning for this current urban planning paradigm, particularly of the associated social outcomes.

40|$|<b>Master</b> <b>planned</b> estates in Australia {{emerge from}} two major {{directions:}} one aims {{to address the}} inadequacies of 1970 s suburbanisation and the other comes from governments and developers seeking to realise alternatives. The very idea of <b>master</b> <b>planning</b> has a longer history, one that arguably dates back to 19 th-century Utopian Socialism and Baron Haussmann 2 ̆ 7 s redesign of Paris, which involved a large-scale, comprehensive alternative vision realised by a sanctioned authority. <b>Master</b> <b>planning</b> thereby partakes of both utopianism and authoritarianism. These associations have infused the discussion and construction of Australian <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> estates rendering them both pariah and panacea. But research and my own experience suggests that they are far more panaceas than pariahs...|$|R

50|$|Many other places, such as Orange County, California, the Conejo Valley in Ventura County, Valencia in Los Angeles County, {{as well as}} Phoenix, Arizona and Northern Arizona {{also have}} many <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> {{communities}} following the housing boom in the 1960s, which is when the fathers of Scottsdale, Arizona foresaw {{a huge amount of}} growth in Arizona. Some of those communities include Anaheim Hills, Rossmoor, Irvine, Ladera Ranch, Laguna Niguel, Mission Viejo, and Talega, Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, Newbury Park, Valencia in California and (in the Phoenix area) Marley Park, Talking Rock Ranch, McCormick Ranch, Rio Verde, Tartesso and Verrado in Buckeye, Arizona. The neighborhood of Warren in the city of Bisbee has the distinction of being Arizona's first planned community. In the Conejo Valley, which is in the East County Area of Ventura County, all cities were <b>master</b> <b>planned.</b> Most notably, the Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park, and Westlake Village area was <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> by the Janss Investment Company, which was also responsible for the development of Westwood Village, part of the Westside in Los Angeles. Valencia is an area that is a <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> community that incorporated into the City of Santa Clarita, developed and planned by the Newhall Land and Farming Company. About 25% of Orange County is composed of various <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> communities, much of which was done by the Irvine Company, and since 1990, 85% of all developments in Orange County and a slightly smaller amount of communities in Arizona were part of a <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> community. 75% of all resales today in the Phoenix area are homes in <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> communities, and 80% of all new home construction permits issued by Arizona building departments are <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> communities.

The combination of effective building systems <b>master</b> <b>planning</b> and purchasing standardization program management (PSPM) maximizes purchasing power. Proper building systems <b>master</b> <b>planning</b> helps owners get what they want from buildings with greater opportunity for success. <b>Master</b> <b>planning</b> yields benefits in budgeting, staffing, equipment, and opportunities for standardization. PSPM is a strategy utilizing the ?buy now-pay later? concept. Equipment is pre-selected and prepriced for projects as outlined in building systems <b>master</b> <b>plans,</b> and, frequently, in bond programs. Bulk purchasing and standardization, while normally thought of in reference to office and cleaning supplies, can also be applied to big-ticket items. The result is reduced first costs and a domino effect of other savings. Case studies will be presented from Texas school districts that demonstrate successful building systems <b>master</b> <b>planning</b> and PSPM programs. The authors' experience in assisting Texas ISDs implement these programs will also be shared...|$|R
