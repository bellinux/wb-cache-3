500|$|Kesha re-recorded [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] for {{her debut}} studio album, Animal. The song was {{selective}} in its release only being sold as an album bonus track in United Kingdom and Ireland, and was dubbed [...] "Kesha edit" [...] or [...] "Dirty Picture, Pt. 2". The song {{is similar to}} the original recording of the song with the only noticeable change being that Kesha now sings the song's first verse. While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse and I thought that was a really cool idea. I really like both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions out there, because fans of me get more of me on mine and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Apart from Laurence, who {{continued}} in a [...] "feeble" [...] {{version of his}} father's style, his pupils included Isaac Oliver, {{by far the most}} important, and Rowland Lockey. [...] He appears to have given lessons to amateurs also; a letter from a young lady being [...] "finished" [...] in London in 1595 says: [...] "For my drawing, I take an hour in the afternoon... My Lady.. telleth me, when she is well, that she will see if Hilliard will come and teach <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can by any means, she will".|$|E
2500|$|As at her {{previous}} trial in 1973, Dugdale once again used the courtroom {{as a political}} platform, shouting [...] "The British have an army of occupation in {{a small part of}} Irelandâ€”but not for long!" [...] during her arraignment in Dublin. Dugdale's father issued a statement saying [...] "I don't want to appear hardhearted, but I've done everything I can for her. She knows perfectly well she could turn to <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wanted to". In Dugdale's submission to the court during her trial she denounced Britain as [...] "a filthy enemy" [...] and stated the Dublin government was guilty of [...] "treacherous collaboration" [...] with England. On 25 June 1974 she was sentenced to nine years imprisonment after pleading [...] "proudly and incorruptibly guilty", and she gave a clenched fist salute to supporters in the public gallery.|$|E
60|$|She ran to meet <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had been}} my daughter; <b>she</b> kissed <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had been my}} daughter; she fondly looked up at <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been my daughter. At the sight of that sweet young face, so sorrowful, and so patiently {{enduring}} sorrow, all my doubts and hesitations, everything artificial about me with which I had entered the room, vanished in an instant.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{do you go}} to Holmstoke church to-morrow morning: she's sure to be there. Go {{early and}} notice her walking in, and come home and tell <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> taller than I.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, I feel that,' cried Arthur. 'If Margaret {{has broken}} her word to <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> gone {{to him so}} callously, it's because it's not the Margaret I know. Some devil must have taken {{possession}} of her body.' ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{she heard}} that Danes was no longer keen to {{continue}} with the show, Holzman's attitude changed as well. She said, [...] "When I realized that Claire truly did not want to do it any more, {{it was hard for me}} to want to do it. The joy in writing the show was that everyone was behind it and wanted to do it. And I love her. So part of the joy and excitement and happiness would have gone out of <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had not been on board 100 percent. I wasn't able to say this at the time, but in retrospect it was a blessing for it to end at a time when we all enjoyed doing it. That's not to say that if the network had ordered more shows that I wouldn't have given it my best. But there was a rightness in how short the season was. This was a show about adolescence and sort of ended in its own adolescence. There was an aura about how short the series was like all things that die young. The show ended at a point that it was still all potential." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Egad!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Storer, who {{was looking}} on; [...] "she's already {{defeated}} some of the Treasury Bench, and bless <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> isn't rating North himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, {{but she is}} very sick,' a woman struck in. 'My man is a buffalo, or {{he would}} have chosen his words better. Tell <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> recover?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--I {{beg your}} pardon for {{stopping}} you," [...] said Venn. [...] "But I am waiting about for Mrs. Wildeve: I have something to give her from Mrs. Yeobright. Can you tell <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> gone home from the party yet?" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{mother looked}} at <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> doubted the {{evidence}} of her own senses.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted her}} {{face from the}} floor, and looked at <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> doubted whether she had heard aright.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well," [...] Victor said; [...] "but what opinion would she have of <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> thought me capable of deserting her in that way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only for {{the parties}} and receptions, Uncle. But it wouldn't {{surprise}} <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was married soon. She's older than Beth or me, and has a host of admirers." ...|$|E
60|$|Girl. I {{hope you}} will tell <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is here. I had a good account that you were come out to see her, and that she sent for you.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces at <b>me,</b> as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wanted to kiss me.|$|R
60|$|Ally looked coquettishly at <b>me,</b> as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did {{not know}} whether she should favor me to that extent, and the young princess was further solicited.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot say {{for certain}} yet, sir, {{but it looks}} to <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is French. I don't think that the sails are English cut anyhow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can never}} {{ask her to}} release <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>she</b> wishes to hold me to my word I will {{do my best to}} make her a good and loving husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. It was {{necessary}} {{for me to see}} her somewhere, so I asked her to come here. Perhaps the Duke has found out and stopped her. Anyhow, call <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} she does, John. She {{must have a}} very bad idea of <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> doesn't. But she may know what I mean and not mean the same thing herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{need not}} discuss that. But what <b>if</b> <b>she</b> does not love <b>me?</b> What <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{would think it}} a release to be freed from this engagement? How am I to find that out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"'Tis my belief," [...] said Steve, [...] "that they wouldn't {{particularly}} object. Your Emily clung {{as close}} to <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> already belonged to me, dear girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did she {{leave me}} no word or token, Augusta? She swore to <b>me</b> that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> died she would send {{to me the}} other half of that {{necklace}} which I wear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel the}} same way," [...] {{announced}} the stuffed Bear. [...] "What do you suppose my friend the Patchwork Girl would think of <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> saw me wearing this beastly shape?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell her, if you please, Elinor, {{that she}} must choose between Mr. Conolly and <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>she</b> prefers him, well and good: I have done with her. That is my last word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{that woman}} should return,' pursued the girl, fixing her dark, eloquent eyes intently upon the Goth's countenance, 'take me quickly where she cannot come. My heart grows cold as I look on her! She will kill <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can {{approach}} me again! My father's anger is very fearful, but hers is horrible--horrible--horrible! Hush! already I hear her coming back--let us go--I will follow you wherever you please--but {{let us not}} delay while there is time to depart! She will destroy <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> sees me now, and I cannot die yet! Oh my preserver, my compassionate defender, I cannot die yet!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wonder <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has deceived him in anything,' murmured Chickerel. 'I {{can hardly}} suppose it. But she is {{altogether}} beyond <b>me.</b> However, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has misled him on any point she will suffer for it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "bright" [...] {{relationship}} involved {{nurses who}} validated clients and their feelings. For example, one client tested his {{trust of the}} nurse by becoming angry with her and revealing his negative thoughts related to the hospitalization. The client stated, [...] "she's trying to be quite nice to <b>me</b> ... <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> able to tolerate this occasional venomous attack, which she has done quite well right up to now, {{it will probably be}} a very beneficial relationship".|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a gay figure, Pip," [...] said she, {{making her}} crutch stick play round <b>me,</b> as <b>if</b> <b>she,</b> the fairy godmother who had changed me, were bestowing the {{finishing}} gift.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{taught her}} that dodge?" [...] said old Billy, {{who was a}} sardonic old gentleman. [...] "I {{remember}} her at the Olympic, and hang <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could say Bo to a goose." ...|$|E
60|$|Hilary thought suddenly: 'She {{is using}} my own weapon against <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>she</b> {{has seen the}} man, he didn't frighten her. It serves me right!' With a dry laugh, he turned his back.|$|E
6000|$|... "There she is, my hearty; lay her aside, {{and hang}} <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> don't strike. I say, George, faint heart never won fair lady: {{remember}} that, my boy; no, nor a French ship." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{remember}} {{whether it}} was this, or what it was, that made <b>me</b> ask <b>if</b> <b>she</b> hadn't such an appreciation of Mrs. Saltram as might render that active person of some use.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rosie may go instead," [...] said Mrs. Gray, [...] "and {{when she}} has seen it, she may come back and tell <b>me,</b> and <b>if</b> <b>she</b> thinks it is worth while I will go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems 's if {{it helped}} her, an' so--I guess I'll stay. She may call for <b>me,</b> an' <b>if</b> <b>she</b> does," [...] he said resolutely, [...] "I'm goin' in, doctor. How is she now?" ...|$|R
