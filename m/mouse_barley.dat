5000|$|Subspecies include ssp. leporinum, {{known as}} hare barley, <b>mouse</b> <b>barley,</b> and barley grass. It grows in tufts from 10 to 40 {{centimetres}} in height. It {{was first published}} as the full species Hordeum leporinum by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link in 1834. In 1882 it was redescribed as a subspecies of H. murinum by Giovanni Arcangeli. Today some authorities maintain it at the species level. It is native to Europe, northern Africa and temperate Asia, and it is widely naturalised elsewhere. Barley grass is known in Chinese as màiqīng (...) and is a common ingredient in the spring snack qingtuan.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mouse</b> <b>barley</b> (Hordeum murinum), {{from the}} poaceae family, is an {{abundant}} annual grass weed in wheat fields of South Khorasan province. Determining the ecological factors of this grass weed {{will contribute to}} development of its control programs. Effects of environmental factors on germination and emergence of <b>mouse</b> <b>barley</b> was investigated in the laboratory. Although <b>mouse</b> <b>barley</b> germination was greater than 85 % at salinity level of 160 mM, further increase of salinity caused a remarkable decrease in its germination, following a 3 % decrease in germination at salinity level of 320 mM. Increasing osmotic potential from 0 to- 0. 8 MPa, resulted in an 80 % decrease in its germination. <b>Mouse</b> <b>barley</b> germination was not affected by the pH and in a pH range of 4 to 10 remained approximately 90 %. Emergence depth test showed that the maximum emergence of <b>mouse</b> <b>barley</b> occurred for seeds placed on the soil surface (86 %) and no seedlings emerged from the seeds buried at 10 cm depth. High germination ability of <b>mouse</b> <b>barley</b> under diverse environmental conditions may greatly contribute {{to it as a}} problematic weed species in the wheat fields of the region...|$|E

40|$|Specific {{structures}} of oat and barley β(1, 3) (1, 4) -glucans induced different in vitro immunomodulatory effects in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from TLR 2 / 4 knock out <b>mice.</b> All <b>barley</b> β-glucan fractions induced larger amounts of cytokines in BMDCs than their oat equivalents. The particulate fractions of both glucans induced high amounts of cytokines, especially after sample homogenisation. The small particulate barley β-glucans induced more cytokines than the equivalent oat fraction, hence {{there are more}} features influencing the immunomodulatory properties of β-glucans than only the particle size. The soluble glucan fraction and heated suspension induced only low amounts of cytokines, but were different for the two β-glucans, indicating that molecular specificity matters for immunomodulation. Immunomodulatory activity {{is influenced by the}} insolubility of β-glucans, to which characteristics as particle size, granule conformation and particulate homogeneity are related. Consequently, sample preparation influences the immunomodulatory activity of β-glucans. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The next morning, Barley wakes Ravenpaw up {{and shows}} {{him that it}} is snowing. When Ravenpaw goes onto the roof to take a drink of water, his tongue gets stuck and he doesn't want Barley to see him. He brings back a <b>mouse</b> and <b>Barley</b> says Ravenpaw's talking funny, however Ravenpaw denies it. They then start to {{cleaning}} the barn and Barley asks if Ravenpaw misses the clans. Ravenpaw tells him that clan life wasn't for him and that the barn suits him much better. Later, when {{they are going to}} sleep, they hear a scratching noise near the door. Ravenpaw and Barley look outside and see a group of cats standing there, whose names they find out to be, are; Willie, Minty, Snapper, Tess and Pounce. They plead to come in and Willie says that his mate is about to have kits. Ravenpaw welcomes them kindly, and feeds them. Soon, the kits are born, and they are named; Snowflake, Icicle, Cloudy and Sniff. Ravenpaw and Barley seem to be very fond of them. They continue to be their [...] "servants" [...] and Barley doesn't seem to enjoy it, but Ravenpaw is used to it, since he used to belong to a Clan.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} report of an antibody-fusion protein {{expressed}} in transgenic plants for direct use in a medical diagnostic assay. By the use of gene constructs with appropriate promoters, high level expression of an anti-glycophorin single-chain antibody fused to an epitope of the HIV virus was obtained in the leaves and stems of tobacco, tubers of potato and seed of barley. This fusion protein replaces the SimpliRED™ diagnostic reagent, used for detecting the presence of HIV- 1 antibodies in human blood. The reagent is expensive and laborious to produce by conventional means since chemical modifications to a monoclonal antibody are required. The plant-produced fusion protein was fully functional (by ELISA) in crude extracts and, for tobacco at least, could be used without further purification in the HIV agglutination assay. All three crop species produced sufficient reagent levels to be superior bioreactors to bacteria or <b>mice,</b> however <b>barley</b> grain was the most attractive bioreactor as it expressed the highest level (150 μg of reagent g- 1), is inexpensive to produce and harvest, poses a minuscule gene flow problem in the field, and {{the activity of the}} reagent is largely undiminished in stored grain. This work suggests that barley seed will be an ideal factory for the production of antibodies, diagnostic immunoreagents, vaccines and other pharmaceutical proteins...|$|R
5000|$|The story {{continues}} where Ravenpaw and Barley {{are still}} in ThunderClan. They prepare {{to go back to}} the barn and with the help of Firestar and a warrior patrol; they are ready to reclaim the barn back. Ravenpaw and Barley wanted to leave quietly without anyone noticing, but Squirrelkit makes enough noise to get attention of the whole Clan; thus making everyone knowing that Ravenpaw and Barley are leaving. They do their farewells and depart from ThunderClan with a warrior patrol. They go in the barn finding the place all wrecked. Firestar then makes a plan to ambush the rogues in their sleep. When they carry out their plan, they are given away when the chickens are startled and make a lot of racket and noise. During the battle in the barn, the farmer goes in and makes everyone retreat. It turns out that some of the [...] "rogues" [...] were part of BloodClan. Firestar later comes up with another plan, claiming that it will work. Most of the plan works out so far when they drive out the rogues out of the barn, but as the battle continues outside, it transpires that the rogues had reinforcements. They were about to lose against the rogues until the dogs got loose and attack the rogues. They finally drive out the rogues with the help of the dogs (whom Ravenpaw and Barley once saved from the fire), leaving only Barley's brothers left; Hoot and Jumper. They were about to be killed, but Barley says not to. Firestar and the warrior patrol then depart with Ravenpaw and Barley and they return to ThunderClan. Ravenpaw and Barley let Hoot and Jumper stay in the barn. While Barley goes out on a walk, Ravenpaw shows Hoot and Jumper around the farm. Ravenpaw notices that Hoot and Jumper don't even care and they don't do anything. As the three return to the barn, Ravenpaw takes a nap. when he wakes up by Barley, he finds the barn wrecked. Hoot and Jumper claim that they were trying to hunt for <b>mice.</b> One night <b>Barley</b> and his brothers go out for a walk. When they return, Hoot and Jumper order Ravenpaw to do everything for them. The next day, they still are ordering Ravenpaw around. Ravenpaw wonders why Barley isn't doing anything about it. Later in the day, Barley gets angry at Hoot and Jumper saying that he doesn't like how they are treating his friend and claims that loyalty is everything, not blood. Ravenpaw sees this but doesn't help Barley, knowing that he can handle it on his own. Hoot and Jumper later leave the barn for good. Ravenpaw and Barley finally have their home, together, and as their own.|$|R
