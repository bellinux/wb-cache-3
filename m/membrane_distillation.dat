25|$|Direct contact <b>membrane</b> <b>distillation</b> (DCMD). Applicable to desalination. Heated {{seawater}} {{is passed}} along {{the surface of}} a hydrophobic polymer membrane.

The difference in vapour pressure between the hot and cold side helps to push water molecules through.|$|E
25|$|Diesel {{generators}} commonly provide {{electricity in}} remote areas. About 40%–50% {{of the energy}} output is low-grade heat that leaves the engine via the exhaust. Connecting a <b>membrane</b> <b>distillation</b> system to the diesel engine exhaust repurposes this low-grade heat for desalination. The system actively cools the diesel generator, improving its efficiency and increasing its electricity output. This results in an energy-neutral desalination solution. An example plant was commissioned by Dutch company Aquaver in March 2014 for Gulhi, Maldives.|$|E
40|$|Capacitive {{deionization}} {{with carbon}} aerogel electrodes is an efficient and economical new process for removing salt and impurities from water. Carbon aerogel is a material {{that enables the}} successful purification of water because of its high surface area, optimum pore size, and low electrical resistivity. The electrodes are maintained at a potential difference of about one volt; ions are removed from the water by the imposed electrostatic field and retained on the electrode surface until the polarity is reversed. The capacitive deionization of water {{with a stack of}} carbon aerogel electrodes has been successfully demonstrated. The overall process offers advantages when compared to conventional water-purification methods, requiring neither pumps, <b>membranes,</b> <b>distillation</b> columns, nor thermal heaters. Consequently, the overall process is both robust and energy efficient. The current state of technology development commercialization, and potential applications of this process are reviewed. Particular attention and comparison with alternate technologies will be done for seawater, brackish water, and desalting in wastewater reclamation...|$|R
40|$|Process {{boundaries}} and difficult regions for separation units limit the feasible products and recovery of those products. When process boundaries are encountered, a separating agent and or combinations {{of different types}} of equipment are used. In this manner, a number of steps are used collectively to meet the separations objective. ^ One type of equipment configuration, the distillation-membrane hybrid, has been studied for binary and multicomponent systems. In this hybrid, the distillation column performs the bulk of the separation, because of the favorable economics of <b>distillation.</b> The <b>membrane</b> is used to bypass the process {{boundaries and}} difficult regions. Methods for applying and screening these hybrids were developed. Several configurations were examined conceptually. Case studies were performed on the following systems: water-acetic acid, ethanol-water, propylene-propane, benzene-heptane-octane, methanol-ethanol-water. ^ Separations synthesis using all possible separation units (crystallization, <b>membranes,</b> <b>distillation,</b> decantation, extraction, etc.) was then examined. A design methodology for generating flowsheets of process alternatives to separate multicomponent systems was developed based on representing process boundaries with linear hyperplanes. This approximation allowed the generation of process alternatives using relatively simple calculations. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite steady {{advances}} in the technology, desalination {{remains one of the}} most expensive ways to produce potable water. But as water scarcity forces communities to find new sources of drinking water, scientists are developing innovations that may soon make desalination a reasonable option for many more communities. The newest approach to desalination is membrane systems, which include reverse osmosis and electrodialysis systems. Current research seeks to make these systems more effective and less likely to produce environmentally hazardous by-products. Many facilities use traditional distillation to desalinate water, and efforts are being made to combine <b>membranes</b> and <b>distillation</b> for more efficient systems...|$|R
25|$|Membranes {{can also}} be used to {{separate}} ethanol and water. Membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria. Membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid <b>membrane</b> <b>distillation</b> process. This process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as first separating step. The further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode. Vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed.|$|E
2500|$|A {{specialized}} industrial route {{entails the}} catalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol. [...] This method is more cost {{effective than the}} esterification but is applied with surplus ethanol in a chemical plant. Typically, dehydrogenation is conducted with copper at an elevated temperature but below 250°C. The copper may have its surface area increased by depositing it on zinc, promoting the growth of snowflake-like fractal structures (dendrites). Surface area can be again increased by deposition onto a zeolite, typically ZSM-5. Traces of rare-earth and alkali metals are beneficial to the process. Byproducts of the dehydrogenation include diethyl ether, which is thought to arise primarily due to aluminum sites in the catalyst, acetaldehyde and its aldol products, higher esters, and ketones. Separations of the byproducts are {{complicated by the fact}} that ethanol forms an azeotrope with water, as does ethyl acetate with ethanol and water, and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK, which forms from 2-butanol) with both ethanol and ethyl acetate. [...] These azeotropes are broken by pressure swing distillation or <b>membrane</b> <b>distillation.</b>|$|E

The traditional treatment includes flocculation, coagulation, sedimentation, filtration, and lime softening water treatment processes. These treatment procedures are significantly impacted the water impurities suspended and colloidal solids, oil and grease, hardness compounds, and other non-dissolved parameters. Furthermore, these processes {{are much less}} energy intensive than the salt separation treatments. On the contrary, advanced treatment technology includes reverse osmosis <b>membranes,</b> thermal <b>distillation,</b> evaporation, and crystallization processes. These techniques are utilized to treat dissolved solids, primarily consisting of chlorides and salts, that is to say, that it contains dissolved barium, strontium, and some dissolved radionuclides on some occasions. As a matter of fact, these dissolved parameters are actively tricky, and energy consumed to treat and can only be separated with this advanced membrane and thermal technologies.|$|R

The present technologies for capturing CO 2 from flue gases (e.g., gas absorption into solvents or onto sorbents, <b>membrane</b> permeation, cryogenic <b>distillation)</b> remain costly and impose significant energy penalties for CO 2 stripping and sorbent regeneration. Identifying membranes with high selectivity and permeability remains a great challenge. Photocatalytic processes capable of removing CO 2 and simultaneously converting it to marketable hydrocarbon products deserve attention [94].|$|R

30|$|Brine {{treatment}} and disposal pose serious challenges for industries particularly the petrochemical, mining and power industries. These industries utilise membrane desalination {{technologies such as}} reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis reversal (EDR) and ion exchange (IX) to treat their saline effluent (Alkhudhiri et al. 2012; AlHathal Al-Anezi et al. 2013; Abu-Zeid et al. 2015; Drioli et al. 2015; Bogler et al. 2017; Eykens et al. 2017; Thomas et al. 2017). During the treatment processes, large quantities of difficult to treat brines are generated, and for landlocked process plants, these brines are usually stored in evaporation ponds (Kaplan et al. 2017). Storage/disposal of brines in evaporative ponds runs the inherent risk of surface and underground water contamination, thus potentially violating stringent environmental regulations (Alshahri 2017; Hossack et al. 2017). As such, some of these industries often opt to treat the resultant brines using thermal distillation technologies such as evaporative crystallisers or film falling and forced circulation evaporators (Chang et al. 2012; Adham et al. 2013, Joe Patrick Gnanaraj et al. 2016). However, these <b>membrane</b> and <b>distillation</b> technologies have {{their fair share of}} problems ranging from fouling and scaling to being energy intensive and costly. Fouling and scaling often limits the efficiency and usefulness of these technologies (Alkhudhiri et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2013; Naidu et al. 2016). Evaporators are also prone to scaling which results in operational downtime (Bigham et al. 2015).|$|R

In this combination, the membrane may act in different ways: to confine the photocatalytic powder in the reacting suspension, to selectively separate the photoreaction products, or to be the support of photocatalyst. This article reports recent studies in which different types of <b>membranes</b> (such as <b>distillation,</b> dialysis, nanofiltration, pervaporation and osmosis membranes) are used in hybrid systems. An additional advantage of coupling is that the photocatalyst prevents the microbial fouling offering a strong potential for the use of new types of thin-film-composite membrane.

40|$|In {{industrial}} {{practice the}} separation of an azeotropic mixture usually involves adding a third component to the distillation process to break the azeotrope. The major disadvantages of this so called azeotropic and extractive distillation are the relatively high capital and high energy costs {{and the possibility of}} product contamination. A rather new alternative for breaking azeotropes and a fine example of process intensification is coupling <b>membranes</b> with <b>distillation.</b> High performance <b>membranes</b> are required for successful commercial implementation. In addition to large flux and selectivity, membrane stability at higher temperatures in harsh chemical environment is quite important. Considering the fact that permeation at higher temperature gives larger fluxes, resulting in smaller membrane areas, inorganic porous membranes could find a wider application in practical separation and purification processes. However conditions that are beneficial for membranes can result in a disadvantage for the <b>distillation</b> side. <b>Membrane</b> separation at elevated temperatures may require distillation to be operated at an increased pressure, which increases both the number of stages and the energy requirement. Advantages and disadvantages should be balanced appropriately to arrive at an optimized integrated process. In this thesis, the above mentioned features are addressed (Chapter 1). The study focuses on the industrial implementation of ceramic membranes.

The energetic performance of the hybrid system at a feed pressure of 1. 5 bar showed that 337. 5 kWh/tseparated CO 2 was required to separate 90 % of CO 2 and capture processes doubled the electricity price from 33. 7  €/MWh to 65. 5 €/MWh due to high investments for the membrane.

50|$|Membrane {{separation}} processes have a {{very important}} role in the separation industry. Nevertheless, they were not considered technically important until the mid-1970s. Membrane separation processes differ based on separation mechanisms and size of the separated particles. The widely used membrane processes include microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, electrolysis, dialysis, electrodialysis, gas separation, vapor permeation, pervaporation, <b>membrane</b> <b>distillation,</b> and membrane contactors.
