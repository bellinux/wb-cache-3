25|$|Edna Hutton {{reportedly}} died on May 2, 1917, age 33, from suffocation due to <b>mastoiditis,</b> but rumor persists {{that she}} committed suicide by poison in despair over her husband's philandering, {{especially as the}} coroner decided that no autopsy was necessary. Four year old Barbara discovered her mother's body. After her mother's death, she lived with various relatives, and was raised by a governess. Hutton attended Miss Hewitt's Classes, now The Hewitt School in New York's Lenox Hill neighborhood and Miss Porter's School for Girls in Farmington, Connecticut. She became an introverted child who had limited interaction with other {{children of her own}} age. Her closest friend and only confidante was her cousin Jimmy Donahue, the son of her mother's sister. Jimmy Donahue inherited a portion of the Woolworth estate with Barbara and also grew up to have notorious, and public, drug, alcohol and relationship problems.|$|E

5000|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of <b>mastoiditis</b> is straightforward: bacteria {{spread from}} the middle ear to the mastoid air cells, where the inflammation causes damage to the bony structures. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis {{are the most common}} organisms recovered in acute <b>mastoiditis.</b> Organisms that are rarely found are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative aerobic bacilli, and anaerobic bacteria. P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. [...] ) are the most common isolates in chronic <b>mastoiditis.</b> Rarely, Mycobacterium species can also cause the infection. Some <b>mastoiditis</b> is caused by cholesteatoma, which is a sac of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear that usually results from repeated middle-ear infections. If left untreated, the cholesteatoma can erode into the mastoid process, producing <b>mastoiditis,</b> as well as other complications.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mastoiditis</b> is {{the result}} of an {{infection}} that extends to the air cells of the skull behind the ear. Specifically, it is an inflammation of the mucosal lining of the mastoid antrum and mastoid air cell system inside the mastoid process. The mastoid process is the portion of the temporal bone of the skull that is behind the ear which contains open, air-containing spaces. <b>Mastoiditis</b> is usually caused by untreated acute otitis media (middle ear infection) and used to be a leading cause of child mortality. With the development of antibiotics, however, <b>mastoiditis</b> has become quite rare in developed countries where surgical treatment is now much less frequent and more conservative, unlike former times. Additionally, {{there is no evidence that}} the drop in antibiotic prescribing for otitis media has increased the incidence of <b>mastoiditis,</b> raising the possibility that the drop in reported cases is due to a confounding factor such as childhood immunizations against Haemophilus and Streptococci. Untreated, the infection can spread to surrounding structures, including the brain, causing serious complications.|$|E

50|$|In the United States {{and other}} {{developed}} countries, {{the incidence of}} <b>mastoiditis</b> is quite low, around 0.004%, although it is higher in developing countries.

50|$|If {{ear infections}} are {{treated in a}} {{reasonable}} amount of time, the antibiotics will usually cure the infection and prevent its spread.

50|$|In all {{developed}} countries with up-to-date modern healthcare the primary treatment for <b>mastoiditis</b> is administration of intravenous antibiotics. Initially, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given, such as ceftriaxone. As culture results become available, treatment can be switched to more specific antibiotics {{directed at the}} eradication of the recovered aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Long-term antibiotics {{may be necessary to}} completely eradicate the infection. If the condition does not quickly improve with antibiotics, surgical procedures may be performed (while continuing the medication). The most common procedure is a myringotomy, a small incision in the tympanic membrane (eardrum), or the insertion of a tympanostomy tube into the eardrum. These serve to drain the pus from the middle ear, helping to treat the infection. The tube is extruded spontaneously after a few weeks to months, and the incision heals naturally. If there are complications, or the <b>mastoiditis</b> does not respond to the above treatments, {{it may be necessary to}} perform a mastoidectomy: a procedure in which a portion of the bone is removed and the infection drained.|$|E
