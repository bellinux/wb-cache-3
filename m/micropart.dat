Previous work {{pointed out that}} a 2 ̆ 2 core-free 2 ̆ 2 morphology exists for a <b>micropart</b> (150 -µm thick), contrasting with the well-known 2 ̆ 2 skin-core 2 ̆ 2 morphology of a conventional part (1. 5 -mm thick). Local analyses are now conducted in every structural layer of these samples. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal highly oriented crystalline lamellae perpendicular to the flow direction in the <b>micropart.</b> Image analysis also shows that lamellae are thinner. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction measurements using a microfocused beam highlight that highly oriented shish–kebab morphologies are found through the <b>micropart</b> thickness, with corresponding orientation function close to 0. 8. For the macropart, quiescent crystallized morphologies are found with few oriented structures. Finally, the morphology within the <b>micropart</b> is more homogeneous, but the crystalline structures created are disturbed due to the combined effects of flow-induced crystallization and thermal crystallization during processing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper studies {{automated}} tasks {{based on}} hybrid force/position {{control of a}} flexible object at the microscale. A guiding task of a flexible <b>micropart</b> {{is the case of}} the study and is achieved by a two-sensing-finger microgripper. An experimental model of the behavior of the microgripper is given and the interaction forces are studied. Based on grasp stability, a guiding strategy taking into account the pull off forces is proposed. A specific control strategy using an external hybrid force/position control and taking into account microscale specificities is proposed. The experimental results of automated guiding task are presented. Note to Practitioners — This article’s motivation is the need of very precise positioning in micromanipulation and microassembly tasks. The guiding tasks {{are a part of the}} microassembly process. Such guiding tasks are rarely automated. This is mainly due to the fact that automation in the microworld is a new issue and the literature only concerns the local control of microactuators and microrobots for the moment. Hybrid force/position control is a promising approach to achieve an automated guiding task of the <b>micropart.</b> To detect the contact between the <b>micropart</b> and the rail, a two-sensing-finger microgripper is used. The controller aims to release the contact and to continue going forward within the guiding axis. The proposed controller is very accurate, with high speed (low rejection time) and easy to implement. It is noticed that the proposed control scheme can also be applied to other microassembly tasks (pick-and-place, insertion, etc).

A single actuator system has limited <b>micropart</b> translocation capability and multiple sequential actuators need to be used if the required translocation distance is more than the capability of an actuator. For a single actuator system, the parameters of the system and their influence on the system output (translocation distance or travel distance) have already been discussed as function of the input frequency, actuator stroke, surface roughness and deformation wavelength [2]. In a multiactuator system, the subsequent actuators engage the <b>micropart</b> with a finite initial velocity and at some position relative to the actuator. Therefore, a sequential array of actuators exhibits a different set of overall operational characteristics. This manuscript describes the operational characteristics of sequential actuators towards a microconveyor system over a range of actuator frequencies and other system parameters and estimates the system output i. e. the <b>micropart</b> distance travelled or translocation.

40|$|International audienceAt the microscale, small inertia {{and high}} {{dynamics}} of microparts increase {{the complexity of}} grasping, releasing and positioning tasks. The difficulty increases especially because the position, the dimensions and the stiffness of the <b>micropart</b> are unknown. In this paper, {{the use of a}} microgripper with integrated sensorized end-effectors with high dynamic capabilities is proposed to perform stable and accurate grasps of multistiffness microcomponents. A dynamic nonlinear force/position model of the complete microgripper while manipulating a microcomponent is developed. The model takes into consideration not only free motion and constrained motion, but also, contact transitions which is a key issue at the microscale due to the predominance of surface forces. It enables to estimate the position of the microgripper’s end-effectors, the contact position of the microcomponent and the force applied on the microcomponent. Using the proposed microgripper and its model, both of the gripping forces are measured and the position of each of the microgripper’s endeffectors is estimated. This enables to perform a stable grasp of the <b>micropart</b> by providing force and position feedback.

A new methodology to perform pick-and-place microassembly using a 3 DOF micromanipulator is demonstrated here. In this approach, the &quot;pick &quot; operation is performed on one chip, while the &quot;place &quot; operation is performed on a second chip mounted orthogonally to it under a microscope. This removes {{the need for the}} rotation of parts during assembly as required in previous works thus creating a significantly simpler assembly process. Also new in this work is the characterization of the contact resistance and the rigidity of assembled microstructures. The contact resistance of assembled microparts coated with 30 nm of gold is measured to be approximately 12 Ω using a four-point measurement. The force required to pull out a <b>micropart</b> from a socket (into which it is assembled) is characterized along all three axes and found to be over 5 mN in each case.
