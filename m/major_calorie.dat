40|$|Cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, is the <b>major</b> <b>calorie</b> {{provider}} for {{two thirds}} of the world population and in developing countries is a major source of proteins and some micro nutrients. Rice is mainly favoured for its starch content which has a myriad of applications in food and non-food industries. Rice comes from just two species of the Oryza genus which consists of 23 species. A number of these have contributed to the production of a commercial species with increased pest and disease resistance and male sterility. Despite this the starch properties and the cropping potential of many these varieties are largely unknown. Rice and its wild relatives grow in a diverse range of habitats and climates and it is believed their adaptations and genetic diversity may be harnessed for crop improvement programmes. This study was undertaken as an exploration of the wild species of Oryza that might prove to possess comparable starch characteristics with that of cultivated rice. Analysis of the whole grain morphology of 17 wild species of rice by light microscopy found a diverse array of grain sizes and shapes which could be defined by the 2 ̆ 2 standard rice breeders’ classification scale 2 ̆ 2 that is routinely used for rice breeding evaluation. The range of colours of the grains of these species might also indicate their potential nutritional value as carriers of antioxidants in their pericarp. The endosperm morphology of the wild species was subjected to an evaluation and comparison with domesticated rice. Wild rice species starch granule morphology, protein body shape and distribution and endosperm cell shape were similar to domesticated species, suggesting their starch has similar functional properties. The wild species exhibited pinholes, channels and internal cavities which had not been previously reported in rice. The presence of pinholes and channels in other cereal starches are favourable for starch processing quality, indicating these species might possess potential benefits in starch processing. The existence of distinctive sub aleurone layers are associated with high protein grains in other cereals; two of the wild species O. longiglumis and O. spontanea exhibited a distinctive sub aleurone layer, indicating that they are potential high protein species. Evaluation of the physicochemical properties of starch of the wild species found they expanded greater than that of domesticated rice after cooking. Additionally, they all had intermediate apparent amylose content with a higher percentage of longer branch chain amylopectin which imparted a high gelatinization temperature but low viscosity parameters. A comparative study of three different starch genes in domesticated and wild species of rice found a reasonable conservation in the coding regions across the species. Shared non-synonymous changes between non AA genome wild Oryza species and other cereals were observed, suggesting a probable parallel evolution of the genes. A concatenated dataset of the conserved regions produced a topology reflecting gene evolution and more or less the established phylogeny of wild species of Oryza genus. In combination, these studies suggest these wild species have potential to be a crop of their own right and/or can be used in O. sativa breeding programmes...|$|E

Although much has been clarified regarding the enzymes and pathways responsible for acyl-group flux, there are still major gaps in our understanding.

40|$|Rice is a <b>major</b> {{source of}} <b>calories</b> and mineral {{nutrients}} for {{over half the}} world’s human population. However, little is known in rice about the genetic basis of variation in accumulation of copper (Cu), an essential but potentially toxic nutrient. Here we identify OsHMA 4 as the likely causal gene of a quantitative trait locus controlling Cu accumulation in rice grain. We provide evidence that OsHMA 4 functions to sequester Cu into root vacuoles, limiting Cu accumulation in the grain. The difference in grain Cu accumulation is most likely attributed to a single amino acid substitution that leads to different OsHMA 4 transport activity. The allele associated with low grain Cu was found in 67 of the 1, 367 rice accessions investigated. Identification of natural allelic variation in OsHMA 4 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with grain Cu concentrations tuned to both the concentration of Cu in the soil and dietary needs...|$|R

Comparative genomics allows for comparison of genome sequences across different species, with the implication that genomes with large sizes can be investigated using closely related species with smaller genomes. This offers prospects of studying genes in a single species and, in turn, gaining information on their functions in other related species. Comparative genomics is expected to provide invaluable information on the control of gene function in complex cereal genomes, and also in designing molecular markers across related species.

30|$|Rice (Oryza sativa) is {{the most}} widely {{consumed}} staple food for {{a large part of}} the world’s human population, providing a <b>major</b> portion of <b>calories</b> in human diet. One of the major factors limiting rice production is the occurrence of diseases caused by various fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens. Rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) and sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) are the two most devastating fungal diseases of rice (Oryza sativa). Bakanae (“foolish seedling” in Japanese) caused by the fungus Fusarium spp (Gibberella fujikuroi species complex) is also common rice disease. Rice yields can be also severely compromised by the bacterial pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and X. oryzae pv oryzicola (bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak, respectively). More recently, bacterial foot rot (Dickeya zeae, previously known as Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. zeae) and bacterial panicle blight of rice (Burkholderia glumae) have emerged as important pathogens affecting global rice production. Rice virus diseases are generally restricted to specific rice-growing areas, e.g., Rice Hoja Blanca Virus (RHBH) in South-America, and Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (RYMV) in Africa. Rice stripe virus, Rice dwarf virus, and Rice tungro viruses (RSV, RDV, RTBV, RTSV) are found in Asia. A practical means of achieving greater yields in rice is to develop strategies to minimize losses due to diseases.|$|R

Unfortunately, {{it can cause}} potentially fatal complications. TPN infusion results in impairment of gut mucosal integrity, enhanced inflammation, increased cytokine expression and trans-mucosal bacterial permeation. It also causes endotoxin associated down regulation of bile acid transporters and Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease (PNALD), which includes steatosis, disrupted glucose metabolism, disrupted lipid metabolism, cholestasis and liver failure. Despite multiple theories, its etiology and pathophysiology remains elusive and is likely multifactorial. An important cause for TPN related pathologies {{appears to be a}} disruption in the normal enterohepatic circulation {{due to a lack of}} feeding during such therapy.

40|$|Lipases are lipolytic {{enzymes that}} {{play a key}} role in fat metabolism. They are {{catalysts}} for the hydrolysis of triacylglycerides, which contribute for <b>major</b> portion of <b>calories</b> to our daily diets. Due to the apolar nature of oils and fats, the oil-water interface is where the control of lipolytic conversion and finally digestion takes place. It might come as a surprise that despite past efforts the interfacial behaviour of lipases is not completely understood. We have undertaken a detailed study of the interfacial behaviour of lipases, their substrates and the products. Our results demonstrate that lipase activity is a function of interfacial composition and changes concurrently with lipolytic conversion. In these cases lipase "inhibition" should be attributed to substrate depletion and not to lipase desorption or denaturation as previously hypothesized. This self-limiting effect through the feedback of interfacial composition to the reaction conditions of the enzyme may open a new way to control lipase catalysis through the interface. To prove our point, we appreciably reduced oil hydrolysis in a model gastro-intestinal system by interfacial engineering of the oil. We anticipate that our findings can contribute in finding new approaches for controlling fat metabolism, which is central to health threats like obesity and diabetes mellitus II and important for the regulation of energy metabolism in general.

40|$|Starch is {{the main}} storage {{polysaccharide}} in cereals and the <b>major</b> source of <b>calories</b> in the human diet. It is synthesized {{by a panel of}} enzymes including five classes of starch synthases (SSs). While the overall starch synthase (SS) reaction is known, the functional differences between the five SS classes are poorly understood. Much of our knowledge comes from analyzing mutant plants with altered SS activities, but the resulting data are often difficult to interpret as a result of pleitropic effects, competition between enzymes, overlaps in enzyme activity and disruption of multi-enzyme complexes. Here we provide a detailed biochemical study of the activity of all five classes of SSs in barley endosperm. Each enzyme was produced recombinantly in E. coli and the properties and modes of action in vitro were studied in isolation from other SSs and other substrate modifying activities. Our results define the mode of action of each SS class in unprecedented detail; we analyze their substrate selection, temperature dependence and stability, substrate affinity and temporal abundance during barley development. Our results are at variance with some generally accepted ideas about starch biosynthesis and might lead to the reinterpretation of results obtained in planta. In particular, they indicate that granule bound SS is capable of processive action {{even in the absence of}} a starch matrix, that SSI has no elongation limit, and that SSIV, believed to be critical for the initiation of starch granules, has maltoligosaccharides and not polysaccharides as its preferred substrates...|$|R

Therefore, knowledge on nutritive, organoleptic and safety values of OGI is hugely essential {{to justify its}} dietary utilization and fortification as weaning diets and staples {{and the need for}} improvement in cereal fermentation. In this study, we determined the indices of nutrition, palatability and preservation in Ogi made from cultivars of maize and sorghum in Nigeria using Lactobacillus pentosus and L. acidophilus as starter cultures during fermentation. Eleven cultivars of corn and sorghum sold in Nigerian markets were used for the preparation of fermented gruels using L. pentosus and L. acidophilus as single and mixed starter cultures. Gruels from these cultivars were also prepared under uncontrolled fermentation conditions and used as control. These gruels were compared by proximate composition, probiotic and organaoleptic values using standard chemical, chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods. The biochemical analysis of the fermented samples showed the concentration of acid, acetoin and diacetyl to increase in comparison to the controls indicating improved organoleptic properties. All samples showed increased levels of reducing sugars, proteins, and amino acids. Essential amino acids, lysine, isoleucine, and arginine were elicited in all fermented samples, showing desirable nutritional status.

40|$|This thesis {{employs the}} model Drosophila melanogaster and the Geometric Framework for {{nutrition}} (GF) to explore origins, consequences and molecular underpinnings of phenotypic plasticity. The first two studies investigate the influence genetic polymorphism of foraging gene {{can have on}} population level phenotypic plasticity in response to variable larval nutrition. Chapter 2 shows that allelic variants of foraging differ subtly in their larval life history and phenotypic plasticity, yet these differences correspond to one variant displaying ‘nutrient generalist’ and the other ‘nutrient specialist’ feeding strategies. Chapter 3 demonstrates foraging acts as a plasticity gene, meaning that each allelic variant is capable of expressing alternate patterns of phenotypic plasticity in common nutritional environments. This study indicates that natural populations of D. melanogaster are capable of expressing two discrete modes of phenotypic plasticity, potentially facilitating future evolution under nutritional environment change. Chapter 4 analyses the influence variable larval nutrition has on the expression of D melanogaster sex combs, a male secondary sexual trait. By comparing the quality of sex combs between flies raised across diverse food environments, the study demonstrates that nutrition is critical in determining trait variability, suggesting nutrition has direct influence on microevolution via sexual selection. The final data chapter characterises the gene expression changes that occur within individuals of a population that has become adapted to an recent shift to a high-protein diet.

40|$|Cassava is the <b>major</b> {{source of}} <b>calories</b> {{for more than}} 250 million Sub-Saharan Africans, however, it has the lowest protein-to-energy ratio of any major staple food crop in the world. A cassava-based diet {{provides}} less than 30 % of the minimum daily requirement for protein. Moreover, both leaves and roots contain potentially toxic levels of cyanogenic glucosides. The major cyanogen in cassava is linamarin which is stored in the vacuole. Upon tissue disruption linamarin is deglycosylated by the apolplastic enzyme, linamarase, producing acetone cyanohydrin. Acetone cyanohydrin can spontaneously decompose at pHs > 5. 0 or temperatures > 35 °C, or is enzymatically broken down by hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) to produce acetone and free cyanide which is then volatilized. Unlike leaves, cassava roots have little HNL activity. The lack of HNL activity in roots {{is associated with the}} accumulation of potentially toxic levels of acetone cyanohydrin in poorly processed roots. We hypothesized that the over-expression of HNL in cassava roots under the control of a root-specific, patatin promoter would not only accelerate cyanogenesis during food processing, resulting in a safer food product, but lead to increased root protein levels since HNL is sequestered in the cell wall. Transgenic lines expressing a patatin-driven HNL gene construct exhibited a 2 - 20 fold increase in relative HNL mRNA levels in roots when compared with wild type resulting in a threefold increase in total root protein in 7 month old plants. After food processing, HNL overexpressing lines had substantially reduced acetone cyanohydrin and cyanide levels in roots relative to wild-type roots. Furthermore, steady state linamarin levels in intact tissues were reduced by 80 % in transgenic cassava roots. These results suggest that enhanced linamarin metabolism contributed to the elevated root protein levels...|$|R

Rice is an important food crop worldwide, and provides a <b>major</b> source of <b>calories</b> for billions of people in tropical and subtropical developing countries. In many regions throughout Southeast Asia, rice is grown in low-lying coastal regions, which are prone to ingress by seawater. Rice is highly sensitive to salt stress, with mild salinity resulting in large reductions in yield. Improving salt tolerance in rice is essential for ensuring food security for many individuals throughput the developing world. ^ In this work, the overall goals were to characterize a diverse collection of cultivated rice for salt tolerance, and elucidate the genetic basis of salt tolerance-related traits. To this end, a multidisciplinary approach that combined aspects of classical plant physiology, molecular biology, computational biology, and quantitative genetics was employed. Considerable natural variation was observed for salt-tolerance related traits. Moreover, the five subpopulations of rice (indica, temperate japonica, tropical japonica, aromatic, and aus) exhibited contrasting phenotypes, suggesting that there may be inherent differences between the subpopulations of cultivated rice for salt tolerance. ^ Phenotypes derived from classical end-point phenotyping, and temporal non-destructive imaging, were used for genome-wide association mapping. For the majority of the traits analyzed, numerous loci were identified that accounted for {{only a small portion of}} the phenotypic variation. These results indicate that many genes collectively contribute to salt-tolerance in rice. However, a single gene, HKT 1; 1, was identified and was shown to regulate root sodium content. Moreover, variants of HKT 1; 1 were shown to underlie the divergence of Indica and Japonica subspecies of rice for root Na+ content. Transcriptome data from 91 diverse accessions of the rice diversity panel were leveraged to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying the complex salt tolerance-related traits. Together, this work provides a comprehensive phenotypic and genetic analysis of the responses to moderate salinity. ...|$|R

Therefore, children were fed one of four different milk diets: standard fat cow´s milk; low fat cow´s milk or iron fortified, protein reduced cow´s milk with either 50 % or 100 % vegetable fat. From 12 to 18 months of age, dietary intakes, growth and indices of fat-, protein-, and iron metabolism were compared between the groups. We found similar energy intakes and growth in all groups despite differences in energy content in the milk used. Children given iron fortified, protein reduced milk with 50 or 100 % vegetable fat had saturated fat intake around 12 % of energy; polyunsaturated fat intake around 6 % of energy, both verified in plasma fatty acid contributions; recommended iron intake and protein intake closer to recommendations. Children fed low fat milk had fat intakes below 30 % of energy. Further, children fed whole cow´s milk showed saturated fat intakes of around 19 % of energy, signs of weaker development of iron stores and indices of protein metabolism indicating unnecessarily high protein intakes. The differences in intakes of polyunsaturated fat had no major effect on plasma long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid contributions. We found that a reduction of saturated fat intake and recommended protein and iron intake is difficult to achieve without modifications in the fat, protein and iron compositions of whole cow´s milk. Therefore, we propose that a recommendation of fat quality composition and protein and iron content in milk for young children should be developed...|$|R

On Java and Madura, almost all corn is produced on the eastern half of the land area. The province of East Java produces 45 percent of the nation's total output. The land types used for corn production are "tegalan" (rain-fed) and "sawah" (floodable rice land). The two tegalan systems differ from each other in the frequency of corn harvests and are classified as systems with multiple or a single corn crop per year. The two sawah systems are characterized by the degree of water control. Irrigated sawah has permanent irrigation infrastructure, while rain-fed sawah is flooded by rainfall runoff. Prior to the mid- 1970 's farmers used mostly local, low yielding corn varieties which produced less than 1 tone per hectare. By 1987, yield had increased to 1. 9 tons. The release and spread of new, improved corn varieties since 1978 are largely responsible for growth in yield. Although corn is a secondary foodcrop to rice, it is a <b>major</b> source of <b>calories</b> and protein in the Indonesian diet. According to the food balance sheet of Indonesia, corn directly consumed by humans accounts for about 9 percent of all calories and 12 percent of protein intake. It is especially important in the diet of the poor, since it is cheaper than rice. Three-quarters of Indonesia's corn production is consumed directly by humans as a staple foodstuff. Corn is also a major ingredient in livestock feed, which ultimately is the largest component in meat and eggs. The modern feed industry was established in 1972 and has expanded rapidly {{through the end of the}} decade. However, it is not the main source of demand for corn. In the mid 1980 's, livestock feeding absorbed an estimated one-fifth of annual corn production. The primary purpose of this study is not to examine or evaluate the existing corn program or policies, but rather to study factors affecting the demand for and supply of corn in Indonesia and to project production, total demand and per capita consumption in the future. The objectives of this study are as follows: 1) to select appropriate variables for establishing an estimated demand equation; 2) to select appropriate variables for establishing an estimated supply equation; and 3) to apply two estimated equations for generating projection of production, total demand and per capita consumption of corn to the year 2000.

40|$|Potato late blight, {{caused by}} the {{destructive}} Irish famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is {{a major threat to}} global food security 1, 2. All late blight resistance genes identified to date belong to the coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat class of intracellular immune receptors 3. However, virulent races of the pathogen quickly evolved to evade recognition by these cytoplasmic immune receptors 4. Here we demonstrate that the receptor-like protein ELR (elicitin response) from the wild potato Solanum microdontum mediates extracellular recognition of the elicitin domain, a molecular pattern that is conserved in Phytophthora species. ELR associates with the immune co-receptor BAK 1 /SERK 3 and mediates broad-spectrum recognition of elicitin proteins from several Phytophthora species, including four diverse elicitins from P. infestans. Transfer of ELR into cultivated potato resulted in enhanced resistance to P. infestans. Pyramiding cell surface pattern recognition receptors with intracellular immune receptors could maximize the potential of generating a broader and potentially more durable resistance to this devastating plant pathogen. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the most important non-grain food crop and a <b>major</b> source of <b>calories</b> for the world's poor 5. Increasing potato production is critical to prevent global malnutrition and hunger in an era of expanding world population. Unfortunately, potato suffers from the devastating late blight disease, which is {{caused by the}} notorious oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans. To limit losses to late blight, potato breeders rely on fungicide treatment and breeding of disease resistance (R) genes, all of which identified thus far belong to the coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) class of immune receptors. These intracellular proteins recognize pathogen avirulence (Avr) proteins of the RxLR class of effectors to mount defence responses. However, RxLR effectors display high evolutionary rates 4, and as a result, P. infestans can rapidly circumvent recognition by intracellular R immune receptors, thereby limiting the development of sustainable and durable genetic resistance. Therefore, novel types of immune receptors that recognize a broader spectrum of pathogen molecules are needed. To fend off pathogens, plants rely on two classes of immune receptors that either reside inside the plant cell (NB-LRRs) or on the cell surface. The first line of defence is initiated by surface receptors, also called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are characteristically receptor-like proteins (RLPs), such as Ve 1 /Ve 26, Cfs 7, 8 and LeEIX 19, or receptor-like kinases (RLKs), such as FLS 2, EFR and XA 2110. PRRs typically recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 11. So far, only a relatively few cell surface receptors against agronomically important pathogens have been identified. Elicitins are structurally conserved extracellular proteins in Phytophthora and Pythium pathogen species (Pfam PF 00964) 12,​ 13,​ 14. P. infestans contains six elicitin genes that are conserved among different strains 13, 15. Elicitins are recognized as oomycete PAMPs but their intrinsic function in oomycetes is to bind lipids. Some elicitins sequester sterols from plants, thereby fulfilling an important biological function in Phytophthora and Pythium species that cannot synthesize sterols 12. Targeting such conserved ‘Achilles heel’ proteins of pathogens is expected to lead to a more broad-spectrum resistance. To identify novel types of potential immune receptors against the potato late blight pathogen, we initiated the cloning of ELR, a gene that determines response to elicitins 16. We screened a collection of wild Solanum germplasm by Potato virus X (PVX) agroinfection for responses to INF 1, a secreted elicitin of P. infestans (Fig. 1 a). Solanum microdontum genotype mcd 360 - 1 consistently responded to INF 1 with a cell death response (Fig. 1 b). We crossed mcd 360 - 1 with S. microdontum ssp. gigantophyllum gig 714 - 1 that does not respond to INF 1. The F 1 population segregated for response to INF 1 in a 1 : 1 ratio, which suggests that ELR is a single dominant gene...|$|R
40|$|Storage starch is {{an energy}} {{reservoir}} for {{plants and the}} <b>major</b> source of <b>calories</b> in the human diet. Starch is used in {{a broad range of}} industrial applications, as a cheap, abundant, renewable and biodegradable biopolymer. However, starch needs to be modified before it can fulfill the required properties for specific industrial applications. Genetic modification of starch, as a green technology with environmental and economic advantages, has attracted increasingly attention. Many achievements obtained from earlier studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of using this approach to produce starches with novel properties (Chapter 2). The main objective of this research was to produce novel starches with enhanced functionalities through genetic modification, while gaining a better understanding of storage starch biosynthesis. A focus on potato was warranted as it represents a superior model system for storage starch biosynthesis studies and for the production of starches with novel properties. To this end, a number of enzymes from various sources have been expressed in potato tubers to modify starch phosphate content and polysaccharide structure, since these two characteristics have long been recognized as key features in starch properties. To modify starch phosphate content and explore starch (de) phosphorylation, a human phosphatase enzyme named laforin, and modifications of it, were introduced into potato (Chapter 3). Interestingly, modified starches exhibited a significantly higher phosphate content rather than the expected lower phosphate content. Transcriptome analysis showed that the increase in phosphate content was a result of upregulation of starch phosphorylating genes, which revealed a compensatory response to the loss of phosphate content in potato starch. Furthermore, the increase of phosphate content in potato starch was reached to a threshold level. This was in line with the observations in the modified starches from overexpressed- Glucan water dikinase (GWD 1) transgenic plants (Chapter 4). Furthermore, overexpression of two starch dikinases from Arabidopsis thaliana, glucan water dikinase 2 and 3 (AtGWD 2 and AtGWD 3), did not result in a significant increase in phosphate content of potato starch (Chapter 5). Taken together, these results indicated that phosphate content of potato starch is under strict control. Morphological analysis of starch granules containing different levels of phosphate content confirmed the indispensible role of phosphate content in the normal formation of starch granules, since cracked granules were observed in the starches containing low phosphate content, while irregular bumpy shaped granules were observed in the tubers from plants containing high phosphate content. Interestingly, further analyses on the expression level of genes involved in starch metabolism and sugar-starch conversion suggested that starch phosphorylation might affect starch synthesis by controlling the carbon flux into starch while simultaneously modulating starch-synthesizing genes. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding (Chapter 4). To produce starches with novel structures, an (engineered) 4, 6 -α-glucanotransferase (GTFB) from Lactobacillus reuteri 121 was introduced into potato tubers (Chapter 6). The resulting starches showed severe changes in granule morphology, but not in starch fine structure. Transcriptome analysis revealed the existence of a self-repair mechanism to restore the regular packing of double helices in starch granules, which possibly resulted in the removal of novel glucose chains potentially introduced by the (engineered) GTFB. This research successfully generated starches with various functionalities, including altered gelatinization characteristics (Chapter 3 and 4), improved freeze-thaw stability (Chapter 4) and higher digestibility (Chapter 6). The exploitation of relationships between starch characteristics and starch properties revealed that starch properties represent the outcome of the combined effect of many factors and are highly dependent on the genetic background in which the modification has been performed. In conclusion, the research described in this thesis demonstrates the great potential of genetic modification in producing starches with novel properties. Meanwhile, these results revealed the presence of complex and exquisite molecular regulation mechanisms for starch biosynthesis in potato. In future research, these regulations need {{to be taken into account}} for the relational design of starch in planta. Certainly, a better understanding of the process of starch metabolism in storage organs would be a great step forward towards tailoring starch in an economically important crop such as potato...|$|R
40|$|Ataxic {{polyneuropathy}} is {{a neurological}} syndrome that was described from an endemic area in south-western Nigeria in the 1950 s and 1960 s. The major clinical features are sensory polyneuropathy, sensory gait ataxia, optic atrophy, and nerve deafness. Although cases with similar clinical features {{have been described}} {{from other parts of}} the world, their distribution and natural history are not identical with cases from Nigeria. Exposure to cyanide from cassava foods was proposed as the major causal factor. However, occurrence of ataxic polyneuropathy is rare in many parts of the tropics where cassava foods are the <b>major</b> source of <b>calories.</b> The objective of this thesis was to determine if occurrence of ataxic polyneuropathy in Nigeria is associated with cyanide from cassava foods. The prevalence of ataxic polyneuropathy in Ososa, a community in the endemic area was compared with the prevalence of ataxic polyneuropathy in Jobele, a community in the non-endemic area. A case-referent study was nested in an incidence study of ataxic polyneuropathy in Ososa. Intake of cassava foods and of protein, levels of thiocyanate in plasma and urine, and levels of low molecular weight thiols in the plasma were measured in cases and referents. Cohorts of subjects were followed in Ososa and Jobele to compare mortality. 150 g of gari from which 128 µmol of cyanide could be released was given to 12 healthy volunteers to determine if gari is a source of exposure to cyanide. Consumption of cassava foods and exposure to cyanide from cassava foods were compared in the endemic and non-endemic areas. Efficiencies of the methods of processing cassava roots to gari and lafun, two common cassava foods in Nigeria, were compared, and changes in the level of cyanogenic compounds in gari during storage were studied. The prevalence of ataxic polyneuropathy was 490 per 10 000 in Ososa compared with 17 per 10 000 in Jobele. The age standardised prevalence ratio between Jobele and Ososa was 4 % (95 % Cl 0 - 9). The incidence of ataxic polyneuropathy in Ososa was 63 per 10 000 personyears, 27 for males and 93 for females. The adjusted odds ratios (95 % CI) were 0. 44 (0. 09 2. 26) for the intake of cassava foods, and 1. 74 (0. 48 - 6. 28) for exposure to cyanide. The concentrations of thiols were within the reference limits in cases and referents. The adjusted relative risk of death in Jobele, compared with Ososa, was 0. 43 (95 % CI 0. 25 - 0. 76). The mean amount of cyanide absorbed into the plasma from gari was 13 µmol (SD 12), and the mean transit time of absorbed cyanide in the plasma was 7. 3 hours (SD 2. 1). The mean number of times cassava foods were eaten per person per week (95 % Cl) were 17 (16 - 17) in the endemic area, and 10 (9 - 10) in the non-endemic area in southwestern Nigeria, while the geometrical mean thiocyanate (95 % Cl) were 73 µmol/l (66 - 80) in the endemic area, and 51 µmol/l (48 - 54) in the non-endemic area in southwest Nigeria. Mean levels of cyanogenic compounds in mg HCN eq/kg dry weight (95 % Cl) were 18. 0 (15. 9 - 20. 1), and 7. 0 (4. 3 - 9. 7) in gari, which were processed using two different methods from cassava roots that contained 313. 7 mg HCN eq/kg dry weight. Mean level of cyanogenic compounds dropped from 15 mg HCN eq/kg dry weight to 7 mg HCN eq/kg dry weight in gari after four weeks of storage. The studies in this thesis do not show association of occurrence of ataxic polyneuropathy and exposure to cyanide from cassava foods. The finding of comparable levels of thiols and thiocyanate in the plasma of cases and referents suggests that detoxification of cyanide is not impaired in cases of ataxic polyneuropathy. Although cassava foods are consumed in most communities in Nigeria, exposure to cyanide from cassava foods varies widely, due largely to differences in the frequency of intake of cassava foods and the amount of cyanogenic compounds in cassava foods. The studies in this thesis show that the method of processing cassava roots, the duration of storage of the foods before being prepared to meals, and the method of preparation of the meals determine the amount of cyanide that consumers are exposed to. Since all possible adverse effects of a toxicant on health were not studied in this thesis, reduction of exposure to cyanide from cassava foods is recommended in communities where cassava foods are eaten...|$|R
