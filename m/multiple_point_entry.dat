40|$|International audienceTo {{implement}} the Continuous Descend Operation (CDO) to the high-density flow, Flight-deck Interval Management (FIM) is proposed by some researchers. To enhance the FIM, the merging optimization method with the <b>multiple</b> <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> for the Extended Terminal Maneuvering Area (E-TMA) is developed in this study. The simultaneous optimization method for trajectory and sequence is employed as the merging optimization method. The simultaneous optimization method {{is able to}} optimize the trajectory and the sequence simultaneously by introducing the criterion function which expresses {{the relation between the}} terminal time and the value of the criterion of the trajectory. However, the simultaneous optimization method for trajectory and sequence is not enough for the merging optimization method for the E-TMA, because aircraft enter the TMA from some <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> to merge the arrival flow, and the previous method is able to treat only one merging point. To enable the simultaneous optimization method to treat the <b>multiple</b> <b>entry</b> <b>points,</b> the criterion function is modified in this paper.

40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Science) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Student {{transcripts}} are {{a critical}} component of admission, transfer credit processing, and graduation processing. The majority of transcripts come into the University in paper form through <b>multiple</b> <b>points</b> of <b>entry</b> and are processed in multiple areas depending on the reason the transcript is requested (admissions evaluation, additional credit, pre-requisite requirements, special programs or graduation processing). Currently, until a transcript is data entered and processed in Common Management System (CMS), there is no reliable way to track incoming transcripts. This creates many problems for students and staff. Students may be required to send in multiple transcripts if their initial submissions cannot be located. Staff spends a considerable amount of time trying to locate transcripts. Lost or misplaced transcripts can delay admission decisions, prevent a student from registering into a course with pre-requisites and ultimately delay graduation which can lead to unwanted consequences. The purpose of my Master???s Project is to design, develop and implement an efficient transcript tracking system for transcripts submitted at California State University, Sacramento. The system will accommodate <b>multiple</b> <b>points</b> of <b>entry</b> and allow staff to efficiently track the acceptance and routing of a transcript. The system will interact with the existing CMS and provide a real time status of the processing of the transcript turned in and additional reports needed for audit processes. The project aims to provide many benefits including proper routing and tracking of turned in transcripts, improved processing efficiency of the system, and increased satisfaction for both the staff and students for the processing of transcripts.
