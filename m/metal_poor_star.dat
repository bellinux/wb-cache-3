40|$|The Galactic bulge of the Milky Way {{is made up}} {{of stars}} with a broad range of metallicity, - 3. 0 < [Fe/H] < 1 dex. The mean of the Metallicity Distribution Function (MDF) {{decreases}} as a function of height z from the plane and, more weakly, with galactic radius. The most metal rich stars in the inner Galaxy are concentrated to the plane and the more <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> are found predominantly further from the plane, with an overall vertical gradient in the mean of the MDF of about - 0. 45 dex/kpc. This vertical gradient is believed to reflect the changing contribution with height of different populations in the inner-most region of the Galaxy. The more metal rich stars of the bulge are part of the boxy/peanut structure and comprise stars in orbits which trace out the underlying X-shape. There is still a lack of consensus on the origin of the <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> ([Fe/H] < - 0. 5) in the region of the bulge. Some studies attribute the more <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> of the bulge to the thick disk and stellar halo that are present in the inner region, and other studies propose that the <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> are a distinct "old spheroid" bulge population.

In agreement with earlier work, we find strong radial gradients in the fraction of the oldest (tform < 0. 8 Gyr) and most <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> ([Fe/H]< - 2. 5) stars, both of which increase outwards. The most <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> form {{over an extended period of}} time; half of them form after z = 5. 3, and the last 10 % after z = 2. 8. The age of the <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> stellar population also shows significant variation with environment; a high fraction of them are old in the galaxy's central regions and an even higher fraction in some individual dwarf galaxies, with substantial scatter from dwarf to dwarf. Overall, over half of the stars that belong to both the oldest and most metal-poor population are found outside the solar circle. Somewhat counter-intuitively, we find that dwarf galaxies with a large fraction of <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> that are very old are systems where <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> are relatively rare, but where a substantial old population is present.

40|$|In 2005 we {{suggested}} a {{relation between the}} optimal locus of gas giant planet formation, prior to migration, and the metallicity of the host star, based on the core accretion model and radial profiles of dust surface density and gas temperature. At that time, less than two hundred extrasolar planets were known, limiting the scope of our analysis. Here we {{take into account the}} expanded statistics allowed by new discoveries, in order to check the validity of some premises. We compare predictions with the present available data and results for different stellar mass ranges. We find that the Zero Age Planetary Orbit (ZAPO) hypothesis continues to hold after a one order of magnitude increase in discovered planets. In particular, the prediction that <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> harbor planets with an average radius distinctively lower than metal rich ones is still evident in the statistics, and cannot be explained away by chaotic planetary formation mechanisms involving migration and gravitational interaction between planets. The ZAPO hypothesis predicts that in <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> the planets are formed nearer their host stars; as a consequence, they are more frequently engulfed by the stars during the migration process or stripped of their gaseous envelops. The depleted number of gas giant planets around <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> would then be the result of the synergy between low formation probability, as predicted by the core accretion model, and high destruction probability, for the ones that are formed.

A recently established well documented sample of 217 RR Lyr stars with V 0. 4, and normalized maximum orbital z-distance> 0. 45. Of these stars roughly half have retrograde orbits. The z-distance probability distribution of this sample shows scale heights of 1. 3 ± 0. 1 kpc for the disk component and 4. 6 ± 0. 3 kpc for the halo component. With our orbit statistics method we found a (vertical) spatial distribution which, out to z = 20 kpc, {{is similar to that}} found with other methods. This distribution is also compatible with the ones found for blue (HBA and sdB) halo stars. The circular velocity Θ, the orbit eccentricity, orbit z-extent and [Fe/H] are employed to look for possible correlations.

40|$|Abstract. Rotating {{massive stars}} at Z = 10 − 8 and 10 − 5 lose {{a great part}} of their initial mass through stellar winds. The {{chemical}} composition of the rotationally enhanced winds of very low Z stars is very peculiar. The winds show large CNO enhancements by factors of 10 3 to 10 7, together with large excesses of 13 C and 17 O and moderate amounts of Na and Al. The excesses of primary N are particularly striking. When these ejecta from the rotationally enhanced winds are diluted with the supernova ejecta from the corresponding CO cores, we find [C/Fe], [N/Fe],[O/Fe] abundance ratios very similar to those observed in the C–rich extremely <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> (CEMP). We show that rotating AGB stars and rotating massive stars have about the same effects on the CNO enhancements.

In a more general scenario, the pristine gas clouds were polluted by one or more supernovae of relatively low mass (less than ∼ 25 M⊙).

While stars forming from truly primordial gas are thought to be considerably more massive than our Sun, stars in the universe today have typical masses below one solar mass.

To check for new correlations between stars and the existence of an orbiting planet, we determine precise stellar parameters for a sample of metal-poor solar-type stars. This sample was observed with the HARPS spectrograph and is part of a program to search for new extrasolar planets. The stellar parameters were determined using an LTE analysis based on equivalent widths (EW) of iron lines and by imposing excitation and ionization equilibrium. The ARES code was used to allow automatic and systematic derivation of the stellar parameters. Precise stellar parameters and metallicities were obtained for 97 low metal-content stars. We also present the derived masses, luminosities, and new parallaxes estimations based on the derived parameters, and compare our spectroscopic parameters with an infra-red flux method calibration to check the consistency of our method in <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars.</b> Both methods seems to give the same effective temperature scale. Finally we present a new calibration for the temperature as a function of B-V and [Fe/H]. This was obtained by adding these new <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> in order to increase the range in metallicity for the calibration. The standard deviation of this new calibration is ∼ 50 K. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables. In press on A&...|$|R
40|$|Rotating {{massive stars}} at $Z= 10 ^{- 8 }$ and $ 10 ^{- 5 }$ lose {{a great part}} of their initial mass through stellar winds. The {{chemical}} composition of the rotationally enhanced winds of very low $Z$ stars is very peculiar. The winds show large CNO enhancements by factors of $ 10 ^ 3 $ to $ 10 ^ 7 $, together with large excesses of $^{ 13 }$C and $^{ 17 }$O and moderate amounts of Na and Al. The excesses of primary N are particularly striking. When these ejecta from the rotationally enhanced winds are diluted with the supernova ejecta from the corresponding CO cores, we find [C/Fe], [N/Fe],[O/Fe] abundance ratios very similar to those observed in the C [...] rich extremely <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> (CEMP). We show that rotating AGB stars and rotating massive stars have about the same effects on the CNO enhancements. Abundances of s-process elements and the $^{ 12 }$C/$^{ 13 }$C ratio could help us to distinguish between contributions from AGB and massive stars. On the whole, we emphasize the dominant effects of rotation for the chemical yields of extremely <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, to appear in From Lithium to Uranium: Elemental Tracers of Early Cosmic Evolution, V.

40|$|Abstract. We review some {{important}} observed properties of massive stars. Then we discuss how mass loss and rotation affect their evolution and help in giving better fits to observational constraints. Consequences for nucleosynthesis at different metallicities are discussed. Mass loss {{appear to be}} the key feature at high metallicity, while rotation is likely dominant at low and very low metallicities. We discuss various indications supporting the view that very <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> had their evolution strongly affected by rotational mixing. Many features, like the origin of primary nitrogen at low metallicity, that of the C-rich extremely <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> halo <b>stars,</b> of He-rich stars in massive globular clusters, of the O-Na anticorrelation in globular clusters {{may be related to the}} existence of a population of very fast rotating <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> <b>stars</b> that we tentatively call the spinstars. A fraction of these spinstars may also be the progenitors of GRB in very <b>metal</b> <b>poor</b> regions. They may avoid pair instability explosion due to the heavy mass loss undergone during their early evolutionary phases and be, dependent on their frequency, important sources of ionising photons in the early Universe. 1 From stars to nuclei, what’s new after the B 2 FH paper? The papers by Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler and Hoyle (1957, B 2 FH) and Cameron (1957) are wonderful achievements exposing in a detailed and documented manner nearly all the nuclear processes responsible for nucleosynthesis in the Universe. In the last fifty years, only very few new nuclear processes have been added to those listed in these papers. This underlines the success of the authors in providing an exhaustive and correct synthesis still accepted today (a very nice account of the history of the field of nucleosynthesis has been written in french by Celnikier 1998). Among the new processes described later, let us mention the spallation reactions resulting from the interactions of the cosmic rays with the interstellar mediu...|$|R
