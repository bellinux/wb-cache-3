30|$|Some forest-climate {{research}} {{continued into}} the mid-twentieth century, but it occurred under a more limited form focused on “local peculiarities” in climate such as on mountains, in valleys and within forest canopy (Geiger 1951). Rudolph Geiger’s (1894 – 1981) pioneering research in Germany on climates near the ground, which was translated from German into English in 1950, established the field of <b>microclimatology</b> as a significant field of international research. Geiger’s work pointed to distinct microclimates determined by canopy cover, species composition, rain interception and dew formation, among other influences (Geiger 1950). Research on large forests suggested that established canopies and forest ecosystems could have {{a positive influence on}} the water balance (Biel 1961). The view that mountain forests generate water and rain recurred in popular campaigns and writing. Viviroli et al. (2007) extended this into a metaphor by calling mountains “water towers for humanity”.|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is to}} explain how architectural traits of plants and canopies induce a more or less severe epidemic and how they may be modified in order to reduce disease development. In particular, it focuses on three key questions: i) which processes linked to epidemics can be influenced by architecture ii) how can architecture be characterized relative to these modes of action, and iii) how can these effects be explored and exploited? The roles of plant/canopy architecture on inoculum interception, on epidemic development via the microclimate and on tissue receptivity are discussed. In addition, the concepts of disease avoidance, canopy porosity and an ideotype unfavourable for disease development are described.

Fundamentals of airflow impact on cave microclimate were developed by Wigley (1967) and Wigley & Brown (1971, 1976). Previous works were focused on (1) both direct and indirect airflow monitoring (e. g., de Freitas & Littlejohn, 1982; Dueñas et al., 1999; Pfl itsch & Piasecki, 2003; Fernández-Cortés et al., 2009) and (2) impact of air circulation on (i) cave microclimate (Luetscher et al., 2008; Russell & MacLean, 2008), (ii) cave CO 2 (Kowalczk & Froelich, 2010), or (iii) speleothem growth (Boch et al., 2011). Some attempts appeared to derive a complete model of cave air circulation (Christoforou et al., 1996; Jernigan & Swift, 2001).

40|$|The fast urban {{expansion}} {{has led to}} the transformation of the natural landscape into anthropogenic surfaces. The city of Abeokuta, for instance, is located in a region experiencing rapid urbanization, which has produced a remarkable effect on the surface thermal response. This effect significantly influences urban internal <b>microclimatology</b> on a regional scale. In this study, the surface temperatures and land cover types retrieved from Landsat TM and ETM+ images of Abeokuta city for 1984, 2003, and 2014 were analyzed. A quantitative approach was used to assess surface urban heat islands through the relationships among surface temperature and land cover types. Results showed that impervious surface areas were found to be correlated positively with high temperatures. Conversely, vegetated areas and bare surfaces correlated positively with mid temperature zones. This study found that areas with increasing impervious surfaces will accelerate LST rise and consequently lead to increasing effect of surface urban heat islands. These findings pose a major challenge to urban planners. However, the study would help to quantify the impacts of different scenarios (e. g., vegetation loss to accommodate urban growth) on LST and consequently to devise appropriate policy measures...|$|E

40|$|Because of his {{classification}} {{as a minor}} architect, Gaetano Vinaccia’s (1881 – 1971) role in {{the history}} of architecture has not been studied in depth. Despite the fact that his impact on the debate about rational architecture was limited, the depth and scientific accuracy of his theoretical contribution to the field of <b>microclimatology</b> in relation to urban design issues deserve to be highlighted, especially today when environmental and bioclimatic questions arise strongly in architecture and planning. Thus, this work aims to reconsider this figure by describing the—unfavorable—context in which his work evolved, by bringing to light his most brilliant statements, by reading his scientific productions, and by starting to consider the validity of some of Vinaccia’s intuitions and their actual correspondence with contemporary research.

40|$|In acidic forest soils, {{aluminium}} {{can alter}} tree health {{due to its}} potential toxicity. Aluminium phytotoxicity is mainly influenced by its chemical form and its availability. As physical-chemical indicators of Al toxicity in soil, Al speciation in soil solutions and in the exchange complex was measured in the rhizosphere and the bulk soil of two tree species (Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in an acidic soil and in 4 months (November, February, May and August) representing the four seasons in a year. In the bulk soil, Al toxicity was generally higher under Norway spruce than under beech. Furthermore, temporal changes in Al behaviour were identified under Norway spruce but not under beech. The monomeric Al in the soil solutions and the exchangeable Al in the solid soil increased significantly in February under Norway spruce and were positively correlated with nitrate concentration, suggesting that nitrate influence Al speciation and mobility under Norway spruce. In the rhizosphere, Al toxicity was restricted through Al complexation by organic compounds and by nutrient contents independently from the season. The ecological importance of the rhizosphere in Al detoxification is discussed. This study suggests that plant specific differences as well as seasonal changes in plant physiology, microbial activity and <b>microclimatology</b> influence aluminum toxicity in acid forest soils...|$|E
40|$|Progress {{in urban}} {{climatology}} {{over the two}} decades since the first publication of the International Journal of Climatology is reviewed. It is emphasized that urban climatology during this period has benefited from conceptual advances made in <b>microclimatology</b> and boundary-layer climatology in general. The role of scale, heterogeneity, dynamic source areas for turbulent fluxes and the complexity introduced by the roughness sublayer over the tall, rigid roughness elements of cities is described. The diversity of urban heat islands, depending on the medium sensed and the sensing technique, is explained. The review focuses on two areas within urban climatology. First, it assesses advances {{in the study of}} selected urban climatic processes relating to urban atmospheric turbulence (including surface roughness) and exchange processes for energy and water, at scales of consideration ranging from individual facets of the urban environment, through streets and city blocks to neighbourhoods. Second, it explores the literature on the urban temperature field.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{physical}} climatology {{research from}} North American alpine tundra environments is summarized and directions {{for further research}} suggested. Despite a rather limited database, the essential themes in the physical climatology of alpine tundra are understood. With numerous permutations of slope angle, azimuth and surface types in the alpine zone, generalizations of alpine tundra radiation and energy balances are hard to define. Several aspects of the alpine tundra radiation budget {{are very similar to}} nonalpine ones, such as the controls exerted on net radiation by atmospheric and surface conditions, and the strong relation between global solar radiation and net radiation. The larger inputs of solar radiation experienced at high altitudes are typically offset by the moderating effects of orographic clouds. Turbulent energy flux partitioning is dependent upon both the effects of macroscale weather and microscale variations in surface soil moisture. Evaporation regimes tend to be moisture-limiting in the dry tundra and energy-limiting in wetter alpine/ subalpine meadows, but there are also significant season-to-season variations. Theory suggests that the surface heterogeneity common to the alpine zone must at times stimulate vigourous horizontal heat advection at a wide range of spatial scales, but the true significance of this process remains almost entirely undocumented. Suggested future research directions include analyses of the spatial variations of albedo, the role of sloping surfaces, and the relative importance of atmospheric and surface controls on the energy balance.

Data on two different drips indicate that the physicochemical parameters, such as conductivity, pH, δ 13 CDIC and drip rate depend on the local structural setting and water path length. The data presented show that Galleria delle Stalattiti (the focus of the paleoclimate research) has the most stable conditions in terms of temperature, and the dripwaters show constant pH, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, calcium and magnesium content and δ 18 O. Drip rate is not affected by rain events and displays long-term trends that require a longer period of monitoring for elucidating their nature.

40|$|Despite an {{increasing}} demand for Burgundy truffles (Tuber aestivum), gaps remain {{in our understanding}} of the fungus' overall lifecycle and ecology. Here, we compile evidence from three independent surveys in Hungary and Switzerland. First, we measured the weight and maturity of 2, 656 T. aestivum fruit bodies from a three-day harvest in August 2014 in a highly productive orchard in Hungary. All specimens ranging between 2 and 755 g were almost evenly distributed through five maturation classes. Then, we measured the weight and maturity of another 4, 795 T. aestivum fruit bodies harvested on four occasions between June and October 2015 in the same truffière. Again, different maturation stages occurred at varying fruit body size and during the entire fruiting season. Finally, the predominantly unrelated weight and maturity of 81 T. aestivum fruit bodies from four fruiting seasons between 2010 and 2013 in Switzerland confirmed the Hungarian results. The spatiotemporal coexistence of 7, 532 small-ripe and large-unripe T. aestivum, which accumulate to ~ 182 kg, differs from species-specific associations between the size and ripeness that have been reported for other mushrooms. Although size-independent truffle maturation stages may possibly relate to the perpetual belowground environment, the role of mycelial connectivity, soil property, <b>microclimatology,</b> as well as other abiotic factors and a combination thereof, is still unclear. Despite its massive sample size and proof of concept, this study, together with existing literature, suggests consideration of a wider ecological and biogeographical range, as well as the complex symbiotic fungus-host interaction, to further illuminate the hidden development of belowground truffle fruit bodies...|$|E
40|$|Landscape {{analysis}} and landscape planning need sophisticated spatio-temporal image analysis complemented with context-sensitive methodology. The latter means that raster processing has to evolve beyond per-cell analysis. We have integrated two approaches for the delineation of homogenous areas, or “mapping units”. First, a multiscale image analysis technique {{is used to}} extract objects from earth observation images. Using multiscale segmentation and object aggregation, homogeneous ‘patches ’ are created comparable to those produced via manual interpretation. However, a benefit of the approach is that constituent lower level (i. e. finer resolution) objects are available plus the patch delineation process is explicitly parameterized. These rules (including fuzzy operators) are stored in the project, and can readily be queried and modified when {{a new understanding of}} the mapped scene is introduced. We assume that mapped boundaries are based on ontological objects, corresponding to real world entities of scientific and practical significance. Second, we apply segmentation methods to terrain information and add this information to the patch definition algorithms. This enables us to combine boundary characteristics (length, relative proportions to neighbours, spectral gradients to neighbours etc.) with object characteristics (mean spectral as well as elevation and morphometric values, standard deviation, range) and sub-object information (e. g. heterogeneity based on sub-objects, spatial distribution of subobjects). Morphographic landform information is essential for the modeling and the understanding of many physical processes. Analysing geomorphological processes, surface runoff and erosion as well as mass movement risk assessment and <b>microclimatology</b> require consideration of topographic features. We demonstrate that the combination of these methodologies allows for better detection and mapping of complex topographic landuse units and, by incorporating patch generation rules, for improved landscape monitoring and scenario modeling. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presents {{research on the}} integration and transfer of knowledge from the specialized field of urban <b>microclimatology</b> into the generic field of urban design. Both fields are studied {{in order to identify}} crosslinks and reveal gaps. The main research question of the research is: How can the design of urban neighbourhoods contribute to microclimates that support physical well-being and what kind of information and form of presentation does the urban designer need in order to make design decisions regarding such urban microclimates? This question consists of two parts, which are addressed separately in the first two parts of the dissertation. Part 1 concerns an assessment of relevant knowledge on urban design by literature review, followed by a field study into the use of expert information in the urban design process. Part 2 discusses the influence of the urban environment on its microclimate and, consequently, the living quality of its inhabitants – both by means of literature review. Combined, Parts 1 and 2 serve as a basis for a framework for a design-decision support tool, which is discussed in Part 3. This tool is proposed as a means to integrate knowledge of the urban microclimate into the urban design process, bridging an observed gap. Urban design is concerned with shaping the physical environment to facilitate urban life in all its aspects. This is a complex task, which requires the integration and translation of different stakeholder interests into a proposition for the realization of physical-spatial constructs in the urban environment. Such a proposition comprises different planning elements in the following categories: spatial-functional organization, city plan, public space design and rules for architecture. During the design process, the urban designer has to deal with incomplete, often contradictory and/or changing constraints and quality demands as well as other uncertainties. He/ she handles this complexity by starting with a small selection of constraints, iteratively working to a design solution by incorporating an increasing number of constraints. The selection of constraints is subjective, depending on the design frame of the individual designer. In order to make design decisions, the urban designer requires diverse information. To establish how urban designers collect information and which formats and information levels they prefer, field research among Dutch urban designers was carried out. This consisted of a series of exploratory interviews and an online questionnaire. The results indicate that dissemination of expert knowledge to urban design should be focused on the orientation and sketch phases of the design process and should provide different layers of detail, using mainly visual information accompanied by explanatory text. The results furthermore show a remarkable discrepancy between the assigned significance of the urban microclimate for urban design and the frequency of inquiry on this topic; almost all interviewees and respondents consider the subject to be important, but a majority of them seldom collect information on it. This signifies a gap in the knowledge transfer process. It is important to bridge this gap, because the urban microclimate has {{a significant impact on the}} physical well-being of people. All components of the urban microclimate – solar radiation, daylight, wind, air quality and sound – affect the physical well-being of people, whether separately or in conjunction. Some of these effects are immediate, such as heat stress and noise annoyance; others develop over a longer period of overexposure or underexposure, such as pulmonary and respiratory diseases. Some cause discomfort, for example sleep disturbance; others can be life- threatening, such as heat stroke or skin and lung cancer. It is therefore vital that the urban microclimate is given considerable attention in the urban design process. The urban microclimate is to a large extent influenced by the city’s morphology, materialization and landscaping. This influence is exerted through different physical principles, such as reflection, absorption and evapotranspiration. Basic knowledge on how and to what extent the urban environment affects the urban microclimate and of the underlying physical principles, supported by design guidelines and examples/ reference projects, will enable urban designers to estimate the effects of their design choices on the microclimate themselves better, and help them create conditions for urban microclimates that favour physical well-being. In order to make this information available to the urban designer in a way that corresponds to his/her working process, a framework for a design-decision support tool was set up. Requirements regarding form and function were derived from the field of urban design, while requirements regarding content were derived from the field of urban <b>microclimatology.</b> The tool is proposed to be a web-based knowledge base, consisting of five main menu categories: “climate elements”, “plan elements”, “principles”, “guidelines” and “example projects”. Each category provides access to separate pages for underlying items, containing different layers of information, from general to detailed, that can be accessed through collapse menus or click-through functions. Hyperlinks between related items are provided to support different ways to access information. The main menu further gives access to background information on physical well-being and regulations and standards. Separate item pages can be added to a ‘shopping cart’, enabling customised information selection for a specific design at hand. Providing the necessary content for the tool requires further translation of expert knowledge into design information as well as additional research regarding: the plain and simple formulation of physical phenomena related to the urban environment; the integration of expert knowledge of separate microclimatological elements; the incongruity of parameters in microclimatological studies and urban design plan elements; and the presentation of information consistent with design and (design) communication purposes as opposed to evaluation purposes. To illustrate how expert studies can be rendered into design information, the impact of three selected plan elements - Floor Space Index (FSI), Ground Space Index (GSI) and orientation - on solar irradiation and wind was examined with the aid of numerical simulation tools. The results of the calculations for both climate elements were integrated in order to identify conflicts and matches. The emphasis of the study lay on showing trends and generating generic knowledge. Such knowledge is required to fill the proposed design-decision support tool with content. Answering the main research question, it can be concluded that various aspects relating to the morphology, materialization and landscaping of urban neighbourhoods can be employed to create conditions for a distinctive microclimate; urban microclimates often deviate substantially from the regional climate, and even vary within a few meters. Designing urban microclimates needs to be done with care as they affect the physical well-being of people significantly. In order to be able to do this, the urban designer needs information that ties in with his/her way of working and cognitive process. However, expert knowledge from the field of urban <b>microclimatology</b> does not fulfil this requirement and needs to be translated to information for urban design purposes. Aiming to give direction to this translation and facilitate the dissemination of expert urban microclimate knowledge to the urban design process, this research proposes a framework for a design-decision support tool. Requirements for the framework were derived from both the field of urban design and the field of urban <b>microclimatology.</b> A tool created according to the proposed framework will enable urban designers to practice climate-sensitive urban design, and, thus contribute to the physical well-being of people...|$|E
40|$|Cette {{communication}} a donné lieu à un poster disponible sur demande auprès de l'auteur. This {{has been}} presented on a poster available through a request to the author. Hygrometric and thermic measurements have been recorded to assess the <b>microclimatology</b> of some Guadeloupean caves. The results from Blanchard Cave and Morne Rita Cave, two Pre-columbian archeological sites, are presented here. Recordings have been conducted according to two modes: a short-step one which defines the daily cycle, and a long-term one which documents the annual cycle. Measurements show two distinct patterns: 1. The first cave records temperatures globally warmer than the exterior conditions. But the regime is very unstable due to air currents bringing cold air deep into the cave. The result is a limited hygrometry and a very high sensitivity to daily hygro-thermic variations. Annual data collection reveals fluctuations in the hot air trap system, that we link {{to the influence of}} seasonal cloud covering. 2. The second cave can be considered as a cold air trap. Lack of air currents helps to establish a more stable system, and a more humid air to be maintained in the cavity. Daily fluctuations are strongly weakened. However, seasonnal variations are still recorded. These data open up prospects for further understanding of physical processes occurring in these sites. Thus, air flows that have been highlighted in the first site can explain the presence of evaporitic minerals in the ancient deposits by seaspray transported into the cave with cold air flows. Highlighting this supply also support the assumption that salt fretting contributes heavily to wall desegregation. A 0. 6 cm/century weathering rate is thus estimated from sedimentation age model. Such a rate would explain the total lack of engravings in this kind of cave. Conversely, the stable system in Morne Rita cave would have favored the preservation of the Pre-columbian art...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the effects}} {{urbanization}} has on land-use and land cover change (LULC), urban areas have {{a major influence on}} the environment. The strong coupling between the land and atmosphere can alter the <b>microclimatology</b> of cities and their surrounding regions. Previous research has shown that cities can influence regional precipitation patterns. This is a result of many factors such as: increased heating and lifting caused by the urban heat island effect (UHI), increased pollution and aerosols, alteration of land use/land cover (which includes surface albedo, presence or lack of vegetation, and surface roughness changes), and urban design (which leads to increased friction and convergence). This study analyzes temporal and regional changes in the precipitation patterns of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex as it has grown over the past century, and provides a methodology for testing urban influences on precipitation in other metropolitan areas. Precipitation from 1930 ? 2007 was analyzed for the following three study regions: DFW (urban area), CRA (upwind control region), and CRB (downwind control region). By comparing early (1930 ? 1950) and late period (1987 ? 2007) precipitation within each region, it was found that there were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} periods. Entire period precipitation (1930 ? 2007) at CRB was statistically significantly different from both DFW and CRA although early and late period precipitation was not. While precipitation was similar between the two periods in all regions, comparing precipitation between the regions using the entire period shows potential anthropogenic influences. Land cover change between 1976 and 2001 was analyzed and it was found that water in the DFW Metroplex study region increased by 54. 75 %, vegetation decreased by 20. 34 %, and urban land cover increased by 176. 14 %. This may increase atmospheric moisture, surface temperature, friction and lifting over the urban center, and decrease the amount of heat released from the ground. While natural climate variability is the most important factor influencing precipitation in this region, it is possible that urbanization is also changing local and regional precipitation patterns, it may not be the only factor influencing change...|$|E
40|$|The unique {{climate of}} the alpine wetland meadow is {{characterized}} by long cold winters and short cool summers with relatively high precipitation. These factors shorten the growing season for vegetation to approximately 150 to 165 days and prolong the dormant period to almost 7 months. Understanding how environmental variables affect the processes that regulate carbon flux in alpine wetland meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau is critical important because alpine wetland meadow {{plays a key role}} in the carbon cycle of the entire plateau. To address this issue, Gross Primary Production (GPP), Ecosystem Respiration (Reco), and Net Ecosystem CO 2 Exchange (NEE) were examined for an alpine wetland meadow at the Haibei Research Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The measurements covered three years and were made using the eddy covariance method. Seasonal trends of both GPP and Reco, followed closely changes in Leaf Area Index (LAI). Reco, exhibited the same exponential variation as soil temperature with seasonally-dependent R 10 (the ecosystem respiration rate (μmol CO 2 m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 ) at the soil temperature reach 283. 16 K (10 &deg;C)). Yearly average GPP, Reco, and NEE (which were 575. 7, 676. 8 and 101. 1 gCm&minus; 2 , respectively, for 2004 year, and 682. 9, 726. 4 and 44. 0 gCm&minus; 2 for 2005 year, and 630. 97, 808. 2 and 173. 2 gCm&minus; 2 for 2006 year) values indicated that the alpine wetland meadow was a moderately important source of CO 2 . The observed carbon dioxide fluxes in this alpine wetland meadow plateau are high in comparison with other alpine meadow environments such as Kobresia humilis meadow and shrubland meadow located in similar areas. And the cumulative NEE data indicated that the alpine wetland meadow is a source of atmospheric CO 2 during the study years. CO 2 emissions are large on elevated <b>microclimatology</b> areas on the meadow floor regardless of temperature. Furthermore, relatively low Reco, levels occurred during the non-growing season after a late rain event. This result is contradicted observations in alpine shrubland meadow.

No seedling frost damage was noted on any treatment until after a frost event on July 4, even though at least three frost events had occurred earlier in the season during periods when seedling were growing and so susceptible to damage. Soil temperature at 20 mm depth dropped below air temperature during the July 4 frost, but not during an earlier frost event on which did not damage seedlings. Air temperature was similar on both dates, indicating that there was a change in soil heat capacity between June 6 and July 4. As long as soil temperature remained above air temperature during frost events, no seedling damage was evident. Seedling condition and damage, soil water loss, soil heat capacity (calculated from soil water loss) and soil temperature changes were compared between the 2 frost events. Seedlings growing on the 2 burn treatments (burn + scalp and burn) showed the least frost damage; seedlings growing on the scalp treatments showed the most. The effect of soil water on soil heat capacity is well documented; by June 4, water loss in the surface 250 mm of soil was significantly greater on the scalp treatment than on either burn treatment. By the end of July, treatment ranking for soil water loss was identical to ranking for frost damage - scalp, control, burn, burn + scalp. Control of surface vegetation had the greatest effect on water conservation; burning for vegetation control was a more effective means of conserving soil water than scalping, but combining the two treatments resulted in the lowest soil water loss. Water has a high heat capacity and thermal conductivity relative to air or soil. Therefore, conserving surface soil moisture provides some measure of frost protection to seedlings during the early growing season by buffering soil temperature changes during a frost event...|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the <b>microclimatology</b> of the ice free areas in Antarctica is needed to better quantify the impacts of human activities on this fragile environment and to help monitor global climate change processes. This research was undertaken to characterise the surface and sub surface factors influencing Antarctic soil microclimates and quantify the sub surface thermal processes resulting from these conditions. A measurement programme was developed and implemented at three contrasting sites within the Dry Valleys of the McMurdo Sound Region, Antarctica during the 1994 - 95 summer season, and samples were collected for further analysis in New Zealand. Climatic variables measured included the surface radiation and energy balance, soil and air temperature, and windspeed and direction. Important soil physical and thermal properties such as moisture content, bulk density, particle density, grainsize distribution, salinity, specific heat and thermal conductivity were also measured. The sites investigated were located at Scott Base on Ross Island in the coastal climate zone, {{at the foot of}} Mount Brooke in the Coombs Hills which has a high mountainous climate, and in the Northwind Valley (Greenville Valley) in the Convoy Range which is climatically midway between the two. Apart from being climatically different, the soils examined at each site were also different. Basalt derived soil was examined at Scott Base, dolerite derived soil was studied at the Coombs Hills, and a sandy soil derived from sandstone was examined in the Northwind Valley. Similar amounts of shortwave radiation were recorded at each site under comparable conditions, although surface albedo varied significantly which determined the amount of radiation reflected. Consequently, the Scott Base site, which had the darkest surface and lowest albedo, had the greatest net radiation inputs, and the Northwind Valley site had the lowest due to its pale colour and high albedo. Despite this, the Northwind Valley soil had the largest soil heat flux. The reason for this is not fully understood, but involves the soil temperature gradient which is the main determinant of the soil heat flux. The warmer climate at Scott Base resulted in generally warmer soil temperatures which produced an active layer greater than two times that seen at either of the other sites. Due to its relatively high moisture content, ice-cement was found at about 0. 25 m which delineates the summer O°C isotherm, and indicates the permafrost is at a similar depth. At the other two sites which were a lot colder, there was no permanent ice cement found due to their dry nature. The active layer was approximately 0. 10 m deep at the Coombs Hills site, and was only 0. 08 m at the Northwind Valley site. The permafrost at these sites would also be at about these depths. Soil temperatures, which were strongly negative, fluctuated by up to 5 °C at a depth of about 0. 20 m at these two sites. Under snow cover, the soil heat flux at both the Scott Base and Coombs Hills sites became negative which means energy was being lost from the profile, and the penetration depth of diurnal temperature variations was reduced. The main factors influencing the soil thermal regime are incoming solar radiation, air temperature, windspeed, and surface albedo. Soil properties including moisture content, thermal conductivity and heat capacity are less important in determining the variations observed...|$|E
