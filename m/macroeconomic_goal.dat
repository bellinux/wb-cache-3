40|$|Excess wages tax (EWT) is a tax-based {{incomes policy}} {{instrument}} introduced in many centrally-planned economies and still {{used in some}} FSU and Eastern European countries in transition. The main <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goal</b> of EWT is to curb inflationary pressures by penalizing through taxation the “excessive” wage awards granted by enterprises {{in the course of}} wage and price liberalization. In this paper, effects of EWT on the behavior of a profit-maximizing enterprise under monopsony, its incidence on wages and profits, and its impact on inflation are analyzed. The effect of EWT on an enterprise that maximizes workers’ income is also examined with some observations on EWT’s impact on managerial behavior. Finally, recent experience with EWT is assessed and compared to that suggested by the model. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{period from}} 1980 to 2003 {{may have seen}} the {{brighter}} side of the Zimbabwean economy, with the nation reaching the worst levels {{in terms of economic}} performance between 2003 and 2008. In light of the crucial role that education seems to play in economic growth, this study explores the relationship between education and economic growth in Zimbabwe for the period 1980 to 2003. The choice of the period was determined by the attempt to exclude years in which the country was in economic doldrums and for which outliers in data are prevalent. Using a dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) method, the study observes that education, as measured by government expenditure on education, is a fundamental covariate of economic growth in Zimbabwe. The paper essentially argues that, economic growth, being the ultimate <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goal</b> for any economy, is crucial and worthy striving for. Its explanatory variables, and specifically, education, should thus deserve priority in fiscal allocation. To achieve economic growth, economies should invest more in education...|$|E
40|$|Many central banks, {{particularly}} in the developing world, aim for exchange rate stability as a <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goal.</b> However, most are reluctant to relinquish monetary policy autonomy, so they end up operating through both interest rate and foreign exchange interventions. But {{the use of multiple}} policy instruments does not necessarily equip monetary authorities with better tools to achieve their targets. On the contrary, their effects can potentially offset each other. Using daily data from the Central Bank of Colombia during the period of 1999 – 2012, I study the effects of simultaneous policies by first deriving new measures of monetary shocks and then determining their impact on economic activity. The main findings indicate that (a) while interest rate interventions {{have a significant impact on}} real and nominal variables, foreign exchange interventions tend to have limited effects; and (b) empirical anomalies, such as the positive relationship between output growth, inflation, and the policy rate are eliminated when properly accounting for the systematic responses of policy.

This calls for the development of methodologies capable of incorporating environmental as well as <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goals</b> in the design of public policies. In view of this, this paper proposes a methodology based upon Simonian satisficing logic implemented with the help of goal programming models to address the joint design of macroeconomic and environmental policies. The methodology is applied to the Spanish economy, where a joint policy is elicited, taking into account <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goals</b> (economic growth, inflation, unemployment, public deficit) and environmental goals (CO 2, NOx and SOx emissions) within the context of a computable general equilibrium model.

An alternative policy setting is to keep government expenditure changes gradual and modest. It is shown that whether a more discretionary or a more stable usage of government expenditures better attains official sector <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goals</b> is difficult to determine theoretically, in part because of missed risk effects. But the detecting which policy better meets the official sector <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goals</b> from analysis of historical data or inter-country comparisons suffers from confounding events and institutions. This study offers a fresh insight from laboratory experiments.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{different}} structures of investment finance in the main EMU member economies, using the BACH database of balance sheet data, aggregated by firm size. Two main sets of results are obtained. First, each country/size class group is characterised using the net sources and uses of finance methodology. The importance of long-term debt {{as a source of}} investment finance, and its reduction in the later part of the 1990 s, is emphasised. The second contribution of the paper is to conduct panel regressions examining the determinants of the level and returns to investment, paying particular attention to the differential impact of economic conditions and monetary policy. The main findings to emerge are that both the level and the returns to smaller firms ’ investments are particularly dependent on the share of long-term debt in their financing and on monetary policy conditions. The broad conclusion is that while stability should remain a central <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goal,</b> financial market policy aimed at encouraging the expansion of a stable supply of long-term credit is also critical for the employment and growth prospects of the eurozone...|$|E
40|$|Amongst the 14 {{independent}} Pacific island Countries (PICs), Papua New Guinea (PNG) {{is unique}} in several aspects. It is the largest island country {{in terms of both}} geographical area and population. Unlike other PICs, it is richly endowed with mineral and non-mineral resources and hence its exports are much more diversified. Mineral and non mineral tree exports since the mid 1990 s have helped the country to emerge with trade surpluses and build up international reserves. Prudent monetary and fiscal policies especially have helped PNG to create sufficient fiscal space to fight the adverse effects of the ongoing global recession since 2008. PNG is the only PIC with a floating exchange rate regime unlike the other five PICs which have currencies of their own. The amended Central Bank Act of 2000, which set price stability as primary <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goal</b> of the Bank of PNG, the country’s central bank has further empowered it with greater autonomy than ever before.

The main aim {{of this paper is}} to examine the public administration system during the Girmit time period in the Fiji Islands. This study found that Taylor’s principles of achieving maximum productivity from workers while ignoring the workers personal welfare and interests dominated the British rule during the Girmit time period. The Girmitiya’s were propelled to work on harsh working conditions with lack of incentives to improve their performance. The public administration system during the Girmit times viewed workers as commodities that will help the British rule to achieve their <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goal</b> of establishing revenue generating activities around Fiji.

And, more than that, I want to discuss how to sustain, in some countries, and recreate, in other countries, a spirited economy. The word “spirited ” is rarely used by economists to describe an economy. I have chosen to use that term for this address because of {{a view of the}} economy that I hold, that a fundamental driver of the economic success of nations {{has to do with the}} spirit of the people. An economy needs esprit de corps just as an army or business does. John Maynard Keynes, in his classic 1936 book The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money took an ancient medical term, “animal spirits ” (spiritus animalis in Latin, referring to the animating spirit that gets people to get up and go and do things) and said that fluctuations in these spirits drive economic successes and failures. My colleague George Akerlof and I wrote a book entitled Animal Spirits How Human Psychology Drives the Economy and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism (Princeton, 2009) which was a plea to regard the maintenance of a good level of animal spirits as a fundamental <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goal.</b> Achieving the proper economic spirit does not mean cheerleading by government officials to try to boost confidence.

According to Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory different socialising agents at multiple levels can contribute to optimal child development. The aim of this explorative baseline research was therefore to provide the Ministry of Education with descriptive information about whether or not child rearing practices in the pedagogical climate at micro and meso level contribute to the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goal.</b> Because constructivist classrooms, authoritative child rearing approaches and a robust educative and pedagogical civil society are prerequisites for optimal child development, this mix-method study researched these aspects in five districts while making a distinction between advantaged and disadvantaged communities. Data was collected from a sample of headmasters (n = 5), teachers (n = 88), parents (n = 268) and children aged eight to ten (n = 155). Findings showed that the climate did not fully contribute to optimal child development because of a pedagogical mismatch between child rearing approaches at home and at school. This was especially the case amongst the disadvantaged communities, where the civil society was eve less robust than in advantaged communities. This indicated that change is required to provide children with a pedagogical climate in which they can optimally develop into critical citizens that can adapt to their changing society, because of the transition into a knowledge based economy...|$|E
40|$|Professor Mark Scarberry has {{put forth}} a {{formidable}} critique of my empirical study of mortgage market sensitivity to bankruptcy modification risk. As this response shows, however, his critique does not hold up under scrutiny. Professor Scarberry argues that my study design is invalid because, as he reads {{the current state of}} the law, cramdown is virtually impossible. Therefore, he contends, we should not expect markets to exhibit sensitivity to cramdown risk, so no policy conclusions can be derived from my finding of market insensitivity. Regrettably, Professor Scarberry overreads the state of the law. The law is in fact unsettled, and that is all that is necessary to uphold the validity of my study’s design because the market can be expected to price for uncertainty about the law, and the absence of such a premium is significant. This response article also challenges Professor Scarberry’s contention that Chapter 13 relief should be limited lest it engender “resentment” of debtors. The article questions whether prevention of resentment even provides a sound basis for limiting bankruptcy relief, much less when relief would further an important <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>goal</b> of housing market stabilization. More broadly, the article takes issues with claims about the sanctity of secured credit. Debates about the efficiency of secured credit have all played out in the business context. In the consumer context, however, the inefficiency is manifest. Treating secured credit as inviolable would take us back to the unhappy future of Chapter XIII with higher costs for unsecured credit and the abusive consumer finance world of Williams v.
