5|$|At the 1921 {{rally at}} the site, {{following}} a campaign by poet-politician Ventura Gassol, Pi Jove was inaugurated as {{the successor to}} the then-dead main tree. Speaking at the event, Gassol invited the landowner, who was present, to donate the tree to the Commonwealth of Catalonia (a semi-recognised autonomous government), but he declined, saying that practical effort is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> symbols.|$|E
5|$|Bulk interactions: The Debye {{screening}} length (defined above) {{is short}} {{compared to the}} physical size of the plasma. This criterion means that interactions in {{the bulk of the}} plasma are <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> those at its edges, where boundary effects may take place. When this criterion is satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral.|$|E

5|$|Its {{nesting site}} is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> its {{foraging}} site in {{playing a role}} in determining the habitat of the black-throated blue warbler. The black-throated blue warbler is an open-nesting species, that nests very close to the ground so it has to choose a protected nesting site where the risk of predation is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying Azzimani to the Olympics, was a {{group of}} eight {{schoolchildren}} from Woippy, a suburb of the French city Metz. Azzimani had organised the trip for the children, who were from an area which saw rioting following the death of a man fleeing police in January 2010.

5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> the weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{there was}} a burst in {{overlapping}} commitments and commission, both public and ecclesiastical, {{many of which were}} <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> his debut work at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli.

5|$|Given {{the events}} {{happening}} in Cuba at the time, Betances thought that his diplomatic work was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> ever. However, his failing health (he had uremia, and since his lungs could not exchange oxygen properly this put extra burden {{to his heart}} and kidneys) prevented Betances from performing further diplomatic work from France on behalf of Puerto Rico or Cuba. His illness, which lasted more than a year, prevented him from performing medical work, and forced the Party to approve a stipend for Betances during his long illness, until his death.|$|E

A staunchly anti-communist Indonesia was {{considered by the}} United States to be an essential counterweight, and friendly relations with the Indonesian government were considered <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> a decolonisation process in East Timor. The United States also wanted to maintain its access to deep water straits running through Indonesia for undetectable submarine passage between the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|E
5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning of the myths was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> elaborate storytelling.|$|E
5|$|Later, Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) confronts Glenn about {{revealing}} the barn's secret to the group, but Glenn says his personal well-being is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> her affections. Carol tries to stop Daryl from searching for Sophia alone, but he later {{comes back to}} show her another Cherokee rose blooming, helping to restore Carol's faith they will find Sophia. Elsewhere, Rick confronts Shane about his defiant attitude. The two argue until Rick exclaims that Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) is pregnant. As Rick leaves, Shane congratulates him, but is shocked and feared by this revelation.|$|E

5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely to}} be <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E
5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, {{it is evident that}} the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, most of the major structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E
5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, spiders' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae. Pedipalps carry {{a large number of}} such setae sensitive to contact chemicals and air-borne smells, such as female pheromones. Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations. In web-building spiders, all these mechanical and chemical sensors are <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> the eyes, while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively.|$|E
