5|$|A {{possible}} transitional form of <b>microorganism</b> {{between a}} prokaryote and a eukaryote {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists. Parakaryon myojinensis is a unique <b>microorganism</b> larger than a typical prokaryote, but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote, {{and the presence of}} endosymbionts. This is seen to be the first plausible evolutionary form of <b>microorganism,</b> showing a stage of development from the prokaryote to the eukaryote.|$|E
5|$|Yeast is the <b>microorganism</b> that is {{responsible}} for fermentation in beer. Yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains, which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide, and thereby turns wort into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.|$|E
5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} navigates {{a series of}} {{two-dimensional}} planes with an aquatic <b>microorganism</b> that evolves by consuming other microorganisms. The game's design is based on Chen's research into dynamic difficulty adjustment at the University of Southern California, and on psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theoretical concept of mental immersion or flow. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 22, 2007.|$|E

5|$|In July 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration {{issued a}} warning to the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group {{regarding}} HAACP (hazard analysis and critical control points) violations that were found at a processing plant in Irving, Texas. FDA found that lemon and lime juice was held in unsanitary conditions, which was a potential health threat to consumers. Company managers were advised by FDA that a reduction in <b>microorganism</b> levels was necessary to protect consumers.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} {{can be called}} monovalent (or specific) if they have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of <b>microorganism</b> (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Klebs was {{the first}} to observe {{bacteria}} in the airways of persons having died of pneumonia in 1875. Initial work identifying the two common bacterial causes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was performed by Carl Friedländer and Albert Fraenkel in 1882 and 1884, respectively. Friedländer's initial work introduced the Gram stain, a fundamental laboratory test still used today to identify and categorize bacteria. Christian Gram's paper describing the procedure in 1884 helped to differentiate the two bacteria, and showed that pneumonia could be caused by more than one <b>microorganism.</b>|$|E

50|$|Materials and {{surfaces}} {{can give}} off substances which {{serve as a}} food source for <b>microorganisms</b> such as bacteria, algae or fungi. <b>Microorganisms</b> could accumulate and multiply. However, plastics could not only represent a food source to <b>microorganisms,</b> materials and surfaces may also be altered by the products of metabolism generated by the <b>microorganisms</b> (e.g. discoloration). This may affect the service life of materials and enable <b>microorganisms</b> to gain uncontrolled access to critical areas.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} <b>microorganisms</b> from Antarctic soils were {{isolated}} using different selective nutrient media. The soils {{were collected from}} different habitats of Livingston Island. The <b>microorganisms</b> were isolated and purified to pure culture. The isolated <b>microorganisms</b> were micro-morphologically and macro-morphologically characterized. The results obtained suggested that despite the extreme Antarctic environment the diversity of soil <b>microorganisms</b> was considerably high. Some of the isolated <b>microorganisms</b> were able to protect corrosion. The effect of the studied <b>microorganisms</b> on the corrosive stability of steel samples was studied by micrometer method. The corrosive activity was confirmed by microscopic pictures of the treated steel samples...|$|R
5|$|Flow (stylized as flOw) is an indie {{video game}} created by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark. Originally {{released}} {{as a free}} Flash game in 2006 to accompany Chen's master's thesis, it was reworked into a 2007 PlayStation 3 game by his development studio, thatgamecompany. SuperVillain Studios released a PlayStation Portable version {{of the game in}} 2008, and PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions in 2013. In Flow, the player navigates a series of two-dimensional (2D) planes with an aquatic <b>microorganism</b> that evolves by consuming other microorganisms. The game's design is based on Chen's research into dynamic difficulty adjustment at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division, and on psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theoretical concept of mental immersion or flow.|$|E
5|$|The biotechnological {{applications}} of toxin-antitoxin systems {{have begun to}} be realised by several biotechnology organisations. A primary usage is in maintaining plasmids in a large bacterial cell culture. In an experiment examining {{the effectiveness of the}} hok/sok locus, it was found that segregational stability of an inserted plasmid expressing beta-galactosidase was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin-antitoxin system. In large-scale <b>microorganism</b> processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms. A toxin-antitoxin system maintains the plasmid thereby maintaining the efficiency of the industrial process.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. He {{found that the}} blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a <b>microorganism</b> and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E
40|$|Effects of the {{herbicide}} atrazine on soil <b>microorganisms</b> was investigated. Trials {{were set}} up in laboratory, on a clay loam soil. Atrazine was applied at 8. 0, 40. 0 and 80. 0 mg/kg soil rates. The abundance of total <b>microorganisms,</b> fungi, actinomycetes, cellulolytic <b>microorganisms</b> and amino-heterotrophs was recorded. Soil samples were collected 1, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 60 days after atrazine treatment for microbiological analyses. The {{results showed that the}} intensity of atrazine effect on soil <b>microorganisms</b> depended on treatment rate, exposure time and group of <b>microorganisms.</b> Atrazine had an inhibiting effect on cellulolytic <b>microorganisms</b> and amino-heterotrophs. Initially, it inhibited fungiand actinomycetes but its effect turned into a stimulating one once a population recovered. Atrazine had a stimulating effect on total abundance of <b>microorganisms...</b>|$|R
50|$|The spore {{count is}} used as an {{indirect}} measure {{of the number of}} <b>microorganisms</b> present. Typically 99% of <b>microorganisms</b> by species will be non-spore forming and able to survive in dormant states, and so the actual number of viable dormant <b>microorganisms</b> remaining on the sterilized spacecraft is expected to be many times the number of spore-forming <b>microorganisms.</b>|$|R
30|$|During the {{isolation}} of <b>microorganisms,</b> 313 <b>microorganisms</b> were chosen for further studies: 289 bacterial and 24 fungal strains. The pure cultures of <b>microorganisms</b> were stored at cooling conditions until {{the start of the}} plate tests.|$|R
5|$|Testing often {{including}} {{observing the}} colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying {{white and red}} blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid. The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels. A CSF culture may yield the <b>microorganism</b> that has caused the infection, or PCR {{may be used to}} identify a viral cause. Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis; and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.|$|E
25|$|CAP {{is treated}} with an {{antibiotic}} that kills the offending <b>microorganism</b> and by managing complications. If the causative <b>microorganism</b> is unidentified (often the case), the laboratory identifies the most-effective antibiotic; this may take several days.|$|E
25|$|Several {{tests can}} {{identify}} the cause of CAP. Blood cultures can isolate bacteria or fungi in the bloodstream. Sputum Gram staining and culture can also reveal the causative <b>microorganism.</b> In severe cases, bronchoscopy can collect fluid for culture. Special tests can be performed if an uncommon <b>microorganism</b> is suspected, such as urinalysis for Legionella antigen in Legionnaires' disease.|$|E
5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating <b>microorganisms</b> from the surroundings. As <b>microorganisms,</b> in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful <b>microorganisms</b> may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, <b>microorganisms</b> are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill <b>microorganisms</b> with heat and pressure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Microorganisms</b> {{are crucial}} to {{nutrient}} recycling in ecosystems as they act as decomposers.
