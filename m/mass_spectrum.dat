40|$|Summary: SPECLUST is a web {{tool for}} {{hierarchical}} clustering of peptide <b>mass</b> <b>spectra</b> obtained from protease-digested proteins. <b>Mass</b> <b>spectra</b> are clustered {{according to the}} peptide masses they contain, such that <b>mass</b> <b>spectra</b> containing similar <b>masses</b> are cluste-red together. Hierarchical clustering of <b>mass</b> <b>spectra</b> with SPECLUST can in particular be useful for MS-screening of large proteomic data sets derived from 2 D-gels. SPECLUST {{can also be used}} to iden-tify masses shared by <b>mass</b> <b>spectra.</b> <b>Masses</b> present in the majority of the <b>mass</b> <b>spectra</b> in a data set are likely to be contaminants. With SPECLUST, MS/MS can be focused on non-contaminant sha-red masses in a cluster, facilitating investigations of protein isoforms.

25|$|The {{final element}} of the mass {{spectrometer}} is the detector. The detector records either the charge induced or the current produced when an ion passes by or hits a surface.

25|$|These two components, used together, allow a much finer {{degree of}} {{substance}} identification than either unit used separately. It {{is not possible}} to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. Flame ionization detector) cannot differentiate between multiple molecules that happen to take {{the same amount of time}} to travel through the column (i.e. have the same retention time), which results in two or more molecules that co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (<b>mass</b> <b>spectrum).</b> Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error, as it is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, when an identifying <b>mass</b> <b>spectrum</b> appears at a characteristic retention time in a GC-MS analysis, it typically increases certainty that the analyte of interest is in the sample.|$|E
25|$|Spectral skewing is {{the change}} in {{relative}} intensity of mass spectral peaks due to the changes in concentration of the analyte in the ion source as the <b>mass</b> <b>spectrum</b> is scanned. This situation occurs routinely as chromatographic components elute into a continuous ion source.

40|$|Abstract. Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} {{is a widely}} used method for protein and peptide sequences identification. Since the <b>mass</b> <b>spectra</b> contain up to 80 % of noise and many other inaccuracies, there still exists {{a need for more}} accurate algorithms for <b>mass</b> <b>spectra</b> interpretation. The sizes of protein databases grow rapidly and the methods for indexing these databases in order to interpret <b>mass</b> <b>spectra</b> become very popular.

25|$|The matrix {{solution}} {{is mixed with}} the analyte (e.g. protein-sample). A mixture of water and organic solvent allows both hydrophobic and water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules to dissolve into the solution. This {{solution is}} spotted onto a MALDI plate (usually a metal plate designed for this purpose). The solvents vaporize, leaving only the recrystallized matrix, but now with analyte molecules embedded into MALDI crystals. The matrix and the analyte {{are said to be}} co-crystallized. Co-crystallization is a key issue in selecting a proper matrix to obtain a good quality <b>mass</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the analyte of interest.|$|E
25|$|A common way to {{get more}} {{quantitative}} information out of a <b>mass</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{is to create a}} standard curve to compare the sample to. This requires knowing what is to be quantitated ahead of time, having a standard available and designing the experiment specifically for this purpose. A more advanced variation on this is the use of an internal standard which behaves very similarly to the analyte. This is often an isotopically labeled version of the analyte. There are forms of mass spectrometry, such as accelerator mass spectrometry that are designed from the bottom up to be quantitative.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{molecule}} has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, it is frequently bound to other lipids including fatty acids; most analytical methods, therefore, utilise a strong alkali (KOH or NaOH) to saponify the ester linkages. Typical extraction solvents include 6% KOH in methanol. The free sterols and stanols (saturated sterols) are then {{separated from the}} polar lipids by partitioning into a less polar solvent (e.g. hexane). Prior to analysis, the hydroxyl group is frequently derivatised with BSTFA (bis-trimethyl silyl trifluoroacetamide) to replace the hydrogen with the less exchangeable trimethylsilyl (TMS) group. Instrumental analysis is frequently conducted on gas chromatograph (GC) with either a flame ionisation detector (FID) or mass spectrometer (MS).

25|$|The <b>mass</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{can be used}} to {{determine}} the mass of the analytes, their elemental and isotopic composition, or to elucidate the chemical structure of the sample. MS is an experiment that must take place in gas phase and under vacuum (1.33 * 10−2 to 1.33 * 10−6 pascal). Therefore, the development of devices facilitating the transition from samples at higher pressure and in condensed phase (solid or liquid) into a vacuum system has been essential to develop MS as a potent tool for identification and quantification of organic compounds and peptides. MS is now in very common use in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great variety of compounds. Among the many different kinds of mass analyzers, the ones that find application in LC-MS systems are the quadropole, time-of-flight (TOF), ion traps, and hybrid quadropole-TOF (QTOF) analyzers.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the precise}} {{structure}} or peptide sequence of a molecule is deciphered through {{the set of}} fragment masses, the interpretation of mass spectra requires combined use of various techniques. Usually the first strategy for identifying an unknown compound is to compare its experimental <b>mass</b> <b>spectrum</b> against a library of mass spectra. If no matches result from the search, then manual interpretation or software assisted interpretation of mass spectra must be performed. Computer simulation of ionization and fragmentation processes occurring in mass spectrometer is the primary tool for assigning structure or peptide sequence to a molecule. An a priori structural information is fragmented in silico and the resulting pattern is compared with observed spectrum. Such simulation is often supported by a fragmentation library that contains published patterns of known decomposition reactions. Software taking advantage of this idea has been developed for both small molecules and proteins.|$|E
