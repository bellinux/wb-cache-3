5|$|The {{decision}} by Andrew Harrison and Aaron Harrison {{on whether to}} enter the 2014 NBA draft would be the determining factor on whether Ulis became an immediate starter or not. <b>Many</b> <b>thought</b> Andrew would be Calipari's seventh consecutive point guard to declare for the NBA Draft after his freshman season, but that Ulis would likely last much longer at Kentucky. On April 25, the Harrisons announced {{that they would be}} returning to Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of the fittest, and <b>many</b> <b>thought</b> Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Kemp's {{endorsement}} {{was highly}} coveted. Forbes {{had tried to}} get Kemp {{to run in the}} 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar. Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. <b>Many</b> <b>thought</b> Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.|$|E
5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1778, Brant {{achieved}} an undeserved reputation for brutality. He {{was not present}} at Wyoming — although <b>many</b> <b>thought</b> he was — and he actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley. Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the butchers and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy with whom actually ordered or failed to restrain the killings. The massacre contributed to calls for reprisals, leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1990s, the {{official}} State Flag of Georgia {{had been a}} center of controversy as it incorporated the historic Confederate flag dating to the American Civil War, which among some people is thought to symbolize resistance to cultural changes in the state. After 2001 changes to the flag which removed this, Governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, who had led the flag-redesign effort, was defeated for re-election; <b>many</b> <b>thought</b> it {{was the result of}} the political backlash. The 1956 version with the Confederate States of America battle emblem, known as a St.Andrew's cross, was a continuing topic of debate for southern heritage proponents. Reed served as one of Governor Sonny Perdue's floor leaders in debates that led to the ratification of the current (2003) version of the state flag.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Báthory's reign {{marks the}} end of szlachta's reform movement. The foreign king was skeptical of the Polish {{parliamentary}} system and had little appreciation for what the execution movement activists had been trying to accomplish. Batory's relations with Sienicki soon deteriorated, while other szlachta leaders had advanced within the nobility ranks, becoming senators or being otherwise preoccupied with their own careers. The reformers managed to move in 1578 in Poland and in 1581 in Lithuania the out-of-date appellate court system from the monarch's domain to the Crown and Lithuanian Tribunals run by the nobility. The cumbersome sejm and sejmiks system, the ad hoc confederations, and the lack of efficient mechanisms for the implementation of the laws escaped the reformers' attention or will to persevere. <b>Many</b> <b>thought</b> that the glorified nobility rule had approached perfection.|$|E
5|$|Taylor rebounded in {{the early}} stages of what <b>many</b> <b>thought</b> would be his final season in 1992. Through close to nine games Taylor was on pace for 10 sacks and the Giants were 5–4. However, a {{ruptured}} Achilles tendon suffered in a game on November 8, 1992 against Green Bay sidelined him for the final seven games, during which the team went 1–6. Before the injury Taylor had missed only four games due to injury in his 12-year career. Throughout the 1992 season, and the ensuing offseason, Taylor was noncommittal about his future, alternately saying he might retire, then later hinting he wanted a longer-term contract.|$|E

Not only did he win, but Warner Bros. also {{knew that he was}} still their foremost box office draw and invited him back for a five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, with no more than two pictures a year. Cagney also had full say over what films he did and did not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.|$|E
5|$|Though Fox was {{initially}} worried about an entire episode {{set in the}} other universe, they soon came to appreciate the storyline. The episode included the first appearances of guest actors Andre Royo and Amy Madigan, who would both appear in several later episodes. It first aired in the United States on Fox in September 23, 2010, receiving almost all positive reviews due to the combination of emotional storylines, suspense, action, and humor. <b>Many</b> <b>thought</b> {{it was a good}} indicator of {{what the rest of the}} season had to offer, while others appreciated the numerous popular culture references that set the two universes apart.|$|E
5|$|Jean-François Champollion (Champollion le jeune; 23 December 17904 March 1832) was a French scholar, philologist and orientalist, known {{primarily}} as the decipherer of Egyptian hieroglyphs and a founding {{figure in the}} field of Egyptology. A child prodigy in philology, he gave his first public paper on the decipherment of Demotic in 1806, and already as a young man held many posts of honor in scientific circles, and spoke Coptic and Arabic fluently. During the early 19th-century French culture experienced a period of 'Egyptomania', brought on by Napoleon's discoveries in Egypt during his campaign there (1797–1801) which also brought to light the trilingual Rosetta Stone. Scholars debated the age of Egyptian civilization and the function and nature of hieroglyphic script, which language if any it recorded, {{and the degree to which}} the signs were phonetic (representing speech sounds) or ideographic (recording semantic concepts directly). <b>Many</b> <b>thought</b> that the script was only used for sacred and ritual functions, and that as such it was unlikely to be decipherable since it was tied to esoteric and philosophical ideas, and did not record historical information. The significance of Champollion's decipherment was that he showed these assumptions to be wrong, and made it possible to begin to retrieve many kinds of information recorded by the ancient Egyptians.|$|E
5000|$|Mindfulness {{has three}} characteristics. First, {{one has a}} {{sharpness}} and clearness of mind in which the instructions are not forgotten. Second, although the mind is very sharp and focused, there are not <b>many</b> <b>thoughts</b> arising because meditation is nonconceptual, so there are not <b>many</b> <b>thoughts</b> arising and the mind is naturally focused one-pointedly on an object. Third, because one has trust and faith and has the suppleness or flexibility of having become well trained, meditation becomes pleasant {{with a sense of}} comfort and pleasure. These three qualities in one's meditation cause the meditation instructions not to be forgotten.|$|R

5|$|On October 2, {{two days}} before it made {{landfall}} on southwestern Hispaniola, the San Juan Weather Bureau issued a gale warning from Barahona in the Dominican Republic to Sud-Est, Haiti. Advisories recommended small craft in the southern portions of the countries to remain at port. Later that day, the gale warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning in southwestern Haiti. On the day of when Flora made landfall, advisories recommended all citizens on beaches and in low-lying areas west of Santo Domingo to evacuate. Carmelo Di Franco, the provisional Director of Civic Defense for the Dominican Republic, organized safety procedures and the dissemination of tropical cyclone bulletins from the San Juan Weather Bureau. Di Franco also organized for the transmission of hurricane emergency information to citizens, believed to reduce the loss of life. On the afternoon before the hurricane struck, {{the head of the}} Haitian Red Cross prohibited radio broadcasts of tropical cyclone advisories for fear of panic among citizens. As a result, <b>many</b> <b>thought</b> the hurricane would miss the country.|$|E
5|$|The House of Commons {{backed the}} {{proposals}} strongly, but {{the bill of}} supremacy met opposition in the House of Lords, particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the Archbishopric of Canterbury. This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England rather than the more contentious title of Supreme Head, which <b>many</b> <b>thought</b> unacceptable {{for a woman to}} bear. The new Act of Supremacy became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the heresy laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new Act of Uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer compulsory, though the penalties for recusancy, or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.|$|E
