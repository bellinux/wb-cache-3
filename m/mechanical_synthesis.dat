40|$|The present work investigates Ni–nanodiamond and Ni–graphite {{composites}} {{produced by}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>synthesis</b> and subsequent heat treatments. Processing of nickel–carbon nanocomposites by this {{powder metallurgy route}} poses specific challenges, as carbon phases are prone to carbide conversion and amorphization. The processing window for carbide prevention has been established through X-ray diffraction by a systematic variation of the milling parameters. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the absence of carbide and showed homogeneous particle distributions, as well as intimate bonding between the metallic matrix and the carbon phases. Ring diffraction patterns of chemically extracted carbon phases demonstrated that milled nanodiamond preserved crystallinity, while an essentially amorphous nature could be inferred for milled graphite. Raman spectra confirmed that nanodiamond particles remained largely unaffected by <b>mechanical</b> <b>synthesis,</b> whereas the bands of milled graphite were significantly changed into the typical amorphous carbon fingerprint. The results on the annealed nanocomposites showed that milling with Ni accelerated graphitization of the carbon phases during heat treatments at 973 and 1073 K in both composites. At the finer scales, the nanocomposites exhibited a remarkable microhardness enhancement (∼ 70 %) compared with pure nanostructured nickel.

With this approach it is possible to investigate each degree-of-freedom individually. Equivalent Linear Momentum Systems are proposed to facilitate the calculations in order to use different convenient reference frames.
