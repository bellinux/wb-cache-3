5|$|Alligator and {{crocodile}} farming began {{because of}} demand for their hides, but now nearly {{all parts of the}} animal are put to use. The side and belly skin make the best leather, the <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> eaten, the gall bladders are valued in East Asia, and the heads are sometimes made into ornaments. In traditional Chinese medicine, alligator <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> said to cure the common cold and prevent cancer, while various internal organs are believed to have medicinal properties.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are farmed {{for meat}} and skins in South America. The <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} unsuitable {{to eat in}} some areas, while in other areas it is considered {{an important source of}} protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> dark and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are {{considered}} a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, {{as it can be}} infected with the parasite Trichinella spiralis.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Meat</b> <b>was</b> {{prepared}} {{in several different}} ways. The most common was to cook it with water as a broth or a stew (for example, [...] ). Meat stewed with onions, garlic and leeks and flavored with cumin and coriander is described on ancient Babylonian cuneiform tablets, and it is most likely that it was prepared similarly in ancient Israel. Stewed <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> {{considered to be a}} dish worthy of serving to honored guests (...) [...] A less common way to prepare <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> to roast it over an open fire, but this was done particularly for the meat of the Passover lamb. For long-term storage, <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> smoked, dried or salted, according to indications in texts and ethnographic studies.|$|R
25|$|In the 1870s, <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> {{rare and}} eaten on Sabbath and festivals, but became more {{available}} {{towards the end}} of the 19th century; however, chicken remained a luxury item. <b>Meat</b> <b>was</b> primarily beef, but goat and lamb were eaten, particularly in the spring. Almost every part of the animal was used.|$|R
50|$|One major Nigerian {{newspaper}} {{published a}} {{report about the}} widespread view that eating dog <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> a healthy alternative to bush <b>meat.</b> Dog <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> implicated in a June 2015 Liberian outbreak of Ebola, where three villagers who had {{tested positive for the}} disease had shared a meal of dog meat.|$|R
5|$|Beef is an {{excellent}} source of zinc, selenium, phosphorus, iron, and B vitamins. Bison <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> lower in fat and cholesterol than beef, but has a higher protein content.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E
50|$|Hindus who eat <b>meat</b> <b>are</b> {{encouraged}} to eat Jhatka meat.|$|R
50|$|Most widely {{consumed}} <b>meats</b> <b>are</b> pork, chicken, {{rabbit and}} goat.|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} {{feature of the}} rural economy was the herding of cattle. Cows were not generally slaughtered for meat unless old or injured, but male cattle, if not destined to be oxen, were often slaughtered at one or two years. Salted beef <b>Meat</b> <b>was</b> cooked in a cauldron where different forms of stew <b>were</b> commonly made. <b>Meat</b> <b>was</b> also barbecued on spits (bir) made of either wood or iron. The poem Aislinge Meic Con Glinne describes the roasting of pieces of beef, mutton and ham on spits of whitebeam. The <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> marinated in salt and honey first.|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of the Bengal slow loris, every part—including the brain, urine, and skin—is used in {{traditional}} medicine in order to heal wounds and rheumatism. With the Sunda slow loris, people trade the skin, feet, skeletons, and skulls. The fur is reported to heal wounds, the flesh to cure epilepsy, eyes are used in love potions, and the <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> reported to cure asthma and stomach problems. The pygmy slow loris is primarily valued for the medicinal use of its hair, but it is also used to make bone glue of monkey, a medicine used mostly by local people, but sometimes sold to visitors. In general, wearing slow loris bones is considered good luck and the <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> sometimes thought to cure leprosy.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cultures}} revere the elk as {{a spiritual}} force. In parts of Asia, antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines. Elk are hunted as a game species. The <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> leaner and higher in protein than beef or chicken.|$|E
5|$|The creek whaler {{is a minor}} bycatch of inshore gillnet {{fisheries}} {{operating in}} northern Australia; the <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> sold for human consumption. Given its relatively high reproductive rate, its population appears capable of withstanding present levels of fishing. Therefore, the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern.|$|E

50|$|Production was not {{economically}} feasible in Europe, where <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> expensive, but in Uruguay and New South Wales <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> an inexpensive {{byproduct of the}} leather industry. In 1865, Liebig partnered with Belgian engineer George Christian Giebert, and was named scientific director of the Liebig's Extract of Meat Company, located in Fray Bentos, Uruguay.|$|R
5|$|Venison was {{the most}} popular game. The {{plentiful}} <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> often potted or jerked, and its tripe was popular as well. Venison was especially popular during the Thanksgiving season. Buffalo was an important protein source until roughly 1770, when the animals were over-hunted in the eastern United States. Bear were numerous in the northern colonies, especially in New York, and many considered the leg <b>meat</b> to <b>be</b> a delicacy. Bear <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> frequently jerked as a preservation method.|$|R
5|$|Different {{variants}} {{have been}} introduced catering to regional taste and requirements. A meethi (sweet) variant of haleem is consumed as breakfast by the Arab diaspora in Barkas neighbourhood of the city. The chicken variant is less popular, {{even though it is}} lower priced. A vegetarian version of haleem, in which dry fruits and vegetables are substituted for goat <b>meat,</b> <b>is</b> available at some eateries in Hyderabad.|$|E
5|$|Dromedary {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E
5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>meat</b> of conchs <b>is</b> eaten raw in salads, or cooked, as in burgers, chowders, fritters, and gumbos. All {{parts of}} the conch <b>meat</b> <b>are</b> edible.|$|R

5|$|Relatively strong {{reducing}} acids {{can have}} antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and {{preventing them from}} being absorbed. Notable examples are oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid, which are high in plant-based diets. Calcium and iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.|$|E
5|$|Ringed seals {{were once}} the main food staple for the Inuit. They are still an {{important}} food {{source for the}} people of Nunavut and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. Seal <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> an important source of food for residents of small coastal communities. The seal blubber is used to make seal oil, which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada's raw seal oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores.|$|E
5|$|Since ancient times, the mallard {{has been}} eaten as food. The wild mallard was eaten in Neolithic Greece. Usually, only the breast and thigh <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> eaten. It {{does not need}} to be hung before preparation, and is often braised or roasted, {{sometimes}} flavoured with bitter orange or with port.|$|E

50|$|Vleeshal means meat-hall; it was {{the only}} place in Haarlem where fresh <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> allowed to be sold from 1604 to the 18th century. The ox-heads {{on the front of the}} {{building}} indicate the function of the hall. The building was used for selling fresh <b>meat,</b> salted <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> sold in the Warmoesstraat, the street next to the building.|$|R
5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is typically}} inoffensive towards humans, but if disturbed, can inflict a severe bite. Across {{much of its}} range, it is a frequent catch (intentional or not) in bottom trawls and probably also set nets and demersal gillnets; the <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> eaten and the rough skin is made into a type of leather called shagreen for use in wood finishing.|$|E
5|$|The hide of the {{blackbuck}} (krishnajina in Hindi) {{is deemed}} to be sacred in Hinduism. According to the scriptures, {{it is to be}} sat upon only by brahmins (priests), sadhus and yogis (sages), forest-dwellers and bhikshus (mendicants). Blackbuck <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> highly regarded in Texas. In an analysis, blackbuck milk was found to have 6.9% protein, 9.3% fat, and 4.3% lactose.|$|E
5|$|The hippo {{population}} declined most {{dramatically in}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By 2005, the population in Virunga National Park had dropped to 800 or 900 from around 29,000 in the mid-1970s. The decline is attributed to the disruptions caused by the Second Congo War. The poachers {{are believed to be}} Mai-Mai rebels, poorly paid Congolese soldiers, and local militia groups. Reasons for poaching include the belief that hippos are harmful to society, as well as financial gain. However, as of 2016, the Virunga hippo population appears to have increased, possibly due to greater enforcement and cooperation between fishermen and park authorities. The sale of hippo <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> illegal, but black-market sales are difficult for Virunga National Park officers to track. Hippo <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> considered a delicacy in some areas of central Africa and the teeth have become a valued substitute for elephant ivory.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meat</b> {{and poultry}} <b>was</b> stewed, baked and boiled. There <b>were</b> no fried <b>meat</b> dishes in Finno-Ugric cuisine, only roasted dishes which also were {{borrowed}} from Tatar cuisine in the 19th century. Beef, mutton and pork were preserved in several ways. The most ancient preservation method <b>was</b> drying. Pre-boiled <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> dried at oven {{or under the}} Sun. Fat from broth was collected and used for cooking. <b>Meat</b> <b>was</b> also frozen for preservation.|$|R
