The estimation results demonstrate that the repurchase based on the 1994 amendment to the Commercial Law is more consistent with the cash-flow hypothesis, while the repurchase made under the special code enforced in 1997 is more agreeable with the signaling hypothesis. No evidence is found for liquidity impacts of repurchases on stock pricing. ...|$|R
