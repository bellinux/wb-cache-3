50|$|Mace, {{in one of}} {{his recent}} studies, wanted to test the notion that basic {{cognitive}} activities, such as thinking about the past, may prime involuntary memories. To test this idea, Mace set up a diary <b>method</b> <b>study</b> in which participants recorded involuntary memories they experienced during a two-week period, in a diary. During this two-week period, participants also had to come into a laboratory at intervals, and were instructed to recall memories from certain life periods (e.g., high school, first five years of marriage). Following this, comparing their involuntary memories to a control condition found that a significant number of their involuntary memories related to the time period they were instructed to recall. Such findings suggest that involuntary memories may be primed by even the simplest of cognitive tasks—namely, reminiscing and recalling the past.|$|E

The inclusion of mixed <b>methods</b> <b>studies</b> in systematic reviews is increasing, but these studies pose particular challenges to methods of review. This article examines the quality of the reporting of mixed <b>methods</b> and qualitative-only <b>studies.</b> <b>Methods</b> We used two completed systematic reviews to generate a sample of qualitative <b>studies</b> and mixed <b>method</b> <b>studies</b> in order to make an assessment of how the quality of reporting and rigor of qualitative-only studies compares with that of mixed-methods studies. Results Overall, the reporting of qualitative studies in our sample was consistently better when compared with the reporting of mixed <b>methods</b> <b>studies.</b> We found that mixed <b>methods</b> <b>studies</b> are less likely to provide a description of the research conduct or qualitative data analysis procedures and less likely to be judged credible or provide rich data and thick description compared with standalone qualitative studies. Our time-related analysis shows that for both types of study, papers published since 2003 are more likely to report on the study context, describe analysis procedures, and be judged credible and provide rich data. However, the reporting of other aspects of research conduct (i. e. descriptions of the research question, the sampling strategy, and data collection methods) in mixed <b>methods</b> <b>studies</b> {{does not appear to have}} improved over time. Conclusions Mixed methods research makes an important contribution to health research in general, and could make a more substantial contribution to systematic reviews.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the cross {{sectional}} areas of individual muscle fibers were investigated with focus on statistical methodology. This thesis includes data from two studies; Resistance Study and <b>Method</b> <b>Study.</b> The Resistance Study analyzes the effect of exercise by comparing muscle fiber area before and after eight weeks of resistance training. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained from young male participants. The purpose of the <b>Method</b> <b>Study</b> {{was to examine the}} variation between right and left leg. Contrary to previous studies, this thesis focuses on individual data rather than on group-based data, and therefore takes a different approach than the previously published articles. This is proven to be successful since information is lost when analyzing group-wise, as the increase in small muscle fibers did not show when analyzing as a group. The results of the Resistance Study is similar to the results of the <b>Method</b> <b>Study.</b> Means and standard deviations have a wide spread both between subjects and between biopsies taken from the same subject. Inference on the 10 th and 90 th percentiles shows a positive pattern in the Resistance Study, in the sense that both the smallest and the largest muscle fibers have grown {{as a result of the}} resistance training. If muscle fiber area is used as a proxy for training effect, the conclusion is that many people seem to have responded well to the training. ...|$|E
