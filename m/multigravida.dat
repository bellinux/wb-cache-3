2500|$|Associated {{terms for}} {{pregnancy}} are gravid and parous. Gravidus and gravid {{come from the}} Latin for [...] "heavy" [...] and a pregnant female is {{sometimes referred to as}} a gravida. Gravidity is a term used to describe the number of times that a female has been pregnant. [...] Similarly, the term parity is used for the number of times that a female carries a pregnancy to a viable stage. Twins and other multiple births are counted as one pregnancy and birth. [...] A woman who has never been pregnant is referred to as a nulligravida. [...] A woman who is (or has been only) pregnant for the first time is referred to as a primigravida, and a woman in subsequent pregnancies as a <b>multigravida</b> or as multiparous. Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2, para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2, para 2. [...] In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/ or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of a multiple birth the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy achieving more than 20 weeks of gestation age are referred to as nulliparous.|$|E

40|$|Oxytocin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used drugs in obstetric practice but it is also the drug associated with the most preventable adverse events in childbirth. In this review we look at the use of oxytocin augmentation in the <b>multigravida.</b> We look at the concept of whether the <b>multigravida</b> is different to the primigravida. We provide a differential diagnosis for poor progress in the <b>multigravida</b> and look at the use of the partogram. Oxytocin recommended regimens are discussed and we look at how one can measure the effects of oxytocin. We summarize the evidence for the use of oxytocin in augmentation of the <b>multigravida</b> and then provide strategies to avoid problems if oxytocin is used in the multigravid patient. We conclude that the <b>multigravida</b> is very different to the primigravida and that use of oxytocin for augmentation in the <b>multigravida</b> should be strongly discouraged. If used, one should seriously consider the risks associated with oxytocin augmentation in the <b>multigravida</b> which includes uterine rupture. Use needs to be decided on a senior consultant level and it should only be used with continuous fetal monitoring, intrauterine pressure monitoring and only after all other causes of poor progress in the <b>multigravida</b> have been excluded. Consent, with explanation of all the risks associated with augmentation, should be obtained from the mother before augmentation is initiated. If oxytocin is going to be used for augmentation in the <b>multigravida</b> there must be a standardized protocol, there must be a doctor on site who is able to perform emergency caesarean section and who is available to respond to all emergencies. A low-dose, low-frequency dosing regimen should be used with weaning to the lowest dose necessary to maintain contractions. Revie...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{looked at}} the {{association}} between caesarean section (CS) and Body Mass Index (BMI) in primigravidas compared with <b>multigravidas.</b> STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled women at their convenience, in the first trimester after an ultrasound examination confirmed an ongoing pregnancy. Weight and height were measured digitally and BMI calculated. After delivery, clinical details were again collected from the Hospital's computerised database. RESULTS: Of the 2000 women enrolled, there were 50. 4 % (n= 1008) primigravidas and 49. 6 % (n= 992) <b>multigravidas.</b> Of the 2000 8. 5 % were delivered by elective CS and 13. 4 % were delivered by emergency CS giving an overall rate of 21. 9 %. The overall CS rate was 30. 1 % in obese women compared with 19. 2 % in the normal BMI category (p< 0. 001). In primigravidas the increase in CS rate in obese women was due {{to an increase in}} emergency CS (p< 0. 005) and in <b>multigravidas</b> the increase was due to an increase in elective CS (p< 0. 01). In obese primigravidas 20. 6 % had an emergency section for fetal distress. In obese <b>multigravidas</b> 17. 2 % had a repeat elective CS. CONCLUSION: The influence of maternal obesity on the increase in CS rates is different in primigravidas compared with <b>multigravidas...</b>|$|R

40|$|During pregnancy, Plasmodium falciparum-infected {{erythrocytes}} sequester in {{the placenta}} by adhering to chondroitin 4 -sulfate, creating {{a risk factor}} for both the mother and the fetus. The primigravidae are at higher risk for placental malaria than the <b>multigravidae.</b> This difference in susceptibility has been attributed to the lack of antibodies that block the adhesion of infected erythrocytes to placental chondroitin 4 -sulfate in primigravid women. However, recent results show that many primigravidae at term have antibody levels similar to those of <b>multigravidae,</b> and thus the significance of antiadhesion antibodies in providing protection against malaria during pregnancy remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed plasma samples from women of various gravidities at different gestational stages for antiadhesion antibodies. The majority of women, regardless of gravidity, had similar levels of antibodies at term. Most primigravidae had low levels of or no antiadhesion antibodies prior to ∼ 20 weeks of pregnancy and then produced antibodies. <b>Multigravidae</b> also lacked antibodies until ∼ 12 weeks of pregnancy, but thereafter they efficiently produced antibodies. In pregnant women who had placental infection at term, higher levels of antiadhesion antibodies correlated with lower levels of placental parasitemia. The difference in kinetics of antibody production between primigravidae and <b>multigravidae</b> correlated with the prevalence of malaria in these groups, suggesting that antibodies are produced during pregnancy in response to placental infection. The early onset of efficient antibody response in <b>multigravidae</b> and the delayed production to antibodies in primigravidae appear to account for the gravidity-dependent differential susceptibilities of pregnant women to placental malaria...|$|R

We used 80 trematode-infected ewes: primigravidae in group P-A and <b>multigravidae</b> in M-A remained untreated, primigravidae in P-B and <b>multigravidae</b> in M-B were drenched with netobimin and <b>multigravidae</b> in M-C were given rafoxanide. We collected faecal samples for parasitological examination, blood samples for beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration measurement and uterine content, teat duct material and milk samples for bacteriological examination. We found significant differences in blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations between M-A, M-B and M-C during pregnancy (P 0. 83). We found that for M-A, M-B and M-C ewes, respectively, median time to first case of mastitis was 5. 75, 21 and 6. 75 days after lambing (P = 0. 003) and incidence risk of mastitis was 0. 308, 0. 069 and 0. 222 (P = 0. 047). We postulate that trematode infections predispose ewes to mastitis; perhaps, increased beta-hydroxybutyrate blood concentrations adversely affect mammary cellular defences.

40|$|Objective: We {{evaluated}} {{the prevalence of}} cervicovaginal Bacteria, group B Streptococcus (GBS), Gardnerella vaginalis (GV), Candida spp., Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma hominis (MH) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) in pregnant women with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). Materials and method: Cervicovaginal swabs were gathered from 473 pregnant patients divided into 127 diabetic and 346 non-diabetic. The results were correlated to gestational age, parity and glycemic control. Results: A higher prevalence of MH/UU (P= 0. 012) {{was found in the}} diabetic patients. After the 28 th weeks of pregnancy the prevalence for all investigated microorganisms appeared similar except for MH/UU (P= 0. 014). In <b>multigravida</b> were there statistically differences between two groups in testing for Bacteria (P= 0. 015) and for MH/UU (P= 0. 037). The diabetic condition correlated to the state of <b>multigravida</b> in cases positive for Candida spp (P= 0. 049) and in those testing positive for at least one microorganism (P= 0. 043). Pregnant with a blood glucose > 92 have twice the risk of being positive to a single microbiological test than those with better glycemic control. Conclusions: The higher prevalence of MH/UU after the 28 th weeks can be explained with the physiological reduced insulin tolerance characteristic of this gestational period. Among the diabetic testing positive to Candida spp the statistically significant association was observed only in <b>multigravida</b> condition. These data suggest that diabetic <b>multigravida</b> are at increased risk for Candida spp infection in relation to the improper glycemic control...|$|E

40|$|Background: Primigravidity {{is one of}} {{the main}} risk factors for both malaria and anaemia. Since the {{implementation}} of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) in sub-Saharan Africa, the relationship between anaemia and gravidity and its evolution during pregnancy has been little explored. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of gravidity on the variation of haemoglobin during pregnancy according to the timing of gestation. Methods: Data from three studies carried out in nearby areas in south Benin (Ouidah, Come, Allada) between 2005 and 2012 were analysed. At inclusion (first antenatal visit, ANV 1) women's age, area of residence, schooling, gravidity, gestational age, weight and height were recorded. Thick blood smears were performed on ANV 1, second visit (ANV 2) and at delivery. In Allada, women's serum ferritin and CRP concentrations were also assessed. The impact of gravidity on maternal haemoglobin (Hb) was analysed using a logistic or linear regression depending on the outcome. The statistical significance was set to P < 0. 05. Results: In total, data from 3, 591 pregnant women were analysed. Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed a constant association between Hb concentrations and gravidity in the three periods of Hb assessment (ANV 1, ANV 2 and delivery). Mean Hb concentration was significantly lower in primigravidae than in <b>multigravidae</b> at ANV 1 (mean difference = - 2. 4 g/L, CI 95 %: [- 3. 4, - 1. 4], P < 0. 001). Afterwards, there was a significant increase in primigravidae only, with a tendency to reversal between primigravidae and <b>multigravidae,</b> which was confirmed at delivery (mean difference = 2. 8 g/L, CI 95 %: [1. 3, 4. 2], P < 0. 001). The prevalence of malaria infection was halved between ANV 1 and delivery in primigravidae while it decreased by only 38 % among <b>multigravidae,</b> who were less prone to malaria infection (prevalence at ANV 1, 20 % and 10 % respectively). Iron deficiency was more common in <b>multigravidae,</b> and it decreased slightly in this group between ANV 1 and delivery. Conclusion: In a context of IPTp, Hb levels improved progressively throughout pregnancy in primigravidae, likely as a result of reduction in malaria infection.

40|$|Maternal malaria and anaemia, {{pregnancy}} and infant outcomes are reviewed among {{a cohort of}} mothers and their babies living in Chikwawa district, southern Malawi. Overall, 4104 women were screened at first antenatal visit and 1523 at delivery. Factors independently associated with moderately severe anaemia (MSA; < 8 g haemoglobin/dl) in primigravidae were malaria (relative risk = 1. 9; 95 % confidence interval = 1. 6 - 2. 3) and iron deficiency (relative risk = 4. 2; 95 % confidence interval = 3. 5 - 5. 0). Only iron deficiency was associated with MSA in <b>multigravidae.</b> After controlling for antimalarial use, parasitaemia was observed in 56. 3 % of the HIV-infected primigravidae and 36. 5 % of the non-infected (P = 0. 04). The corresponding figures for <b>multigravidae</b> were 23. 8 % and 11. 0 %, respectively (P = 0. 002). Over 33 % of the infants born alive to primigravidae were of low birthweight (LBW; < 2500 g), and 23. 3 % of all newborns had foetal anaemia (< 12. 5 g haemoglobin/dl cord blood). LBW was significantly associated in primigravidae with pre-term delivery, placental malaria and frequency of treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and in <b>multigravidae</b> with pre-term delivery, adolescence, short stature and MSA. LBW was significantly reduced with a second SP treatment in primigravidae, and with iron-folate supplementation in <b>multigravidae.</b> Mean haemoglobin concentrations were significantly lower in the infant who had been LBW babies than in the others, and significantly associated with parity, peripheral parasitaemia at delivery and placental malaria.

Design. Randomised controlled trial. Setting. Tertiary academic hospital. Method. Two different groups of patients were screened for BV at the first antenatal visit, namely primigravidae and high-risk <b>multigravidae</b> who had had a previous midtrimester abortion or preterm delivery. Patients where BV was diagnosed clinically or on Gram's stain of a smear taken from the posterior vaginal fornix, received either 400 mg metronidazole, or 100 mg vitamin C orally twice daily for 2 days. The Gram's stain was repeated after 4 weeks. If BV was found again, treatment with the same drug was repeated. Outcome measures. Preterm delivery, birth weight and perinatal deaths. Results. One thousand and five patients entered the study, but 40 were excluded for various reasons and 10 were lost to follow-up. There were 464 primigravidae, of whom 150 (32 %) had BV. Except for the 5 -minute Apgar score, {{no significant differences were}} found between primigravidae negative for BV and those who received either metronidazole or vitamin C. There were 491 high-risk <b>multigravidae,</b> of whom 127 (26 %) had BV. The mean gestational age in the BV negative group was 37 weeks, in contrast to 37. 4 weeks in the vitamin C group and 35. 6 weeks in the metronidazole group. Birth weights in these three groups were 2 752 g, 2 759 g and 2 475 g respectively, significantly less (P = 0. 0109) in the metronidazole group in comparison with the BV-negative group. Delivery before 37 weeks occurred in 29 % of high-risk <b>multigravidae</b> with no BV but in 24 % of those who took vitamin C and in 43 % who took metronidazole. Differences were significant between the BV-negative and metronidazole groups (P = 0. 0231) and also between the metronidazole and vitamin C groups (P = 0. 0274). Delivery before 28 weeks occurred in 4 % of the high-risk <b>multigravidae</b> with no BV but in 10 % of those with BV who took metronidazole. The difference was significant (P = 0. 0430).

40|$|Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is a {{sensitive}} biomarker of cardiac ischemia. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) may imply fetal hypoxia, resulting in blood flow centralization {{in favour of}} vital organs (brain, heart, adrenals—‘‘brain sparing effect’’). Based on the latter, we hypothesized that cord blood IMA levels should not differ between IUGR and appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) full-term pregnancies. IMA was measured in blood samples from doubly-clamped umbilical cords of 110 AGA and 57 asymmetric IUGR pregnancies. No significant differences in IMA levels were documented between AGA and IUGR groups. IMA levels were elevated in cases of elective cesarean section (P =. 035), and offspring of <b>multigravidas</b> (P =. 021). In conclusion, ‘‘brain sparing effect’’ is possibly responsible {{for the lack of}} differences in cord blood IMA levels at term, between IUGR and AGA groups. Furthermore, higher oxidative stress could account for the elevated IMA levels in cases of elective cesarean section, and offspring of <b>multigravidas...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{impact of}} malaria on {{the risk of}} {{stillbirth}} is still under debate. The aim of the present analysis was to determine comparative changes in stillbirth prevalence between two areas of Tanzania with different malaria transmission patterns in order to estimate the malaria attributable component. Methods: A retrospective analysis was completed of stillbirth differences between primigravidae and <b>multigravidae</b> in relation to malaria cases and transmission patterns for two different areas of Tanzania {{with a focus on}} the effects of the El Nino southern climatic oscillation (ENSO). One area, Kagera, experiences outbreaks of malaria, and the other area, Morogoro, is holoendemic. Delivery and malaria data were collected over a six year period from records of the two district hospitals in these locations. Results: There was a significantly higher prevalence of low birthweight in primigravidae compared to <b>multigravidae</b> for both data sets. Low birthweight and stillbirth prevalence (17. 5...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} {{antibodies to}} chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) -binding and placental Plasmodium falciparum - infected {{red blood cells}} (PRBCs) among pregnant women with or without placental malaria. Immunoglobulin G to PRBC surface antigens was rare in uninfected primigravidae (3. 7 %), more prevalent in infected primigravidae (70 %; P <. 001), and common in infected (77 %) and uninfected (83 %) <b>multigravidae.</b> Similar patterns were seen for agglutinating antibodies, and antibodies were similar among women with past or active placental infection. PRBC adhesion to CSA was inhibited 60 % by cells obtained from infected primigravidae but 24 % by cells obtained from uninfected primigravidae (P =. 025), whereas infection did not alter adhesion inhibition by <b>multigravidae</b> (77 % inhibition). There was substantial heterogeneity in antibody type and levels. Antibodies did not correlate with parasite density or pregnancy outcome. Comparisons between antibodies suggest that adhesion-inhibitory antibodies and those to PRBC variant antigens have distinct and overlapping epitopes, may be acquired independently, and have different roles in immunity...|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{observational}} study aimed {{to describe the}} rates and indicators for continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during normal labour and to compare them between {{women who have had}} one pregnancy (PG) and women who have already delivered two or more children (G 2 and above). Methods: The study was conducted at Mother and Child Hospital, Buraidah from July-Sept, 2013 as a descriptive cross sectional study. Results: Seventy four percent of labouring women had EFM and 25. 7 % had intermittent auscultation. Amongst the EFM group 62 % were Primigravidas and 37. 9 % were <b>multigravidas.</b> When compared between PG and <b>multigravidas,</b> maconium staining (14. 18 vs 1. 22, p value= 0. 001), maternal concerns for fetal heart rate (14. 93 vs 6. 10 p value= 0. 049), and syntocinon usage (14. 18 vs 2. 44 p value= 0. 005) were significantly prominent indications for Primigravidas. However trial of scar (0. 00 vs 15. 85 p value < 0. 001) and associated medical problems (6. 72 vs 19. 51 p value 0. 004) were the most frequent indications for G 2 and above. For a large population of women including 13 PG and 18 <b>Multigravidas</b> (Overall 14. 3 %) there was no particular indication assigned for EFM and this was more frequent amongst Gravida 2 and above (P < 0. 013).
