Large groups of solitary bee nests are called aggregations, to distinguish them from colonies. In some species, multiple females share a common nest, but each makes and provisions her own cells independently. This type of group is called [...] "communal" [...] and is not uncommon. The primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis.|$|E

40|$|The {{ferruginous}} sandstone of {{the gothic}} “Maagdentoren” {{is suffering from}} a specific biological deterioration process triggered by perforating activities of <b>mason</b> <b>bees.</b> The damage due to these perforations causes extensive loss of material, so that a durable conservation of such degraded stone blocs becomes questionable. In order to evaluate the conservation possibilities of stone blocs damaged by perforating <b>mason</b> <b>bees,</b> {{an investigation of the}} internal structure by means of X-ray tomography was carried out. This investigation revealed that the cumulative effect of the digging work by multiple generations of <b>mason</b> <b>bees</b> may result in networks of perforations. Bioturbated sandstones were found to be most suitable for attack by <b>mason</b> <b>bees</b> because of morphological and geometrical compatibility between the original layered burrowings by marine organisms and those by the <b>mason</b> <b>bees.</b> As a conclusion the conservation is not recommended of sandstone blocs for which the load bearing capacity is endangered by the branched and layered perforations...|$|R

5000|$|Osmia avosetta is {{a species}} of <b>mason</b> <b>bee.</b> It is solitary by nature, and is unique in its use of flower petals to {{construct}} nests for its larvae.|$|E
50|$|Species of {{the genus}} include the orchard <b>mason</b> <b>bee</b> Osmia lignaria, the {{blueberry}} bee O. ribifloris, and the hornfaced bee O. cornifrons. The former two are native to the Americas and the latter to Japan, although O. lignaria and O. cornifrons have been moved from their native ranges for commercial purposes. The red <b>mason</b> <b>bee,</b> Osmia bicornis, is found across the European continent. Over 300 species are found across the Northern Hemisphere. Most occur in temperate habitats within the Palearctic and Neartic zones, and are active from spring through late summer.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mason</b> <b>bee</b> {{is a name}} now {{commonly}} used for species of bees in the genus Osmia, of the family Megachilidae. Historically, the term <b>mason</b> <b>bee</b> has also been used to describe bees of Chalicodoma and Megachilidae, most notably in [...] "The Mason-Bees" [...] by Jean-Henri Fabre and his translator Alexander Teixeira de Mattos in 1914. [...] Mason bees are named for their habit of using mud or other “masonry” products in constructing their nests, which are made in naturally occurring gaps such as between cracks in stones or other small dark cavities; when available some species preferentially use hollow stems or holes in wood made by wood-boring insects.|$|E
50|$|Osmia caerulescens, {{the blue}} <b>mason</b> <b>bee,</b> is {{a species of}} solitary bee from the family Megachilidae. It has a Holarctic {{distribution}} extending into the Indomalayan region, although its presence in the Nearctic {{may be due to}} human assisted introduction.|$|E
50|$|Osmia uncinata, the {{pinewood}} <b>mason</b> <b>bee,</b> is {{a species}} of solitary bee from the family Megachilidae It is an Arctic-alpine species which {{is found in the}} northern Palearctic, in the United Kingdom it is a Biodiversity Action Plan priority species.|$|E
50|$|The cavity nest of the <b>mason</b> <b>bee</b> can host Ptinus sexpunctatus, the six-spotted spider beetle, which {{feeds on}} other dead or {{decaying}} insects. It {{was discovered in}} North America in 2004, where it was accidentally introduced alongside Osmia species used for research as pollinators.|$|E
5000|$|Osmia bicornis, synonym Osmia rufa, is {{a species}} of <b>mason</b> <b>bee,</b> and {{is known as the}} red <b>mason</b> <b>bee</b> due to its {{covering}} of dense gingery hair. It is a solitary bee that nests in holes or stems and is polylectic, meaning it forages pollen from various different flowering plants. These bees can be seen aggregating together [...] and nests in preexisting hollows, choosing not to excavate their own. These bees are not aggressive; they will only sting if handled very roughly and are safe to be closely observed by children. Females only mate once, usually with closely related males. Further, females can determine the sex ratio of their offspring based on their body size, where larger females will invest more in diploid females eggs than small bees. These bees also have trichromatic color vision and are important pollinators in agriculture.|$|E
5000|$|Anthidium exhumatum is an {{extinct species}} of <b>mason</b> <b>bee</b> in the Megachilidae genus Anthidium. [...] The species is solely {{known from the}} late Eocene, Chadronian stage, Florissant Formation {{deposits}} in Florissant, Colorado, USA. [...] Anthidium exhumatum {{is one of only}} four extinct species of mason bees known from the fossil record, and with Anthidium scudderi, one of two species from the Florissant Formation.|$|E
50|$|The flowers {{themselves}} are a subtle pale creamy yellow, a significant characteristic for separating its identity from the purple flowered Russian Comfrey. The usual pollinators are the common carder bumble bee, honey bee, and red <b>mason</b> <b>bee.</b> The stem and leaves are clothed with soft hairs. The stem usually remains unbranched {{and the leaves}} are distinctly veined with a clear reduction in size from top to base.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers are}} pollinated by insects. In {{a survey of}} {{pollinator}}s in Alberta, the primary pollinator was Osmia proxima, a <b>mason</b> <b>bee.</b> Other pollinators included several hoverflies, such as Eriozona laxus, Eristalis hirta, Eristalis rupium, and Eupeodes lapponicus. The insects were observed probing the flower spur with their mouthparts and then getting the sticky pollen wads stuck on their heads as they pushed into the flower. The tiny, light seeds are dispersed on the wind.|$|E
50|$|The six-spotted spider beetle {{has been}} {{generally}} associated with pine forests, although more cosmopolitan sightings have occurred indoors. The larvae of P. sexpunctatus are commensals {{in the nest}}s of cavity-nesting solitary bees in the genera Osmia and Megachile. One example has been recorded, from Nova Scotia, Canada, in the nest of the Blue Orchid <b>Mason</b> <b>Bee</b> (Osmia lignaria). Within the nest, the larvae feed on the food provisions of the host larva.|$|E
50|$|Osmia lignaria, {{commonly}} known as the orchard <b>mason</b> <b>bee</b> or blue orchard bee, is a megachilid bee that makes nests in reeds and natural holes, creating individual cells for its brood that are separated by mud dividers. Unlike carpenter bees, it cannot drill holes in wood. O. lignaria is a common species used for early spring fruit bloom in Canada and the United States, though a number of other Osmia species are cultured for use in pollination.|$|E
50|$|An entomovector is a {{pollinating insect}} {{used as a}} vector to spread a {{substance}} used in the biocontrol of plant pests and diseases. The insect is typically a honey bee, bumble bee, or <b>mason</b> <b>bee,</b> but may be any variety of insect that spreads pollen among plants. The choice of vector species is decided {{by a combination of}} native species in the area to be pollinated, the plant species to be treated, and the ease of care of the vector species.|$|E
50|$|During the 19th {{and early}} 20th century, large {{portions}} of the island were richly wooded, with indigenous sago, coconuts and cloves abundantly produced. The Dutch purposefully exterminated the native nutmeg trees: a large grove still remained {{as late as the}} 1870s but it had disappeared by the onset of World War I. It is the easternmost point naturally inhabited by primates, {{in the form of a}} black ape which also occurs on Sulawesi. The world's largest bee, the giant <b>mason</b> <b>bee,</b> occurs here and on nearby Halmahera.|$|E
50|$|Llŷn {{is notable}} for its {{large number of}} {{protected}} sites, including a national nature reserve at Cors Geirch, a National Heritage Coastline and a European Marine Special Area of Conservation, and 20 Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

The Llŷn Coastal Path, a long distance footpath, enables walkers to fully explore both coasts of the peninsula.|$|E
50|$|North America {{has many}} native megachilid species, but alfalfa leafcutter bees (Megachile rotundata) are an {{imported}} species used for pollination. The most significant native species is Osmia lignaria (the orchard <b>mason</b> <b>bee</b> or blue orchard bee), which is sold commercially {{for use in}} orchard crop pollination, and which can be attracted to nest in wooden blocks with holes drilled in them (which are also sold commercially for this purpose). Anthidium manicatum, {{also known as the}} European wool carder bee, is another species within the Megachilidae family. Rather than cutting leaves or petals, however, A. manicatum scrapes the hairs from leaves to use for nesting material, a behavior that is atypical in Megachilidae bees.|$|E
