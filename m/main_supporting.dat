5|$|With this vote-of-confidence in place, BTF {{contracted}} with an independent maritime engineering firm {{to make a}} survey of the ship to determine her condition. If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks, then the question of dry berthing would be moot. The survey reflected that, although her hull leaks, her keel and <b>main</b> <b>supporting</b> internal structure is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the ship in a dry berth.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{underwent a}} series of repairs and redecoration, {{carried out by the}} Steel Coleman Davis Partnership in the early 21st century. These included a significant structural repair, as the <b>main</b> <b>supporting</b> roof truss was badly damaged. The frontage was also upgraded to withstand the weathering effects of being north-facing, and the damage caused by being so close to the road. Services continue to be held at the Unitarian Chapel, and as of March 2015, are held twice a month, on the first and third Sundays of each month.|$|E

When Kaufmann later confessed to what had been done, Wright showed him what Mosher had done and {{pointed out that the}} cantilever had held up for the past month under test loads without the wall’s support.|$|E

25|$|After the {{abolition}} in 1968 of theatre censorship in Britain, Travers {{was for the}} first time able to write about sexual matters without discreet allusion or innuendo. The Bed Before Yesterday (1975) depicts a middle-aged woman discovering the pleasure of sex, to the consternation of some who know her and the delight of others. Joan Plowright played the central character with John Moffatt, Helen Mirren and Royce Mills in the <b>main</b> <b>supporting</b> roles.

25|$|In March 2009 {{the club}} were officially granted {{permission}} {{to expand the}} stadium once again, over two phases. The first phase {{would have seen the}} Kop being extended to increase the ground's capacity up to approximately 37,000. It would also have seen the removal of the <b>main</b> <b>supporting</b> pillars and a giant screen installed as part of the stand's roof. The second phase would have seen the Valad Stand (formerly Arnold Laver Stand) also extended, bringing the total capacity to a 40,000 all seater. The expansion would also have had a secondary focus of being available for selection for FIFA World Cup matches in 2018 or 2022, if England's bid were to be successful. However, on 16 December 2009 The Football Association announced that should England's 2018/2022 World Cup bid be successful then any games played in Sheffield would be staged at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough Stadium. In light of this United's former chief executive, Trevor Birch, made it known that all planned ground redevelopment had been put on hold until the club was able to regain and maintain Premiership status.|$|E

25|$|As an alternative, Carleton built a {{drainage}} engine {{where the}} Holbeach River met the sea bank, {{but this was}} destroyed four days after its completion in December 1587, when someone cut through the <b>main</b> <b>supporting</b> beam. The perpetrator was tried, and during the trial it emerged that Carleton had been threatened because of another scheme for a drainage mill as Saturday Bridge on Ravens Dyke. It also became clear that Carleton had carried out the work at his own expense and {{did not expect to}} charge the parish for its continued maintenance. In July 1578, Lord Burghley, acting for the Privy Council, attempted to resolve the deadlock over the South Holland drain. He appointed the surveyors John Hexham and Ralph Agas to conduct a survey of the area, and their findings broadly supported Carleton's proposals. Four special commissioners, including Carelton, were appointed to design a course for the drain and were assisted by the engineer Humphrey Bradley. There is no evidence that any work was carried out, and it was not until 1793 that construction of the drain began.|$|E

Together, the anchors support a load of 8,000 tons. Their construction required a pile driver that was specially designed to work underwater.|$|E

Eagle was launched on 8June 1918 and was towed downriver to the shipbuilder's High Walker yard for fitting-out ten days later. The boiler uptakes were re-routed and the existing openings were plated over. The existing [...] upper deck became {{the floor of the}} hangar deck and a new superstructure was built above it. The flight deck was [...] thick and served as the uppermost strength deck, or <b>main</b> <b>supporting</b> deck, of the ship.

500|$|The <b>main</b> <b>supporting</b> {{character}} of Phantom Blood, Zeppeli, was {{created as a}} [...] "silly teacher" [...] {{in the style of}} the martial art masters from Jackie Chan's films and The Karate Kid, with a charm in the contrast between how they appear and who they are inside. Araki designed him with a mustache, drawing inspiration from the appearances of the painter Salvador Dalí and the Osomatsu-kun character Iyami; this was considered a gamble, as mustachioed characters in shōnen magazines were considered to appear old and untrusthworthy, potentially turning readers off. His name comes from the rock band Led Zeppelin, and was chosen to balance out the large amount of names in the series beginning with [...] "J"; the character Speedwagon was given his name for the same reason.|$|E
500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as {{he has nothing to}} say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a <b>main</b> <b>supporting</b> role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006. Director Bryan Singer credited the 1978 Superman as an influence for Superman Returns, and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. [...] also was released in 2006.|$|E
