5|$|A {{prototype}} <b>Mark</b> <b>2</b> {{was tested}} and proven on 8 April 1918, {{and the gun}} was scheduled to go into naval service in 1923. However, with the cancellation of both the Lexington and the South Dakota classes, no guns were installed on any ships even though 71 had been built and 44 were under construction. In 1922–24, twenty of the guns {{were given to the}} Army for use as coastal defense guns along with the Army's 16"/50 caliber M1919 guns. Later planning called for the use of these guns in the s, but miscommunication between design bureaus led to the 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun being used instead. As a result, all but three of the Navy's remaining <b>Mark</b> <b>2</b> and 3 guns were sent to the Army to also be used as coastal defense guns.|$|E
5|$|Early warning {{would have}} been {{provided}} by a Type 2, <b>Mark</b> <b>2,</b> Model 1 air search radar mounted {{at the top of}} the foremast. A Type 93 passive hydrophone system {{would have been}} fitted in the bow. The ships were designed to carry three aircraft on a platform between the funnel and the mainmast. These would have consisted of one three-seat Aichi E13A and two two-seat Yokosuka E14Y floatplanes. They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults, one on each side of the aircraft platform.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{meeting the needs}} of the British forces, Project E affected the design and development of British nuclear weapons. Interim designs like Violet Club were no longer required, as Project E weapons could do the job pending the development of a British weapon. The British designers were particularly impressed by the Mark 28, which was not only lighter than the British Green Grass warhead used in Yellow Sun, but remarkably more economical in its use of expensive fissile material. An Anglicised version of the Mark 28 was developed, known as Red Snow, and a Yellow Sun <b>Mark</b> <b>2</b> using Red Snow cost £500,000 compared with £1,200,000 for the Mark 1 with Green Grass.|$|E

50|$|In December 2008 the loco-hauled Holyhead to Cardiff Premier Service was inaugurated. It was hauled by Class 57s on hire from Virgin Trains, {{initially}} in top-and-tail {{formation and}} later singularly, hauling three standard class <b>Mark</b> <b>2s</b> and a <b>Mark</b> 3 first/buffet. Four Class 57s were repainted at Cardiff Canton and six <b>Mark</b> <b>2s</b> were refreshed at Eastleigh Works. Class 67s took {{over from the}} Class 57s in March 2012, and Mark 3s refurbished by Pullman Rail from the <b>Mark</b> <b>2s</b> in October 2012.|$|R
50|$|Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) {{introduced}} 540 Victory <b>Mark</b> <b>2s</b> between 1979 and 1983, {{including one}} unsuccessful air-conditioned coach which later had the air-conditioning unit removed. China Motor Bus (CMB) purchased 167 Victory <b>Mark</b> <b>2s</b> between 1979 and 1982. New Lantao Bus (NLB) also purchased nine between 1980 and 1983, with a further six buses acquired from KMB in later years. In 1993 NLB sold 10 of its Victory <b>Mark</b> <b>2s</b> to Citybus which took over 26 routes from CMB on 1 September 1993.|$|R
5|$|The ship {{returned}} home in 1943 {{and began to}} lay defensive minefields in 1944. She was moderately damaged by a mine in April 1945 and struck an American mine two months later. By this time, her armament had been augmented with approximately ten 25mm Type 96 AA guns in single mounts and 80 depth charges. In addition Tokiwa was fitted with Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 and Type 2, <b>Mark</b> <b>2,</b> Model 1 air search radars. While in northern Japan {{a few days before}} the end of the war, Tokiwa was severely damaged by American carrier aircraft and had to be beached by her crew lest she sink.|$|E

25|$|On 20 October 1949, {{the larger}} Skeeter <b>Mark</b> <b>2</b> {{performed}} its first flight. Powered tests using the rotorcraft soon made it {{apparent that the}} <b>Mark</b> <b>2</b> suffered from severe ground resonance problems. Cierva {{found it difficult to}} resolve these issues; on 26 June 1950, the Skeeter <b>Mark</b> <b>2</b> was destroyed during ground testing. Despite these problems, Cierva had received an order from the British Ministry of Supply for three improved Skeeters, a pair of Mark 3s and a single Mark 4, for evaluation purposes by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy. Prior to the completion of any of these three rotorcraft, rival manufacturer Saunders-Roe completed its take over of Cierva and took control of its facilities and development programmes in January 1951.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Mark</b> <b>2</b> has a semi-integral construction, {{giving it}} more {{strength}} than a Mark 1 {{in the event}} of an accident, although a key driver of the changed construction method was to overcome the serious corrosion problem point in the Mark 1 at the base of the body, where it was attached to the underframe. Other changes of design, such as the window units, were for the same reason, which had become a serious problem in Mark 1 vehicle maintenance costs. Revised painting methods were also part of this, which coincided with the change of livery from maroon (dark green on the Southern) to the blue and grey that <b>Mark</b> <b>2</b> coaches wore for much of their lives (some of the earliest <b>Mark</b> <b>2</b> coaches had the old livery at first).|$|E
