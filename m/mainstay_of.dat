5|$|For centuries, {{oyster farming}} {{has been a}} <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> the {{surrounding}} economy. However, in December 2009, commercial harvesting was suspended after the norovirus was discovered in several exported crops, resulting in a recall.|$|E
5|$|From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney, pilot of the B-29 Superfortress Bockscar that dropped the Fat Man nuclear bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. During his tenure, the wing developed from a rather new unit to the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> air {{defense in the}} Northeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|The lumber {{industries}} and stone mines {{on both sides}} of the river were eventually exhausted and closed. Tourists coming up the river from Port Jervis became the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> the local economy. During the next two decades, seasonal homes and hotels were built in Pond Eddy.|$|E

5|$|Today {{the main}} {{settlement}} {{on the island}} is Biggings, just {{to the east of}} which is Housa Voe from where the Snolda ferry arrives from its base at West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. Crofting, especially sheep rearing, is the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> island life.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak retired its {{fleet of}} F40PHs {{in the mid-1990s}} {{in favor of the}} GE Genesis, but the {{locomotive}} remains the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> Via Rail's long-distance trains and is a common sight on many other commuter railroads throughout the United States. In addition, Amtrak has kept a number of de-engined F40PHs in use as Cabbage cars/Non-Powered Control Units.|$|E
5|$|Samantha Claire Taylor MBE (born 25 September 1975) is {{a former}} cricketer who {{represented}} England more than 150 times between 1998 and 2011. A top order batsman, Taylor {{was the first woman}} to be named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. Along with Charlotte Edwards, she was the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> England's batting during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, and played a key role in the team's two world titles in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> {{the island}} is now ecological tourism, based around the farmhouse, which is operated by the Lihou Charitable Trust, although overall responsibility for the island remains with the Environment Department of the States of Guernsey. Lihou and several other small Channel Islands such as Herm and Sark, issued their own stamps until 1969, when the States of Guernsey assumed responsibility for postal services in the Bailiwick, which had previously been provided by the UK Government.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> the Ancient Greek diet was bread, {{and this}} was {{accompanied}} by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment}} is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed {{during the first}} few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E

5|$|The <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment}} is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment}} is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} cultivars of blackcurrant. 'Baldwin' was the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> the {{industry}} {{for many years}} but it has now largely been superseded by more productive and disease-resistant varieties. During the 20th century in Europe, much hybridisation work {{has been carried out}} {{in order to reduce the}} plant's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields. This effort centred especially on Russia, Sweden and Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{agriculture}} was the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> {{the economy}} {{of this part of}} Wales, but with the Industrial Revolution, the North Wales Coalfield was developed and parts of eastern Clwyd around the Dee estuary and Wrexham became industrialised. The advent of the railway running from Chester along the North Wales coast in the mid-nineteenth century made it easy for urban dwellers from Lancashire and Cheshire to visit the seaside towns of North Wales, and nowadays, tourism is the main source of income in Clwyd.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decline}} in the 1890s, the logging of native timber {{expanded}} into new areas made accessible by an extension of the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century. One nail in the industry's coffin came with a series of bushfires which destroyed several mills in 1935. The cleared land was used primarily for pastoral sheep and dairy farming, which continues to be a <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> the Catlins' economy. Much of the remaining forest is now protected by the Department of Conservation as part of the Catlins Conservation Park.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> the Malagasy economy. Land is {{used for}} the {{cultivation}} of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E

5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|Early Muslim {{writings}} {{confirm that}} the people of West Africa operated a sophisticated network of trade, usually under the authority of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom. Sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved African areas were in place before Islam further strengthened trade, towns and government in western Africa. The capital, court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar Ab≈´ 'Ubayd 'Abd AllƒÅh al-Bakrƒ´; the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> the trans Saharan trade was gold and salt.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{is a very}} {{important}} resource in the Sava River basin, generally used for public water supply of potable water, as a source of water for industrial use, but also as the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> aquatic ecosystems. There are 41 identified significant groundwater bodies in the Sava River basin of basin-wide importance, ranging in area size from , as well as numerous minor ground water bodies. Even though most of them are transboundary waters, eleven are considered to be largely located in Slovenia, fourteen in Croatia, seven in Bosnia-Herzegovina, five in Serbia and four in Montenegro.|$|E
