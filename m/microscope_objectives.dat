50|$|The {{condition}} for the reproduction of a surface element {{in the place of}} a sharply reproduced point — the constant of the sine relationship must also be fulfilled with large apertures for several colors. E. Abbe succeeded in computing <b>microscope</b> <b>objectives</b> free from error of the axis point and satisfying the sine {{condition for}} several colors, which therefore, according to his definition, were aplanatic for several colors; such systems he termed apochromatic. While, however, the magnification of the individual zones is the same, it is not the same for red as for blue; and there is a chromatic difference of magnification. This is produced in the same amount, but in the opposite sense, by the oculars, which Abbe used with these objectives (compensating oculars), so that it is eliminated {{in the image of the}} whole microscope. The best telescope objectives, and photographic objectives intended for three-color work, are also apochromatic, even if they do not possess quite the same quality of correction as <b>microscope</b> <b>objectives</b> do. The chromatic differences of other errors of reproduction have seldom practical importances.|$|E

50|$|<b>Microscope</b> <b>objectives</b> are {{characterized}} by two parameters: magnification and numerical aperture. The magnification typically ranges from 4× to 100×. It is combined with the magnification of the eyepiece to determine the overall magnification of the microscope; a 4× objective with a 10× eyepiece produces an image that is 40 {{times the size of}} the object. Numerical aperture for microscope lenses typically ranges from 0.10 to 1.25, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 mm to 2 mm, respectively.|$|E

Similar to <b>microscope</b> <b>objectives,</b> {{they provide}} magnifications of 4X-10X and 2X-6X respectively when {{mounted on the}} FD Auto Bellows. They can only be used with a bellows, via an FD adapter; while the adapter can mechanically mount them directly to a camera, they cannot function optically. They are not properly FD lenses, but are listed here because {{they are part of}} the whole system.|$|E

Fast measurements of complete Mueller matrices over a range of polar angles (0 - 60 °) and all azimuthal angles (0 - 360 °) are achieved without mechanical movements. The polarization states generator and analyzer are based on nematic liquid crystals. The angular range is achieved through focalization of light over the measured sample with a <b>microscope</b> <b>objective</b> of high numerical aperture and imaging of the objective's back Fourier plane on a CCD array. A method for the calibration of the instrument, and particularly the precise characterization of the <b>microscope</b> <b>objective,</b> is shown and validated over well-known isotropic samples.

50|$|The {{thickness}} of the cover slip is crucially important for high-resolution microscopy. Typical biological <b>microscope</b> <b>objectives</b> are designed for use with No. 1.5 cover slips (0.17 mm thickness). Mount is used to attach the cover glass to the slide. The use of cover slips that deviate from this intended thickness will result in spherical aberration {{and a reduction in}} resolution and image intensity. Specialty objectives may used to image specimens without coverslips, or may have correction collars that permit a user to accommodate for alternative coverslip thickness.|$|E

After earning his doctorate, {{he worked for}} Edmund Hartnack's optical workshop in Potsdam designing <b>microscope</b> <b>objectives.</b> In 1891, {{after the death of}} Hartnack, he moved to Rathenow and took a job with the optical company Schulze & Barthels, where he developed telescopes, binoculars, {{and one of the first}} tele lenses for cameras. In 1894 he went to Voigtländer & Sohn in Braunschweig, where he held the post of technical director and also worked on improving rifle scopes. In 1899 he succeeded Hermann Wilhelm Vogel at the Royal Technical University in Berlin as professor of photography, photochemistry, and spectral analysis.|$|E

The system collects the backscattered light by the particles in the solid angle subtended by a <b>microscope</b> <b>objective</b> and then analyses its frequency components. The results for the detection of 2 μm and 50 nm particles are explained in terms of a cross polarization effect of the polarization vectors when the beam converts from divergent to parallel in the <b>microscope</b> <b>objective.</b> This explanation is supported with the results of the optical modelling using the exact Mie theory for the light scattered by the particles...|$|R

50|$|The {{polarization}} of the input beam (assumed to be collimated and monochromatic) can be chosen freely (linear, circular, or elliptic). Furthermore, a constant or Gaussian shaped input beam intensity profile can be assumed. On {{its way from}} the objective to the focus, the illumination light passes through up to three stratified optical layers, which allows the simulation of an immersion oil/air (layer 1) objective that focusses light through a glass cover slip (layer 2) into the sample medium (layer 3). Each layer is characterized by its (constant) refractive index and thickness. PSF Lab can also simulate <b>microscope</b> <b>objectives</b> that are corrected for certain refractive indices and cover slip thicknesses (design parameters). Thus, any deviations from the ideal imaging conditions for which the objective was designed for are properly taken into account.|$|E
50|$|At {{the lower}} end of a typical {{compound}} optical microscope, there are one or more objective lenses that collect light from the sample. The objective is usually in a cylinder housing containing a glass single or multi-element compound lens. Typically there will be around three objective lenses screwed into a circular nose piece which may be rotated to select the required objective lens. These arrangements are designed to be parfocal, which means that when one changes from one lens to another on a microscope, the sample stays in focus. <b>Microscope</b> <b>objectives</b> are characterized by two parameters, namely, magnification and numerical aperture. The former typically ranges from 5× to 100× while the latter ranges from 0.14 to 0.7, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2 mm, respectively. Objective lenses with higher magnifications normally have a higher numerical aperture and a shorter depth of field in the resulting image. Some high performance objective lenses may require matched eyepieces to deliver the best optical performance.|$|E

It consisted of 1 m focal length lens, a 10 power microscope objective, and a 128 -element G series Reticon linear array. Collimating throughput efficiency was defined as the ratio of measured collimated power to total laser output power. Two throughput efficiencies were obtained: one for the didoe operation below lasing and the other for the diode operation above lasing. The custom lenses had higher throughput efficiencies than the <b>microscope</b> <b>objectives.</b> The f/ 0. 8 system provided better throughput efficiencies than the f/ 1. 0 system...|$|E
