25|$|A typical {{method of}} {{top-down}} fabrication includes photolithography {{to define the}} geometry of channels on a substrate wafer. The geometry is created by several thin-film deposition and etching steps to form trenches. The substrate wafer is then bonded to another wafer to seal the trenches and form channels. Other technologies to fabricate nano-channels include surface <b>micromachining</b> with sacrificial layers, nano-imprinting lithography, and soft-lithography.|$|E
25|$|Superfinishing, {{also known}} as <b>micromachining,</b> microfinishing, and short-stroke honing, is a {{metalworking}} process that improves surface finish and workpiece geometry. This is achieved by removing just the thin amorphous surface layer left by the last process with an abrasive stone or tape; this layer is usually about 1μm in magnitude. Superfinishing, unlike polishing which produces a mirror finish, creates a cross-hatch pattern on the workpiece.|$|E

Then, {{different kinds of}} MEMS gyroscope structures, materials and fabrication technologies are illustrated. <b>Micromachined</b> gyroscopes are mainly categorized into <b>micromachined</b> vibrating gyroscopes (MVGs), piezoelectric vibrating gyroscopes (PVGs), surface acoustic wave (SAW) gyroscopes, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) gyroscopes, <b>micromachined</b> electrostatically suspended gyroscopes (MESGs), magnetically suspended gyroscopes (MSGs), micro fiber optic gyroscopes (MFOGs), micro fluid gyroscopes (MFGs), micro atom gyroscopes (MAGs), and special <b>micromachined</b> gyroscopes.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of recent achievements in microwave micro-electrome chanical systems (microwave MEMS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. The Ørst topic is a <b>micromachined</b> W-band phase shifter based on a <b>micromachined</b> dielectric block which is vertically moved by integrated MEMS actuators to achieve a tuning of the prop- agation constant of a <b>micromachined</b> transmission line. The second topic is W-band MEMS- tuneable microwave high-impedance metamaterial surfaces conceptualized for local tuning of the electromagnetic resonance properties of surface waves on a high-impedance surface. The third topic covers 3 -dimensional <b>micromachined</b> coplanar transmission lines with integrated MEMS actuators which move the sidewalls of these transmission lines. Multi-stable switches, tuneable capacitors, tuneable couplers, and tuneable Ølters have been implemented and characterized for 1 { 40 GHz frequencies.

50|$|Both {{bulk and}} surface silicon <b>micromachining</b> {{are used in}} the {{industrial}} production of sensors, ink-jet nozzles, and other devices. But in many cases the distinction between these two has diminished. A new etching technology, deep reactive-ion etching, has made it possible to combine good performance typical of bulk <b>micromachining</b> with comb structures and in-plane operation typical of surface <b>micromachining.</b> While it is common in surface <b>micromachining</b> to have structural layer thickness in the range of 2 µm, in HAR silicon <b>micromachining</b> the thickness can be from 10 to 100 µm. The materials commonly used in HAR silicon <b>micromachining</b> are thick polycrystalline silicon, known as epi-poly, and bonded silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers although processes for bulk silicon wafer also have been created (SCREAM). Bonding a second wafer by glass frit bonding, anodic bonding or alloy bonding is used to protect the MEMS structures. Integrated circuits are typically not combined with HAR silicon <b>micromachining.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of these devices}} is usually done by two techniques, surface <b>micromachining</b> and bulk <b>micromachining.</b> To do bulk <b>micromachining,</b> the region needed is highly doped with boron and the unwanted silicon is etched in liquid silicon etches.

50|$|Muller and {{his student}} Roger T. Howe created {{the process of}} surface <b>micromachining</b> using {{polysilicon}} (poly) as a structural material, and silicon oxide as a sacrificial layer. This surface <b>micromachining</b> process becomes the foundation of high volume airbag accelerometers. The surface <b>micromachining</b> process is the fundamental process for many consumer, industrial, and military devices today, including microphones, pressure sensors, electronic filters, spectrometers, and e-readers.|$|E
50|$|Surface <b>micromachining</b> uses layers {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of a substrate as the structural materials, rather than using the substrate itself. Surface <b>micromachining</b> was created in the late 1980s to render <b>micromachining</b> of silicon more compatible with planar integrated circuit technology, with the goal of combining MEMS and integrated circuits on the same silicon wafer. The original surface <b>micromachining</b> concept was based on thin polycrystalline silicon layers patterned as movable mechanical structures and released by sacrificial etching of the underlying oxide layer. Interdigital comb electrodes were used to produce in-plane forces and to detect in-plane movement capacitively. This MEMS paradigm has enabled the manufacturing of low cost accelerometers for e.g. automotive air-bag systems and other applications where low performance and/or high g-ranges are sufficient. Analog Devices has pioneered the industrialization of surface <b>micromachining</b> and has realized the co-integration of MEMS and integrated circuits.|$|E

50|$|<b>Micromachining</b> {{starts with}} a silicon wafer or other {{substrate}} and grows layers on top. These layers are selectively etched by photolithography and either a wet etch involving an acid or a dry etch involving an ionized gas, or plasma. Dry etching can combine chemical etching with physical etching, or ion bombardment of the material. Surface <b>micromachining</b> can involve as many layers as is needed with a different mask (producing a different pattern) on each layer. Modern integrated circuit fabrication uses this technique and can use dozens of layers, approaching 100. <b>Micromachining</b> is a younger technology and usually uses no more than 5 or 6 layers. Surface <b>micromachining</b> uses developed technology (although sometimes not enough for demanding applications)which is very repeatable for volume production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} the dynamic {{behavior of a}} <b>micromachined</b> switch including a thin metal membrane called the “bridge”. A nonlinear model is presented considering mechanical force, electrostatic force, and the squeeze-film damping force, and the dynamic equations of a double model for the <b>micromachined</b> system are derived. The numerical simulation of the double model equations indicates that due to nonlinearity in the electrostatic force and the squeeze-film damping force, the <b>micromachined</b> switch undergoes period-doubling and inverse period-doubling bifurcation motion in both {{the first and second}} models of the system when the electrostatic excitation is changed. The Poincaré sections show that the period-doubling bifurcation is the typical way to chaos in the system of the <b>micromachined</b> switch.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{development and}} optimisation of optically-driven <b>micromachines</b> will be greatly {{enhanced by the}} ability to computationally model the optical forces and torques applied to such devices.

However, while fast methods exist for scattering calculations for spheres and axisymmetric particles, optically-driven <b>micromachines</b> will almost always be more geometrically complex. Fortunately, such <b>micromachines</b> will typically possess a high degree of symmetry, typically discrete rotational symmetry. Many current designs for optically-driven <b>micromachines</b> are also mirror-symmetric about a plane.
