50|$|Today Air-to Ground {{communication}} {{has evolved}} {{to the point}} where pilots no longer need to be in the plane to fly it. These planes are known as unmanned aerial vehicles or <b>more</b> <b>commonly</b> UAVs. The <b>US</b> military uses several types of UAVs, these include the Predator, Reaper and Global Hawk drones. These drones are used for video surveillance and more recently air to ground attacks. These aircraft represent the pinnacle of Air-to-Ground communications. They can be controlled by pilots thousands of miles away and can safely navigate treacherous terrain using ground mapping radars. They are able to transmit high-resolution video to military stations across the globe. Not all UAVs are used for military purposes however. Some are equipped with high tech sensors, which enable them to survey the ground. These sensors are able to be used for geographical surveys to map the earth and look for oil and mineral deposits.|$|R
40|$|In this essay, {{written for}} a {{symposium}} {{on the work}} of Mark Tushnet, I examine Tushnet’s effort to defend popular constitutionalism in his powerful and subtle book entitled ATaking the Constitution Away from the Courts,” I ask whether the book succeeds in reconciling constitutionalism with leftism. If there is anyone who could accomplish this task, it is Tushnet. He is without question our most thoughtful constitutional leftist. And yet, the book, at least taken at face value, fails to achieve its goal. To the extent that the book argues for constitutionalism, it abandons leftism, and to the extent it is leftist, it abandons constitutionalism. Tushnet=s proposal can be both leftist and constitutional only by reconceiving what constitutionalism amounts to in ways I suggest {{at the conclusion of the}} essay. The failure to reconcile leftism with constitutionalism as it is <b>more</b> <b>commonly</b> understood teaches <b>us</b> something important: If Tushnet cannot produce this synthesis, then no one can...|$|R

40|$|Background: Recognition, diagnosis, and {{management}} of axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) continue to advance. Objectives: The objectives {{of this study were}} to compare referrals, diagnosis, {{and management}} of axial SpA in Western Europe (WE), North America (US and Canada), and the rest of world (RoW) in academic and community rheumatology practices and to identify areas for further education. Methods: Rheumatologists responded online to the MAXIMA (Management of Axial SpA International and Multicentric Approaches) survey. Questions pertained to referral, diagnosis, {{and management of}} axial SpA. Results: Rheumatologists (N = 809) from 56 countries completed the survey about patients with chronic back pain (>= 3 months) starting before age 45 years. Responses from academic and community practice rheumatologists were generally similar. Most referrals were from primary care providers. Symptom duration of 3 years or more at referral was reported more frequently by WE and RoW than US respondents. More WE and RoW than US rheumatologists referred to the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society criteria for axial SpA in clinical practice. Rheumatologists reported prescribing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for the management of axial SpA. Sulfasalazine was frequently prescribed across regions; methotrexate was <b>more</b> <b>commonly</b> prescribed by <b>US</b> rheumatologists compared with other regions. Conclusions: Referral patterns, diagnosis, and disease management for axial SpA were similar among WE, North America, and RoW rheumatologists and in academic/community practices, although more WE and RoW rheumatologists referred to Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society criteria in clinical practice. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were commonly prescribed for axial SpA patients, although it was unclear whether these were prescribed for axial or peripheral symptoms...|$|R
