The task of revitalizing the area around the Residence was informed by both religious prophecy and city planning, and construction began in 1954 on a project that continues today. The oyasato-yakata is a massive organizational undertaking that is understood by Tenrikyo adherents as a spiritual practice, creating a <b>model</b> <b>city</b> that reflects their belief in a Joyous Life. As such a practice it has involved the entire Tenrikyo community, from the volunteers who assist in construction to professors who plan the scope of future wings.

500|$|To {{create the}} two suicide falls, the {{miniature}} New York set was hung sideways to allow full movement along {{the heights of}} the buildings. McAlister calculated that such a drop would take seven seconds, but for dramatic purposes it was extended to around thirty. Problems occurred when the Coens and cinematographer Roger Deakins decided that these shots {{would be more effective}} with a wide-angle lens. [...] "The buildings had been designed for an 18 mm lens, but as we tried a 14 mm lens, and then a 10 mm, we liked the shots more and more." [...] However, the wider amount of vision meant that the edges of the frame went beyond the fringes of the <b>model</b> <b>city,</b> leaving empty spaces with no buildings. In the end, extra buildings were created from putting the one-sided buildings together and placing them at the edges. Charles Durning's fall was shot conventionally, but because Tim Robbins had to stop abruptly at the camera, his was shot in reverse as he was pulled away from the camera.|$|E

For more than two years, successive vituperative public meetings did little to resolve differences. Meanwhile, Neighborhood Development Program money was used to selectively clear substandard housing then in the neighborhood. In late 1969 HUD issued an ultimatum: the city had thirty days to decide how it would operate its <b>Model</b> <b>Cities</b> district. A compromise was worked out; the <b>Model</b> <b>Cities</b> Neighborhood Planning Committee would have some control over both money and staff, and the city government, through the HRA, would retain a share of the power.

2500|$|By the 1970s, Ivy City had {{declined}} so strongly that District officials targeted it for <b>Model</b> <b>City</b> reconstruction. The Model Cities Program was {{a federally funded}} effort which allowed local residents to redesign, revitalize, and reconstruct neighborhoods most severely affected by poverty. The D.C. government focused its <b>Model</b> <b>City</b> efforts on the neighborhoods of Ivy City, Trinidad, Shaw, and Stanton Park. The goal was to renovate distressed housing {{and turn it into}} federally subsidized low-income housing. Ivy City was chosen because the neighborhood had seen a severe decline of 20,000 residents since 1960, leaving just 80,000 people living there. This meant there was a good deal of unoccupied housing to renovate. Low-income housing was desperately needed there, as the birth rate in Ivy City was a shockingly high 49.4 per 1,000, with most households led by a single mother. Residents in Ivy City were also extremely poor, with 22,000 of the neighborhood's residents earning less than $3,000 ($ in [...] dollars) a year. In 1971, the crime rate in Ivy City was {{among the highest in the}} District of Columbia.|$|E
2500|$|Detroit {{had one of}} {{the largest}} Model Cities projects. Mayor Jerome Cavanagh (Mayor 1962—69) was the only elected {{official}} to serve on Johnson's task force. Detroit received widespread acclaim for its leadership in the program, which used $490 million to try to turn a nine-square-mile section of the city (with 134,000 inhabitants) into a <b>model</b> <b>city.</b> [...] The city's political and business elite, and city planners, along with the black middle class, wanted the federal funding to assist the economic growth of the entire city. They sought to protect the central business district property values from nearby slums and to construct new revenue-generating structures. But, local community organizers and civil rights activists rallied poor residents in opposition to these plans. They said federal renewal funding should be used to replace deteriorating housing stock, whether with new public housing or low-cost housing built by private developers. The <b>Model</b> <b>City</b> program was terminated in Detroit and nationwide in 1974 after major race riots in in the late 1960s most of its target cities.|$|E

60|$|Do not fancy me {{a dreamer}} dealing with {{impossible}} ideals. I know well what cannot be done; fair and grand {{as it would}} be, if it were done, a <b>model</b> <b>city</b> is impossible in England. We have here no Eastern despotism (and it is well we have not) to destroy an old Babylon, as that mighty genius Nabuchonosor did, and build a few miles off a new Babylon, one-half the area of which was park and garden, fountain and water-course--a diviner work of art, to my mind, than the finest picture or statue which the world ever saw. We have not either (and it is well for us that we have not) a model republic occupying a new uncleared land. We cannot, {{as they do in}} America, plan out a vast city on some delicious and healthy site amid the virgin forest, with streets one hundred feet in breadth, squares and boulevards already planted by God's hand with majestic trees; and then leave the great design to be hewn out of the wilderness, street after street, square after square, by generations yet unborn. That too is a magnificent ideal; but it cannot be ours. And it is well for us, I believe, that it cannot. The great value of land, the enormous amount of vested interests, the necessity of keeping to ancient sites around which labour, as in Manchester, or commerce, as in Bristol, has clustered itself on account of natural advantages, all these things make any attempts to rebuild in cities impossible. But they will cause us at last, I believe, to build better things than cities. They will issue in a complete interpenetration of city and of country, a complete fusion of their different modes of life, and a combination of the advantages of both, such as no country in the world has ever seen. We shall have, I believe and trust, ere another generation has past, model lodging-houses springing up, not {{in the heart of the}} town, but on the hills around it; and those will be--economy, as well as science and good government, will compel them to be--not ill-built rows of undrained cottages, each rented for awhile, and then left to run into squalidity and disrepair, but huge blocks of building, each with its common eating-house, bar, baths, washhouses, reading-room, common conveniences of every kind, where, in free and pure country air, the workman will enjoy comforts which our own grandfathers could not command, and at a lower price than that which he now pays for such accommodation as I should be ashamed to give to my own horses; while from these great blocks of building, branch lines will convey the men to or from their work by railroad, without loss of time, labour, or health.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Model</b> <b>Cities</b> Program was {{an element}} of U.S. President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and War on Poverty.

The ambitious federal urban aid program succeeded in fostering a new generation of mostly black urban leaders. However, the nation moved to the right after the urban riots of the late 1960s.
