40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2009. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The advent of a continuously updated <b>Master</b> <b>Area</b> File (MAF) following the 2000 census represents an information resource {{that can be}} tapped for purposes of developing timely, cost-effective, and precise population estimates for even the smallest of geographical units (e. g., census blocks). We argue that the MAF can be enhanced (EMAF) for these purposes. In support of our argument we describe a set of activities needed to develop EMAF, {{each of which is}} well within the current capabilities of the U. S. Census Bureau and discuss various costs and benefits of each. We also describe how EMAF would provide population estimates containing a wide range of demographic (e. g., age, race, and sex) and socio-economic characteristics (e. g., educational attainment, income, and employment). As such, it could largely negate and eliminate the need for many of the traditional demographic methods of population estimation and possibly reduce the number of sample surveys. We identify important challenges that must be surmounted in order to realize EMAF and make suggestions for doing so. We conclude by noting that th...|$|E

One key feature of every (software) fault tolerance mechanism {{is the ability to}} commit system progress, i. e., to guarantee that some reached state will no longer be subject to any considered fault. The paper focuses on a formal model extending the notion of commit, which is originally established in classical transaction theory for isolated transactions, to the notion commit-correctness, reflecting the possibility of interactions between different computations. The problem of the domino-effect, originally established {{in the context of a}} process oriented, message based paradigm, is inherently solved by this approach. 1 [...] ...|$|R
