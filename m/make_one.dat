5|$|A novel {{adaptation}} of The Fifth Element, written by Terry Bisson, {{was published by}} HarperPrism in 1997. There were rumors after the film's release {{that it would be}} followed by a sequel, tentatively titled Mr. Shadow. In 2011, Besson stated that a sequel was never planned, and that he has no desire to <b>make</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{expressed}} {{the hope that}} the Eighth Army could withdraw to Japan {{by the end of the}} year. When Bradley asked if a division could be sent to Europe, MacArthur replied that he could <b>make</b> <b>one</b> available in January. In fact, Chinese troops had already begun crossing the Yalu into North Korea, and by November 180,000 had done so.|$|E
5|$|Ronald Lockley (1903–2000), {{among many}} studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered {{the science of}} bird migration. He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the Manx shearwater, living on the remote island of Skokholm. These small seabirds <b>make</b> <b>one</b> of the longest migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year. This {{behaviour}} led {{to the question of}} how they navigated.|$|E

5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states {{that when the}} leaves are taken internally, they <b>make</b> <b>one</b> incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his career as a {{director}} Whale directed The Road Back (1937), a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would <b>make</b> <b>one</b> final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Monroe and Fox {{had come}} to an {{agreement}} about a new seven-year contract. It was clear that MMP {{would not be able to}} finance films alone, and the studio was eager to have Monroe working again. The contract required her to make four movies for Fox during the seven years. The studio would pay her $100,000 for each movie, and granted her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers. She would also be free to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.|$|E

5|$|Determined to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> {{last show}} of defiance, Maxwell ordered the marines to wade towards the proas {{at low tide}} and open fire on them. This {{achieved}} no hits, but did persuade the Dayaks to move further offshore, and they departed entirely when the Ternate was spotted. The following day the survivors embarked on board Ternate, Maxwell having lost not one man on either the shipwreck or the island. At Batavia the crew were reunited with Amherst and his party, who had sent Ternate to search for them and subsequently chartered the East Indiaman Caesar {{for the remainder of}} the journey to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Laird {{began his}} {{football}} {{career as a}} trainee at Plymouth Argyle, progressing through the club's centre of excellence. He spent a total of eight years on the club's books, but only managed to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> first–team appearance for the club. In 2006, he was loaned out to Tiverton Town, playing a total of 20 games for the club, scoring four times. He was later loaned to Torquay United in September 2007, making two appearances for the side. Another loan spell followed, this time to Stevenage in late 2007. Laird impressed under manager Peter Taylor and signed on a permanent basis {{at the start of}} February 2008 for an undisclosed fee.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1910, the BX {{fulfilled}} {{a heroic}} role. The Chilco {{had been on}} its way up from Quesnel to Fort George in late November with Fort George's winter food supply when it met with an accident just above the Cottonwood Canyon and the food had to be transported back to Quesnel. When news of this reached Fort George, pioneers Al Johnson and Russell Peden snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> last run with the BX with the necessary supplies. By then ice had begun to form along the river, but Captain Browne consented and brought the BX to Fort George, without {{as much as a}} scratch on her paint.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{continues}} {{his efforts to}} break up the relationship between his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) and her new boyfriend Mark (Paul Schneider). Andy challenges Mark to a game of pool with the hopes of hustling him, but Mark turns out to be an excellent player and wins multiple games. Mark and Andy <b>make</b> <b>one</b> final wager: if Andy wins, he gets Ann, but if Mark wins he has to leave them alone. Mark dominates the game but loses when he scratches on the 8 ball. Initially delighted, Andy becomes confused when Ann leaves with Mark anyway. The next day, he tells Mark and Ann he will no longer be bothering them, and says a final goodbye to Ann.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{continues}} to gather evidence while the hijackers capture {{a shipment of}} cigarettes worth £10,000. As the gang prepare to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> last raid – their target being a £20,000 haul of nickel ingots – Ross himself joins the operation {{with the aim of}} exposing Miles. Having uncovered the truth behind Ross's actions, Diamond pulls a gun on the officer and chases him through the cellars underneath the café. Wounding Ross with one of his bullets, Diamond eventually corners him, only to be shot dead by Johnny – an undercover detective who has successfully infiltrated the gang. Johnny informs Ross that the authorities are already aware of Miles' location and that he {{and the rest of the}} gang will soon be apprehended. Ross returns to his former life as an ordinary beat constable.|$|E
5|$|Steven Soderbergh {{had been}} {{interested}} in making a film about the drug wars for some time but {{did not want to}} <b>make</b> <b>one</b> about addicts. Producer Laura Bickford obtained the rights to the United Kingdom mini-series Traffik (1989) and liked its structure. Soderbergh, who had seen the mini-series in 1990, started looking for a screenwriter to adapt it into a film. They read a script by Stephen Gaghan called Havoc, about upper-class white kids in Palisades High School doing drugs and getting involved with gangs. Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film, but found he was already working for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer.|$|E

5|$|Steven Spielberg, {{one of the}} film's {{executive}} producers, {{visited the}} director and the writers during pre-production {{to look over the}} script and the artwork. He provided Favreau with a collection of classic Western films. Spielberg also invited the director and the writers to a private screening of several Western films and provided live commentary on how to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> properly. The films included Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, and Destry Rides Again. Spielberg made several other suggestions: a main enemy alien, Jake's final use of the gauntlet being to decapitate an alien, and that Jake and Ella's first kiss should occur in the climax of the film.|$|E
5|$|The final {{was held}} in Feyenoord Stadium, Rotterdam, with an {{attendance}} of 39,776. Only nine minutes into the game, Villa lost their experienced goalkeeper Jimmy Rimmer to a shoulder injury. He was replaced by 23-year-old reserve goalkeeper Nigel Spink, who had only played one match for the club in five years since joining from Chelmsford. Spink went on to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> of his best performances for the club against the highly experienced Bayern strikeforce, which included Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Other key players in this Villa side included Tony Morley, Gordon Cowans and Dennis Mortimer.|$|E

The exhausted 34th Infantry Regiment retreated to the Kum River, near the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters.

5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race cabinet {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only <b>make</b> <b>one</b> per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run in a reasonable amount of time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E
5|$|Born in Stockport, Greater Manchester, Crowther {{spent nine}} years at his local club Stockport County {{moving through the}} youth system, before making his first team debut for the club on 2 January 2006 in a 2–2 draw against Cheltenham Town, where aged just 17, he came on as a {{substitute}} and was made captain, making him the youngest captain in the club's history. He went on to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> other senior appearance for Stockport before the club were approached by Liverpool requesting {{an opportunity to take}} both Crowther and Greg Tansey on trial with a view to take them to a tournament in Milan, and agreed deals with Stockport for both players subject to satisfactory performances from the players at the tournament. The players both went to the tournament and Crowther joined Liverpool on 9 July 2007, with Tansey deciding to stay at Stockport. Crowther featured for the successful Liverpool reserve team during the 2007–08 season. On 18 August 2009, it was confirmed that he had left Liverpool by mutual consent.|$|E
