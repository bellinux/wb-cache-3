2500|$|In an {{interview}} Mueller gave different reasons for leaving, [...] "One {{is that the}} decision {{had been made to}} terminate the Apollo program, and that was a good time then to leave before, and let someone else take over for the next phase. From a practical point of view, I needed to go make some money so I could keep my family going. It was costly for us to join the Apollo program. <b>My</b> <b>salary</b> was half what I was making in industry when I went there, {{and it was just a}} strain to keep the family going and work going at the same time. So I went back to industry.".|$|E
60|$|January 27.--Slept {{better and}} less bilious, owing doubtless to the fatigue of the {{preceding}} night, and the more comfortable news. I drew <b>my</b> <b>salaries</b> of various kinds amounting to £300 and upwards and sent, with John Gibson's consent, £200 to pay off things at Abbotsford which must be paid.

2500|$|Javed Akhtar narrates: [...] "Kamal sahab {{gave me a}} job {{and helped}} me. <b>My</b> <b>salary</b> was Rs.50 {{and even in the}} 60s, you could not rent a house with that amount of money. I used to sleep {{in a corner of the}} studio. I started living in the costume room of the studio. I didn't have enough money to even go out to have a meal. In the evenings I would just potter around in the drawers. There were many {{cupboards}} filled with costumes of Pakeezah; sherwanis, dresses, shoes. One day I opened a drawer and found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar in India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings I would come back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in front of the mirror, acting how I would accept it if I were to receive it. The first trophy I held in my hand was that of Meena Kumari! I was an eighteen-year-old boy who had no home, no money, no food, but these trophies encouraged me to achieve my dreams, and for this, I will be always thankful to Meena-ji." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Get up to London, {{and see if}} <b>my</b> quarter's <b>salary</b> {{would take}} me out in the {{steerage}} to some diggings or other. What would your brother say to me if I turned up at the Grange--New Zealand?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Lavinia,' {{returned}} Mr Sampson, in {{a dismal}} vein, I {{did not mean}} to say so.

Why do you take me,' said Mr Sampson, 'to the glittering halls with which I can never compete, and then taunt me with <b>my</b> moderate <b>salary?</b> Is it generous? Is it kind?' ...|$|R
