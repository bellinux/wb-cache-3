50|$|This form of {{magnesium}} supplementation has increased bioavailability compared to oxide and citrate. There were some promising clinical trials {{conducted in the}} 1960s that found a combination {{of magnesium}} and potassium aspartates had {{a positive effect on}} fatigue and they reduced muscle hyper-excitability.In its evaluation in 2005, the AFC Panel concluded that in humans the bioavailability of magnesium from <b>magnesium</b> <b>L-aspartate</b> was similar to that from other organic magnesium salts and the more soluble inorganic magnesium salts. Overall, it was concluded that organic salts of magnesium have the greatest water solubility and demonstrate a greater oral absorption and bioavailability compared to less soluble magnesium preparations such as magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate and magnesium sulphate.|$|E
