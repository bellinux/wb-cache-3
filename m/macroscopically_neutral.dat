50|$|A plasma {{consists}} of a fluid {{of positive and negative}} charged particles, generally created by heating or photo-ionizing (direct / tunneling / multi-photon / barrier-suppression) a dilute gas. Under normal conditions the plasma will be <b>macroscopically</b> <b>neutral</b> (or quasi-neutral), an equal mix of electrons and ions in equilibrium. However, if a strong enough external electric or electromagnetic field is applied, the plasma electrons, which are very light in comparison to the background ions (by a factor of at least 1836), will separate spatially from the massive ions creating a charge imbalance in the perturbed region. A particle injected into such a plasma would be accelerated by the charge separation field, but since the magnitude of this separation is generally {{similar to that of the}} external field, apparently nothing is gained in comparison to a conventional system that simply applies the field directly to the particle. But, the plasma medium acts as the most efficient transformer (currently known) of the transverse field of an electromagnetic wave into longitudinal fields of a plasma wave. In existing accelerator technology various appropriately designed materials are used to convert from transverse propagating extremely intense fields into longitudinal fields that the particles can get a kick from. This process is achieved using two approaches: standing-wave structures (such as resonant cavities) or traveling-wave structures such as disc-loaded waveguides etc. But, the limitation of materials interacting with higher and higher fields is that they eventually get destroyed through ionization and breakdown. Here the plasma accelerator science provides the breakthrough to generate, sustain, and exploit the highest fields ever produced by science in the laboratory.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{multi-band}} envelope-function Hamiltonian for lattice-matched semiconductor heterostructures {{is derived from}} first-principles norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The theory is applicable to isovalent or heterovalent heterostructures with <b>macroscopically</b> <b>neutral</b> interfaces and no spontaneous bulk polarization. The key assumption [...] proved in earlier numerical studies [...] is that the heterostructure can {{be treated as a}} weak perturbation with respect to some periodic reference crystal, with the nonlinear response small in comparison to the linear response. Quadratic response theory is then used in conjunction with k. p perturbation theory to develop a multi-band effective-mass Hamiltonian (for slowly varying envelope functions) in which all interface band-mixing effects are determined by the linear response. To within terms of the same order as the position dependence of the effective mass, the quadratic response contributes only a bulk band offset term and an interface dipole term, both of which are diagonal in the effective-mass Hamiltonian. Long-range multipole Coulomb fields arise in quantum wires or dots, but have no qualitative effect in two-dimensional systems beyond a dipole contribution to the band offsets.

40|$|Abstract. Magnetized plasma {{dynamics}} is {{of central}} importance {{in a great}} variety of astrophysical phenomena, and poses particular challenges to computational studies. We review the development history of the Versatile Advection Code, a software package designed for simulating magnetohydrodynamic processes, and discuss its current extension to grid-adaptive simulations. Adaptive mesh refinement is essential to capture plasma flow details which play a role in long-term dynamical evolutions. A specific example is given for magnetized shear flow layers, where large-scale coalescence effects go hand-in-hand with small-scale magnetic field reconnections. Grid-adaptivity is also a prerequisite for accurately handling relativistic hydro- and magnetohydrodynamic flow problems. Examples of the latter are presented with an outlook to ongoing astrophysically relevant applications. Key words. MHD – AMR – relativistic flows 1. Magnetized Plasma-Astrophysics It is commonly stated {{that the vast majority of}} visible matter in our universe is in the plasma state, where free electrons and ionized atoms/molecules form a <b>macroscopically</b> <b>neutral</b> substance. Since charged particles have associated longe-range electromagnetic forces, they exhibit collective effects which make the plasma state of matter quite distinct from ordinary fluid behavior. Perhaps the best known example of intricate plasma behavior is provided by our own Sun. There, the dynamics Send offprint requests to: R. Keppen...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the spectacular collider signatures of <b>macroscopically</b> displaced, <b>neutral</b> par-ticles that decay to Higgs bosons and missing energy. We show that such long-lived particles arise naturally {{in a very}} minimal extension of the Standard Model with only two new fermions with electroweak interactions. The lifetime of the long-lived neutral particles can range from 10 − 2 mm to 106 mm. In some regions of the parameter space, the exotic signals would have already been selected by the ATLAS and CMS triggers in their 7 and 8 TeV runs, hence hiding in the existing data. We also discuss the possibility of explaining the mild anomalies observed in the diphoton Higgs channel and the WW production at the LHC...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} issue of the self energy of the mobile ions in {{electrolyte}} solutions within a general Gaussian renormalized fluctuation theory using a field-theoretic approach. We introduce the Born radii of the ions {{in the form of a}} charge distribution allowing for different Born radii between the cations and anions. The model thus automatically yields a theory free of divergences and accounts for the solvation of the ions at the level of continuous dielectric media. In an inhomogeneous dielectric medium, the self energy is in general position dependent and differences in the self energy between cations and anions can give rise to local charge separation in a <b>macroscopically</b> <b>neutral</b> system. Treating the Born radius a as a smallness parameter, we show that the self energy can be split into an O(a^(− 1)) nonuniversal contribution and an O(a^ 0) universal contribution that depends only on the ion concentration, valency, and the spatially varying dielectric constant. For a weakly inhomogeneous dielectric medium, the nonuniversal part of the self energy is shown to have the form of the Born energy with the local dielectric constant. This self energy is incorporated into the Poisson-Boltzmann equation as a simple means of including this local fluctuation effect in a mean-field theory. We illustrate the phenomenon of charge separation by considering cations and anions of difference sizes and valencies in a periodic dielectric medium...|$|E
