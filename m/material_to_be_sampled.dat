40|$|Sclerochronology is to shells what {{dendrochronology}} is to trees, i. e., growth structures within some shells (in {{this case}} the bivalve mollusc Arctica islandica L., the Ocean Quahoc) resemble, in form and content, those growth structures in trees, which grow with an annual periodicity. By utilising laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), allied with stable isotope analysis to sample the growth structures within shells, environmental conditions (e. g., ambient temperature, salinity, seasonality and productivity) prevalent {{at the time of}} shell genesis may be ascertained. A limiting factor in the retrieval of any data from biogenic carbonates such as these is the size of the repeated growth structures from which to extract information. In the case of Arctica, these can be as low as tens of mm. Micro-drilling techniques, such as those commonly used in isotope analyses, are constrained {{by the size of the}} drill bit used to collect the sample. LA-ICP-MS, with its ultra-high spatial resolution (10 – 20 mm ablation pits) and precision, delivers highly constrained analysis allowing accurate multi-element sampling of seasonal growth bands within shells. It may be feasible to use the elements strontium, magnesium and barium as records of inter-annual environmental conditions, thus removing the need to carry out stable isotope analyses in some instances, particularly where the size of the <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sampled</b> demands the high resolution of LA-ICP-MS...|$|E

A representative sample can be collected using techniques or equipment that are designed for obtaining liquids or sludges from various depths. The structure and characteristics of storage tanks present problems with collection of samples from more than one location; therefore, the selection of sampling devices is an important consideration.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this paper}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> propose a risk based {{surveillance}} model for environmental pollutants, monitoring the presence and the quantity of toxic contaminants in cattle and sheep products. Methods: The province of Latina was chosen as study area. The official list of polluted sites {{was provided by the}} Province. This was then integrated into a Geographic Informative System together with geographical, hydrographic, and geological data along with information regarding the farms that was obtained from the National Livestock Registry. In order to identify the monitoring priority of polluted sites, a semi-quantitative risk assessment was then set up. A score for each of the attributes considered in the risk evaluation <b>was</b> given <b>to</b> each site, based on two main criteria: the environmental hazard characterization and the quantification of the exposed animal population. The <b>sample</b> of farms <b>to</b> <b>be</b> monitored <b>was</b> defined according <b>to</b> statistical criteria.

40|$|The {{development}} of non-conventional representational strategies within documentary practice {{is central to}} the work of Marley and Cox. Their theoretical hypothesis proposes that one can represent reality faithfully by rejecting conventional modes of representation and adopting an avant-garde aesthetic, {{in order to create a}} reflexive text that has the ability to draw attention to the film making process. This serves the purpose of revealing the constructed nature of so-called realist texts, and in reference to the intentions of the influential Russian filmmaker Dziga Vertov, can encourage audiences to see and view the world in a different way to that which they have been previously accustomed. Previous works by Marley and Cox have paid particular attention to the creative treatment of diegetic sound (drawing heavily on aesthetic concepts derived from musique concrète) in order to create a deeper level of signification within their documentary work. This is an area of creative practice that has largely been ignored within documentary production, with the aural signifier often seen as subordinate to the visual signifier. Marley and Cox have addressed this hierarchical relationship by adopting representational strategies that make an attempt to render the visual signifier subordinate to the aural. They are currently using technologies that are seldom associated with documentary practice; these will be discussed briefly below, and will provide the context for the presentation that they are proposing for Documentary Now. Marley, who is concerned with the visual element of documentary production, is currently using technologies normally associated with the videojockey (VJ) whilst Cox, who is concerned with the aural element, is exploring the use of software normally associated with the electroacoustic / electronica genres (primarily MAX/MSP) to trigger and / or transform audio material. Such technologies allow great freedom in terms of real-time sonic and visual manipulation allowing <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sampled,</b> sequenced, looped and creatively manipulated in a ‘live’ editing situation. By adopting these technologies it is hoped that new discursive practice can emerge from this improvisatory approach allowing the audience new ways of experiencing the documentary format whilst creating the potential for multiple encodings from the use of the same core material. This would implicitly open up the potential decoding of the text by audiences. The presentation will summarise the theory and aesthetics underlying Marley and Cox’s work and also demonstrate their methods by showing examples of their concept of performative documentary alluded to above, whereby the documentary product results from the editing of images of actuality and associated diegetic sonic material as a live creative act. This takes the form of a structured improvisation where the stock of materials to be drawn on and the formal outline of the performance are pre-determined. In many ways Marley and Cox’s work can be seen as building a bridge back to the poetic style of British documentary filmmakers such as Humphrey Jennings and Harry Watt, a style which became rapidly superseded after WWII by the journalistic / empirical modes of representation...|$|E

40|$|For {{various reasons}} particle-size {{analysis}} of sediment {{is used in}} many fields of science and technology, a. o. earth sciences, agricultural and civil engineering. Relatively coarse-grained sediment like sand, with dimensions ranging from 0. 06 till 2 mm, is analyzed almost exclusively by sieving. The size of particles in the silt and clay range (0. 002 - 0. 06 mm resp. smaller than 0. 002 mm) commonly is derived from their settling velocity using Stokes' law; in this connection the important studies by Odén (1915, 1925) and Fisher/Odén (924) are recalled. Since the 1930 's attempts have <b>been</b> made <b>to</b> remove this difference in analyzing technique by application of fall velocity analysis to sand-size sediment as well, using an empirical relation between size and fall velocity. A second and more important motive {{for the development of}} settling velocity analysis of sand is the surmise that the fall velocity of a particle might be a more fundamental property than its size as far as its behaviour in a stream is concerned. Hence, in studies on depositional environment of recent and ancient sediments settling velocity analysis is sometimes given preference to sieving (Reed et al., 1975; Emery, 1978). In this respect it is noted that in an alluvial stream the initiation of motion as well as the concentration distribution of suspended sediment with height are dependent on the ratio between shear velocity and fall velocity. Thirdly, in some cases the amount of <b>material</b> available <b>to</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> very small, e. g. in flume experiments on selective transport and in studies on sedimentary structures (Emery, 1978; Grace et al., 1978). Unlike sieving settling velocity analysis permits [...] and sometimes necessitates the use of small samples. Fourthly, in settling velocity analysis the measurement process is continuous by nature. Therefore, more information is available than in the case of sieving, which is a discontinuous method. In addition, the application of a modern detection system and electronic data processing enables rapid analysis {{of a large number of}} samples in a short time. CONCLUSIONS 1. The specifications of the detection method applied in a settling tube <b>are</b> closely related <b>to</b> the characteristics of the sediment, the sedimentation fluid and the settling tube dimensions. 2. An underwater balance as applied in DUST is sufficiently accurate for fall velocity analysis of both fine and coarse sand. 3. Measurements in the test model of DUST have confirmed that the error due <b>to</b> settling convection <b>is</b> depending on particle size. For particles smaller than 0. 2 mm the maximum value of the ratio between sample volume and settling tube volume, as estimated by the procedure of Kranenburg/Geldof (1974) is too large. 4. The reproducibility of the median fall velocity of samples of sieved sand, analyzed in the test model, is better than 2 %. 5. Given a certain error in the measurement of the time of arrival of the particles at the level of measurement and given the maximum fall velocity in the <b>samples</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> analyzed, it can be shown that an optimum value of the delay time of the weighing system exists. The magnitude of the dynamic effect of the settling particles on the weighing system needs further study. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|This project {{seeks to}} develop an on-line sensor to measure the {{viscosity}} of dense slurries. This report summarizes work {{after two years of}} a three year project. The flow behavior of slurries is important for many of the proposed unit operations <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in the conveying and processing of tank wastes. One alternative for determining the rheological properties of such <b>materials</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> obtain <b>samples</b> and test them off-line using conventional rheometers. Such a protocol is not practical {{for a wide variety of}} wastes. Rather, it is the goal of this work to find on-line, in-process techniques for measurement. There are two systems that the authors have propose examining: (1) Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI), and, (2) Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry. Central to both of these techniques is the measurement of velocity profiles in pipe flows. For the NMRI measurements, the presence of particles has two principal effects on the NMRI velocity profiles: a decrease in signal intensity and image blurring. Similar effects are observed in turbulent flows due to the local random fluctuations in the flow. This similarity has led us to turbulent flow using NMRI. The governing equations for the signal obtained by NMRI are the Bloch-Torrey equations. Previously, the author showed a relationship between turbulent fluctuations and spatial signal intensity variations, assuming isotropic turbulence. However, this assumption does not reflect the true nature of turbulence in a pipe flow where the turbulence is not isotropic. In the new work the Bloch-Torrey equations will be solved by first, time averaging and then employing a turbulence model for pipe flow. The purpose of the time averaging <b>is</b> <b>to</b> smooth the fluctuations of time scale smaller than that of NMRI data acquisition. After this work with single phase fluids, the authors shall undertake NMRI experiments of slurry flow. Various operational parameters will be optimized during the experiments to obtain velocity profile of the flow. Pressure drops will also <b>be</b> recorded <b>to</b> obtain shear stress distribution. Plot of shear stress versus the shear rate, obtained from the velocity profile, will yield the shear viscosity over a wide range of shear rate. The velocity images will also <b>be</b> analyzed <b>to</b> compare the effects of fluctuations with those of turbulent flow experiments For single phase fluids, the NMRI and the UDV work will be compared with measurements using LAV. In their LAV, flow apparatus, the working fluid, water, is gravity fed from a reservoir into a horizontal one inch Pyrex tube, 180 diameters in length. The system enables traverses of the optical probe in the horizontal and vertical directions, with a resolution of 200 micrometers. Radial distributions of the axial component of velocity were obtained at a location 150 diameters from the tube entrance. Measurements in the laminar regime indicate a precision of within one percent, as indicated by the root mean square fluctuations. In the turbulent regime, radial profiles of the mean and fluctuation velocities agree with literature values. In the laminar regime, symmetry of the radial velocity distribution was observed in the horizontal plane passing through the axis, but was not in general observed in the vertical plane passing through the axis. Further investigation revealed that the asymmetry was a result of buoyancy due to heat transfer between the working fluid and the surroundings, even though the pipe was not actively heated or cooled. Temperature differences as little as 1 degree Celsius <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> result in significant asymmetry. To have a reproducible result in the laminar regime, it <b>was</b> necessary <b>to</b> control the reservoir temperature to within 0. 1 degree Celsius. ...|$|R
