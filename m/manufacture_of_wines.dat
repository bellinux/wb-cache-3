Investigations of toxicity of wines from that time have centered around the development of liver cirrhosis caused by etha-nol consumption, pesticide residues from vineyard sprayings, and histamine formation in certain wines.

Histamine development has been associated with bacterial production occurring when unsanitary conditions are present during wine making, and not with the species of grape. White wines, in general, seem to contain less histamine than red wines (11). About 20 years ago, a French physician, J. de Leobardy, attributed liver disorders to drinking wines made from native eastern United States grapes or from hybrid grapes (crosses of French and American varieties). After feeding various wines to hens, rats, guinea pigs, pigs, and goats, with subsequent organ histologic examinations, the only diseased conditions were found in the chickens. Fowl tuberculosis was observed, which de Leobardy and Loubet (8) claimed was coincident to the experiment and not attributable to the wine intake. About this time, Breider, Reuther, and Wolf (4) showed that liver damage was produced in chickens when hybrid wines were fed, and Breider (3) stated falsely that the results from his labora-tory agreed with those of the French investiga-tions. Apparently, because of increased German news-paper publicity at this time regarding "poisonous substances " in hybrid wines, a great deal of pub-lished criticism of Breider's work occurred i...|$|E

50|$|The Basi Revolt, {{also known}} as the Ambaristo Revolt, was a revolt {{undertaken}} from September 16 to 28, 1807. It was led by Pedro Mateo and Salarogo Ambaristo (though some sources refer to a single person named Pedro Ambaristo), with its events occurring in the present-day town of Piddig in Ilocos Norte. This revolt is unique as it revolves around the Ilocanos' love for basi, or sugarcane wine. In 1786, the Spanish colonial government expropriated the <b>manufacture</b> and sale <b>of</b> basi, effectively banning private <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wine,</b> which was done before expropriation. Ilocanos were forced to buy from government stores. However, wine-loving Ilocanos in Piddig rose in revolt on September 16, 1807, with the revolt spreading to nearby towns and with fighting lasting for weeks. Spanish led troops eventually quelled the revolt on September 28, 1807, albeit with much force and loss of life on the losing side. A series of 14 paintings on the Basi Revolt by Esteban Pichay Villanueva currently hangs at the Ilocos Sur National Museum in Vigan City. The event is immortalized and commemorated in the Basi Revolt Monument located along the highway of Piddig.|$|R

The softest berries were associated with Ancellotta (1. 72 N), Dolcetto (1. 79 N), Gamay (2. 26 N) and Schiava gentile (2. 29 N) cultivars. The hardest berries corresponded to Franconia and Bonarda cultivars (4. 02 - 4. 03 N). High resistance to splitting was also detected for Grenache, Raboso, Marzemino, Negramaro, Montepulciano and Croatina cultivars (3. 50 - 3. 95 N).

40|$|The {{mannoprotein}} {{which is}} {{a major component of}} the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an effective bioemulsifier. Mannoprotein emulsifier was extracted in a high yield from whole cells of fresh bakers' yeast by two methods, by autoclaving in neutral citrate buffer and by digestion with Zymolase (Miles Laboratories; Toronto, Ontario, Canada), a beta- 1, 3 -glucanase. Heat-extracted emulsifier was purified by ultrafiltration and contained approximately 44 % carbohydrate (mannose) and 17 % protein. Treatment of the emulsifier with protease eliminated emulsification. Kerosene-in-water emulsions were stabilized over a broad range of conditions, from pH 2 to 11, with up to 5 % sodium chloride or up to 50 % ethanol in the aqueous phase. In the presence of a low concentration of various solutes, emulsions were stable to three cycles of freezing and thawing. An emulsifying agent was extracted from each species or strain of yeast tested, including 13 species of genera other than Saccharomyces. Spent yeast from the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> beer and <b>wine</b> was demonstrated to be a possible source for the large-scale production of this bioemulsifier...|$|R

40|$|On {{the market}} {{there is an}} {{increasing}} interest of consumers in the wines produced by carbonic maceration technique. The peculiarity <b>of</b> these <b>wines</b> is owing to the chemical and physical phenomena related to the anaerobic metabolism that occurs in the uncrushed grapes under carbon dioxide atmosphere. To maximize these phenomena, high resistance of the grapes to splitting is required during the intracellular fermentation step. This work constitutes the first contribution to {{the evaluation of the}} varietal aptitude to resist the rupture under compression load. By texture analysis tests, twenty-three red winegrape varieties were studied, and the differentiating power of the mechanical variables of the whole berry and skin was assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis. The relationship among the instrumental berry hardness and other physical and mechanical properties was also investigated. Although all of the double compression parameters of the whole berry and the puncture ones of the skin contributed to the varietal differentiation, Principal Component Analysis highlighted that those of the whole berry showed higher discriminating power. The berry volume, skin break force and thickness, berry gumminess and springiness were positively correlated with the berry hardness, whereas the berry weight, skin break energy and Young’s modulus, berry cohesiveness, chewiness and resilience were negatively correlated. Furthermore, the skin break force and energy, and the berry cohesiveness and gumminess, were the more strongly and significantly correlated parameters with the berry hardness. The results obtained suggest that the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> carbonic macerated <b>wines</b> should be planned considering the berry hardness, and it represents a new variable that should be considered in selecting which is the most appropriate winegrape variety to elaborate carbonic macerated wines...|$|R
