5|$|Deep Blue Sea is a 1999 American {{science fiction}} horror film {{directed}} by Renny Harlin. It stars Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Rapaport, and rapper LL Cool J. Set {{in an isolated}} underwater facility, the film follows {{a team of scientists}} and their research on <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> to help fight Alzheimer's disease. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on rampage and flood the facility.|$|E
5|$|The sister species {{relationship}} between the longfin and shortfin makos has been confirmed by several phylogenetic studies based on mitochondrial DNA. In turn, the closest relative of the two <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> is the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Fossil teeth belonging to the longfin mako have been recovered from the Muddy Creek marl of the Grange Burn formation, south of Hamilton, Australia, and from Mizumani Group in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Both deposits date to the Middle Miocene epoch (15–11 million years ago (Mya).|$|E

5|$|Sea lions are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating killer whale pods. The sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>sharks.</b> Sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.|$|E
5|$|In an {{underwater}} facility, {{a team of}} scientists is doing research on <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> to help in the re-activation of dormant human brain cells like those found in Alzheimer's disease patients. After one of their sharks escapes the facility and attempts to attack a boat full of teenagers, financial backers send corporate executive Russell Franklin to investigate the facility. In the laboratory, doctors Susan McAlester and Jim Whitlock prove their research is working by testing a certain protein complex that was removed from the brain tissue of their largest shark. However, Jim's right arm is bitten off by the animal shortly afterwards. Brenda Kerns, the tower's operator, calls a helicopter to evacuate Jim, but as he is being lifted, the stormy weather causes Jim to fall into the shark pen. The shark then grabs Jim's stretcher and pulls the helicopter into the tower, killing Brenda and the pilots.|$|E
25|$|Irrespective of {{the cause}} of their {{ultimate}} extinction, during the long time of their existence the pseudotooth birds furnished prey for large predators themselves. Few if any birds that coexisted with them were large enough to harm them while airborne; {{as evidenced by the}} Early Eocene Limnofregata, the frigatebirds coevolved with the Pelagornithidae and may well have harassed any of the small species for food on occasion, as they today harass albatrosses. From the Middle Miocene or Early Pliocene of the Lee Creek Mine, some remains of pseudotooth birds which probably fell victim to sharks while feeding are known. The large members of the abundant Lee Creek Mine shark fauna that hunted near the water's surface included the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), Carcharias sand tiger sharks, Isurus and Cosmopolitodus <b>mako</b> <b>sharks,</b> Carcharodon white sharks, the snaggletooth shark Hemipristis serra, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo), Carcharhinus whaler sharks, the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) and hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna), and perhaps (depending on the bird fossils' age) also Pristis sawfishes, Odontaspis sand tiger sharks, and Lamna and Parotodus benedeni mackerel sharks. It is notable that fossils of smaller diving birds – for example auks, loons and cormorants – {{as well as those of}} albatrosses are much more commonly found in those shark pellets than pseudotooth birds, supporting the assumption that the latter had quite low population densities and caught much of their food in mid-flight.|$|E

The <b>Mako</b> <b>Shark</b> II debuted in 1965 as a show car. Chevrolet actually created two of them - only {{one of which was}} fully functional. The non-running show car (gallery) sported some interesting, futuristic details, such as square section side pipes and a squared-off steering wheel. While the functioning version didn't have these features, it did have a retractable rear spoiler, and a square section bumper that could be extended for added protection. The <b>Mako</b> <b>Shark</b> II was powered by a 427 Mark IV engine, which became available on production Corvette models. The paint scheme continued the Shark I tradition, with blue/gray on top and silver/white along the rocker panels. The original <b>Mako</b> <b>Shark</b> was then retroactively called the [...] "Mako Shark I".|$|R
500|$|Longfin <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> are predators {{that feed}} on small {{schooling}} bony fishes and cephalopods. Whether this shark {{is capable of}} elevating its body temperature above that of the surrounding water like {{the other members of}} its family is uncertain, though it possesses the requisite physiological adaptations. Reproduction in this species is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from eggs inside the uterus. In the later stages of development, the unborn young are fed nonviable eggs by the mother (oophagy). The litter size is typically two, but may be as many as eight. The longfin mako is of limited commercial value, as its meat and fins are of lower quality than those of other pelagic sharks; it is caught unintentionally in low numbers across its range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature [...] has assessed this species as vulnerable due to its rarity, low reproductive rate, and continuing bycatch mortality.|$|E
500|$|In New Zealand, {{sharks and}} rays appear to be {{important}} prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks and shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>sharks.</b> With sharks, orcas may herd them {{to the surface and}} strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in {{sharks and rays}} by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a [...] female killed a [...] great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap. Killer whales have also been recorded hunting tiger sharks. In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an [...] long whale shark, Rhincodon typus, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles in Baja California.|$|E

5000|$|Shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>sharks,</b> as {{with most}} other sharks, are aged by {{sectioning}} vertebrae — {{one of the few}} bony structures in sharks — and counting growth bands. The age of shortfin mako, and therefore important parameters, such as age at sexual maturity and longevity, were severely underestimated until 2006 (e.g. claims of sexual maturity at 4-6 years, claims of longevity as low as 11 years), because of a poorly supported belief that shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> deposited two growth bands per year in their vertebrae. This belief was overturned by a landmark study which proved that shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> only deposit one band in their vertebrae per year, as well as providing validated ages for numerous specimens.

50|$|The shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> is {{cylindrical}} in shape, with a vertically elongated tail. This species exhibits countershading, with brilliant metallic blue coloration dorsally {{and white}} ventrally. The {{line of demarcation}} between blue and white on the body is distinct. The underside of the snout and {{the area around the}} mouth are white. Larger specimens tend to possess darker coloration that extends onto parts of the body that would be white in smaller individuals. The juvenile mako differs in that it has a clear blackish stain on the tip of the snout. The longfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> very much resembles the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark,</b> but has larger pectoral fins, dark rather than pale coloration around the mouth and larger eyes.
