5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Cucurbita are {{susceptible}} to some types of <b>mosaic</b> virus including: Cucumber <b>mosaic</b> virus (CMV), Papaya ringspot virus-cucurbit strain (PRSV), Squash <b>mosaic</b> virus (SqMV), Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), Watermelon <b>mosaic</b> virus (WMV), and Zucchini yellow <b>mosaic</b> virus (ZYMV). PRSV {{is the only one}} of these viruses that does not affect all cucurbits. SqMV and CMV are the most common viruses among cucurbits. Symptoms of these viruses show a high degree of similarity, which often results in laboratory investigation being needed to differentiate which one is affecting plants.|$|E
5|$|The House of Orpheus in the {{southern}} part of the city thus takes its name from the large <b>mosaic</b> depicting Orpheus playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the <b>mosaic</b> is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The <b>mosaic</b> is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central <b>mosaic.</b> Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a <b>mosaic</b> of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.|$|E
50|$|This {{case study}} {{outlines}} {{the events that}} occurred in 1989 between Peg Goldberg, a local art dealer in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg gained “ownership” {{and then tried to}} sell Cypriot <b>mosaics</b> from the 6th century. These <b>mosaics</b> have been looted from the Church of the Virgin of Kankaria in the village of Lythrangomi in Northern Cyprus after surviving the 8th and 9th century. These <b>mosaics</b> had survived the 8th- and 9th-century iconoclasm in the Byzantine world and were considered to be finer than other <b>mosaics,</b> even the <b>mosaics</b> found in Ravenna, Italy and the <b>mosaics</b> in St. Catherine’s monastery in Sinai. The Kankarian <b>mosaics</b> were cut into pieces when they were looted from the original church, and Peg Goldberg was able to purchase four segments of these early <b>mosaics</b> from Aydin Dikmen. These <b>mosaics</b> are important to the cultural, artistic, and religious heritage of Cyprus because they are some of the few remaining Byzantine <b>mosaics</b> from the island; when and how these <b>mosaics</b> were taken from Cyprus is unknown because there is documentation to show that they were still intact in 1976, two years after the initial invasion by the Turkish troops.|$|R
5|$|The {{origins of}} the composition, techniques, layout, and style of Delian <b>mosaics</b> {{can be found in}} 5th-century BC pebble <b>mosaics</b> of Olynthus in the Chalcidice of {{northern}} Greece, with <b>mosaics</b> positioned in the center of cement floors and utilizing garland, meander, and wave patterns around a centralized motif or figured scene. This design scheme {{is similar to that of}} 4th-century BC <b>mosaics</b> of Pella in Macedonia, although the pebble <b>mosaics</b> there employ a wider range of colors to create the effects of volume. The transition from pebble <b>mosaics</b> to more complex tessellated <b>mosaics</b> perhaps originated in Hellenistic-Greek Sicily during the 3rd century BC, developed at sites such as Morgantina and Syracuse. Much like Olynthus, <b>mosaics</b> of Morgantina contain the garland, wave, and meander patterns, although the latter was finally executed with perspective.|$|R

5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} <b>mosaic</b> viruses, which cause a green <b>mosaic</b> pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea <b>mosaic</b> virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Frequently large SAR <b>mosaics</b> are not {{precisely}} geo-referenced because topographic distortions are not removed during the mosaicking process {{due to the}} lack of digital elevation models (DEMs). The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) has recently provided high-resolution DEM data with nearly global coverage, and makes it possible to rectify SAR <b>mosaics.</b> Though techniques are available for rectifying individual scenes of SAR imagery using DEM data, these methods encounter difficulties when rectifying SAR <b>mosaics</b> because sharp geometric discontinuities occur in SAR <b>mosaics</b> at scene boundaries. This paper introduces an automated method of removing topographic distortions from SAR <b>mosaics</b> and producing ortho-rectified <b>mosaics,</b> without accessing original SAR images. The procedures include SAR image simulation from DEMs, two-staged image matching between SAR <b>mosaics</b> and the simulated image, automated tie-point derivation and screening, piecewise image rectification for localized adjustment, and production of ortho-rectified <b>mosaics.</b> The method is used to ortho-rectifying both high-water and low-water GRFM (Global Rain Forest Mapping project) SAR <b>mosaics</b> covering the entire Amazon basin. Validation results show that 1 -pixel (i. e., 92 m) positioning accuracy (root mean square error) was achieved in both cases, compared to 14 to 16 pixel errors (i. e., 1, 288 to 1, 472 m) of the original <b>mosaics.</b> Index Terms — ortho-rectification, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) <b>mosaics,</b> topographic distortions, piecewise image rectification, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), digital elevation models (DEMs) ...|$|R

5|$|The House of Venus, {{towards the}} eastern side of the city under a {{prominent}} cypress tree, was one of the most luxurious residences in the city. It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior, with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes. There were mosaics in seven corridors and eight rooms. The central courtyard has a fanciful <b>mosaic</b> depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome, drawn by teams of peacocks, geese and ducks. The <b>mosaic</b> of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier, but in the next-door room is a still-extant <b>mosaic</b> showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing. Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning to sprout from his head as he is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag, before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs. The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city's fall around 280; a <b>mosaic</b> depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it, perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used the <b>mosaic</b> as the site of a hearth.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Masks {{is named}} after the <b>mosaic</b> motif of theatre masks decorating ivy scrolls {{arranged}} in strips around a central surface area decorated in a cubic pattern. The more intricately decorated mosaics are found in four different rooms branching off from the peristyle courtyard paved with marble chips, with corridor mosaics utilizing amphora fragments. In the center of one <b>mosaic</b> is the figure of Dionysos riding a leopard against a similar black background to the <b>mosaic</b> in the House of Dionysos. Another central <b>mosaic</b> features a flute player and a dancing figure, the latter perhaps representing Silenus. Only the Dionysos figure employs the vermiculatum method. The other mosaics of the house fail to achieve the naturalism of finer figure scenes and motifs, but they nevertheless demonstrate an attempt at mimicking their illusionist qualities with the tesselated technique.|$|E

The quarter of the House of the Masks is the only area of Delos without this archetypal house plan.
