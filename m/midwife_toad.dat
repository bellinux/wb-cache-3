500|$|Many other diverse {{forms of}} parental care {{are seen in}} frogs. The tiny male Colostethus subpunctatus stands guard over his egg cluster, laid under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, he {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back to a temporary pool, where he partially immerses himself {{in the water and}} one or more tadpoles drop off. He then moves on to another pool. The male common <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> (Alytes obstetricans) carries the eggs around with him attached to his hind legs. He keeps them damp in dry weather by immersing himself in a pond, and prevents them from getting too wet in soggy vegetation by raising his hindquarters. After three to six weeks, he travels to a pond and the eggs hatch into tadpoles. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs from predation. The foam is made from proteins and lectins, and seems to have antimicrobial properties. Several pairs of frogs may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft. The eggs are laid in the centre, followed by [...] alternate layers of foam and eggs, finishing with a foam capping.|$|E
500|$|The male Colostethus subpunctatus, a tiny frog, {{protects the}} egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, the male {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back, stuck there by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips {{himself into the}} water and the tadpoles drop off. The male <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> (Alytes obstetricans) winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks. He keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch, he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus spp.) reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings; however, this stage was never observed before the species became extinct. The tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply. The pouched frog (Assa darlingtoni) lays eggs on the ground. When they hatch, the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs. The aquatic Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis. The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family Dendrobatidae. Its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch, the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the [...] of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad. The female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.|$|E

40|$|<b>Midwife</b> <b>toads</b> {{present one}} of the {{simplest}} calls in anurans, with the whole energy concentrated in a single band without frequency modulation. The tuning curves of the Iberian <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> Alytes cisternasii show the typical bimodal pattern in anurans, with two best excitatory frequencies at 0. 412 kHz (corresponding to the amphibian papilla) and at 1. 358 kHz (corresponding to the basilar papilla and matching the male call frequency). In this study, the hypothesis that complex calls arose in anurans because they were inherently more attractive to females, since they provided greater acoustic stimulation, was tested. However, our results indicate that splitting the call energy to stimulate both inner ear organs simultaneously, the male call is not more attractive to female <b>midwife</b> <b>toads,</b> but sometimes renders it unattractive.

50|$|Five {{separate}} {{species of}} <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> are found across western Europe, northern Africa, and Majorca.

40|$|The {{allozyme}} {{data base}} of Arntzen & García-París (1995) on <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> (Alytes, Discoglossidae) is reanalysed considering each locus as a discrete character. The phylogeny thus inferred {{differs from the}} one obtained with genetic distances {{in the position of}} A. dickhilleni from the Betic region – it appears that its sister species is the widespread A. obstetricans, not the Mallorcan endemic A. muletensis. This phylogenetic hypothesis agrees with the taxonomic treatment of the genus based on morphology. A testable biogeographic hypothesis is proposed to account for the diversification of <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> in Iberia and the Balearics. The postulated underlying geological changes were the spread of inland saline lakes that divided Iberia (16 mY B. P.), the emergence and break-up of the Betic orogen (14 mY), and the formation of the Betic Strait (8 mY).

50|$|The Pelobatoidea are a {{superfamily}} of frogs. They typically {{combine a}} toad-like body shape with a frog-like, pointed face (hence the German name 'Krötenfrösche', literally 'toad frogs'). Phylogenetically they stand between primitive frogs (fire-bellied <b>toads,</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toads)</b> {{on the one}} side and higher frogs (the family of true toads, tree frogs, and the family of true frogs) on the other and are therefore - among other things by characteristics of bone construction - in the suborder Mesobatrachia.|$|R
25|$|Since anurans {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to motion, females use conspicuous movements to communicate interest. A female frog may also send vocal signals {{of her own}} to males, motivating copulation and competitive behaviors. Female Iberian <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> (Alytes cisternasii) use courtship calls to distinguish themselves from other male competitors. The African common platanna (Xenopus laevis) uses duet calling when males are not visible, allowing females to distinguish territorial males from satellite males. The Emei music frog (Babina daunchina) female calling stimulates male movement towards sound or phonotaxis.|$|R

40|$|Chytridiomycosis, {{caused by}} the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, {{contributes}} to amphibian declines worldwide. Recently, the fungus has shown to be widely distributed in Belgium and the Netherlands, although no clinical cases of the disease have been diagnosed yet. This case report describes the first case of mortality due to chytridiomycosis in Belgium in a wild population of <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> (Alytes obstetricans).

40|$|Three {{competing}} phylogenetic hypotheses for {{the genus}} Alytes (<b>midwife</b> <b>toads)</b> are evaluated.

Using calibrations derived from protein evolutionary rates, the vicariant events {{giving rise to}} A. obstetricans and the lineage leading to the A. muletensis and A. dickhilleni clade and the subsequent splitting between A. muletensis and A. dickhilleni cannot be placed much earlier than the Miocene-Pliocene boundary.

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen {{unprecedented}} loss of global biodiversity with amphibians {{among the most}} affected species. Emerging infectious diseases have being linked to declines and may result in very rapid extinctions, with chytridiomicoses and ranaviroses cited as diseases with the greatest impact. However, demonstration of a link between population declines and infectious pathogens is not always straightforward and becomes harder if pre-outbreak data are not available. With this thesis I combine observational, experimental and modelling approaches to analyse the spread and impacts of emerging agents on amphibian assemblages. In Iberia, the first case of Bd-infection and consequent mass mortality was documented in 1997 in Sierra de Guadarrama (Spain), leading to the decline of common <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> (Alytes obstetricans). In Portugal, impacts were first recorded in 2009 in Serra da Estrela and here described. Bd led to a collapse of <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> in high altitude areas. However, despite being regarded as a highly susceptible host to Bd, <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> seem to exhibit strong variation in the prevalence of infection across small geographic scales. Although present at lower elevations, an altitudinal envelope prevented chytrid from causing mortality among this amphibian assemblage. Through ongoing monitoring, I detected the asynchronous emergence of a second pathogen: a Ranavirus. The new virus {{had the capacity to}} infect multiple hosts, leading to massive annual die-offs in different taxa, life stages and across the altitudinal range. Data recorded prior to the first outbreak, as well as observations at a comparable site with similar geoclimatic features, illustrated the collapse of the amphibian community in relation to potential drivers. Laboratory experiments and field observations showed that S. salamandra larvae were resistant to the disease chytridiomycosis despite sharing Bd-positive sites with dying Alytes. These results contrast with other higher elevation systems where salamander larvae often overwinter. This prolonged exposure increases the chances of infection and supports the idea that the impact of a pathogen can be mediated by host life history. The mediation of a pathogen impact by the host natural history and/ or particular behaviour was also demonstrated on newts. The lethal effects of Ranavirus annual exposure on the newt population were amplified by host phenology causing a strongly imbalanced adult sex ratio. Modelling showed how behaviour may influence recovery. Following mass mortality, population recovery will be faster if there is an even sex ratio. Bd-mediated declines and extinctions may occur in species with certain life history traits, whereas Ranavirus CMTV-like strains seem to have a broader impact across amphibian species. Good surveillance and monitoring are key steps for effective management and conservation of wild populations. Sustainable conservation of wild amphibian assemblages is dependent on long-term population persistence and co-evolution with these lethal pathogens...|$|R

50|$|The Trust has {{endangered}} the Mallorcan <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> in Spain {{by introducing}} the pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis.

The trust were however, successful in the mitigation of the impact of chytridiomycosis after a large scale re-introduction programme, and thanks to the work of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Mallorcan <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> became the only amphibian to be downgraded from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} reproductive stage or reproductive history of females affects their preferences for male calls that differ in frequency.

The tests were grouped in two categories, spectral and temporal, according to the acoustic variable addressed in the test. Females selecting the alternative chosen less often by the population responded less often in phonotaxis tests and thus could be less motivated. Female repeatability was significant for temporal tests, but not for spectral tests. The observation of behavioural patterns during phonotaxis tests appears to be a useful complement to mate choice studies in anurans...|$|R
