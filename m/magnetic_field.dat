5|$|Earth's <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> {{predominantly}} dipolar at its surface, is distorted {{further out}} by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's corona and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000kilometres per second. They carry with them a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> the interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> (IMF).|$|E
5|$|In 2014, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> around HD 209458 b was {{inferred}} {{from the way}} hydrogen was evaporating from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> on an exoplanet. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> {{is estimated to be}} about one tenth as strong as Jupiter's.|$|E
5|$|The solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> extends {{well beyond}} the Sun itself. The {{electrically}} conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> into space, forming {{what is called the}} interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> with opposite hemispherical polarities {{on either side of the}} solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral. The interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The Sun's dipole <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> of 50–400μT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5nT, about a hundredtimes greater. The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Earth's <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> stops its {{atmosphere}} {{from being}} stripped {{away by the}} solar wind.

The interaction of this <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and material with Earth's <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E

40|$|We improve {{previous}} {{calculations of}} the CMB spectral distortions {{due to the}} decay of primordial <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> We focus our studies on causally generated <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> at the electroweak and QCD phase transitions. We also consider the decay of helical <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> We show that the decay of non-helical <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> generated at either the electroweak or QCD scale produce μ and y-type distortions below 10 ^- 8 which are probably not detectable by a future PIXIE-like experiment. We show that <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> generated at the electroweak scale must have a helicity fraction f_*> 10 ^- 4 {{in order to produce}} detectable μ-type distortions.

5|$|Homing pigeons use <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> {{information}} with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the sun, but switch to using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> was disrupted.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> {{serves to}} deflect {{most of the}} solar wind, whose charged {{particles}} would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. One stripping mechanism is for gas {{to be caught in}} bubbles of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> which are ripped off by solar winds. Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{primordial}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> on X-ray or S-Z galaxy cluster survey is investigated. After recombination, the primordial <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> generate additional density fluctuations. Such density fluctuations enhance {{the number of}} galaxy clusters. Taking into account the density fluctuations generated by primordial <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> we calculate the number of galaxy clusters based on the Press-Schechter formalism. Comparing {{with the results of}} Chandra X-ray galaxy cluster survey, we found that the existence of primordial <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> with amplitude larger than 10 nGuass would be inconsistent. Moreover, we show that S-Z cluster surveys also have a sensitivity to constrain primordial <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> Especially SPT S-Z cluster survey has a potential to constrain the primordial <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> with several nano Gauss.

5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is applied. In reverse, {{it produces a}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E

40|$|Sunspots {{are dark}} {{spots on the}} solar surface {{associated}} with strong <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The number, area, and brightness of sunspots are supposed to reflect {{the intensity of the}} solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> and are often used as proxies for their long-term variations. However, the correlations between the sunspot parameters and solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are not constant, and the causes and the time profiles of the variations in these correlations are not quite clear.

But the Earth is a sort of a probe reacting to interplanetary disturbances which are manifestation of the solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> so records of the geomagnetic activity can be used as diagnostic tools for reconstructing past solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> evolution.

5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> that drives an electric motor.

40|$|The {{origin of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in {{clusters}} of galaxies {{is still an}} unsolved problem, which {{is largely due to}} our poor understanding of initial seed <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> If the seed <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> have primordial origins, it is likely that large-scale pervasive <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> were present before the formation of the large-scale structure. On the other hand, if they were ejected from astrophysical bodies, they were highly localized in space at the time of injection. In this paper, using turbulence dynamo models for high magnetic Prandtl number fluids, we find constraints on the seed <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The hydrodynamic Reynolds number based on the Spitzer viscosity in the intracluster medium (ICM) is believed to be less than $O(10 ^ 2) $, while the magnetic Reynolds number can be much larger than that. In this case, if the seed <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> have primordial origins, they should be stronger than $O(10 ^{- 11 }) $G, which is very close to the upper limit of $O(10 ^{- 9 }) $G set by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. On the other hand, if the seed <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> were ejected from astrophysical bodies, any seed <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> stronger than $O(10 ^{- 9 }) $G can safely magnetize the intracluster medium. Therefore, it is less likely that primordial <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are the direct origin of present-day <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in the ICM.

5|$|Earth's <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> {{also known}} as the {{geomagnetic}} field, is the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E
5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> acted {{as a source of}} an electric field, and a time-varying electric field was a source of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation.
