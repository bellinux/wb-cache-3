5|$|The {{battle in}} the nebula was a {{difficult}} sequence to accomplish {{without the aid of}} computer-generated models. The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water. All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department. Using matte work, the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot. The destruction of the Reliants engine nacelle was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{blending}} is {{the process}} of adding the component gases of the mixture together as a continuous process and then compressing the <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> storage cylinder. The intention is to supply the component gases to the intake of the compressor in a continuous flow at a pressure suited to the compressor design, already mixed to the correct specification. This generally requires equipment to monitor and control the flow of the input gases, which are usually supplied from high-pressure storage cylinders, excepting for air which is normally taken from the ambient surroundings.|$|E
500|$|The Boom {{novels are}} {{essentially}} modernist novels. [...] They treat time as nonlinear, often use {{more than one}} perspective or narrative voice and feature {{a great number of}} neologisms (the coining of new words or phrases), puns and even profanities. [...] As Pope writes, in reference to the style of the Boom: [...] "It relied on a Cubist superposition of different points of view, it made time and lineal progress questionable, and it was technically complex. Linguistically self assured, it used the vernacular without apologies." [...] Other notable characteristics of the Boom include the treatment of both [...] "rural and urban settings", internationalism, an emphasis on both the historical and the political, as well as [...] "questioning of regional as well as, or more than, national identity; awareness of hemisphereic as well as worldwide economic and ideological issues; polemicism; and timeliness." [...] Boom literature breaks down the barriers between the fantastical and the mundane, transforming this <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> new reality. [...] Of the Boom writers, Gabriel García Márquez is most closely {{associated with the use of}} magical realism; indeed, he is credited with bringing it [...] "into vogue" [...] after the publishing of One Hundred Years of Solitude in 1967.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT:—Vegetable oils (triacylglycerols) {{have many}} char-acteristics {{that make them}} {{attractive}} candidates as renewable alternative fuels for compression-ignition (diesel) engines. Un-fortunately, vegetable oils are too viscous to be compatible with modern direct-injection diesel fuel systems and engines. Co-sol-vent blending is a simple and flexible technology that reduces viscosity by mixing the oil with low molecular weight alcohol. A co-solvent (A), consisting of surfactant plus an amphiphilic compound, is added to solubilize otherwise nearly immiscible oil–alcohol <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single-layer (isotropic) solution. This work examines low-temperature phase behavior of two soybean oil (SBO) /methanol mixtures solubilized by A = unsaturated long-chain (C 18) fatty alcohol/medium-chain alkanol (n-butanol and 2 -octanol), one SBO/methanol mixture solubilized by A = triethylammonium linoleate/ 2 -octanol, and one SBO/ 95 wt...|$|R

30|$|In the UBSS case, {{one way to}} {{deal with}} the lack of {{information}} is to use an expectation-maximization-based method[11] to obtain a maximum likelihood estimation of the mixing matrix and sources. However, such an approach requires prior knowledge of the source distributions. In contrast, sparseness-based methods solve the UBSS problem[12 – 20] without prior knowledge on the source distribution, by exploiting the sparseness of the non-stationary sources in the time–frequency domain. Roughly speaking, sparseness-based approaches[21] involve transforming the <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> appropriate representation domain. The transformed sources are then estimated thanks to their sparseness and, finally, the sources are reconstructed by inverse transform. A source is said to be sparse in a given signal representation domain if most of its coefficients, in this domain, are (almost) zero and only a few of them are big.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The fMRI signal {{associated}} with a given voxel is affected by a subject's general arousal levels, the experimental task being executed, drifting sensor outputs, and noise. Thus, the signal at each voxel consists of a mixture of underlying source signals. One method for separating signal <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> set of statistically independent signals is independent component analysis (ICA) (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995). ICA depends critically on the following two observations. First, the central limit theorem ensures that a linear mixture of any source signals tends to be Gaussian. Second, source signals tend to be statistically independent of each other. Together, these observations appear to suggest that, if a signal mixture can be decomposed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> set of statistically independent, non-Gaussian signals then these signals {{are likely to be}} the source signals of that signal mixture. ICA can be used in two complementary ways to...|$|R
