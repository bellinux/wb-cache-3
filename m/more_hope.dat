25|$|During {{his presidential}} campaign, Ma participated {{in one of}} the debates that {{discussed}} many topics, including environmental protection. The Taiwan Academy of Ecology evaluated the policies of both candidates Hsieh and Ma, and the secretary of its workstation in Taipei said that both candidates failed their expectations, but they had <b>more</b> <b>hope</b> for Hsieh than Ma because Ma's environmental concepts lack considerations of reality. In February 2008, several environmental groups created a list of commitments for the two candidates to sign. DPP candidate Frank Hsieh agreed to all the items on the list and signed it in March. Ma did not and emailed the group instead. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) criticized Ma for ignoring important issues and not having the guts to sign the commitments.|$|E
2500|$|He {{has been}} {{critical}} of the process used by ICANN, the International Telecommunication Union and the World Summit on the Information Society. Although he describes their approach as, in some ways, simple and naïve, Zittrain sees <b>more</b> <b>hope</b> in the open Internet Engineering Task Force model and in the ethical code and assumption of good faith that govern Wikipedia. He wrote in 2008, [...] "Wikipedia—with the cooperation of many Wikipedians—has developed a system of self-governance that has many indicia {{of the rule of law}} without heavy reliance on outside authority or boundary." ...|$|E
2500|$|C.R.B. Combellack openly {{challenges}} Ousby's {{interpretation of}} the Informer's identity. He feels that since, [...] "Shakespeare's objections to false accusations against him are the very {{subject matter of the}} poem, an Informer who lays information against another is particularly apropos in the poem". Combellack subscribes to the idea that there are four characters represented in Sonnet 125: the Speaker, the Friend, the Informer, and the Suborner. He believes that the actions of the first quatrain were accusations leveled against Shakespeare as the Speaker. For Combellack, Shakespeare becomes the canopy-bearer as a means of advancement toward fame and fortune. In the second quatrain, Shakespeare shows how those who participate in these grand gestures often pay too much and lose a great deal only to have their gestures be seen as empty. Combellack sees the third quatrain as the offer of genuine love to the Friend, [...] "uncomplicated by any secondary thought of self-interest, in return for love". The couplet then changes tone once more as Combellack views it. He sees it as Shakespeare defending himself against gossip by pointing out how [...] "outrageously untrue gossip" [...] could not possibly be believed by his Friend. There is <b>more</b> <b>hope</b> in Combellack's interpretation of Sonnet 125, because he sees the altruism of the love offered by Shakespeare and how vehemently he denies the rumors against him.|$|E

The “pre-text” for the composition is l’Attente (Waiting), by Roland Barthes, from the book Fragments d’un Discours Amoureux (Fragments from a Lover’s Discourse).
