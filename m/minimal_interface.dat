40|$|A recent {{trend in}} {{interactive}} modeling of 3 D shapes {{from a single}} image is designing <b>minimal</b> <b>interfaces,</b> and accompanying algorithms, for modeling a specific class of objects. Expanding upon the range of shapes that existing <b>minimal</b> <b>interfaces</b> can model, we present an interactive image-guided tool for modeling shapes made up of extruded parts. An extruded part is represented by extruding a closed planar curve, called base, in the direction orthogonal to the base. To model each extruded part, the user only needs to sketch the projected base shape in the image. The main technical contribution is a novel optimization-based approach for recovering the 3 D normal of the base of an extruded object by exploring both geometric regularity of the sketched curve and image contents. We developed a convenient interface for modeling multi-part shapes and a method for optimizing the relative placement of the parts. Our tool is validated using synthetic data and tested on real-world images.

40|$|The {{promotion}} of membrane fusion by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) requires {{an interaction between}} the viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins, although the mechanism by which this interaction regulates fusion is not clear. The NDV HN protein exists as a tetramer composed {{of a pair of}} dimers. Based on X-ray crystallographic studies of the NDV HN globular domain (S. Crennell et al., Nat. Struct. Biol. 7 : 1068 - 1074, 2000), it was proposed that the protein undergoes a significant conformational change from an initial structure having minimal intermonomeric contacts to a structure with a much more extensive dimer interface. This conformational change was predicted to be integral to fusion promotion with the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> form required to maintain F in its prefusion state until HN binds receptors. However, no evidence for such a conformational change exists for any other paramyxovirus attachment protein. To test the NDV model, we have engineered a pair of intermonomeric disulfide bonds across the dimer interface in the globular domain of an otherwise non-disulfide-linked NDV HN protein by the introduction of cysteine substitutions for residues T 216 and D 230. The disulfide-linked dimer is formed both intracellularly {{and in the absence of}} receptor binding and is efficiently expressed at the cell surface. The disulfide bonds preclude formation of the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> form of the protein and yet enhance both receptor-binding activity at 37 °C and fusion promotion. These results confirm that neither the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> form of HN nor the proposed drastic conformational change in the protein is required for fusion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Component {{interfaces}} are {{the essence}} of modular program analysis. In this work, a component interface documents correct se-quences of invocations to the component’s public methods. We present an automated framework that extracts finite safe, permissive, and <b>minimal</b> <b>interfaces,</b> from potentially infinite software components. Our proposed framework uses the L * automata-learning algorithm to learn finite in-terfaces for an infinite-state component. It {{is based on the}} observation that an interface permissive with respect to the component’s must ab-straction and safe with respect to its may abstraction provides a precise characterization of the legal invocations to the methods of the concrete component. The abstractions are refined automatically from counterex-amples obtained during the reachability checks performed by our frame-work. The use of must abstractions enables us to avoid an exponentially expensive determinization step that is required when working with may abstractions only, and the use of L * guarantees minimality of the gener-ated interface. We have implemented the algorithm in the ARMC tool and report on its application to a number of case studies including several Java 2 SDK and J 2 SEE library classes as well as to NASA flight-software components. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of microdomains, also called rafts, in biomembranes {{can be attributed}} to the surface tension of the membrane. In order to model this phenomenon, a model involving a coupling between the local composition and the local curvature was proposed by Seul and Andelman in 1995. In addition to the familiar Cahn-Hilliard/Modica-Mortola energy, there are additional 2 ̆ 7 forces 2 ̆ 7 that prevent large domains of homogeneous concentration. This is taken into account by the bending energy of the membrane, which is coupled to the value of the order parameter, and reflects the notion that surface tension associated with a slightly curved membrane influences the localization of phases as the geometry of the lipids has an effect on the preferred placement on the membrane. The main result of the paper is the study of the Γ-convergence of this family of energy functionals depending on the size of the sample, involving nonlocal as well as negative terms. Since the limiting energy is minimized by a phase function with <b>minimal</b> <b>interfaces,</b> the physical interpretation is that, within a certain parameter range, raft microdomains are not formed...|$|R
