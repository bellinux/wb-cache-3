5|$|In 2000 Lee {{released}} the 22-minute short Subrosa, following a woman's {{search for her}} mother in Seoul. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a <b>medium</b> <b>shot,</b> which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E
25|$|The {{style is}} related to the {{landscape}} backgrounds of Hieronymous Bosch, although in his main works these function as a backdrop to his crowds of figures and are not as concerned to include a variety of landscape elements; but those of smaller works such as his St. Jerome at Prayer anticipate the new style. In most respects the paintings retain the same elements as many 15th-century treatments of the same subjects but show, in modern cinematic terms, a long shot rather than a <b>medium</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{follows a}} six-second <b>medium</b> <b>shot,</b> in the semidarkness, of a vase {{on the floor}} in the same room, in front of a shōji screen through which the shadows of leafy {{branches}} can be seen. There is a cut back to Noriko, now looking sad and pensive, almost in tears. Then there is a ten-second shot of the same vase, identical to the earlier one, as the music on the soundtrack swells, cuing the next scene (which takes place at the Ryōan-ji rock garden in Kyoto, the following day).|$|E
50|$|A {{normal lens}} that sees what {{the human eye}} see, is usually used for <b>medium</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Medium</b> <b>shots</b> are favored in {{sequences}} where dialogues or a {{small group}} of people are acting, as they give the viewer a partial view of the background and also show the subjects' facial expressions in the context of their body language. <b>Medium</b> <b>shots</b> are also used when the subject in the shot is delivering information, such as news presenters. It is also used in interviews. It is the most common shot in movies, and it usually follows the first establishing shots of a new scene or location.|$|R
50|$|<b>Medium</b> <b>shots</b> {{are divided}} into singles (a waist-high shot of one actor), group shots, over-the {{shoulders}} or two-shots (featuring two people). A <b>medium</b> wide <b>shot,</b> or American shot, shows {{a bit more of}} the background but is still close enough for facial expressions to be seen, although these facial expressions would be better seen in a waist-high shot.|$|R
500|$|Whale {{was known}} for his use of camera movement. He is {{credited}} with being the first director to use a 360-degree panning shot in a feature film, included in Frankenstein. Whale used a similar technique during the Ol' Man River sequence in Show Boat, in which the camera tracked around Paul Robeson as he sang the song. (The sequence also uses expressionist montages illustrating some of the lyrics.) Often singled out for praise in Frankenstein is the series of shots used to introduce the Monster: [...] "Nothing can ever quite efface the thrill of watching the successive views Whale's mobile camera allows us of the lumbering figure". These shots, starting with a <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> and culminating in two close-ups of the Monster's face, were repeated by Whale to introduce Griffin in The Invisible Man and the abusive husband in One More River. Modified to a single cut rather than two, Whale uses the same technique in The Road Back to signal the instability of a returning World War I veteran.|$|E
500|$|Patinir {{developed}} what is {{now called}} the world landscape genre, which is typified by biblical or historical figures within an imagined panoramic landscape, usually mountains and lowlands, water and buildings. Paintings of this type are characterised by an elevated viewpoint, with the figures dwarfed by their surroundings. The format was taken up by, among others, Gerard David and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and became popular in Germany, especially with painters from the Danube school. Patinir's works are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called [...] "landscape" [...] format in ordinary contexts, but {{at the time it was}} a considerable novelty, as the vast majority of panel paintings before 1520 were vertical in format. World landscape paintings retain many of the elements developed from the mid-15th century, but are composed, in modern cinematic terms, as a long rather than a <b>medium</b> <b>shot.</b> The human presence remained central rather than serving as mere staffage. Hieronymus Bosch adapted elements of the world landscape style, with the influence especially notable in his single-panel paintings.|$|E
500|$|Charness {{singled out}} the film's famous title number and states, [...] "it's a very kinetic moment, for {{though there is}} no {{technically}} accomplished dance present, the feeling of swinging around in a circle with an open umbrella is a brilliantly apt choice of movement, one that will be readily identifiable by an audience which might know nothing kinesthetically of actual dance... Accompanying this movement is a breathless pullback into a high crane shot that takes {{place at the same time}} Kelly is swinging into his widest arcs with the umbrella. The effect is dizzying. Perhaps the finest single example of the application of camera knowhow to a dance moment in Donen-Kelly canon." [...] He also complimented Donen's direction in the [...] "Moses Supposes" [...] number, including [...] "certain camera techniques which Donen had by now formularized... the dolly shot into <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> to signify the ending of one shot and the beginning of another." [...] Although Donen credits earlier musicals by René Clair, Lubitsch and Astaire as [...] "integrated", he also states that [...] "in the early musicals of Lubitsch and Clair, they made it clear from the beginning that their characters were going to sing operatically. Gene and I didn't go that far. In 'Moses Supposes', he and Donald sort of talk themselves into a song." [...] Donen's Royal Wedding and Give A Girl A Break continued to use special effect shots to create elaborate dance sequences, and Kelly used even more sophisticated animation in his film Invitation to Dance.|$|E

500|$|Like all Hawks' comedies, {{the film}} {{is known for its}} fast pace (despite being filmed {{primarily}} in long <b>medium</b> <b>shots,</b> with little cross-cutting). Hawks told Peter Bogdanovich, [...] "You get more pace if you pace the actors quickly within the frame rather than cross cutting fast".|$|R
30|$|The {{production}} process of sports videos also has certain rules {{that can be}} used to analyze video content. Ekin et al. studied the scenes of sports videos. They first divided the shots into distant <b>shots,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>shots,</b> close-ups shots, and off-site shots based on the main color distribution of the video images. For the semantic understanding of video content, many researchers start from the wonderful event detection of video and expand the semantic analysis of video content [3].|$|R
2500|$|Under Masters, Nova Studios {{developed}} the [...] "West Coast Look" [...] of gay pornography. As {{noted in a}} published history of Nova Studios, the West Coast Look was a very stylized and highly planned filmmaking style. [...] Films were like staged plays, and contained extremely linear story-telling. [...] "Tight transitions" [...] were inserted between each scene to add continuity and establish setting, mood, and theme. [...] Each scene sequenced almost formulaically [...] "from master shot to <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> to close-up, with frequent returns to the master shot. (By re-establishing the overall shot so often, Walters made viewers feel that they were viewing the action from the best seat in the house, not from within the circle of action itself.)" [...] The lighting was strong, and tended to eliminate shadows and expose flaws in the performers' skin. [...] Models' hair was carefully groomed, make-up was used, and cleanliness emphasized.|$|E
2500|$|Proxemics is an {{essential}} component of cinematic mise-en-scène, the placement of characters, props and scenery within a frame, creating visual weight and movement. [...] There are two aspects to the consideration of proxemics in this context, the first being character proxemics, which addresses such questions as: [...] How much space is there between the characters? [...] What is suggested by characters who are close to (or, conversely, far away from) each other? [...] Do distances change as the film progresses? [...] and, Do distances depend on the film's other content? [...] The other consideration is camera proxemics, which answers the single question: How far away is the camera from the characters/action? [...] Analysis of camera proxemics typically relates Hall's system of proxemic patterns to the camera angle used to create a specific shot, with the long shot or extreme long shot becoming the public proxemic, a full shot (sometimes called a figure shot, complete view, or medium long shot) becoming the social proxemic, the <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> becoming the personal proxemic, and the close up or extreme close up becoming the intimate proxemic.|$|E
50|$|The {{dividing}} line between what constitutes a long shot and <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> is not definite, nor is the line between <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> and close-up. In some standard texts and professional references, a full-length view of a human subject is called a medium shot; in this terminology, {{a shot of the}} person from the knees up or the waist up is a close-up shot. In other texts, these partial views are called medium shots. In principal, the <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> is what can be seen with the human eye in a single quick glance and convey all the action taking place in that field of view.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} February 2006, {{under the supervision}} of the 3D cinematographer Peter Anderson; two shows were filmed in Mexico City to capture <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> during a practice run for the crew to learn the choreography of U2's performances. The crew captured additional <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> using two camera setups at the two São Paulo concerts, and captured overhead footage of drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. using a single camera setup at the show in Santiago. During preparations for the Buenos Aires concerts, U2 performed a 10-song set without an audience, so that the crew could capture close-up footage using a wide-angle lens; doing so in-concert would have interfered with the show. Owens dubbed the session the [...] "phantom shoot". During the Buenos Aires shows, all nine camera setups were used, capturing shots of U2 from the B-stages. The Buenos Aires shoot was the largest of the project, requiring a crew of 140people.|$|R
50|$|A {{close-up}} or closeup in filmmaking, television production, still {{photography and}} {{the comic strip}} medium {{is a type of}} shot, which tightly frames a person or an object. Close-ups are one of the standard shots used regularly with <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> and long shots (cinematic techniques). Close-ups display the most detail, but they do not include the broader scene. Moving in to a close-up or away from a close-up is a common type of zooming.|$|R
500|$|... "I'll Remember" [...] had {{multiple}} projection screen fills and classic theatre atmospherics (like smoke haze and the flickering light beams from a projection booth) added. The theatre {{walls and ceiling}} had digital enhancements. A sound booth was completely created from scratch to accompany a crane shot down to Madonna. All the movie inserts were treated {{to appear to be}} within the theater and all Madonna's close ups and <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> were individually treated for facial beauty enhancements.|$|R
50|$|This film is {{interesting}} because it contains the first example, of several, now common, cinematic techniques: camera angle, long shot, <b>medium</b> <b>shot,</b> close-up, and forced perspective.|$|E
50|$|As {{is typical}} for Méliès's work, {{most of the}} action is filmed in long shots. Unusually, a <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> also occurs, to clarify the action—probably, in this case, to show the janitor's astonishment more clearly.|$|E
50|$|Corbucci lets Clay {{reach the}} horizon, then cuts to a <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> of Clay {{taking off his}} glasses, {{throwing}} them in the air, and shooting holes in both lenses. His sight, miraculously, has been completely restored.|$|E
50|$|Like all of {{the other}} films Méliès made in 1911 and 1912, Cinderella was made under the {{supervision}} of Charles Pathé for his studio Pathé Frères. After receiving Méliès's work, Pathé authorized the filmmaker Ferdinand Zecca to edit it. Zecca cut the film down to half the length Méliès intended, and is also probably responsible for adding the cross-cutting effects and <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> seen in the film, as these devices are highly unusual in Méliès's style.|$|R

50|$|All {{sorts of}} camera shots {{are used in}} the film. Some of which include extreme long <b>shots,</b> <b>medium</b> long <b>shots,</b> {{full-body}} <b>shots,</b> close-ups, <b>medium</b> close-up, and so on. An example of a close-up shot used in the film could be the main character’s spontaneous yells while driving. By this, would emphasize pure happiness and freedom that he had not felt in a long time.|$|R
50|$|The film {{includes}} {{examples of}} substitution splicing, {{as well as}} two experimental techniques relatively rare in Méliès's films: a three-scene cross-cutting sequence, and a <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> used to give the audience a final glimpse of the cook and her fiancé.|$|E
50|$|Mariano Rajoy's {{speech on}} the {{occasion}} of Fiesta Nacional de España was criticized by the Left because it seemed too similar to the King's Christmas speech. Rajoy delivered his message seated near the Flag of Spain and in a <b>medium</b> <b>shot,</b> just as royal speeches usually are.|$|E
50|$|Cuts {{serve as}} {{transitions}} between camera angles, {{such a wide}} establishing shot and a <b>medium</b> <b>shot.</b> Footage of a moving character may be captured from multiple angles rather than a tracking shot, either for aesthetic reasons or to lessen the risk of damaging a camera while in motion.|$|E
5000|$|The barrel is {{manufactured}} by Lothar Walther with 12-twist right-hand rifling and 450 mm pitch. Air {{power is supplied}} from an under-barrel cylinder, available in four different capacities: long (300 shots), intermediate (230 <b>shots),</b> <b>medium</b> (180 <b>shots)</b> and short (80 shots). It uses atmospheric air compressed to [...] A pressure gauge {{on the end of}} the cylinder allows for constant monitoring of the pressure.|$|R
50|$|Nutcracker: The Motion Picture, {{like the}} Stowell-Sendak stage {{production}} {{on which it}} is based, is presented as Clara's coming-of-age story. It depicts Clara's inner conflict and confusion, {{as well as the}} beginning of her sexual awakening, as she approaches adolescence; similar themes occur in many of Sendak's books. The film especially emphasizes the darker aspects of Hoffmann's original story and the significance of dreams and the imagination. The cinematography, by making considerable use of closeups and <b>medium</b> <b>shots,</b> attempts to bring viewers closer to the psychology of the main characters.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the other}} two films, Am Abend begins with a {{primitive}} narrative frame sequence, then it shows signs of a more conventional cinema {{for a short period}} of time, and it finally shows hard-core scenes in a fragmented manner. Film studies scholar Linda Williams, in her book Hard Core: Power, Pleasure and the Frenzy of the Visible, suggested that early pornographic films, such as Am Abend, like modern-day pornographic videos, showed close ups of genitals and <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> of sex. Thus, there were structural similarities between early stag films and modern-day pornographic videos.|$|R
