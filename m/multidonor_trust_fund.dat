40|$|Aid (GPOBA) is a <b>multidonor</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> {{administered}} by the World Bank. Its pur-pose is to fund, demonstrate and document output-based aid (OBA) approaches to support the sustainable delivery of basic services to those least able to afford them and to those without access to such services. What is output-based aid? OBA is a strategy for supporting the delivery of basic services— water, sanitation, electricity, telecommuni-cations, transport, education, health care— where policy concerns would justify public funding to complement or replace user fees. How are OBA approaches applied? At the core of OBA approaches is contracting out service provision to a third party, usually a private firm, with payment of public funding tied to the actual delivery of services. How can GPOBA help? GPOBA can assist {{in the design and}} development of pilot OBA projects, and can help identify and dissemi-nate emerging knowledge on issues related to OBA approaches through studies, publications, workshops, and conferences. GPOBA can also contribute to the funding of subsidized payments for the provision of services under OBA schemes. To find out more, visit www. gpoba. or...|$|E

40|$|Expanding {{access to}} {{preschool}} {{education is a}} particularly important policy issue in developing countries, where enrollment rates are generally much lower, and where private institutions constitute a much {{larger share of the}} formal preschool sector, than in developed countries. This paper examines if an expansion in the supply of public preschool crowds-out private enrollment using rich data for municipalities in Brazil from 2000 to 2006, where federal transfers to local governments change discontinuously with given population thresholds. Results from a regression-discontinuity design reveal that larger federal transfers lead to a significant expansion of local public preschool services, but show no evidence of crowding-out of private enrollment, nor of negative impacts on the quality of private providers. This finding is consistent with a theory in which households differ in willingness-to-pay for preschool services, and private suppliers optimally adjust prices in response to an expansion of lower-quality, free-of-charge public supply. In the context of the model, the absence of crowding-out effects of more public preschool providers can be rationalized by the existence of relatively large differences in willingness-to-pay for preschool services across different demand segments. Our theoretical and empirical findings therefore suggest that in developing country settings characterized by relatively high income inequality, an expansion in public preschool supply will likely significantly increase enrollment among the poorest segments of society, and need not have adverse effects on the quantity or quality of local private supply.
