40|$|Honeybees and bee {{products}} are optimal monitors for environment quality. Twelve honey and wax samples from six hives located in six different provinces of Burkina Faso, sited near agricultural crops, were analyzed. Two honey flow periods {{were taken into}} account: the <b>main</b> <b>honey</b> <b>flow,</b> during the dry season, and the second one, occurring {{at the end of}} the rainy season. Physico-chemical parameters (water, total sugars, hydroxy-methyl-furfural content, conductivity, pH and acidity) and residual pesticide analysis were carried out to verify honey quality. Melissopalynological analysis was conducted to establish the botanical origin of honey samples. Five samples were identified as monoflorals, with a predominance of Lannea microcarpa Engl. & K. Krause, Vitellaria paradoxa C. F. Gaertn., Cassia mimosoides L. and Combretum Loefl. genus. Pollen profiles obtained by palynological analysis were compared with plant biodiversity present in the sampling area, which covered seven square kilometers. Ninety beekeepers were interviewed about their perception of the impact of agricultural pesticide use on honeybee colonies. As a first result, pesticides were absent both in honey and in wax samples. On the other hand, data showed that honey quality needed to be increased and beekeeping techniques improved. In general, further researches are recommended, to enhance the knowledge on the characteristics of Burkina Faso’s honeys and verify the specific impact of pesticides on Apis mellifera adansonii Latreille life-cycle and bee-products. The improvement of honey quality could ensure a best-selling price, opening new sale channels for Burkinabé beekeepers and farmers; at the same time, it could guarantee ecosystem pollination service and biodiversity conservation...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Eastern, South-East and Central zones of Tigray region from September, 2014 up to June, 2015 to determine the occurrence and prevalence of honeybee diseases and pests; investigate the effect of honeybee disease and pests inflicted on honey bee colonies and their products; to find out associated potential risk factors for honeybee disease and pests. Questionnaire survey and laboratory diagnostic methods were used for the study. In the questionnaire survey, 384 beekeepers (350 male and 34 female) were interviewed. Similarly, a total of 384 honey bee colonies in 87 apiary sites were examined for the presence of honeybee external parasites and disease pathogens. Regarding honeybee pests and predators, the rank index confirmed that the most important pests and predators affecting honeybee colonies were ants (24. 8 %), wax moth (24. 7 %), birds (15. 5 %), honey badger (13. 7 %), lizards (9 %), spiders (12 %) and death head’s hawks moth (5. 4 %). The total honeybee colonies absconded due to the major honeybee pests was estimated to be 1019 (38. 8 %). About 13 %, 12. 4 %, 9. 8 % and 3. 6 % of the colonies absconded were due to wax moth, ants, honey badger and death head’s hawks moth respectively. Colony level prevalence of Varroa mite was 61. 2 % and 53. 4 % during <b>honey</b> <b>flow</b> and dearth period seasons respectively. There was statistically significant (p< 0. 05) variation in overall prevalence of Varroa infestation between comb age, colony strength, seasons and among agro ecologies (p< 0. 01). Management affected the observed prevalence of bee lice with the overall colony level prevalence of 27. % and 5. 73 % during <b>honey</b> <b>flow</b> and dearth period seasons, respectively. Nosema and Chalk brood diseases were detected only during <b>honey</b> <b>flow</b> season with overall colony level prevalence of 38. 8 % and 16. 9 %, respectively. Amoeba was observed during the study seasons with highest colony level prevalence of 62. 5 % during the <b>honey</b> <b>flow</b> season. The result indicated that unlike honeybee pests and predators, the impact of honeybee external parasites and disease pathogens did not significantly affected honeybee colony strength.

50|$|Populous {{honey bee}} colonies are usually reduced to single hive bodies at the {{beginning}} of the <b>honey</b> <b>flow</b> when one or more comb honey supers are added.

Caucasian honey bees are often preferred for their tendency to keep a constricted brood nest and for their production of white wax cappings, making more attractive honey combs.|$|R
40|$|Summary &mdash; The defense {{behavior}} of an African bee colony was studied {{in order to}} determine rec-ommendations for handling A m adansonii bees (when and how) without being stung. The number of stings left in a leather ball suspended 50 cm in front of the hive entrance for 1 min was therefore counted as well as the number of workers returning to the hive over a 5 -min period. A typical pattern of diurnal defensive behavior was observed. During the non-productive period, ie the summer rainy season, one peak of defensive behavior was observed in the morning. During the period of <b>honey</b> <b>flow,</b> ie the winter dry season, 2 peaks occurred, one {{early in the morning and}} the other late in the evening. A highly positive correlation existed between flight activity and defensive behavior. The bees stung less during periods of low flight activity.

During the period of <b>honey</b> <b>flow</b> (the winter dry sea-son), the bees stung about 4 times more frequently than during the summer rainy season.
