5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be more eager {{to take on a}} wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers would be paid a similar rate no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E
5|$|That wasn't just a {{faith in}} {{herself and her}} talent, but also the ability to let herself go, to pray to God, and to trust in what would happen. These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others know that no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing, no matter how {{difficult}} things were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed {{a little more to}} gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E

500|$|In the {{treatment}} facility, Aaron hears a female voice singing and investigates. He discovers a music video playing on television, the song performed by Julie. The video prompts Aaron {{to return to}} Los Angeles in search of Christian. Upon arriving at Christian's apartment, Aaron is heartbroken when a stranger answers the door. Thinking that Christian has returned to his party boy ways and moved on, and having nowhere else to go, Aaron {{makes his way to}} Lila's restaurant, having befriended the owner while on missionary work after her life partner died. Christian, who happens to be working there, comes out and is overjoyed to see Aaron alive. They reconcile and later celebrate Thanksgiving with Christian's co-workers. Lila tells everyone that, no <b>matter</b> <b>what,</b> <b>they</b> will always have [...] "a place at my table, and a place in my heart".|$|E
500|$|Nick Offerman {{received}} considerable {{praise for}} his performance as Ron Swanson {{during the second}} season. Many reviewers praised Offerman's subtle and understated style of comedy, {{and said he was}} often the funniest part of the scenes he was in. Jonah Weiner of Slate magazine declared Swanson [...] "Parks and Recreations secret weapon" [...] and [...] "vital to the show's improvement". Aziz Ansari, who was particularly acclaimed during the first season for his role as Tom Haverford, received similar praise in the second season as well. Many reviewers were critical of the pairing of Mark and Ann, feeling the couple lacked chemistry and were often the least funny parts of the individual episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons called Mark and Ann the show's [...] "Achilles' heel", and Sandra Gonzalez, also from Entertainment Weekly, wrote, [...] "No <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do with these two, I can’t help but be bored." ...|$|E
500|$|... "1 Thing" [...] was {{produced}} by Harrison and is built around a sample of The Meters' 1970 version of the theme song from Oh! Calcutta!, [...] "Oh, Calcutta!", written by Stanley Walden. Built around The Meters' funky beat-driven percussion, [...] "1 Thing" [...] finds Amerie lamenting an aspect of a relationship that keeps her satisfied. Even if other factors are less than positive, {{there is one thing}} that keeps her hooked ("It's this one thing that's got me trippin'"). Amerie said that the inspiration for the song came from a conversation she had with Harrison [...] "about relationships and how there's always one thing that keeps you attracted to someone. No <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do or how they act, there's that one undeniable thing that keeps you coming back." [...] She told Blender that the [...] "one thing" [...] "could be bringing flowers, or something more ... physical. People think I'm just this good girl, but there are other sides they don't see." ...|$|E

500|$|Hammerstein and Rodgers {{returned}} to the Liliom project in mid-1944. [...] Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked, fearing that no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did, Molnár would disapprove of the results. [...] Green Grow the Lilacs had been a little-known work; Liliom was a theatrical standard. [...] Molnár's text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society. [...] A dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy. [...] Hammerstein {{decided to use the}} words and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers. [...] He also built up the secondary couple, who are incidental to the plot in Liliom; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge. [...] "This Was a Real Nice Clambake" [...] was repurposed from a song, [...] "A Real Nice Hayride", written for Oklahoma! but not used.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Buried Secrets" [...] left me {{wondering if}} there was even more to Megan's father's death than a simple suicide. There must be a story there and I hope we get to hear more of it. [...] It {{would be nice to}} see Megan get her answers, no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> may be". Orlando called Joan [...] "a real piece of work" [...] saying that she could not understand why Joan would not allow Megan to exhume her father's body. She added that Joan was [...] "cold" [...] saying this adding, [...] "I suddenly understood why Megan avoids Mom like the plague". Of the conversation between Samantha and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) she said, [...] "Ethan's story about losing his guinea pig as a child was sad and sweet. In his own strange way he was trying to relate to Samantha and the death of her friend. Plus, it painted a heart-breaking picture of a sad, lonely boy". She added that the death of the episode [...] "caused a ripple effect, touching everyone who came near it", including Kate, who she said that she admired Megan for exhuming the body, as [...] "she's not allowed to flaunt [...] the rules the way Megan is prone to do.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial began}} on May 9, 1951. Colonel Eric Pepler, a World War I veteran and British Columbia's deputy {{attorney}} general, led for the Crown while Diefenbaker led for the defence. To a CNR official on the stand, Diefenbaker said, [...] "I suppose {{the reason you}} put these soldiers in wooden cars with steel cars on either end was so that no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> might subsequently find in Korea, they'd {{always be able to}} say, 'Well we had worse than that in Canada'." [...] Colonel Pepler objected, stating that Diefenbaker had not asked a question. Diefenbaker responded, [...] "My Lord, it was made clear by the elevation of my voice {{at the end of the}} sentence that there was a great big question mark on it." [...] The judge, Justice A.D. McFarlane, began to rule, but Pepler interjected, [...] "I want to make it clear that in this case we are not concerned about the death of a few privates going to Korea." [...] Pepler intended to remind the judge that Atherton was charged in relation to the death of only the troop train fireman, but Diefenbaker pounced: [...] "Oh, you're not concerned about the killing of a few privates? Oh, Colonel!" [...] Diefenbaker recounted that a veteran, sitting on the jury, expressed shock at Pepler's comment, and Diefenbaker lost no opportunity during the rest of the trial to address Pepler as [...] "Colonel".|$|E

2500|$|In his {{unpublished}} autobiography, I Always Had Shoes (portions {{of which}} were later incorporated by Jack's daughter, Joan Benny, into her memoir of her parents, Sunday Nights at Seven), Benny said that he, not NBC, {{made the decision to}} end his TV series in 1965. He said that while the ratings were still very good (he cited a figure of some 18 million viewers per week, although he qualified that figure by saying he never believed the ratings services were doing anything more than guessing, no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> promised), advertisers were complaining that commercial time on his show was costing nearly twice as much as what they paid for most other shows, and he had grown tired of what was called the [...] "rate race". Thus, after some three decades on radio and television in a weekly program, Jack Benny went out on top. In fairness, Benny himself shared Fred Allen's ambivalence about television, though not quite to Allen's extent. [...] "By my second year in television, I saw that the camera was a man-eating monster... It gave a performer close-up exposure that, week after week, threatened his existence as an interesting entertainer." ...|$|E
