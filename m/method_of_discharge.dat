The sac fungi are separated into subgroups based on whether asci arise singly or are borne in one of several types of fruiting structures, or ascocarps, and on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> of the ascospores. Many ascomycetes are plant pathogens, some are animal pathogens, a few are edible mushrooms, and many live on dead organic matter (as saprobes). The largest and most commonly known ascomycetes include the morel and the truffle, however the polymorpha is an inedible variety.|$|E

For example: It is seriously believed by many that nature requires a periodical and somewhat frequent discharge of the seed, and that the retention of it is liable to be injurious. Even if this were true, it would be no argument against Male Continence, but rather an argument in favor of masturbation; for it is obvious that before marriage men have no lawful <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> but masturbation; and after marriage it is as foolish and cruel to expend one's seed on a wife merely for the sake of getting rid of it, as it would be to fire a gun at one's best friend merely for the sake of unloading it.”All the members of the community lived in their communal home, which made keeping track of sexual intercourse much easier. After sexual intercourse individuals were required to return to their own rooms.|$|E

In processes involving ammonia, appropriate <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> are imperative for long-term maintenance of the process equipment and production/compressor lines. Hence, purging is indispensable, and for this purpose, the physical form of ammonia must be controlled. Ammonia is generally used in anhydrous form (99.9  %) in industrial processes. However, because of its pungent odor, ammonia stored at cryogenic temperatures should not be discharged into the environment in anhydrous form.|$|R

Thus, the river near estuary is characterized by a density current. Consequently, the existing H-Q rating curve gives a large error to estimate the discharge. In this research, time-series discharge has been observed by using the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) to improve the discharge estimation. We proposed the new estimation <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> based on the analysis of measured flow velocity and water level variation, instead of the H-Q rating curve method.

The pulse current method is used to detect discharge pulses from three-phase insulator strings, and the analytical <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> strength vector imbalance based on the three-phase imbalance method is put forward. This method depicts the distribution of discharge pulses using discharge strength vectors, and identifies faulty insulators {{with the help of}} the sum of discharge strength vectors and the imbalance of apparent discharge strengths in different regions. At the same time, the C-mean clustering method is used to eliminate abnormal statistical information and the increment method to solve the asymmetry of the discharge strength vectors of normal three-phase insulator strings. The experiment results of 110 kV three-phase insulator strings show that identifying faulty insulators by the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> strength vector imbalance is effective.

40|$|A probability-based {{method is}} {{presented}} {{that can be}} used to simulate 2 -D velocity distribution in rectangular open channels and to estimate the flow discharge. The method is based on Chiu's velocity distribution equation. A technique for estimating a parameter of 2 -D velocity equation has been developed, by which the 2 -D velocity distribution in rectangular open channels can be simulated by using one or several velocity samples, or even without using any velocity data. The present study also developed an efficient <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> estimation in rivers, which is applicable regardless of whether flow is steady or unsteady. It only requires a quick velocity sampling. The relation between the surface velocity and the vertical mean velocity has been studied. It can be used for developing a non-contact <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> measurement. Under the same framework of analysis, a new slope-area method has been developed to determine the flow discharge.

40|$|A <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> {{initiation}} at an undervoltage by a laser-induced {{pulse of}} electrons from a photo-cathode is presented. The intended application {{is to produce}} spatially uniform current sheet initiation in gas-fed pulsed plasma thrusters. The effect is ex-plained by a space charge buildup which can increase the electric field of the gap. A theoretical model was developed and showed that an increase of the charge multiplication coefficient to a level above unity will produce a current rise to breakdown. Attempts to use an ultraviolet light pulse to create a photocur-rent spike were unsuccessful probably due to inade-quate surface preparation of the photocathode. In-fared laser pulses, however, did lead to current pro-duction which lead to breakdown from a 15 % under-voltage in argon. ...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{rates of}} {{pollution}} and over-exploitation {{have reduced the}} availability of water in many regions of the world. In this context, the qualitative and quantitative management of available water resources becomes paramount. Thus, this study evaluated the applicability of two low-cost discharge measurement methods that are adequately precise: the electromagnetic method and the culvert method. The methods were applied in the field (Ribeirão da Onça Basin) {{in order to assess}} their advantages and disadvantages with reference to the conventional <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> measurement. Compared with the traditional method, the electromagnetic method resulted in a deviation of - 5 %, but allowed velocity measurements in the turbulent conditions caused by the channel’s side walls. The culvert method resulted in discharge deviations of 2. 1 %; however, it had limitations in high water situations. The two low-cost methods showed good results in determining the rate of discharge, but it is crucial to understand their operational limitations...|$|E
40|$|Obtaining {{discharge}} measurements {{during high}} flows {{is very difficult}} in steep rivers (slopes greater than about 0. 1 %) because of the highly unstable free surfaces and bed elevations. In this study, a portable flow measuring system with an acoustic velocimeter was developed.

Field data collected by conventional velocimeters were analyzed, and compared with the flow measurements using the portable system with an ADP (acoustic Doppler profiler) or ADCP (acoustic Doppler current profiler).

The laboratory simulation was achieved by applying the concepts of dynamic similarity and secondary scaling ratios to provide relationships between protype and model. The trajectory and dilution characteristics of the simulated buoyant jet were determined by microdensitometer scanning and computer assisted analysis of photographic negatives, complemented with the placement of a light probe in the plume.

40|$|Indirect {{discharge}} is {{the application}} of recycled water to land, either on the soil surface or into the subsurface, a relatively short distance from a surface water {{for the purpose of}} discharge. Water quality benefits associated with indirect discharge have implications to possible future regulations for the discharge of excess recycled water by the Laguna Subregional Water Reuse Facility (Laguna Plant). As part of the Discharge Compliance Project (DCP), the water quality changes associated with indirect discharge were investigated to determine if subsurface transport of discharge would help the City comply with current and future regulations.

The mea-surement of river discharge plays a large part {{in the distribution of}} water resources. The conventional methods of discharge measurement are costly, time-consuming, and dangerous. Therefore the efficient <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> measurement which bases on the relationship between maximum and mean velocities being constant was employed to justify its alternative for the conventional methods: velocity-area and rating curve methods. Distribution test was applied to investigate the statistical properties of the uncertainties involved in the three methods of discharge measurement.

The main {{purpose of this study is}} to quantify the uncertainty involved in several discharge measurement meth-ods and justify the availability and reliability of using the efficient method as an alternative of the conventional methods. Results show that the correlation analysis also validates that the efficient method is a more reliable method than the rating curve method to yield accurate discharge measurements.
