5|$|Ladas {{was sent}} to Doncaster for the St Leger on 12 September {{in an attempt to}} win the Triple Crown. Ridden by Tommy Loates, Ladas started at odds of 10/11 (0.9/1) in a field of eight, with <b>Matchbox</b> (ridden by Watts) the second choice on 2/1 and the filly Throstle ignored on 50/1. As usual, Ladas was held up {{at the back of the}} field as, at first Throstle, then a horse named Legal Tender, then <b>Matchbox</b> made the running. Ladas moved {{steadily}} closer and turned into the straight in second, before overtaking <b>Matchbox</b> and going into a clear lead. In the final furlong, however, he was challenged by Throstle, and in the closing stages the latter pulled ahead to win by three quarters of a length. According to The Sportsman, the cheers of the crowd were replaced by those of the bookmakers as the outsider overhauled the favourite.|$|E
5|$|Ladas {{ended the}} season unbeaten in four races {{and was the}} winter {{favourite}} for the following year’s Derby at 5/2 (2.5/1) with the Dewhurst Stakes winner <b>Matchbox,</b> from the stable of John Porter, being seen as his biggest potential rival.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{alternative}} rock's declining popularity, {{some artists}} retained mainstream relevance. Post-grunge remained commercially viable into {{the start of}} the 21st century, when bands like Creed and <b>Matchbox</b> Twenty became among the most popular rock bands in the United States. At the same time Britpop began to decline, Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with its third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with post-Britpop groups like Travis and Coldplay, were major forces in British rock in subsequent years.|$|E

Introduced {{in the late}} 1970s, Powertrack and Speedtrack {{differed}} from other slot car sets because the cars {{could be seen in}} the dark as the cars had headlights. <b>Matchbox's</b> H0/00 (approx. 1/64) cars were smaller than Scalextric 1/32-scale cars.|$|R
5|$|Its game {{engine was}} carried over from a failed {{attempt at a}} flight {{simulator}} and was inspired by <b>Matchbox</b> toys and Choplifter. Jungle Strike retained its predecessor's core mechanics and expanded on the model with additional vehicles and settings. The game was well received by most critics upon release, with the Mega Drive release receiving critical acclaim from their respective reviewers. Publications praised its gameplay, strategy, design, controls and graphics, although there were some complaints regarding the interface, difficulty and perceived jingoistic politics.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{alternative}} rock's mainstream prominence declined due to {{a number}} of events that caused grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival. Nevertheless, post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, with the commercial success of Creed and <b>Matchbox</b> Twenty; Radiohead's critical acclaim, and the success of some post-Britpop groups like Coldplay. Emo attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and 2000s, other alternative rock bands emerged, including The White Stripes, The Strokes and Arcade Fire.|$|E
5|$|DiCaprio's {{career began}} with his {{appearance}} in several commercials and educational films. After being {{removed from the}} set of children's television series Romper Room for being disruptive {{at the age of}} five, he followed his older stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, landing an ad for <b>Matchbox</b> cars at 14. In 1990, he got his break on television when he was cast in the short-lived series based on the movie Parenthood. After Parenthood, DiCaprio had bit parts on several shows, including The New Lassie and Roseanne, as well as a brief stint on the soap opera Santa Barbara, playing the young Mason Capwell. His involvement in Parenthood and the daily soap earned him a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor each.|$|E

5|$|Jungle Strike is {{the sequel}} to , a similar game which parodied the Gulf War and which was {{released}} in 1992. Desert Strike arose from a failed attempt at a flight simulator and was inspired by <b>Matchbox</b> toys and Choplifter. Central to the game's concept were nonlinear gameplay and the eschewing of power-ups and bosses. With {{the success of the}} original title, producer Scott Berfield, game director John Manley and associate producer Tony Barnes were tasked with creating the sequel. Jungle Strike retained the core mechanics of its predecessor, with the addition of various vehicles and settings. Desert Strike was at the time Electronic Arts' highest selling video game and maintained a high sales chart position as Jungle Strike was released in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Lavigne's earlier {{influences}} {{came from}} country music acts such as Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain; and alternative singer-songwriters such as Alanis Morissette, Lisa Loeb, Natalie Imbruglia and Janis Joplin. By {{the time she}} left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by skate punk, pop punk and punk rock acts such as blink-182, Sum 41, NOFX, Pennywise, Dashboard Confessional, Green Day, the Ramones, the Distillers and Hole. She also enjoyed metal bands such as Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, Incubus and the Used; as well as alternative bands such as Nirvana, No Doubt, the Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Oasis, Third Eye Blind and <b>Matchbox</b> Twenty.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, who applauded its instrumentation. It became a commercial success, charting {{in the top}} ten in the United States and Australia, and also charting in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. In 2001, the song was certified 2x Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and also became the most played radio track of that year in the United States. The official music video for the song premiered on Vh1.com on December 7, 2000. In the video, Wade is seen singing the lyrics of the song in many locations around a town. The band went on tours with <b>Matchbox</b> Twenty and 3 Doors Down as an opening act before going on their first headline tour that featured American rock band The Calling and American singer Michelle Branch.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by <b>Matchbox</b> toys {{he played}} with as a child, Posehn {{decided to make the}} size of the game sprites {{resemble}} toys. Posehn contacted his friend, Tim Calvin, to assist with designing and creating the vehicle sprites. Though Calvin was a practising dentist at the time, he also had experience with 3D modelling. He rendered 3D models on a computer and reduced them to the desired size. Different views were obtained by rotating the models along a single axis. Calvin added colour to the sprites to meet the production staff's specifications; most required black, white, red, and blue, as well as four shades of colours like green and brown. Calvin eventually felt the rendering process was a waste of resources and attempted to create sprites on the pixel level himself without 3D models. The developers, however, preferred the sprites created from the models over Calvin's freestyle ones.|$|E

50|$|In 1964, he {{initiated}} {{the cycle of}} the two artists SEITA and SAFFA by displaying a giant box of matches illustrated with La Fontaine's Fable ‘The Ass in Lion’s Skin’ at the Leone Gallery in Venice. “I had imagined two artists, each having a monopoly on <b>matchboxes.</b> These gimmicks would help illustrate what I think of New Realism, which also could have been named personified Abstractions”. SAFFA created reproductions of <b>matchboxes</b> produced by the Italian tobacco company: The SAFFA. His French partner, SEITA, only reproduced the French <b>matchboxes</b> produced by the SEITA. The following year, Hains arranged an exhibition entitled “Seita and Saffa: copyright by Raymond Hains” at the Iris Clert gallery in Paris. Giant <b>matchboxes</b> were displayed, signed with the two acronyms Seita and Saffa, “fictional and incendiary” artists, with Hains presenting himself as their agent. Clert had also provided for two firemen to be on site to strengthen the rendering. Her request had initially been challenged as there were doubts {{as to whether the}} matches possibly could ignite. She managed at last to prove that a match, when being struck against the box's strike strip did -indeed- light up, and two firemen were duly posted at the gallery that very evening.|$|R
25|$|Models were well-proportioned {{and looked}} similar in style to {{contemporary}} <b>Matchbox</b> or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to <b>Matchbox,</b> the Land Rover (which {{came with a}} horse trailer) had windows, grey or black plastic wheels and a black base (see photo, Force 1988, p.47).The model in the photograph is a very poor example and any self respecting collector wouldn't have it on the shelf. Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet {{as well as one}} underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of <b>Matchbox</b> and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The baseplate, however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not diecast with moulded lettering {{as was the case with}} <b>Matchbox,</b> Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the baseplate. The front and rear axles were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the baseplate and held pinched on each side by extensions of the diecast body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate. The ref. 072 Bedford articulated lorry was a reproduction of the Meccano factory lorry, its articulated flat trailer was dimensioned to receive the Hornby Dublo container.

25|$|Later, Fun Ho! {{introduced}} {{several new}} models. At first glance these {{appear to be}} dies from both English Lesney and Budgie Toys, but not-so-close inspection shows the Midget Models {{to be much more}} crude and, in many cases, smaller, than the original models from those companies. At least 15 models seem similar enough to former <b>Matchbox</b> (brand) models to eliminate the possibility of coincidence. Some of these are: the 1964 Chevrolet Impala (née 'taxi' as a <b>Matchbox),</b> Dodge wreck truck, Jaguar XKE, Jaguar Mk. 10, Ford Zephyr, Morris pickup truck, Scammell dump truck (sans plow), Merryweather Marquis fire engine, and the bulldozer and excavator (Midget Scale no date; Ragan 2000, 77).|$|E
