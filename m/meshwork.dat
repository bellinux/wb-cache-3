5|$|In animal cells, two {{networks}} of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear lamina forms an organized <b>meshwork</b> {{on the internal}} face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.|$|E
5|$|Eggs are {{individually}} {{deposited on}} leaf hairs and corn silks (not in reference given). The eggs are initially pale green in color, {{but over time}} they turn yellowish and then grey. Eggs are 0.5mm in height and average about 0.55mm in diameter. They hatch after 66 to 72 hours of development. Once larvae have breached the chorion, they spend up to 85% of their time emerging from their shell. In this eclosion process, the larvae work to make the exit hole larger than their heads. Larvae {{spend the rest of}} the time making a silk <b>meshwork</b> around the exit hole; this both helps them escape the shell and helps them find the shell afterwards so they can feed on it. After feeding on their shell, larvae rest about 3 minutes before they begin feeding on the plant material around them.|$|E
5|$|Developing neurons travel {{toward the}} {{olfactory}} bulb along the RMS via glial tubes, which mark {{the division between}} the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics. Uniquely, the cells travel tangential to the brain surface, parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons. Neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe {{this is not the}} case. Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a <b>meshwork</b> of astrocytic bodies and processes. They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology. Furthermore, these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression, a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells. The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the cell surface molecule, a polysialylated (PSA) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) called PSA-NCAM, as well as β-tubulin, a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts, proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb. With the removal of NCAM, the neuroblasts scatter, proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation. The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes.|$|E
25|$|In open/wide-angle glaucoma, flow {{is reduced}} through the trabecular <b>meshwork,</b> {{due to the}} {{degeneration}} and obstruction of the trabecular <b>meshwork,</b> whose original function is to absorb the aqueous humor. Loss of aqueous humor absorption leads to increased resistance and thus a chronic, painless buildup of pressure in the eye.|$|E
25|$|From here, the trabecular <b>meshwork</b> drains {{aqueous humor}} via the scleral venous sinus (Schlemm's canal) into scleral plexuses and general blood circulation.|$|E
25|$|Miotic agents (parasympathomimetics), such as pilocarpine, work by {{contraction}} of the ciliary muscle, opening the trabecular <b>meshwork</b> and allowing increased outflow of the aqueous humour. Echothiophate, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, {{is used in}} chronic glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|Rho kinase inhibitors, such as ripasudil, work by {{inhibition}} of the actin cytoskeleton, {{resulting in the}} morphological changes in the trabecular <b>meshwork</b> and increased aqueous outflow. More compounds in this class are being investigated in phase 2 and phase 3 trials.|$|E
25|$|Nd:YAG laser {{peripheral}} iridotomy (LPI) {{may be used}} {{in patients}} susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to make a small, full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular <b>meshwork.</b> In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular <b>meshwork.</b>|$|E
25|$|The neuron {{doctrine}} is the now fundamental idea that neurons {{are the basic}} structural and functional units of the nervous system. The theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century. It held that neurons are discrete cells (not connected in a <b>meshwork),</b> acting as metabolically distinct units.|$|E
25|$|Less-selective alpha agonists, such as epinephrine, {{decrease}} {{aqueous humor}} production through vasoconstriction of ciliary body blood vessels, useful only in open-angle glaucoma. Epinephrine's mydriatic effect, however, renders it unsuitable for closed-angle glaucoma due to further narrowing of the uveoscleral outflow (i.e. further closure of trabecular <b>meshwork,</b> {{which is responsible}} for absorption of aqueous humor).|$|E
25|$|Hutchinson–Gilford {{progeria}} syndrome (HGPS) and restrictive dermopathy (RD) are two PS {{caused by}} a defect in lamin A/C, which is encoded by the LMNA gene. Lamin A is a major nuclear component that determines the shape and integrity of the nucleus, by acting as a scaffold protein that forms a filamentous <b>meshwork</b> underlying the inner nuclear envelope, the membrane that surrounds the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) {{may be used}} {{to treat}} open-angle glaucoma, but this is a {{temporary}} solution, not a cure. A 50-μm argon laser spot is aimed at the trabecular <b>meshwork</b> to stimulate the opening of the mesh to allow more outflow of aqueous fluid. Usually, half of the angle is treated at a time. Traditional laser trabeculoplasty uses a thermal argon laser in an argon laser trabeculoplasty procedure.|$|E
25|$|Once any {{symptoms}} {{have been}} controlled, {{the first line}} (and often definitive) treatment is laser iridotomy. This may be performed using either Nd:YAG or argon lasers, {{or in some cases}} by conventional incisional surgery. The goal of treatment is to reverse and prevent, contact between the iris and trabecular <b>meshwork.</b> In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases. In the other 25%, laser iridoplasty, medication (pilocarpine) or incisional surgery may be required.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{conventional}} surgery performed for glaucoma is the trabeculectomy. Here, a partial thickness flap {{is made in}} the scleral wall of the eye, and a window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular <b>meshwork.</b> The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble {{on the surface of the}} eye.|$|E
25|$|Scarring {{can occur}} around {{or over the}} flap opening, causing it to become less {{effective}} or lose effectiveness altogether. Traditionally, chemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), are applied with soaked sponges on the wound bed to prevent filtering blebs from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Contemporary alternatives to prevent the scarring of the <b>meshwork</b> opening include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants such as the ologen collagen matrix, which has been clinically shown to increase the success rates of surgical treatment.|$|E
25|$|Eguchi et al. (2003) have {{investigated}} the use of magnetic fields in order to align Schwann cells. They used a horizontal type superconducting magnet, which produces an 8 T field at its center. Within 60 hours of exposure, Schwann cells aligned parallel to the field; during the same interval, Schwann cells not exposed oriented in a random fashion. It is hypothesized that differences in magnetic field susceptibility of membrane components and cytoskeletal elements may cause the magnetic orientation. Collagen fibers were also exposed to the magnetic field, and within 2 hours, they aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, while collagen fibers formed a random <b>meshwork</b> pattern without magnetic field exposure. When cultured on the collagen fibers, Schwann cells aligned along the magnetically oriented collagen after two hours of 8-T magnetic field exposure. In contrast, the Schwann cells randomly oriented on the collagen fibers without magnetic field exposure. Thus, culture on collagen fibers allowed Schwann cells to be oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field and oriented much quicker.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{cytoskeleton}} is {{not part}} of the cytosol, the presence of this network of filaments restricts the diffusion of large particles in the cell. For example, in several studies tracer particles larger than about 25nanometres (about the size of a ribosome) [...] were excluded from parts of the cytosol around the edges of the cell and next to the nucleus. These [...] "excluding compartments" [...] may contain a much denser <b>meshwork</b> of actin fibres than the remainder of the cytosol. These microdomains could influence the distribution of large structures such as ribosomes and organelles within the cytosol by excluding them from some areas and concentrating them in others.|$|E

It ranges from [...] long and from [...] wide, occasionally as wide as [...] The blade varies from pinnate-pinnatifid to bipinnate-pinnatifid; that is, it is cut into lobed pinnae, and sometimes the pinnae themselves are cut into lobed pinnules. There are four to ten pairs of widely spaced pinnae per leaf, {{each of which is}} triangular to lance-shaped, with coarse incisions in the edges, which cut them into pinnules or deep lobes, and a rounded to angled base. The pinnules are indented, but not further cut. The longest pinnae are those nearest the base of the leaf, which range from [...] long and from [...] across. The veins in the leaf do not form a <b>meshwork,</b> and are obscure.|$|E
2500|$|Primary angle closure {{glaucoma}} {{is caused}} by contact between the iris and trabecular <b>meshwork,</b> which in turn obstructs outflow of the aqueous humor from the eye. This contact between iris and trabecular <b>meshwork</b> (TM) may gradually damage {{the function of the}} <b>meshwork</b> until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the pressure rises. In over half of all cases, prolonged contact between iris and TM causes the formation of synechiae (effectively [...] "scars").|$|E

2500|$|In angle-closure {{glaucoma}} (also closed-angle glaucoma, primary angle-closure glaucoma, acute glaucoma) {{the iris}} bows forward and causes physical {{contact between the}} iris and trabecular <b>meshwork,</b> which blocks the outflow of aqueous humor from within the eye. This contact may gradually damage the draining function of the <b>meshwork</b> until it fails {{to keep pace with}} aqueous production, and the intraocular pressure rises. [...] The onset of symptoms is sudden and causes pain and other symptoms that are noticeable; it is treated as a medical emergency. [...] Unlike open-angle glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma {{is a result of the}} angle between the iris and cornea closing. [...] This tends to occur in the far-sighted, who have smaller-than-normal anterior chambers, making physical contact between the iris and trabecular <b>meshwork</b> more likely.|$|E
2500|$|A newer type {{of laser}} trabeculoplasty uses a [...] "cold" [...] (nonthermal) laser to stimulate {{drainage}} in the trabecular <b>meshwork.</b> This newer procedure, selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT), uses a 532-nm, frequency-doubled, Q-switched , which selectively targets melanin pigment in the trabecular <b>meshwork</b> cells. Studies show SLT is {{as effective as}} ALT at lowering eye pressure. In addition, SLT may be repeated three to four times, whereas ALT can usually be repeated only once.|$|E
2500|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{glaucoma}} include increased {{pressure in the}} eye, {{a family history of}} the condition, migraines, high blood pressure, and obesity. For eye pressures a value of greater than [...] is often used with higher pressures leading to a greater risk. However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage. Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma. The mechanism of open-angle glaucoma is believed to be slow exit of aqueous humor through the trabecular <b>meshwork</b> while in closed-angle glaucoma the iris blocks the trabecular <b>meshwork.</b> Diagnosis is by a dilated eye examination. Often the optic nerve shows an abnormal amount of cupping.|$|E
2500|$|The {{increased}} pressure {{is caused by}} trabecular <b>meshwork</b> blockage. Because the microscopic passageways are blocked, the pressure builds up {{in the eye and}} causes imperceptible very gradual vision loss. [...] Peripheral vision is affected first, but eventually the entire vision will be lost if not treated.|$|E
2500|$|In between filopodia—much {{like the}} webbing of the hands—are the [...] "lamellipodia". These are flat regions of dense actin <b>meshwork</b> instead of bundled F-actin as in filopodia. [...] They often appear {{adjacent}} to {{the leading edge of}} the growth cone and are positioned between two filopodia, giving them a [...] "veil-like" [...] appearance. In growth cones, new filopodia usually emerge from these inter-filopodial veils.|$|E
2500|$|Pigmentary {{glaucoma}} (also, pigmentary dispersion syndrome) {{is caused}} by pigment cells sloughing off {{from the back of}} the iris and floating around in the aqueous humor. Over time, these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that it can begin to clog the trabecular <b>meshwork.</b> [...] It is a rare condition that occurs mostly among Caucasians, mostly males in their mid-20s to 40s, and most are nearsighted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{underlying}} cause of open-angle glaucoma remains unclear. Several theories exist on its exact etiology. However, the {{major risk factor}} for most glaucomas and the focus of treatment is increased intraocular pressure. Intraocular pressure {{is a function of}} production of liquid aqueous humor by the ciliary processes of the eye, and its drainage through the trabecular <b>meshwork.</b> Aqueous humor flows from the ciliary processes into the posterior chamber, bounded posteriorly by the lens and the zonules of Zinn, and anteriorly by the iris. It then flows through the pupil of the iris into the anterior chamber, bounded [...] posteriorly by the iris and anteriorly by the cornea.|$|E
2500|$|Nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) {{surgery is}} a similar, but modified, procedure, in which instead of {{puncturing}} the scleral bed and trabecular <b>meshwork</b> under a scleral flap, a second deep scleral flap is created, excised, with further procedures of deroofing the Schlemm's canal, upon which, percolation of liquid {{from the inner}} eye is achieved and thus alleviating intraocular pressure, without penetrating the eye. NPDS is demonstrated to have significantly fewer side effects than trabeculectomy. [...] However, NPDS is performed manually and requires higher level of skills that may be assisted with instruments. [...] In order to prevent wound adhesion after deep scleral excision and to maintain good filtering results, NPDS as with other non-penetrating procedures is sometimes performed {{with a variety of}} biocompatible spacer or devices, such as the Aquaflow collagen wick, ologen Collagen Matrix, or Xenoplast glaucoma implant.|$|E

Short, stubbly brown hair bristled up from his scalp, with a pair of thick, wrinkled ears protruding on either side. His light grey eyes were still open, the pupils dilated and the balls projecting in a fixed and horrid stare.

60|$|Section 8. It {{might be}} {{inferred}} from this that pure and impure blood mix in the ventricle, and that a blood of uniform quality flows to lungs, head, and extremities; {{but this is not}} so. The spongy nature of the ventricle sufficiently retards this mixing. It will be noted that the opening of pulmonary arteries lies nearest to the heart, next come the aortic and carotid arches, which have a common opening at A. Furthermore, at c.g.l. [the carotid artery, repeatedly divides to form a close <b>meshwork</b> of arterioles, the carotid gland, forming a sponge-like plug in this vessel.] is a spongy mass of matter, the carotid gland inserted upon the carotid. Hence the pulmonary arteries yawn nearest for the blood, and, being short, wide vessels, present the least resistance to the first rush of blood-- mainly venous blood for the right auricle. As they fill up, the back resistance in them becomes equal, and then greater, than the resistance at A, and the rush of blood, now of a mixed quality passes through that aperture. It selects the dorsal aorta, because the carotid arch, plugged by the carotid gland, offers the greater resistance. Presently, however, the back resistance of the filled dorsal aorta rises above this, and the last flow of blood, from the ventricular systole-- almost purely oxygenated blood for the left auricle-- goes on towards the head.|$|E
6000|$|This is {{a glorious}} beginning; completed, I think, as far almost as Kunersdorf by one o'clock: and could the iron {{continue}} to be struck while it is at white-heat as now, the result were as good as certain. That was Friedrich's calculation: but circumstances which he had not counted on, some which he could not count on, sadly retarded the matter. His Left Wing (Rear Line, which should now have been Left Wing) from southward, his Right Wing from northward, and Finck farther west, were now on the instant to have simultaneously closed upon the beaten Russians, and crushed them altogether. The Right Wing, conquerors of the Muhlberg, are here: but neither Finck nor the Left can be simultaneous with them. Finck and his artillery are much retarded with the Flosses and poor single Bridges; and of the Left Wing there are only some Vanguard Regiments capable of helping ("who drove out the Russians from Kunersdorf Churchyard," [...] as their first feat),--no Main Body yet for a long while. Such impediments, such intricacies of bog and bush! The entire Wing does at last get to the southeast of Kunersdorf, free of the wood; but finds (contrary to Linden with his hunter eye) an intricate <b>meshwork</b> of meres and straggling lakes, {{two of them in}} the burnt Village itself; no passing of these except on narrow isthmuses, which necessitate change of rank and re-change; and our Left Wing cannot, with all its industry, [...] "march up," [...] that is, arrive at the enemy in fighting line, without the painfulest delays.|$|E
6000|$|At this stage, it appears, Finck {{and many}} Generals, Seidlitz among the others, were of opinion that, in present circumstances, with troops so tired, and the enemy nearly certain to draw off, if permitted, here had been {{enough for one}} day, and that {{there ought to be}} pause till to-morrow. Friedrich knew well the need of rest; but Friedrich, {{impatient}} of things half-done, especially of Russians half-beaten, would not listen to this proposal; which was reckoned upon him as a grave and tragic fault, all the rest of his life; though favorable judges, who were on the ground, Tempelhof for one, [Tempelhof, iii. 194.] are willing to prove that pausing here--at the point we had really got to, a little beyond the Kuhgrund, namely; and not a couple of miles westward, {{at the foot of the}} Jew Hill, where vague rumor puts us--was not feasible or reasonable. Friedrich considers with himself, [...] "Our left wing has hardly yet been in fire!" [...] calls out the entire left wing, foot and horse: these are to emerge from their <b>meshwork</b> of Lakes about Kunersdorf, and bear a hand along with us on the Russian front here,--especially to sweep away that raging Battery they have on the Big Spitzberg, and make us clear of it. The Big Spitzberg lies to south and ahead of the Russian right as now ranked; fatally covers their right flank, and half ruins the attack in front. Big Spitzberg is blown irrecognizable in our time; but it was then an all-important thing.|$|E
60|$|He now recollected {{the place}} and its {{sinister}} character. Many bathers had there prayed for a dry death from time to time, and, like Gonzalo also, had been unanswered; and Troy began to deem it possible {{that he might be}} added to their number. Not a boat of any kind was at present within sight, but far in the distance Budmouth lay upon the sea, as it were quietly regarding his efforts, and beside the town the harbour showed its position by a dim <b>meshwork</b> of ropes and spars. After well-nigh exhausting himself in attempts {{to get back to the}} mouth of the cove, in his weakness swimming several inches deeper than was his wont, keeping up his breathing entirely by his nostrils, turning upon his back a dozen times over, swimming en papillon, and so on, Troy resolved as a last resource to tread water at a slight incline, and so endeavour to reach the shore at any point, merely giving himself a gentle impetus inwards whilst carried on in the general direction of the tide. This, necessarily a slow process, he found to be not altogether so difficult, and though there was no choice of a landing-place--the objects on shore passing by him in a sad and slow procession--he perceptibly approached the extremity of a spit of land yet further to the right, now well defined against the sunny portion of the horizon. While the swimmer's eye's were fixed upon the spit as his only means of salvation on this side of the Unknown, a moving object broke the outline of the extremity, and immediately a ship's boat appeared manned with several sailor lads, her bows towards the sea.|$|E
60|$|The altered clay-slate formation, already described, is seen {{in several}} parts of the valley as far down as Las Vacas, {{underlying}} the porphyritic conglomerate. At the Casa de Pujios [L], there is a hummock of (andesitic?) granite; and the stratification of the surrounding mountains here changes from W. by S. to S.W. Again, near the R. Vacas there is a larger formation of (andesitic?) granite [M], which sends a <b>meshwork</b> of veins into the superincumbent clay-slate, and which locally throws off the strata, on one side to N.W. {{and on the other}} to S.E. but not at a high angle: at the junction, the clay-slate is altered into fine-grained greenstone. This granitic axis is intersected by a green dike, which I mention, because I do not remember having elsewhere seen dikes in this lowest and latest intrusive rock. From the R. Vacas to the plain of Uspallata, the valley runs N.E., so that I have had to contract my section; it runs exclusively through porphyritic rocks. As far as the Pass of Jaula, the claystone conglomerate formation, in most parts highly porphyritic, and crossed by numerous dikes of greenstone porphyry, attains a great thickness: there is also much intrusive porphyry. From the Jaula to the plain, the stratification has been in most places obliterated, except near the tops of some of the mountains; and the metamorphic action has been extremely great. In this space, the number and bulk of the intrusive masses of differently coloured porphyries, injected one into another and intersected by dikes, is truly extraordinary. I saw one mountain of whitish porphyry, from which two huge dikes, thinning out, branched DOWNWARDS into an adjoining blackish porphyry. Another hill of white porphyry, which had burst through dark- coloured strata, was itself injected by a purple, brecciated, and recemented porphyry, both being crossed by a green dike, and both having been upheaved and injected by a granitic dome. One brick-red porphyry, which above the Jaula forms an isolated mass {{in the midst of the}} porphyritic conglomerate formation, and lower down the valley a magnificent group of peaked mountains, differs remarkably from all the other porphyries. It consists of a red feldspathic base, including some rather large crystals of red feldspar, numerous large angular grains of quartz, and little bits of a soft green mineral answering in most of its characters to soapstone. The crystals of red feldspar resemble in external appearance those of orthite, though, from being partially decomposed, I was unable to measure them; and they certainly are quite unlike the variety, so abundantly met with in almost all the other rocks of this line of section, and which, wherever I tried it, cleaved like albite. This brick-red porphyry appears to have burst through all the other porphyries, and numerous red dikes traversing the neighbouring mountains have proceeded from it: in some few places, however, it was intersected by white dikes. From this posteriority of intrusive origin,--from the close general resemblance between this red porphyry and the red granite of the Portillo line, the only difference being that the feldspar here is less perfectly granular, and that soapstone replaces the mica, which is there imperfect and passes into chlorite,--and from the Portillo line a little southward of this point appearing to blend (according to Dr. Gillies) into the western ranges,--I am strongly urged to believe (as formerly remarked) that the grand mountain-masses composed of this brick-red porphyry belong to the same axis of injection with the granite of the Portillo line; if so, the injection of this porphyry probably took place, as long subsequently to the several axes of elevation in the gypseous formation near the Cumbre, as the injection of the Portillo granite has been shown to have been subsequent to the elevation of the gypseous strata composing the Peuquenes range; and this interval, we have seen, must have been a very long one.|$|E
