50|$|The major club {{success was}} {{archived}} {{in this period}} when under the Presidents Mr. Nikola Ristivojević and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Milan</b> Josić and together {{with the help of}} private investors such as Mr. Dobrivoje Stojnić, an owner of the enterprise STOBEX, that facilitated the use of all construction equipment, made possible the creation of a modern stadium. Many other influential people from Loznica helped providing all necessary help. The club had received green light from the commission of the FR Yugoslav Football Association and FIFA officials for hosting international matches. The most astonishing fact was that the construction was made during summer and concluded in little less than two months. Many matches of the FR Yugoslav and Serbian under-21 teams were played there.|$|R

40|$|This Proceedings {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} papers presented at the International Conference "Generalized functions, convergence structures and their applications" held from June 23 - 27, 1987 in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia (GFCA- 87) : 71 participants from 21 countr~es from allover the world took part in the Conference. Proceedings reflects the work of the Conference. Plenary lectures of J. Burzyk, J. F. Colombeau, W. Gahler, H. Keiter, H. Komatsu, B. Stankovic, H. G. Tillman, V. S. Vladimirov provide an up-to-date account of the cur­ rent state of the subject. All these lectures, except H. G. Tillman's, are published in this volume. The published communications give the contemporary problems and achievements in the theory of generalized functions, in the theory of convergence structures and in their applications, specially in the theory of partial differential equations and in the mathematical physics. New approaches to the theory of generalized functions are presented, moti­ vated by concrete problems of applications. The presence of articles of experts in mathematical physics contributed to this aim. At the end of the volume one can find presented open problems which also point to further course of development in the theory of generalized functions and convergence structures. We are very grateful to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Milan</b> Manojlovic who typed these Proce­ edings with extreme skill and diligence and with inexhaustible patience...|$|R
