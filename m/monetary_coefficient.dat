For example, {{in an analysis of}} metal industry, Ohno et al. (2016) applied the WIO–MFA to assess the material network of metals and alloying elements. For creating the network, they developed three steps: to disaggregate sectors and convert monetary to physical units; to calculate the technical coefficients; and to multiply the input coefficient matrix with two filtering matrices, which are physical flow filter as a binary matrix for excluding non-physical flows and the loss filter matrix that removes inputs that are related to process waste.|$|R

40|$|We use the {{input-output}} tables {{in constant prices}} extended with carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions for examining the development of China, a country undergoing rapid growth. We undertake this empirical analysis {{in terms of a}} new and therefore rarely applied methodology: instead of average coefficients characterizing the average (old) technology operating throughout a particular reporting year, we calculate marginal coefficientsin monetary and CO 2 termsthat capture the additional (new) technology installed after that year. Marginal coefficients are increasingly recommended in the literature for applications such as consequential life cycle assessment, where they are supposed to lead to more realistic results, especially in prospective analyses. Our work provides a first, broad overview about the magnitude and distribution of these coefficients across recent years in China's rapidly growing economy for which marginal coefficients could be expected to differ greatly from average coefficients. We find that (1) marginal coefficients can differ substantially from average coefficients, thus lending support to the need expressed in the literature for coining consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) and similar prospective assessment in marginal rather than average terms; (2) marginal CO 2 emissions coefficients differ more from their average counterparts than marginal <b>monetary</b> <b>coefficients,</b> showing that for China, within-sector technological solutions to emissions abatement have played a more important role than the reorganization of supply structures; and (3) there exists considerable scatter and variation of marginal coefficients across years, which to a certain extent precludes the identification of clear temporal and sectoral trends...|$|R

The {{results show that}} (i) an unexpected monetary policy tightening-an increase in the Bank of Mauritius policy interest rate-leads {{to a decline in}} prices and output but the effect on output is weaker; (ii) an unexpected decrease in the money supply or an unexpected increase in the nominal effective exchange rate result in a decrease in prices; and (iii) variations of the policy variables account for small a percentage of the fluctuations in output and prices. Taken together, these results suggest a rather weak monetary policy transmission mechanism. Finally, we find some differences in the transmission mechanism depending on whether core or headline consumer price index is used in the estimations.

This paper addresses the extent to which the ECB rate setting responded to inflation and monetary growth in the run up to, and during, the financial crisis of the late 2000 s. The analysis covers the period between 1999 : 01 and 2013 : 12, split into pre-crisis and financial crisis periods using a structural break test. In addition, a number of specifications are examined, including those in which only positive or negative policy rate changes are used as the dependent variable. An ordered probit model is used as it is deemed more appropriate for modelling discrete economic behaviour, such as policy rate changes, than continuous time series methods. The results from the pre-crisis period show that, although the monetary aggregate was significant in models that incorporate all the policy changes, when considering just positive policy rate changes, the <b>coefficient</b> for <b>monetary</b> growth is not only small, but also statistically insignificant. Hence, this casts doubt on the extent to which monetary growth influenced the ECB policy rate decisions prior to the financial crisis. The <b>monetary</b> growth <b>coefficients</b> for the crisis period are also found to be insignificant. However, unlike during the pre-crisis period, the coefficient for inflation is found to be both positive and statistically significant, thus confirming qualitative perceptions that the ECB prioritised its price-stability mandate over concerns that the Euro Area sovereign debt crisis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} some empirical estimates on how tightly is it feasible to control inflation {{in a very}} small open economy such as Iceland. Estimated macroeconomic models of Canada, Iceland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States are used to derive efficient monetary policy frontiers that trace out the locus of the lowest combinations of inflation and output variability that are achievable under a range of alternative monetary policy rules. These frontiers illustrate that inflation stabilization is more challenging in Iceland than in other industrial countries primarily because of the relative magnitudes of the economic shocks.

40|$|This paper formulates {{a dynamic}} Random Coefficient Model (RCM) to {{consider}} a set of popular determinants of public deficits in the EU- 15 over the period 1971 - 2006, both at a country-specific level and from a population-wide perspective. Although the extent of government deficits and debt {{has been one of}} the most debated macroeconomic issues in recent times, the models trying to capture the explanatory powers driving these deficits typically estimate models that pose the strict assumption of homogeneity on the coefficients over all countries in the model. The sensibility of this assumption will be investigated, with results showing that an increase in the degree of heterogeneity leads to an improvement in the model fit and provides additional information to nuance the effects of the explanatory variables. In this way, the paper exposes a limited degree of partisanship over all countries under consideration, but on the other hand provides evidence for opportunistic behaviour of policymakers in the major part of the sample. The effect of institutional changes following the enforcement of the Maastricht Treaty varies over the countries and is related to the necessity of budgetary consolidation. fiscal policy, European <b>Monetary</b> Union, Random <b>Coefficient</b> Model, Bayesian Analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{operational}} {{performance of a}} set of simple monetary pol- icy rules 0 la Taylor in a model with capital accumulation and nominal and real rigidities is discussed with a special emphasis on the volatility of output, nominal rate and in. ation rate. Within an enriched modelling framework it is shown that output targeting plays a more crucial role than what has been assessed in the current literature for models without capital accumulation. In fact, with a small value of the output targeting <b>coefficient,</b> <b>monetary</b> authority is not completely successfull in stabilizing the volatility of output, nominal rate and inflation rate only by acting on inflation targeting. Moreover, a too strong concerns towards inflation relatively to output translates into a lower ability to control inflation volatility, together with a strong policy reaction with respect to an exogenous shock hitting the economy. Im- pulse response analysis shows that the risk of an excessive concerns towards inflation might end up in counterproductive results on output, after a positive technological shock. The model also shows a better internal propagation mechanism than what has been previously showed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} two {{measures of the}} monetary policy stance. The stance of monetary policy, regarded as a quantitative measure of whether Te policy is too tight, neutral, or too loose relative to objectives of stable prices and output growth, is useful and important {{for at least two}} reasons. First, it helps the authority (central bank) to determine the course of monetary policy needed to keep the objective (goals) within the target range. Secondly, a quantitative measure of the stance is important for an empirical study of the transmission of monetary policy actions through the economy. Measuring the stance of the monetary policy free from any criticism, however, is not an easy task. As pointed out by Gecchetti (1994), {{there seems to be no}} way to measure monetary actions that does not raise serious objections. Our results show that an individual <b>coefficient</b> <b>Monetary</b> Condition Index (MCI) performs better than both the summarised MCI coefficient and the Overall measure proposed by Bernanke and Mihov (1998). The results show that in the 21 -year period from 1984 to 2004, the demand shocks have dominated for about eight years. The MCI (IS-Individual coefficient) can explain six of them. However, it indicates the negative demand shock in two years as neutral. The other two measures, however, fail to capture demand shocks most of the time. This analysis suggests that the MCI (IS-Individual coefficient) plays an important role in determining output and inflation when the economy is not dominated by supply shocks. The results also show that supply shocks are dominant in the case of Pakistan. Furthermore, the exchange rate channel is more important than the interest rate channel.
