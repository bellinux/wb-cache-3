A group of Ypsilantians applied to the state for funding to publish a guidebook to the city's historic homes, and were told that no money was available for that purpose, but that there was funding available to stage a festival.

5|$|In early 1941 the British press, with {{permission}} from the Air Ministry, was allowed to approach Cunningham and write about his experiences. One of the <b>motivating</b> reasons {{for the lack of}} censorship was morale. In {{the early stages of the}} Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during the night. The publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF was fighting back and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was singled out for attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E
5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the <b>motivating</b> force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{distributed}} systems are under threat from a surprising source: the willful failure {{by their own}} users. These failures are not due to chance, nor are they maliciously <b>motivated.</b> Rather, these failures are rationally <b>motivated.</b> Despite evidence of rationally <b>motivated</b> failure in real systems, there has been surprisingly little work on rational behavior {{in the context of}} system fault tolerance. This thesis describes a form of defensive design used to build {{distributed systems}} that are robust to rationally <b>motivated</b> failure. Our approach proactively prevents rationally <b>motivated</b> failure by addressing the underlying failure cause. This approach differs markedly from traditional distributed system techniques of dealing with failure, which reactively seek to recover from an expressed failure.

40|$|It is {{well-established}} that {{coping and}} enhancement drinking motives predict college student drinking and that personality traits predict drinking motives. Little is known, however, about personality and drinking patterns among individuals who drink for both enhancement and coping reasons. University {{students in the}} current study completed questionnaires assessing personality, alcohol use, and drinking motives. Past year drinkers (N = 138) were catego-rized into one of four groups: coping, enhancement, coping + enhancement, and noninternally <b>motivated</b> drinkers. Drinking was lower among noninter-nally <b>motivated</b> drinkers and higher among coping <b>motivated</b> drinkers; coping + enhancement <b>motivated</b> drinkers reported drinking at levels most consistent with the coping group. Coping <b>motivated</b> drinkers reported higher levels of neuroticism, negative affect, and anxiety sensitivity, and lower lev-els of positive affect; coping + enhancement <b>motivated</b> drinkers were not sig-nificantly different from the other groups on personality traits.

Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see structure and action discussion) and whereas Marx argued for {{the primacy of the}} material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as <b>motivating</b> actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.|$|E

5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently <b>motivating,</b> and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E

In the burnout trait depersonalization, significance was found in intrinsically <b>motivated</b> teachers, instrumentally <b>motivated</b> teachers, self-concept internally <b>motivated</b> teachers, and male teachers. The burnout trait reduced personal accomplishment was significant in instrumentally <b>motivated</b> teachers, self-concept externally <b>motivated</b> teachers, self-concept internally <b>motivated</b> teachers, and teachers with an education level beyond a Masters degree. Instrumentally <b>motivated</b> teachers were the only group to show significance with the burnout characteristic emotional exhaustion. ^...|$|R
40|$|When {{observing the}} prosocial acts of others, {{people tend to}} be very {{concerned}} with the reasons for act. A charitable donation <b>motivated</b> by concern for the charitable cause is seen as noble, while the same donation <b>motivated</b> by image enhancement is seen as disingenuous. In a series of six studies, participants consistently evaluated extrinsically <b>motivated</b> prosocial acts to be subjectively smaller and less impactful than the identical but intrinsically <b>motivated</b> act, and evaluated the extrinsically <b>motivated</b> actors less favorably than intrinsically <b>motivated</b> actors. These effects were robust across different prosocial domains and across different types of acts, including the donation of money and time and for conservation behaviors. These results demonstrate that motivation information causes people to violate strict adherence to principles of fungibility, using contextual information to evaluate equal fungible units differently. Two further studies establish that people will adjust their choices of products and resource allocation to punish extrinsically <b>motivated</b> actors and reward intrinsically <b>motivated</b> actors. The authors discuss these findings relative to formal principles of rationality, and propose an explanation of contextualized rationality. The implications of these findings for policy-making and implementation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Do firms use {{autonomy}} to <b>motivate</b> workers, {{or do they}} give autonomous jobs to workers who are already especially <b>motivated?</b> A standard result in economics is that firms offer autonomous jobs to promote worker motivation. But surprisingly, {{little attention has been}} given to the details of this practice of giving {{autonomy to}} especially <b>motivated</b> workers. In contrast, findings from social psychology demonstrate that how people handle new information is closely related to what <b>motivates</b> them. Does autonomy in fact trigger motivation? I argue in this study that motivation may trigger autonomy, and thus that firms may benefit from screening for intrinsically <b>motivated</b> workers. I assume that workers differ in their degree of motivation, and that <b>motivated</b> workers have a lower cost of processing information than unmotivated ones. While <b>motivated</b> workers concentrate on searching for available information, unmotivated ones focus on ignoring certain information as irrelevant. Therefore, firms would gain efficiency from giving the more <b>motivated</b> workers a higher degree of autonomy. This link between autonomy and motivation also has implications for non-monetary aspects of the job, such as forms of leadership style and job design. Incentives, motivation, job-design, tasks and authoirity...|$|R

Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared.

Several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), met with Lord and Quigley in February 1930. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code.

Specifically, Bethe argued that Oppenheimer's stances against developing the hydrogen bomb in the late 1940s had not hindered its actual development, a topic which {{was seen as a}} key <b>motivating</b> factor behind the hearing. Bethe contended that the developments which led to the successful Teller–Ulam design were a matter of serendipity and not a question of manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas. During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried hard to convince Edward Teller against testifying. However, Teller did not agree, and his testimony {{played a major role in}} the revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance. While Bethe and Teller had been on very good terms during the prewar years, the conflict between them during the Manhattan Project, and especially during the Oppenheimer episode, permanently marred their relationship.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was <b>motivating</b> enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E
