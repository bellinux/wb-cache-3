Excavators can {{be divided}} into two categories: {{hydraulic}} <b>excavator</b> and <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavator.</b> Due to the flexibility and mobility, hydraulic excavator has almost replaced the <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavator.</b> But there still exists some problems such as hydraulic leaks and high costs of manufacturing and maintaining.

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} jackhammer, generally {{much larger}} than portable ones, may be fitted to <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavators</b> or backhoes and is widely used for roadwork, quarrying and general demolition or construction groundwork. These larger machine mounted breakers are known as Rig Mounted, or Machine Mounted Breakers. Such tools {{can also be used}} against vertical walls (or ceilings for that matter), since the vehicles involved are massive enough and powerful enough to exert the forces involved without needing the help of gravity in operating the tool. Pneumatic or hydraulic tools are particularly likely to be used in mines where there is an explosion risk (such as underground coal mines), since they lack any high-power electrical circuitry that might cause a triggering spark.|$|E
40|$|For centuries, mining has {{utilized}} {{drill and}} blast {{as the primary}} method of rock excavation. Although this technique has undergone significant improvements, it still remains a cyclic, labor intensive operation with inherent safety hazards. Other drawbacks include damage to the surrounding ground, creation of blast vibrations, rough excavation walls resulting in increased ventilation requirements, {{and the lack of}} selective mining ability. Perhaps the most important shortcoming of drill and blast {{is that it is not}} conducive to full implementation of automation or robotics technologies. Numerous attempts have been made in the past to automate drill and blast operations to remove personnel from the hazardous work environment. Although most of the concepts devised look promising on paper, none of them was found workable on a sustained production basis. In particular, the problem of serious damage to equipment during the blasting cycle could not be resolved regardless of the amount of charge used in excavation. Since drill and blast is not capable of meeting the requirements of a fully automated rock fragmentation method, its role is bound to gradually decrease. Mechanical excavation, in contrast, is highly suitable to automation because it is a continuous process and does not involve any explosives. Many of the basic principles and trends controlling the design of an earth-based <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavator</b> will hold in an extraterrestrial environment such as on the lunar surface. However, the economic and physical limitations for transporting materials to space will require major rethinking of these machines.

50|$|The {{quarries}} {{worked by}} creating a long trench (or gullet) through the overburden, along the base of which a tramway could transport the ore. The overburden (often of considerable depth) was excavated and dumped {{on the far side}} of the gullet, so that the next section of ore could be dug out. In this way the trench would gradually migrate across a field, and the reinstated land would be several feet lower than the surrounding fields. The early quaries had moved all the excavated rock by hand, loading it into wheelbarrows and pushing it via planks suspended over the trench, to be dropped on the far side. By the time this quarry was being opened up, probably in the 1920s there were <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavators,</b> and the quarries used ever larger dragline excavators to maximise production with the fewest people employed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractApplication of <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavators</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used excavation methods because it can bring the project more productivity, accuracy and safety. Among the <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavators,</b> roadheaders are mechanical miners which have been extensively used in tunneling, mining and civil industries. Performance prediction is an important issue for successful roadheader application and generally deals with machine selection, production rate and bit consumption. The main aim of this research is to investigate the cutting performance (instantaneous cutting rates (ICRs)) of medium-duty roadheaders by using artificial neural network (ANN) approach. There are different categories for ANNs, but based on training algorithm there are two main kinds: supervised and unsupervised. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Kohonen self-organizing feature map (KSOFM) are the most widely used neural networks for supervised and unsupervised ones, respectively. For gaining this goal, a database was primarily provided from roadheaders' performance and geomechanical characteristics of rock formations in tunnels and drift galleries in Tabas coal mine, the largest and the only fully-mechanized coal mine in Iran. Then the database was analyzed in order to yield the most important factor for ICR by using relatively important factor in which Garson equation was utilized. The MLP network was trained by 3 input parameters including rock mass properties, rock quality designation (RQD), intact rock properties such as uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and Brazilian tensile strength (BTS), and one output parameter (ICR). In order to have more validation on MLP outputs, KSOFM visualization was applied. The mean square error (MSE) and regression coefficient (R) of MLP were found to be 5. 49 and 0. 97, respectively. Moreover, KSOFM network has a map size of 8  ×  5 and final quantization and topographic errors were 0. 383 and 0. 032, respectively. The results show that MLP neural networks have a strong capability to predict and evaluate the performance of medium-duty roadheaders in coal measure rocks. Furthermore, it is concluded that KSOFM neural network is an efficient way for understanding system behavior and knowledge extraction. Finally, it is indicated that UCS has more influence on ICR by applying the best trained MLP network weights in Garson equation which is also confirmed by KSOFM...|$|E

Tunnelling began about 170 m behind the British forward lines and first went down over 30 m. As with many deep mines, compressed air and electricity were supplied from the surface. The tunnellers experimented with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavator</b> operated by hydraulic rams, {{similar to those used}} for the London Underground. The device weighed more than half a ton and promised to cut a tunnel about 2 m in diameter. In March 1916 it was used to dig 5 m but developed difficluties and was abandoned in situ. The main gallery of the Petit Bois mine was taken out by clay kicking over 500 m and reached beyond the German lines when it was breached by enemy counter-mining. When the enemy blew a camouflet in June, 12 men were trapped by a collapsed tunnel over 30 m below the surface. After six days, the British tunnellers managed to rescue Sapper Bedson, a veteran of the Ypres Salient and of Gallipoli.

Machines are often used in what is called salvage or rescue archaeology in developer-led excavation when there are financial or time pressures. Using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavator</b> is the quickest method to remove soil and debris and to prepare the surface for excavation by hand, taking care to avoid damaging archaeological deposits by accident or to {{make it difficult to}} identify later precisely where finds were located. The use of such machinery is often routine (as it is for instance with the British archaeological television series Time Team) but can also be controversial as it can result in less discrimination in how the archaeological sequence on a site is recorded. One of the earliest uses of earth-moving machinery was at Durrington Walls in 1967. An old road through the henge was to be straightened and improved and was going to cause considerable damage to the archaeology. Rosemary Hill describes how Geoffrey Wainwright [...] "oversaw large, high-speed excavations, taking bulldozers to the site in a manner that shocked some of his colleagues but yielded valuable if tantalising information about what Durrington had looked like and how it might have been used." [...] Machines are used primarily to remove modern overburden and for the control of spoil. In British archaeology mechanical diggers are sometimes nicknamed [...] "big yellow trowels".|$|R
