25|$|Nearly all {{instrumental}} music published by Antonio Sacchini dates from his London years (1772–1781). <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> listed below, {{first published in}} London, were later reprinted in Paris and elsewhere.|$|R
5|$|For the {{newspaper}} supplement Pats, he also created the title series in 1974, {{but he left}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> to Merhottein. The series {{changed its name to}} Tits in 1977 after a lawsuit, and disappeared in 1986.|$|E
5|$|From Persia, Andranik {{moved to}} the Caucasus, where he met the Armenian leaders in Baku and Tiflis. He then left Russia and {{traveled}} to Europe, where he was engaged in advocacy {{in support of the}} Armenians' national liberation struggle. In 1906 in Geneva, he published a book on military tactics. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was about his activities and the strategies he used during the 1904 Sasun uprising.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{administration}} opposed {{efforts by}} the CMS to convert the Bari people of Mongalla. The missionaries interpreted this as due {{to the influence of}} Islam in weakening the spiritual ideals of the officials.Cameron desired to avoid friction with the Muslims who had undertaken <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of building and servicing the new provincial capital.|$|E
50|$|Glass: The glass {{collection}} contains works from artists Harvey Littleton, Dale Chihuly, Joel Philip Meyers, Dan Dailey, Steven Hodder and Judy Jensen. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> in <b>the</b> {{glass collection}} are sculptural rather than functional.|$|R
30|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> {{reported}} on Indian languages are on straight text-line documents.

25|$|Al Biruni is <b>the</b> author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book Kitab~ul~Hind. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Al-Biruni are in Arabic {{although}} he wrote one <b>of</b> his masterpieces, <b>the</b> Kitab al-Tafhim apparently in both Persian and Arabic, showing his mastery over both languages.|$|R
5|$|The {{stainless}} steel cladding is ribbed and riveted {{in the shape of}} sunbeams, with many triangular windows. Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Ensemble Studios worked {{together}} with Big Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires IIIs second expansion. This {{was the first}} joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projects—particularly Halo Wars—while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games did <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen joined in the brainstorming, and had control over the final product. Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.|$|E
50|$|From <b>the</b> writing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Varro, it {{is known}} that there were more than fifty ancient Greeks authors on <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> agriculture.

50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current {{financial}} constraints, the Swiss Federal Government can postpone <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> on new sections. <b>The</b> connection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A16 to the A36 motorway in France (Mulhouse - Dijon) between Montbéliard and Belfort is to {{be completed}} within a time horizon of 2025-2030.|$|R
5|$|Henry II came to {{the throne}} in 1154 and built {{extensively}} at Windsor between 1165 and 1179. Henry replaced the wooden palisade surrounding the upper ward with a stone wall interspersed with square towers and built the first King's Gate. The first stone keep was suffering from subsidence, and cracks were beginning {{to appear in the}} stonework of the south side. Henry replaced the keep with another stone shell keep and chemise wall, but moved the walls in {{from the edge of the}} motte to relieve the pressure on the mound, and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support. Inside the castle Henry remodelled the royal accommodation. Bagshot Heath stone was used for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> and stone from Bedfordshire for the internal buildings.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rachel (Lea Michele) {{realizes that}} some glee club members are faking their singing. She tells glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), complaining {{that she is}} doing <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> exhausting herself and getting ill in the process. She reveals the non-participants as Finn (Cory Monteith), Quinn (Dianna Agron), Puck, Brittany (Heather Morris), and Santana. Will gathers the students and gives them a new task for the week: each club member {{will have to do}} solos, and each must choose a song that best represents their feelings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> on organothorium {{compounds}} {{has focused}} on the cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls. Like many of the early and middle actinides (up to americium, and also expected for curium), thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th(C8H8)2, thorocene. It is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound uranocene. It can be prepared by reacting K2C8H8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC8H8. It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190°C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as (η8-C8H8)ThCl2(THF)2, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
50|$|Bolesław Olszewicz, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern {{historians who}} criticize Lelewel, argues {{there is not}} enough {{evidence}} to prove that Scolvus was actually Polish. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> that mention Johannes Scolvus were published more than a century after the voyage and no contemporary evidence has been found.|$|R
25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> {{listed here}} are largely out of print.

30|$|There {{are some}} <b>works</b> that exploit <b>the</b> {{presence}} <b>of</b> multiple robots {{with the ability}} to communicate and develop techniques for collaborative path-planning dealing with uncertainty. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> collaborative path-planning for multiple robots located in unknown environments focused on <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment.|$|R
5|$|Owens did {{not have}} time to {{complete}} the shot before the Cannes screenings, but afterwards he used cineSync to conduct <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> from home. The shot includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins disappears into the crowd about a minute into the shot, the live footage is gradually joined with more digital work. The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute of the shot before being replaced by digital ones. The shot was made more complicated by the need to add Massive extras. Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Stord Bridge was undertaken {{as part of the}} same contract as the Bømla Bridge, which was awarded in December 1998 to Triangle Contractors, a joint venture between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was carried out by NCC with HBG having responsibility for the steel parts of the deck and the cables. HBG had previously built the steel for the Osterøy Bridge, which opened in 1997. The responsibility for the cables was given to Brown Beach Associates and Hordaland Mekaniske Verksted. Construction started on 20 February 1999. After the pylons were completed on 25 September 1999, two catwalks were erected between them, with the constructors choosing two continuous catwalks instead of three separate pairs. Extra stability to the catwalks was achieved by building connections between the two.|$|E
5|$|When Frank Sels {{left the}} Studio in 1967, Karel Biddeloo took {{over most of}} the {{realistic}} series of Vandersteen. He made Karl May from 1967 until 1969, when the Bessy-studio took over the job. He also took over Biggles, which ended in 1969, when it was replaced by the jungle series Safari, inspired by Daktari. At the start of the series, Vandersteen did most of the creative work, but after a few albums he left <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> to Biddeloo. The series ended in 1974. Biddeloo then devoted most of his time to De Rode Ridder, where he started inking the stories by Vandersteen in 1967 and took completely over in 1969, when Vandersteen lost his interest. He continued working on it until his death in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1950, when Ginzburg {{married again}} {{and moved to}} Rome, she entered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{prolific}} period <b>of</b> her literary career. During the next 20 years, she published <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> for which she is best known. She and Baldini were deeply involved in <b>the</b> cultural life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|R
30|$|In {{recent works}} {{addressing}} this issue, {{as summarized in}} [1], various efficient defense strategies have been proposed and developed. However, few <b>of</b> them consider <b>the</b> real dynamics in <b>the</b> interference environment. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> assume that <b>the</b> interference is constant with time. In fact, interference is time-varying in many cases.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> are solely violent by nature, it {{is perhaps}} the first known example of ero guro or the erotic {{grotesque}} in Japanese culture, an art subgenre which depicts either erotic or extreme images of violence and mutilation. The Muzan-e has influenced many modern day art formats and ero guro {{can be found in}} manga with <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Suehiro Maruo, Shintaro Kago or Toshio Maeda; in many live action films such as the pink film movement and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> director Takashi Miike and even non-Japanese artists such as Trevor Brown. Muzan translates from Japanese as cruelty or atrocity, and <b>the</b> <b>works</b> were said to spread a general panic amongst the populace at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> publishing, with <b>the</b> extreme violence depicted in the paintings taken as a sign of social and moral decline.|$|R
5|$|As Renaissance styles survived {{late in the}} city, the {{appearance}} of Baroque art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at {{the centre of the}} development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it had been two centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, {{but by the end of}} the century <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Magi (1748–50) is the work of Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The earliest two-towered Baroque church was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of Košice and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century more simply designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town. The Baroque Bánffy Palace (1774–1785), constructed around a rectangular yard, is the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its peculiarity lies in {{the appearance}} of the principal façade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 13 May, the 10th Panzer Division slipped into {{position}} upstream to the north-east of Sedan, ready to strike at its designated crossing point near the town of Wadelincourt. Downstream, the 2nd Panzer Division moved into position to cross at Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division prepared to strike at the Gaulier bridgehead, in the centre of Sedan's tactical front. It was on the northern bend of the Sedan Meuse loop that the Luftwaffe was to make its maximum effort, between Gaulier and Wadelincourt. To supplement his air support, Guderian stripped most of his Panzer Divisions of their artillery, which he then positioned directly opposite Gaulier. However, the artillery regiments lacked ammunition. Sustained and damaging bombardment through shelling was impossible. The Luftwaffe {{was going to have to}} do <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Guderian reported that his Corps had only 141 artillery pieces against the French 174. To the north and south of Sedan, the French X Corps and French XXXXI Corps (at the artillery fortress at Charleville-Mézières) could also add their artillery and shell Guderian's Panzer units as they crossed the bridgeheads. The slow advance of artillery units to the front added to the German numerical inferiority, which was now 1:3 against. Only in the afternoon did the German artillery make an appearance, but with little effect. The 2nd Panzer Division was forced to attack without artillery support. For these reasons, Guderian had decided the outcome depended on the quality of air support, acting as flying artillery.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} prohibition (on aikido, at least) {{was lifted}} in 1948 {{with the creation}} of the Aiki Foundation, established by the Japanese Ministry of Education with permission from the Occupation forces. The Hombu dojo re-opened the following year. After the war Ueshiba effectively retired from aikido. He delegated <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of running the Hombu dojo and the Aiki Federation to his son Kisshomaru, and instead chose to spend much of his time in prayer, meditation, calligraphy and farming. He still travelled extensively to promote aikido, even visiting Hawaii in 1961. He also appeared in a television documentary on aikido: NTV's The Master of Aikido, broadcast in January 1960. Ueshiba maintained links with the Japanese nationalist movement even in later life; his student Kanshu Sunadomari reported that Ueshiba temporarily sheltered Mikami Taku, one of the naval officers involved in the May 15 Incident, at Iwama.|$|E
