5|$|Die casting is a <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> {{process that}} is {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old wool {{industry}} in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it was slightly smaller {{than it had been}} in the mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, <b>metal</b> <b>casting,</b> carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E

25|$|The {{first patent}} for an evaporative-pattern casting process was filed in April 1956, by Harold F. Shroyer. He {{patented}} {{the use of}} foam patterns embedded in traditional green sand for <b>metal</b> <b>casting.</b> In his patent, a pattern was machined from a block of expanded polystyrene (EPS), and supported by bonded sand during pouring. This process {{is now known as}} the full mold process.|$|E
25|$|As with <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> and stereotyping, a mold {{is first}} formed from the model. Since {{electrotyping}} involves wet chemical processes and is done near room temperature, the molding material can be soft. Materials such as wax, gutta-percha (natural latex), and ultimately ozokerite were used. The mold's surface is made electrically conducting by coating it very thinly with fine graphite powder or paint. A wire {{is attached to}} the conducting surface, and the mold is suspended in an electrolyte solution.|$|E

25|$|A Murti of a Hindu deity is {{typically}} made by carving stone, wood working, <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> or through pottery. Medieval era texts describing their proper proportions, positions and gestures include the Puranas, Agamas and Samhitas particularly the Shilpa Shastras. The expressions in a Murti vary in diverse Hindu traditions, ranging from Ugra symbolism to express destruction, fear and violence (Durga, Kali), {{as well as}} Saumya symbolism to express joy, knowledge and harmony (Saraswati, Lakshmi). Saumya images are most common in Hindu temples. Other Murti forms found in Hinduism include the Linga.|$|E
25|$|Shell mold casting is a <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> process {{similar to}} sand casting, in that molten metal is poured into an {{expendable}} mold. However, in shell mold casting, the mold is a thin-walled shell created from applying a sand-resin mixture around a pattern. The pattern, a metal {{piece in the}} shape of the desired part, is reused to form multiple shell molds. A reusable pattern allows for higher production rates, while the disposable molds enable complex geometries to be cast. Shell mold casting requires the use of a metal pattern, oven, sand-resin mixture, dump box, and molten metal.|$|E
25|$|The {{cycle and}} motor {{manufacturing}} industries brought into existence {{a wide variety}} of subsidiary trades. Most notably these were general engineering, <b>metal</b> <b>casting,</b> drop forging, chain-making and the manufacture of instruments and gauges, machine tools, and all types of electrical equipment. The manufacture of aircraft, aero engines and related equipment also took place in Coventry as early as 1916, and during World War II the aircraft industry dwarfed all other local industries. With the outbreak of war many of the motor firms switched to aircraft work, and the whole of Coventry's industrial skills and resources turned to war production of one sort or another.|$|E

25|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic and {{is responsible for}} the ease with which gypsum can be cast into various shapes including sheets (for drywall), sticks (for blackboard chalk), and molds (to immobilize broken bones, or for <b>metal</b> <b>casting).</b> Mixed with polymers, it {{has been used as a}} bone repair cement. Small amounts of calcined gypsum are added to earth to create strong structures directly from cast earth, an alternative to adobe (which loses its strength when wet). The conditions of dehydration can be changed to adjust the porosity of the hemihydrate, resulting in the so-called alpha and beta hemihydrates (which are more or less chemically identical).|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} and terrain of Kathmandu {{have played a}} significant role in the development of a stable economy which spans millennia. The city is in an ancient lake basin, with fertile soil and flat terrain. This geography helped form a society based on agriculture. This, combined with its location between India and China, helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading center over the centuries. Kathmandu's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the Silk Road which linked India and Tibet. From centuries past, Lhasa Newar merchants of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia. Other traditional occupations are farming, <b>metal</b> <b>casting,</b> woodcarving, painting, weaving, and pottery.|$|E
25|$|In 1746, the Colmore family {{released}} land {{on what is}} known as the Jewellery Quarter today to help satisfy the demands of an increasing population. The largest tract of land was Newhall which had been purchased from the Manor of Birmingham by William Colmore. In 1560, it was described as a rabbit warren and by 1620, New Hall Manor had been constructed on the site. The large manor house gave its name to the area. By 1746, the Colmore family had moved out and let the manor to tenants. Beyond this, there were enclosed fields leading to Birmingham Heath. Sandpits were located on Hockley Hill and the product of these pits was used for moulds which were used in the local <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> industry.|$|E

25|$|The {{artisans}} {{with the}} highest social status were those who worked with metals and feathers, {{as well as those}} who worked with semi precious stones. The reason for this was that these artisan produced goods used by the ruling classes as well as offerings to the gods. Michoacán was one of Mesoamerica’s major metal working centers, mastering hammering, metal coating and <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> by the time the Spanish arrived. Most metal work was in gold, but the Purépecha had developed some copper work. Most of the products were ornaments for the ruling classes but some utilitarian items such as needles, fishhooks and hole punches were made. Luxury goods made with fine feathers was a particularly appreciated by Purépecha society. Goods such as caps, blankets, clothing, headdresses and ornamental staffs adorned with feathers were used only by priests and rulers as symbols of power and dignity. Artisans who made these objects had their own designation, “izquarecucha.” Purépecha stone work includes the working of turquoise and other semi precious stones along with obsidian. Most were used in adornments and offerings but obsidian was also used for agricultural tools of high economic value, weapons and sacrificial knives. Stoneworkers’ graves can be identified by their goods, which included their tools and raw materials.|$|E
25|$|Objects in {{precious}} {{materials such}} as ivory and metal had a very high status in the period, {{much more so than}} monumental sculpture — we know the names of more makers of these than painters, illuminators or architect-masons. Metalwork, including decoration in enamel, became very sophisticated, and many spectacular shrines made to hold relics have survived, of which the best known is the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral by Nicholas of Verdun. The bronze Gloucester candlestick and the brass font of 1108–17 now in Liège are superb examples, very different in style, of <b>metal</b> <b>casting,</b> the former highly intricate and energetic, drawing on manuscript painting, while the font shows the Mosan style at its most classical and majestic. The bronze doors, a triumphal column and other fittings at Hildesheim Cathedral, the Gniezno Doors, and the doors of the Basilica di San Zeno in Verona are other substantial survivals. The aquamanile, a container for water to wash with, appears to have been introduced to Europe in the 11th century, and often took fantastic zoomorphic forms; surviving examples are mostly in brass. Many wax impressions from impressive seals survive on charters and documents, although Romanesque coins are generally not of great aesthetic interest.|$|E
