However, the future <b>market</b> <b>evolution</b> of EVs strongly depends on several influencing factors such as battery and oil prices as well as their future evolution. The effect of these and other influencing factors as well as the resulting future <b>market</b> <b>evolution</b> are uncertain, yet policy makers need an empirical basis to take decisions impacting the future <b>market</b> <b>evolution.</b> Here, we study the <b>market</b> <b>evolution</b> of EVs in Germany until 2020 and perform a model-based assessment of influencing factors and different monetary policy measures. We use an agent-based model with a utility maximising decision function for several thousand individual private and commercial vehicle owners.

Furthermore, the high uncertainty of framework conditions and the EV <b>market</b> <b>evolution</b> implies that policies to foster market diffusion of EVs should be dynamically adaptable to react to changing framework conditions...|$|E

Co-evolution is generated by two elements missing in previous analyses: securitisation and bank equity capital. As banks evolve via improvements in credit screening, they securitise higher quality credits. This encourages greater investor participation and spurs capital <b>market</b> <b>evolution.</b> And, if capital <b>market</b> <b>evolution</b> is spurred by greater investor participation, banks find it cheaper to raise equity capital to satisfy endogenously arising risk-sensitive capital requirements. Bank evolution is thus stimulated as banks consequently serve previously unserved high-risk borrowers. Numerous additional results are obtained. Copyright � The Author(s).
