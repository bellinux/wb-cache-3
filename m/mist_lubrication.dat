5000|$|Oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> oils {{are applied}} to rolling element (antifriction) {{bearings}} as an oil mist. Neither oil rings nor constant level lubricators are used in pumps and drivers connected to plant-wide oil mist systems. Oil mist is an atomized amount of oil carried or suspended in a volume of pressurized dry air. The oil mist, actually a ratio of one volume of oil suspended or carried in 200,000 volumes of clean, dry air, moves in a piping system (header). The point of origin is usually a mixing valve (the oil mist generator), connected to this header. Branch lines often feed oil mist to hundreds of rolling elements in the many pumps and drivers connected to a plant-wide system.|$|E
50|$|Unlike larger engines, the {{crankcase}} {{does not}} contain only engine oil because it handles the fuel/air mixture. Instead, oil is {{mixed in with the}} fuel supply as petroil, and this mixture provides splash lubrication for the cylinder walls, crankshaft and connecting rod bearings. Using ball or roller bearings for the bearings in such engines has always been more common than the oil-fed plain bearings used for other engines, as these are more amenable to using this oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication.</b> These engines have been used in larger sizes for small cars. They were considered in the 1980s as more fuel efficient engines for larger cars, but the increased interest in engine emissions at this time prevented their use: mixing their lubricating oil into the engine's intake mixture gave high HC emissions and this problem was not overcome.|$|E
40|$|A primary {{technology}} barrier {{preventing the}} operation of gas turbine engines and aircraft gearboxes at higher temperatures is the inability of currently used liquid lubricants to survive at the desired operating conditions over an extended time period. Current state-of-the-art organic liquid lubricants rapidly degrade at temperatures above 300 C; hence, another form of lubrication is necessary. Vapor or <b>mist</b> phase reaction <b>lubrication</b> is a unique, alternative technology for high temperature lubrication. The majority of past studies have employed a liquid phosphate ester that was vaporized or misted, and delivered to bearings or gears where the phosphate ester reacted with the metal surfaces generating a solid lubricious film. This method resulted in acceptable operating temperatures suggesting some good lubrication properties, but the continuous reaction between the phosphate ester and the iron surfaces led to wear rates unacceptable for gas turbine engine or aircraft gearbox applications. In this study, an alternative non-phosphate liquid was used to mist phase lubricate a spur gearbox rig operating at 10, 000 rpm under highly loaded conditions. After 21 million shaft revolutions of operation the gears exhibited only minor wear...|$|R
40|$|Parametric {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with an optimized 35 -mm-bore-angular-contact ball bearing on a high-speed, high-temperature bearing tester. Results from both air-oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> and oil-jet lubrication systems used to lubricate the bearing were compared to speeds of 2. 5 x 10 (exp 6) DN. The maximum obtainable speed with air-oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> is 2. 5 x 10 (exp 6) DN. Lower bearing temperatures and higher power losses are obtained with oil-jet lubrication than with air-oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication.</b> Bearing power loss is a direct function of oil flow to the bearing and independent of oil delivery system. For a given oil-flow rate, bearing temperature and power loss increase with increases in speed. Bearing life is an inverse function of temperature, the difference in temperature between the individual bearing ring components, and the resultant elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film thicknesses. Bearing life is independent of the oil delivery system except as it affects temperature. Cage slip increased with increases in speed. Cage slip as high as 7 % was measured and was generally higher with air-oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> than with oil-jet lubrication...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> offers many advantages over sump lubrication. Unfortunately, <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> generates sub-micrometer sized aerosol particles (fines) that escape from the oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> system. These particles are an environmental hazard. There can be a two-pronged approach to the present problem. The first method is to develop a suitable blend that reduces the number of 'fine' particles. Experiments are designed to identify the effect of the additives and the temperature of the lube oil in the generator. The best performing lube oil formulations are identified based on performance at different bearing speeds and the temperature of the lube oil in the generator. The second approach is based on the design of a better bearing casing to maximize collection efficiency. An attempt is made to study collection efficiency using dimensional analysis. The non-dimensional numbers are identified and their validity is analyzed. Alternatively, a boundary value problem based on continuum mechanics is partially formulated for future study...|$|E

40|$|The {{applicability}} of a once-through oil mist {{system to the}} lubrication of helicopter spur gears was investigated and compared to conventional jet spray lubrication. In the <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> mode, cooling air was supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the out of mesh location of the gear sets. The mist air was also supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the radial position mist nozzle at a constant rate of 0. 0632 mol/s (3 SCFM) per nozzle. The lubricant contained in the mist air varied between 32 - 44 cc/hour. In the recirculating jet spray mode, the flow rate was varied between 1893 - 2650 cc/hour. Visual inspection revealed the jet spray mode produced a superior surface finish on the gear teeth but a thermal energy survey showed a 15 - 20 % increase in heat generated.

In this article, the experimental platform for high-speed grease is designed and manufactured which consists of the drive system, the test portion, the loading system, the lubrication system, the control system, and so on.

A small amount of mist lubricant is sprayed onto the mirror surfaces of cemented tungsten carbide (WC) tools, and pure aluminium specimens are compressed by the tools. It is found that spraying {{a small amount of}} lubricant (0. 5 g/m 2) reduces the friction effectively. The roughness of the workpieces after compression increases as the amount of the lubricant increases to Ra 0 : 20 { 1 : 0 mm which is in the same order as the lubricant film thickness. <b>Mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> results in very small dots of lubricant particles sticking to the tool surface, and the lubrication mechanism of mist lubricant is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> is {{currently}} widely {{used as a}} lubrication method now. It has some advantages as follows: low fuel consumption, uniform lubrication and high efficiency. In job site, oil mist condensation occurs in the pipeline, and this will not only reduce the efficiency, but also lead to accidents. Nowadays, CFD numerical simulation software has been widely applied in design, but the research of oil mist condensation in the transmission process based on CFD is very fare. In this paper, to choose the right the working parameters and a reasonable pipeline layout in job site, the oil mist condensation in the pipeline was simulated based on CFD. And it was found that, the diameter of oil mist particle is mainly influenced by temperature, and the best temperature range is made out...|$|E
40|$|The oil {{lubrication}} {{system is a}} critical part of the helicopter main gearbox (MGB) and this is evident in the many accidents and incidents over the last 30 years.

The aim {{of this study was to}} undertake a comparative investigation into the performance of <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication,</b> using commercially available thioether (MCS- 293 â„¢), on a category A helicopter MGB under loss of oil conditions. Experimental observations highlighted that the high-speed input module of the MGB attained the highest temperature and was a limiting factor to continued gearbox operation under loss of oil conditions. Results showed that by routing thioether mist through existing galleries within the MGB a lower rate of temperature increase was achieved, in comparison with a dry-run conditio...|$|E
40|$|Spent {{metal removal}} fluid (cutting fluid, lubricant, coolant, etc.) is a {{significant}} waste stream from the metal fabrication industry. The quantity of waste generated {{and the cost of}} fluid purchases could be reduced by microlubrication (minimum quantity lubrication, <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication)</b> methods of fluid delivery. In microlubrication, a fine cutting fluid mist is used, rather than the traditional method of flooding the cutting tool ??? workpiece interface. The metal fabrication industry is concerned that the use of microlubrication might reduce tool life negatively impacting production and increasing manufacturing costs. The purpose of this research was to compare the performance (tool life) of cutting tools lubricated and cooled using microlubrication with that of cutting tools lubricated and cooled using traditional flood application. The performance difference identified is used to calculate and compare the economic impact of microlubrication versus flood application. Discussion is also presented comparing the effect of microlubrication and flood application on the cost of fluid purchased and disposal. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E

40|$|LectureThe {{choice of}} which {{lubrication}} strategy {{to apply for}} pump bearings has implications for both the short term characteristics exhibited by the bearings and their long term reliability. When lubricating rolling element bearings, four basic strategies have historically been employed: Grease lubrication; Oil bath lubrication; Oil lubrication via slinger disc or oil ring; Oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication.</b> For high speed (3000 RPM and higher), slinger discs or oil rings are commonly used due to the short re-greasing interval exhibited with grease lubrication and the high heat generation due to churning seen with oil bath lubrication. This paper seeks to reprise the work of Lemmon & Booser, Heshmat & Pinkus, Gardner and Ettles et al in defining the equations of performance related to oil slinger discs and oil rings. It will then {{address some of the}} operational and reliability concerns of each of these oiling methods using a purpose built test rig that is representative of {{the current state of the}} art in bearing housing design for pumps. Specifically it will look at how the following parameters affect oil delivery and stability: Rotational speed; Bearing housing inclination; Oil ring material; Slinger geometry; Slinger and oil ring submergence depth...|$|E
40|$|The high {{percentage}} of the refrigeration costs (17 %) in the operational production costs, the ecological subjects, the lawlegal demands related {{to the preservation of}} the environment and the human health justify the recent researches about the restriction towards the use of abundant cutting fluid in machining processes. However, it is {{important to point out that}} the use of a minimal <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> (mixture of air and oil) has been possible in production processes for machining, due to the technological development of tool materials and also machine-tools. The objective of this work is to test the minimum quantity of lubricant (MQL) technique (10 ml/h of oil) mixed in a flow of air in the drilling process of aluminum silicon alloy (SAE 323) with a solid carbide drill (K 10). The input variables were drill diameter (and consequentelyconsequently, depth of cut) and cutting speed. The results showed that when high depth of cut and cutting speed are used, the operation using abundant fluid is not possible because the drill breaks after a few holes. Moreover, the quality of the holes obtained using MQL is not worse than that obtained for with smaller cutting speed and depth of cut...|$|E
40|$|In both {{civil and}} {{military}} aviation, maintenance plays {{a large role}} in ensuring continued safe operation and accounts for a significant portion of operating costs. Typically, a conservative planned maintenance (PM) program is initially developed to ensure the aircraft reliability but this often leads to over-maintenance. With more in-service experience, operators seek to customize the maintenance interval accordingly in order to reduce workload and cost without compromising safety. With prevailing use of health usage monitoring systems (HUMS), the maintenance can even transit from PM to condition-based maintenance (CBM) where further safety and costs benefit may be reaped. Whilst some guidance for such changes exists, it remains challenging for maintainers in practice as suggested methods often require significant component failure or test data; which are unavailable or too expensive to obtain. As such, this research reviews the challenges faced by maintainers when extending PM intervals or implementing CBM and seeks ways to support decision making for the changes. For PM, the challenge to extend the maintenance interval with little or no past failure is addressed. Existing reliability methods were reviewed and two improved methods to estimate the reliability lower confidence bounds were developed. The first approach adopts the use of Monte Carlo simulation applied to the Weibull plot equation while the second uses a probabilistic damage accumulation model together with bootstrap techniques. Both methods are used to assess the reliability of extending the replacement interval of a gearbox bearing and are shown to perform better than existing methods as they provide tighter reliability confidence bounds. For CBM, a survey on sensor technologies and diagnostic algorithms showed that vibration-based sensor is most widely used to detect fault. The study then demonstrates a CBM implementation using vibration-based HUMS data from in-service helicopters. Analysis of the FFT spectra shows that the fault patterns corresponding to progressing stages of bearing wear can be clearly observed. The fault patterns are extracted as features for unsupervised classification using Gaussian Mixture Models and used to infer the different bearing health states. Signal detection theory was then applied onto the classified feature to determine the detection thresholds for fault diagnosis. A simplistic prognostic model using trend extrapolation to determine the replacement lead-time is then performed and use for maintenance planning. In an effort to ease the implementation of CBM, ways to improve prognostics application is explored. The Switching Kalman Filter (SKF) was adapted for both diagnostic and prognostic under an autonomous framework that requires little user input. The SKF uses multiple dynamical models with each one describing a different stage of bearing wear. The most probable wear process is then inferred from the extracted feature data using Bayesian estimation. As different stages of bearing wear can be tracked using the dynamical behavior of the measurements, pre-established threshold for fault detection is no longer required for diagnostics. The SKF approach provides maintainers with more information for decision-making as a probabilistic measure of the wear processes are available. It also offers the opportunity to predict RUL more accurately by distinguishing between the wear stages and performing prediction only when rapid and unstable wear is detected. The SKF approach is demonstrated using in-service feature data from the AH 64 D TRGB and the results have shown the proposed methods to be a promising tool for maintenance decision-making. As an extension of research on methodologies to improve PM and CBM decision support, a thioether <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> is explored for its feasibility as a backup lubrication system for helicopters. The aim is to reduce the mishap severity category which in turn eases the extension of PM interval or its replacement with a CBM task. An experimental setup was developed to test the thermal properties of a spur gearbox with thioether <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> under various load and speed conditions and it was shown that only a very small volumetric flow of lubricant is required to preserve the gears from damage in oil starved environment. As such, a thioether based mist backup system can potentially reduce the risk of oil starvation failures significantly...|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{receiving}} airworthiness certification, extensive testing is required {{during the development}} of rotary wing aircraft drive systems. Many of these tests are conducted to demonstrate the drive system's ability to operate at extreme conditions, beyond that {{called for in the}} normal to maximum power operating range. One of the most extreme tests {{is referred to as the}} loss-of-lubrication or run dry test. During this test, the drive system is expected to last at least 30 min without failure while the primary lubrication system is disabled for predetermined, scripted flight conditions. Failure of this test can lead to a partial redesign of the drive system or the addition of an emergency lubrication system. Either of these solutions can greatly increase the aircraft drive system cost and weight and extend the schedule for obtaining airworthiness certification. Recent work at NASA Glenn Research Center focused on performing tests, in a relevant aerospace environment, to simulate the behavior of spur gears under loss-of-lubrication conditions. Tests were conducted using a test facility that was used in the past for spur gear contact fatigue testing. A loss-oflubrication test is initiated by shutting off the single into mesh lubricating jet. The test proceeds until the gears fail and can no longer deliver the applied torque. The observed failures are typically plastically deformed gear teeth, due to the high tooth temperatures, that are no longer in mesh. The effect of several different variables to gear tooth condition during loss-of-lubrication have been tested such as gear pitch, materials, shrouding, lubrication condition, and emergency supplied <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> in earlier testing at NASA. Recent testing has focused on newer aerospace gear steels and imbedding thermocouples in the shrouding to measure the air-oil temperatures flung off the gear teeth. Along with the instrumented shrouding, an instrumented spur gear was also tested. The instrumented spur gear had five thermocouples installed at different locations on the gear tooth and web. The data from these two types of measurements provided important information as to the thermal environment during the loss-of-lubrication event. This data is necessary to validate on-going modeling efforts...|$|E
