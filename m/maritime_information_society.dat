40|$|Abstract / This article {{looks into}} the <b>information</b> <b>society</b> from a postcolonial subject position.

It argues that when the <b>information</b> <b>society</b> is perceived from the South, {{it turns out to}} be a new imperial project designed to create markets for multinational corporations that own and operate information technologies, the engine of the <b>information</b> <b>society.</b> It also proposes an amendment – an anti-market utopia – to the <b>information</b> <b>society</b> to make it meaningful for the people of the South...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>information</b> <b>society</b> {{discussion}} {{to date has}} been dominated by vision statements from national governments and promotional campaigns by the major suppliers of information/ communication hardware and software. They have promoted a homogeneous conception of "the" <b>information</b> <b>society,</b> toward which all countries should be developing as fast as possible. Independent research has shown that supply-push development is unlikely {{to meet the needs of}} most countries. Effective <b>information</b> <b>society</b> development must reflect the unique priorities of individual countries, thereby leading to many distinct <b>information</b> <b>societies.</b> Are the priorities identified in <b>Information</b> <b>Society</b> Ireland: Strategy for Action, the best for Ireland, or were important issues and sectors of Irish society neglected? This is an important issue for debate that will help shape the future Irish <b>information</b> <b>society...</b>|$|R

40|$|In my Bachelor's work I {{studied the}} texts on <b>information</b> <b>society</b> in Eesti Päevaleht and Postimees in the timerange of 2002 – 2004. My {{goal was to}} map {{different}} aspects of the texts focusing on {{different aspects of the}} <b>information</b> <b>society</b> and to find a media definition for <b>information</b> <b>society</b> through the themes in the text. For this I compared the themes of journalistic texts to Frank Webster's theoretical framework for defining <b>information</b> <b>society</b> using content and qualitative analysis. The representation of <b>information</b> <b>society</b> concentrates mainly on the themes of technology and economy. The main functions of the journalistic texts are mostly informing or advertising. As in theory, the concept of <b>information</b> <b>society</b> in media is very wide and multidimensional. Thus I {{came to the conclusion that}} the media concept of <b>information</b> <b>society</b> cannot be fully defined based only on this research.
