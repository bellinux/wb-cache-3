5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E

25|$|Pancreatectomy (removal of {{a portion}} or {{nearly all of}} the pancreas) is usually a {{treatment}} of last resort when the simpler medical measures fail to provide prolonged normal blood sugar levels. For some time, the most common surgical procedure was removal of almost all of the pancreas, this cured some infants but not all. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus commonly develops, though in many cases it occurs many years after the pancreatectomy.Later it was discovered that a sizeable minority of cases of mutations were focal, involving overproduction of insulin by only a portion of the pancreas. These cases can be cured by removing <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> the pancreas, resulting in excellent outcomes with no long-term problems.|$|E

25|$|Continued {{research}} has revealed some shortcomings and simplifications {{in the original}} theory. For instance, channel proteins are described as having a continuous water channel through their center, which is now known to be generally untrue (an exception being nuclear pore complexes, which have a 9nm open water channel). Also, free diffusion on the cell surface is often limited to areas a few tens of nanometers across. These limits to lateral fluidity are due to cytoskeleton anchors, lipid phase separation and aggregated protein structures. Contemporary studies also indicate that <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> the plasma membrane is “bare” lipid than previously thought and in fact much of the cell surface may be protein-associated. In spite of these limitations, the fluid mosaic model remains a popular and often referenced general notion for the structure of biological membranes.|$|E
25|$|During a {{discussion}} about the potential plot of the game's sequel BioShock 2, editor Hilary Goldstein said that Ryan should reappear in it, and that while it should be in a new area, it should still have connections to him. Onyett called Ryan a key element, and if not included in the sequel, there would be a dramatic loss of personality. He claimed that much of Rapture's personality comes from Ryan, and it would have <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> an impact without him. Editor Ryan Geddes agreed, adding that he felt there was more to Ryan than Rapture. Editor Nate Ahem suggested that the game's sequel, BioShock 2, could potentially put the players in the role of Ryan, to explore the story of trying to create a perfect world and having it crumble beneath their feet.|$|E
25|$|When Jakov Jaša Tomić {{was born}} at Vršac in 1856, this town {{was part of the}} Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar crown land in the post-1849 Habsburg monarchy. Tomić's family, Serbian Orthodox Christian, was well-to-do having thrived {{significantly}} in trade in the region. He attended elementary school in Vršac, then gymnasium in Timişoara and Kecskemét. He was a volunteer in the Herzegovina Uprising, after which he attended medical faculties in Vienna and Prague, but later transferred to the faculty of philosophy and philology. Thereafter, Tomić was involved in Serb politics in Habsburg-controlled parts of present-day Serbia (Serbian Vojvodina). Combining interests in socialism and Serbian national politics as did many of his generation, namely Svetozar Marković, Mihailo Polit-Desančić, and Nikola Pašić, he eventually found himself <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a socialist than an ardent Serbian patriot.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, {{he founded}} the Reform Party and won their presidential {{nomination}} for the 1996 election. His vice presidential running mate was Pat Choate. Because of the ballot access laws, he had to run as an Independent on many state ballots. Perot received 8% {{of the popular vote}} in 1996, much less than in the 1992 race, but still an unusually successful third-party showing by U.S. standards. He spent <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> his own money in this race than he had four years before, and also allowed other people to contribute to his campaign, unlike his prior race. One common explanation for the decline was Perot's exclusion from the presidential debates, based on the preferences of the Democratic and Republican party candidates. Jamin B. Raskin of Open Debates filed a lawsuit on Perot's behalf on this assumption.|$|E
25|$|While most chloroplasts {{originate}} from that {{first set of}} endosymbiotic events, Paulinella chromatophora is an exception that acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently. It {{is not clear whether}} that symbiont is closely related to the ancestral chloroplast of other eukaryotes. Being {{in the early stages of}} endosymbiosis, Paulinella chromatophora can offer some insights into how chloroplasts evolved. Paulinella cells contain one or two sausage shaped blue-green photosynthesizing structures called chromatophores, descended from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus. Chromatophores cannot survive outside their host. Chromatophore DNA is about a million base pairs long, containing around 850 protein encoding genes—far less than the three million base pair Synechococcus genome, but much larger than the approximately 150,000 base pair genome of the more assimilated chloroplast. Chromatophores have transferred <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> their DNA to the nucleus of their host. About 0.3–0.8% of the nuclear DNA in Paulinella is from the chromatophore, compared with 11–14% from the chloroplast in plants.|$|E

The Z-saber was also redesigned in Zero 3, and has a more triangular shape compared to the original Z-saber, which is similar to a katana and the Z-buster was replaced with a handgun. Early concept art featured Zero with solid-black, pupil-less eyes, though this changed to a normal set of eyes as development progressed.|$|E

Hostilities in the Middle East which interrupted traffic through the Suez Canal contributed, as did nationalization of Middle East oil refineries. Fierce competition among shipowners also played a part. But apart from these considerations is a simple economic advantage: the larger an oil tanker is, the more cheaply it can move crude oil, and the better it can help meet growing demands for oil.|$|E
500|$|As redistributions alter an electorate's {{area and}} {{demographic}} profile, the 2006 Census {{conducted by the}} Australian Bureau of Statistics on the boundaries prior to the redistribution is {{the main source of}} information on the electorate's current profile.

Only 36% were married compared to 49% across Perth, whilst only 47.7% of homes (compared to 67.2%) were fully owned or being purchased. The median income in the electorate was $606 compared with $513, and 49.5% of the electorate's workers were professionals or managers compared with 31.8%.|$|E
500|$|The social {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem {{wrote in}} Psychological Review that Bell et al. {{provide the most}} important data concerning [...] "experience-based theories" [...] {{of the development of}} sexual orientation, including [...] "the classical psychoanalytic account", as well as views that attribute the origins of sexual orientation to learning, conditioning, seduction, or labeling. According to Bem, their finding that [...] "no family variables" [...] are [...] "strongly implicated in the development of sexual orientation for either men or women" [...] is [...] "consistent with accumulating evidence that family variables account for <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> the environmental variance in personality than previously thought". Bem proposed a hypothesis that he refers to as [...] "Exotic becomes erotic": children feel different from either their same-sex peers or opposite-sex peers and therefore eroticize them, leading to homosexuality and heterosexuality respectively. Bem referred to Bell et al.′s finding that gay men and lesbians {{were significantly more likely to}} recall having felt different from same-sex children during the grade-school years, and to other studies that drew similar conclusions. Bem maintained that Bell′s view that people become erotically attracted to those who are different from them out of a [...] "quest for androgyny" [...] does not accurately characterize or explain the data, and rejected Bell et al.′s conclusion that sexual orientation is innate.|$|E

500|$|HenryIII often held {{court at}} the Tower of London, and held {{parliament}} there {{on at least}} two occasions (1236 and 1261) when he felt that the barons were becoming dangerously unruly. In 1258, the discontented barons, led by Simon de Montfort, forced the King to agree to reforms including the holding of regular parliaments. Relinquishing the Tower of London was among the conditions. HenryIII resented losing power and sought permission from the pope to break his oath. With the backing of mercenaries, Henry installed himself in the Tower in 1261. While negotiations continued with the barons, the King ensconced himself in the castle, although no army moved to take it. A truce was agreed with the condition that the King hand over control of the Tower once again. Henry won a significant victory at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, allowing him to regain control of the country and the Tower of London. Cardinal Ottobuon came to England to excommunicate those who were still rebellious; the act was deeply unpopular and the situation was exacerbated when the cardinal was granted custody of the Tower. Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, marched on London in April 1267 and laid siege to the castle, declaring that custody of the Tower was [...] "not a post to be trusted {{in the hands of a}} foreigner, <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> an ecclesiastic". Despite a large army and siege engines, Gilbert de Clare was unable to take the castle.

[...] Gooch was replaced as captain for the remainder of the series by Allan Lamb (himself South African-born), who lost both of his matches in charge. Gooch went on to captain England the following summer against New Zealand and India at home, remaining in that position almost exclusively until 1993 and bringing England a degree of success that they had not experienced for almost a decade, at least at home: the 1991 home series against the West Indies, in fact, was a hard-fought 2-2 draw, and England reached the World Cup final for the second successive time the following winter (which was <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a surprise - even when their Test record was at its worst, England were one of the leading one-day sides of the time, often winning the one-day series even when a Test series was lost, including both the otherwise disastrous 1988 and 1989 summers.) For much of this period, he was also rated as one of the world's leading batsmen. Away from home, though, England were not so strong, losing heavily to Australia in 1990-1 and to India and Sri Lanka in 1992-3, though these were either side of a series victory in New Zealand.|$|E
