25|$|The Yamal baby mammoth Lyuba, {{found in}} 2007 in the Yamal Peninsula in Western Siberia, {{suggests}} that baby mammoths, as do modern baby elephants, ate the dung of adult animals. The {{evidence to show}} {{this is that the}} dentition (teeth) of the baby mammoth had not yet fully developed to chew grass. Furthermore, there was an abundance of ascospores of coprophilous fungi from the pollen spectrum of the baby's mother. Coprophilous fungi are fungi that grow on animal dung and disperse spores in nearby vegetation, which the baby mammoth would then consume. Spores <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> into its stomach while grazing for the first few times. Coprophagy may be an adaptation, serving to populate the infant's gut with the needed microbiome for digestion.|$|E

2500|$|Amsterdam and Rotterdam {{operated}} {{as important}} cosmopolitan centres where merchant ships from {{many parts of}} the world brought people of various customs and beliefs. This flourishing commercial activity encouraged a culture relatively tolerant of the play of new ideas, to a considerable degree sheltered from the censorious hand of ecclesiastical authority (though those considered to have gone [...] "too far" [...] <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> [...] persecuted even in the Netherlands). Not by chance were the philosophical works of both Descartes and Spinoza developed in the cultural and intellectual background of the Dutch Republic in the 17th century. Spinoza may have had access to a circle of friends who were unconventional in terms of social tradition, including members of the Collegiants. One of the people he knew was Niels Stensen, a brilliant Danish student in Leiden; others included Albert Burgh, with whom Spinoza is known to have corresponded.|$|E
2500|$|Mays {{began his}} major league career on a sour note, with no hits {{in his first}} 12 at bats. On his 13th at-bat, however, he hit a towering home run over the left field roof of the Polo Grounds off of future Hall of Famer Warren Spahn. Spahn later joked, [...] "I'll never forgive myself. We <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> rid of Willie forever if I'd only struck him out." [...] Mays' batting average {{improved}} steadily {{throughout the rest of}} the season. Although his [...]274 average, 68 RBI and 20 homers (in 121 games) were among the lowest of his career, he still won the 1951 Rookie of the Year Award. During the Giants' comeback in August and September 1951 to tie the Dodgers in the pennant race, Mays' fielding and strong throwing arm were instrumental to several important Giants victories. Mays was in the on-deck circle when Bobby Thomson hit the Shot Heard 'Round the World against Ralph Branca and the Brooklyn Dodgers to win the three-game playoff 2-1 after the teams were tied at the end of the regular season.|$|E
2500|$|Jefferson's biographer Dumas Malone {{argued that}} the Kentucky {{resolution}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> Jefferson impeached for treason, had his actions become known at the time. [...] In writing the Kentucky Resolutions, Jefferson warned that, [...] "unless arrested at the threshold", the Alien and Sedition Acts would [...] "necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood." [...] Historian Ron Chernow says of this [...] "he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government {{of which he was}} vice president." [...] Jefferson [...] "thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution." [...] Chernow argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts themselves. [...] Historian Garry Wills argued [...] "Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [...] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure" [...] The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was [...] "deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion". George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if [...] "systematically and pertinaciously pursued", they would [...] "dissolve the union or produce coercion". [...] The influence of Jefferson's doctrine of states' rights reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond. Future president James Garfield, {{at the close of the}} Civil War, said that Jefferson's Kentucky Resolution [...] "contained the germ of nullification and secession, and we are today reaping the fruits".|$|E

2500|$|Writing in The Sunday Times in 2008, Dan Cairns had suggested: [...] "many {{consider}} {{him to be}} one of the greatest bass players of all time." [...] Steve Anderson, writing in The Independent said [...] ".. he became one of the most famous and influential bass players in rock." [...] Roger Waters of Pink Floyd recently described Bruce as [...] "probably the most musically gifted bass player who's ever been." [...] Eric Clapton posted on Facebook about Bruce [...] "He was a great musician and composer, and a tremendous inspiration to me" [...] and composed an acoustic song in his honour and Ginger Baker wrote [...] "I am very sad to learn of the loss of a fine man, Jack Bruce...

[...] Guitarist Leslie West, of rock group Mountain, posted on Facebook, [...] "It is with great sadness that one of the worlds greatest musicians and bass players, who I had the honor of playing with in West Bruce and Laing, Jack Bruce has died. I was hoping somehow that we <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> together one last time. Rest in Peace my friend." [...] Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi said on Twitter that Bruce had been his favourite bass player, saying [...] "He was a hero to so many" [...] and Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler regarded him as his [...] "biggest influence and favourite bass player". Guitarist John McLaughlin said on Twitter, [...] "Very sad to have lost my old friend Jack Bruce." [...] Long-standing collaborator Robin Trower wrote on Facebook, [...] "It has always been a great source of pride to me to have made music with Jack (one of the few musicians that can be truly called a force of nature) and Jack and I were proud of that music. He will be greatly missed". Fellow bassist Billy Cox also posted a tribute to Bruce on Facebook. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick said, [...] "There was a time when Jack Bruce was synonymous with the bass guitar in rock history, when he was widely revered as the best there was on four strings." [...] Rush bassist and singer Geddy Lee wrote: “The sudden passing of Jack Bruce is terribly sad news. One of the greatest rock bassists to ever live and a true and profound inspiration to countless musicians. He was one of my first bass heroes and was a major influence on my playing and my music. My heartfelt condolences to his family and fans.” In March 2015, a tribute concert at London's Roundhouse scheduled for October 2015 was announced. Guest artists confirmed were, Joss Stone, Phil Manzanera, Ginger Baker, Ian Anderson and Mark King and musical director Nitin Sawhney.|$|E
