5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with <b>major</b> <b>events</b> in fungal evolution.|$|E

The original capacity was 65,000 but {{this had to be}} reduced in later years to 53,000 for safety reasons. 11,000 of these were on the East Terrace and the conversion to all-seater stadium would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to 47,500. This capacity would have been much less than Twickenham and the other major rugby venues and also less than the demand for tickets to <b>major</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E

The player can pursue other girls once they have finished one of the sisters' storylines.|$|E

40|$|This {{white paper}} proposes {{defining}} a <b>major</b> <b>event</b> day in distribution reliability {{in terms of}} average frequency of occurrence. This definition {{is easy to understand}} for non-technical people like regulators, seems to be fair to apply to systems of any size, and can be translated into a <b>major</b> <b>event</b> threshold {{that can be used to}} classify individual days. An example of this classification is given and practical issues such as the type of probability distribution to use, how to handle zero-outage days, and calculating normal annual reliability with <b>major</b> <b>event</b> days removed are discussed and resolved. II. <b>Major</b> <b>Event</b> Day Classification The problem of equitably classifying operating days into normal days and <b>major</b> <b>event</b> days on the basis of distribution reliability is one that is becoming more important as regulators increase scrutiny of, and impose limits on, operating reliability. A method is needed that is based on solid theoretical ground, is equitable when applied to distribution utilities with different sizes and operating territories (and hence different reliability levels), is robust, and is practical for practicing utility engineers to implement. This section starts with some definitions, discusses current methods of classifying days, an...|$|R
