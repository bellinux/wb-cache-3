5|$|Bruchus rufimanus, {{commonly}} known as the broad bean weevil, broad bean beetle, or broad bean seed beetle is a weevil which inhabits crops and fields, as well as some homes.

5|$|Burton filmed all the {{dramatic}} hospital scenes {{and most of}} those involving Finney first, before <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> to the McGregor section of Bloom's life. Although McGregor was on set from the beginning of filming, Burton chose to shoot all Finney's scenes first. Location filming in Alabama was delayed by inclement weather; during the Calloway circus scenes filming, a tornado watch was issued and flooding on the set interrupted filming for several weeks. Despite the delays, Burton delivered the film on budget and on schedule.|$|E

5|$|Conquest, the single-player tournament career mode, pits the player's team {{against the}} ranked {{hierarchy}} {{en route to}} the championship. Up to three additional human players can join in the single-player. Players initially choose between four teams, though 13 total are unlockable. Teams begin with four players with no alternates for substitution, and fight their way from fourth place in the Rookie Division to first place against each team in between. Players can continue to take challenges within the division before irrevocably <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> to the next division.|$|E

5|$|His films also {{typically}} {{end with}} a death, which is portrayed not as a tragedy, but as a happy <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> where the deceased looks down happily at the world below. Between Heaven and Earth ends with a birth, but it is similarly handled the passing of a character into a new world. This pattern is continued in Mr. Nobody, where two deaths open the film and a unique twist on death {{at the end of}} the film conveys a wistful sense of happiness.|$|E

5|$|Lyapunov exponents use {{logarithms}} {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E
