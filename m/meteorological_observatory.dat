5|$|On September13, 1934, a {{tropical}} cyclone {{developed over the}} western Caroline Islands. The storm traveled generally northwest, executing a brief cyclonic loop on September14–15. After a brief stint traveling nearly due north on September17, the cyclone began recurving to the northeast. It brushed the Ryukyu Islands to the southeast on September20 as it accelerated northeast. On the morning of September21, the typhoon struck Shikoku and southern Honshu. According to the Central <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Observatory</b> (now called the Japan Meteorological Agency), maximum sustained winds reached 150km/h (90mph), with gusts exceeding 215km/h (130mph).|$|E
5|$|The Toronto Magnetic and <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Observatory</b> is a {{historical}} observatory located {{on the grounds of}} the University of Toronto, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The original building was constructed in 1840 as part of a worldwide research project run by Edward Sabine to determine the cause of fluctuations in magnetic declination. Measurements from the Toronto site demonstrated that sunspots were responsible for this effect on Earth's magnetic field. When this project concluded in 1853, the observatory was greatly expanded by the Canadian government and served as the country's primary meteorological station and official timekeeper for over fifty years. The observatory is considered the birthplace of Canadian astronomy.|$|E

In the summer of 1881, Clement Lindley Wragge climbed the mountain daily to make observations (earning him the nickname [...] "Inclement Rag"), leading to the opening on 17 October 1883 of a permanent observatory run by the SMS. The building was manned full-time until 1904, when it was closed due to inadequate government funding. The twenty years worth of readings still provide the most comprehensive set of data on mountain weather in Great Britain.|$|E
500|$|While {{moving across}} New England, Gloria was a {{weakened}} hurricane that passed {{quickly through the}} area. Though still a large hurricane, Gloria hit at low tide, resulting in low to moderate storm surges of 5 feet (1.5 m) in Groton, Connecticut, 6 feet (1.8 m) in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and 3 feet (1 m) in Portland, Maine. The high waves caused heavy beach erosion in Connecticut and Rhode Island. The highest sustained winds were reports of 83 mph (135 km/h) in Waterbury, Connecticut, and Blue Hill <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Observatory</b> in Massachusetts, although neither location is at sea level. Gusts peaked at 110 mph (176 km/h) in Chatham, Massachusetts, and widespread areas across New England reported hurricane-force gusts.

[...] He established a network of observation sites and developed the first method to forecast tropical cyclone movement, with the oldest known forecast made for a hurricane in late August 1873. He would give track details days in advance, based upon clouds which progress well in advance of hurricanes. His {{hurricane warning}} service in Cuba continued until his death on July 23, 1893. Within the United States, the public was dissatisfied with the Signal Corp forecasts after the Hurricane of 1875. The immediate response by the Signal Corp was the creation of the hurricane warning flag, a pair of red flags ten by eight feet each in size, inset with black rectangles. Beginning on October 1, 1875, hurricane warning flags were hoisted in areas where hurricane warnings were in effect, and illuminated at night.|$|E
500|$|The Mont Blanc massif has {{provided}} numerous opportunities for academic research, {{dating back to}} the very first ascent of Mont Blanc in 1786 during which Michel Paccard carried scientific equipment to confirm it as the highest summit. In 1820, an ill-fated expedition led by Dr Hamel included pigeons intended for release at varying altitudes to measure the impact of reduced air density on their ability to fly. In 1890, Joseph Vallot built a small <b>meteorological</b> <b>observatory</b> at approximately [...] between the Dôme du Goûter and Mont Blanc's summit from where numerous measurements and scientific experiments were conducted.

A [...] telescope and a spectrograph for measuring the oxygen content of the sun were installed. The observatory was removed when it started to collapse around 1906.|$|E
