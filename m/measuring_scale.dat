But when once you fully understand the principle, and see how all colors contain as it were a certain quantity of darkness, or power of dark relief from white--some more, some less; and how this pitch or power of each may be represented by equivalent values of gray, you will soon be able to arrive shrewdly at an approximation by a glance of the eye, without any <b>measuring</b> <b>scale</b> at all.|$|E

50|$|A major {{attraction}} of Lecher lines {{was they were}} a way to measure frequency without complicated electronics, and could be improvised from simple materials found in a typical shop. Lecher line wavemeters are usually built on a frame which holds the conductors rigid and horizontal, with a track that the shorting bar or indicator rides on, and a built-in <b>measuring</b> <b>scale</b> so the distance between nodes can be read out. The frame must be made of a nonconductive material like wood, because any conducting objects near the line can disturb the standing wave pattern. The RF current is usually coupled into the line through a single turn loop of wire at one end, which can be held near a transmitter's tank coil.|$|E

This device did not have a vision block of its own (reducing the total number to 4), yet it gave a x5 magnification. A distance <b>measuring</b> <b>scale</b> was added on the lenses, it could reveal the approximate distance of a 2.7 meter tall target (an average NATO tank) at ranges up to 3000 meters.
