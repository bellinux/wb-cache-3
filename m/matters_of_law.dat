5|$|The Stewart dynasty, {{founded by}} King Robert II in 1371, {{was defined by}} the growing {{authority}} {{and power of the}} Scottish Kings in <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and the development of existing legal institutions. In 1469, the parliament of Scotland affirmed the ultimate authority of James III and rejected the authority of imperial notaries in Scottish civil matters. The recognition of the sovereign authority of the Scottish Kings was connected to the influence of the common law in Scots law. Customary laws, such as the Law of Clan MacDuff, came under attack from the Stewart Dynasty, which consequently extended the reach of Scots common law.|$|E
500|$|The law {{dealing with}} seditious libel was {{particularly}} strict. Acting as [...] "the government's chief weapon against criticism", it followed principles {{laid down in}} De Libellis Famosis and R v Carr: that seditious libel was a criminal offence, that {{the intention of the}} publisher or the truth of the allegations was irrelevant, that mere publication was sufficient for a conviction, and that juries were only allowed to deliver a verdict on whether the material had been published by the defendant, not whether it was libellous. Traditionally, matters of fact were left to the jury and <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> to the judge, but with seditious libel [...] "matters of law" [...] was construed very widely; it was the judge's job to decide if the material was libellous, what constituted [...] "seditious libel", and the nature of [...] "publication", which was understood to include almost anything. Even a private letter, if intercepted, could lead to a prosecution.|$|E
500|$|On 18 May 1671, Hale {{was made}} Chief Justice of the King's Bench {{after the death}} of John Kelynge. Edward Turnour {{replaced}} him as Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Hale was not noted as a particularly innovative judge, but took pains to ensure that his decisions were easy to understand and informative. Roger North wrote that [...] "I have known the Court of King's Bench sitting every day from eight to 12, and the Lord Chief Justice Hale's managing <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> to all imaginable advantage to the students, and in that he took a pleasure or rather pride; he encouraged arguing when it was to the purpose, and used to debate with counsel, so that the court might have been taken for an academy of sciences as well as the seat of justice". He was noted for allowing counsel to fix any problems with pleadings, and for letting them correct him if he made an error in his summing up. He disliked eloquence, writing that [...] "If the judge or jury has a right understanding it signifies nothing but {{a waste of time and}} loss of words, and if they are weak, and easily wrought upon, it is a more decent way of corrupting them by bribing their fancies and biassing their affections." [...] As a judge, however, he was noted by Lord Nottingham as the greatest orator on the bench.|$|E

2500|$|In retrospect historians {{debate whether}} {{the impact of}} {{continued}} blockade, relentless bombing, and the Russian invasion of Manchuria would have somehow forced the Emperor to surrender sometime in late 1945 or early 1946 even without the atomic bombs (though not without very large numbers of allied casualties). Stimson looked beyond the immediate end of the war. He was the only top government official who tried to predict {{the meaning of the}} atomic age—he envisioned a new era in human affairs. For a half century he had worked to inject order, science, and moralism into <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> of state, and of diplomacy. The impact of the atom bomb, he thought, would go far beyond military concerns to encompass diplomacy and world affairs, as well as business, economics and science. Above all, said Stimson, this [...] "most terrible weapon ever known in human history" [...] opened up [...] "the opportunity to bring the world into a pattern in which the peace of the world and our civilization can be saved." [...] That is, the very destructiveness of the new weaponry would shatter the ages-old belief that wars could be advantageous. It might now be possible to call a halt to the use of destruction as a ready solution to human conflicts. Indeed, society's new control over the most elemental forces of nature finally [...] "caps the climax of the race between man's growing technical power for destructiveness and his psychological power of self-control and group control--his moral power." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Italy, a Civil law jurisdiction, untrained {{judges are}} present {{only in the}} Corte d'Assise, where two career magistrates are {{supported}} by six so-called Lay Judges, who are raffled from the registrar of voters. Any Italian citizen, with no distinction of sex or religion, between 30 and 65 years of age, can be appointed as a lay judge; {{in order to be}} eligible as a lay judge for the Corte d'Assise, however, there is a minimum educational requirement, as the lay judge must have completed his/her education at the Scuola Media (junior high school) level, while said level is raised for the Corte d'Assise d'Appello (appeal level of the Corte d'Assise) to the Scuola Superiore (senior high school) degree. In the Corte d'Assise, decisions concerning both fact and law matters are taken by the stipendiary judges and [...] "Lay Judges" [...] together at a special meeting behind closed doors, named Camera di Consiglio ("Counsel Chamber"), and the Court is subsequently required to publish written explanations of its decisions within 90 days from the verdict. Errors of law or inconsistencies in the explanation of a decision can and usually will lead to the annulment of the decision. A Court d'Assise and a Court d' Assise d'Appello decides on a majority of votes, and therefore predominantly on the votes of the lay judges, who are a majority of six to two, but in fact [...] lay judges, who are not trained to write such explanation and must rely on one or the other stipendiary judge to do it, are effectively prevented from overruling both of them. [...] The Corte d'Assise has jurisdiction to try crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or life imprisonment, and other serious crimes; felonies that fall under its jurisdiction include terrorism, murder, manslaughter, severe attempts against State personalities, as well as some <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> requiring ethical and professional evaluations (ex. assisted suicide), while it generally has no jurisdiction over cases whose evaluation requires knowledge of Law which the [...] "Lay Judges" [...] generally don't have.

60|$|It must {{be remembered}} that a modern Utopia must differ from the Utopias of any {{preceding}} age in being world-wide; it is not, therefore, to be the development of any special race or type of culture, as Plato's developed an Athenian-Spartan blend, or More, Tudor England. The modern Utopia is to be, before all things, synthetic. Politically and socially, as linguistically, we must suppose it a synthesis; politically {{it will be a}} synthesis of once widely different forms of government; socially and morally, a synthesis of a great variety of domestic traditions and ethical habits. Into the modern Utopia there must have entered the mental tendencies and origins that give our own world the polygamy of the Zulus and of Utah, the polyandry of Tibet, the latitudes of experiment permitted in the United States, and the divorceless wedlock of Comte. The tendency of all synthetic processes in <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and custom is to reduce and simplify the compulsory canon, to admit alternatives and freedoms; what were laws before become traditions of feeling and style, and in no matter will this be more apparent than in questions affecting the relations of the sexes.|$|E

[...] The answer is simple. That a woman's intellect is eminently fitted for business is proved by the enormous amount of business she gets through without any special training for it: but those faults in a woman of which some men complain are simply the results of her not having had a special training. She does not know the laws of business.
