One can imagine a man with a name like that writing a book about farming, having theories on this subject. But in the ordinary course of nature things would not grow for him. He does not look like a farmer. One cannot say precisely what it is, but there is that about a farmer that tells you he is a farmer. The farmer has a way of leaning over a gate. There are not many ways of leaning over a gate. I have tried all I could think of, but it was never quite the right way. It has to be in the blood. A farmer has a way of standing on one leg and looking at a thing that isn't there. It sounds simple, but there is knack in it. The farmer is not surprised it is not there. He never expected it to be there. It {{is one of those things}} that ought to be, and is not. The farmer's life is full of such. Suffering reduced to a science is what the farmer stands for. All his life he is the good man struggling against adversity. Nothing his way comes right. This does not seem to be his planet. Providence means well, but she does not understand farming. She is doing her best, he supposes; that she is a born <b>muddler</b> is not her fault. If Providence could only step down for a month or two and take a few lessons in practical farming, things might be better; but this being out of the question there is nothing more to be said. From conversation with farmers one conjures up a picture of Providence as a well-intentioned amateur, put into a position for which she is utterly unsuited.|$|E

50|$|There are {{limitless}} {{material and}} colour variations, however {{the essence of}} the <b>Muddler</b> Minnow is a spun deer hair head. While each <b>Muddler</b> may differ in colour or profile, all true Muddlers have a fore-end or body of spun deer hair that is clipped close to the shank to provide a buoyant head. Typically there is an underwing of squirrel hair and a wing of mottled secondary turkey feather. Often the fly body is made of gold/silver Mylar or tinsel wrapped around the hook shank. Marabou may be tied in as a substitute wing for colour and lifelike movement through the water. The head may be weighted or unweighted, according to the style of fishing, the target species and the intended imitation. The <b>muddler</b> has served for the basis of several patterns, including the Spuddler, <b>Muddler</b> Hopper, Mizzoulian Spook, Searcy <b>Muddler,</b> Keel <b>Muddler,</b> and so on, but even in its simplest and original form, it remains a very effective fly.|$|E
5000|$|Effective {{retrieval}} tactics include {{stripping the}} floating <b>Muddler</b> {{across the water}} surface rhythmically, imparting a [...] "wake", or allowing the <b>Muddler</b> to sink and twitching or pulsating it against or across a river's current. An unweighted <b>Muddler</b> will float and appears as a hopper, moth or struggling mouse. With a tiny piece of split shot {{in front of it}} (or an intermediate flyline) the <b>Muddler</b> can be made to swim slowly over weedbeds and shallow gravel bars. With more weight, the <b>Muddler</b> can be stripped wildly in the shallows to imitate and alarmed baitfish, or allowed to settle in deeper water. When weighted—either on the fly itself, with split shot, or a sinking leader or line—the <b>Muddler</b> my be fished right on the bottom to effectively imitate a sculpin. When imitating sculpins, Muddlers must be kept right on the bottom and fished slowly, with occasional fast strips of maybe a foot to a yard, as if trying to escape a predator.|$|E

All the books and pictures, even the chairs and tables, had belonged to him, or had reference to him; even the china dogs on the mantelpiece and the little shepherdesses with their sheep had been bought by him for a penny a piece from a man who used to stand with a tray of toys in Kensington High Street, as Katharine had often heard her mother tell. Often she had sat in this room, with her mind fixed so firmly on those vanished figures that she could almost see the muscles round their eyes and lips, and had given to each his own voice, with its tricks of accent, and his coat and his cravat. Often she had seemed to herself to be moving among them, an invisible ghost among the living, better acquainted with them than with her own friends, because she knew their secrets and possessed a divine foreknowledge of their destiny.
