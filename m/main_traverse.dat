2500|$|Before North Carolina and Montana {{were laid}} down, the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) made some minor design changes {{in light of}} {{experience}} gained from the Russo-Japanese War. Their <b>main</b> <b>traverse</b> bulkheads remained unpierced below the armored deck and some armor was rearranged. Armor on the barbettes was increased [...] on exposed surfaces. Deck armor over the magazines was thickened from [...] to [...] over the magazines; {{to make up for}} this weight, side armor abeam was reduced slightly. The magazines were rearranged to allow 20 percent additional 10-inch and 6-inch ammunition without sacrificing coal capacity. Rearranging the berth and gun decks amidships increased coal capacity by 200 tons. Coal bunkers were also modified to allow trimming directly from the upper bunkers to the fire rooms, which was considered potentially advantageous in battle. Throughout this review process, the Bureau sought to save weight whenever possible. For example, cellulose was omitted as water-excluding material as its utility after being packed a number a years had come into question.|$|E

40|$|The {{tropical}} soils systems {{cover more}} than 1 / 3 of the emerged earth. The {{knowledge of the}} shallow structures is crucial for the understanding of global pedological functioning of soils. Multifrequency radar and pole-pole multi-electrode DC resistivity surveys were conducted here along the 950 meters long <b>main</b> <b>traverse</b> of Nsimi watershed to delineate the main pedological horizons. The results of pole-pole survey are interpreted using RES 2 DINV software, which allows a rapid 2 -D inversion. The resulting image shows the main structures from shallow depth to more than 80 meters deep. Features like major fault, bedrock topography or altered zones are clearly defined. In order to image the shallower part of the section, the radar and a more detailed electrical section are presented together and compared to dense pedological observations available on this traverse. In the first ten meters, the main radar reflectors at 25 MHz and iso-resistivity curves correlate themselves. This allows to give precise indications to the pedologist who can locate more accurately observation pits or borehole investigations {{as well as to}} give precise geometrical limits to pedo-hydrogeologic models.
