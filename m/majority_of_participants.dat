5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E

25|$|The King's South Africa Medal {{was awarded}} {{only to those}} troops who fought in 1902, and who had served for 18 months. Even with {{continuous}} service, the recipient {{would have had to}} have served from 1 December 1900 to have 18 months service before the war ended on 31 May 1902. Service therefore had to have commenced before the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901 and, as a result, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> qualified for the award of the Queen's South Africa Medal only.|$|E
25|$|In June 2002 and February 2003 the Lithuanian Parliament amended Lithuania's laws on {{referendum}}s. Previously, for {{a referendum}} to pass, 50% {{of the voters}} had to vote and over 50% of all eligible registered voters had to support the proposal. After the amendment only a simple <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> in favour was required for the referendum to pass, while still having the requirement for turnout to be over 50%. To help reach the turnout requirement, the voting hours were extended, postal voting was allowed for 11 days before the referendum, and a second voting day was added. Parliament then set the date for EU referendum to be the 10–11 May and set the question for the vote.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} their many functions, WUB have in many cases limited {{capacity}}. PSI carried out a study of their capacity during the first phase, in the coast, where {{the state of the}} art irrigation practices are found. The study established that only 65% of them have acceptable water management. As a result, PSI held training and capacity building programs and found that the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> were male. However, women do most of the agriculture work in rural areas as a result of male migration to the cities. Nevertheless, their representation in WUB is limited. Furthermore, in the board, most times they hold non relevant positions or their presence is nominal.|$|E

25|$|In the prisoner's dilemma with {{third party}} punishment, {{two of the}} {{participants}} play a prisoner's dilemma, in which each must choose to either cooperate or defect. The game is set up such that {{regardless of what the}} other player does, it is rational for an income maxizer to always choose to defect, even though both players cooperating yields a higher payoff than both players defecting. A third player observes this exchange, then can pay to punish either player. An income maximizing third parties' rational response would be to not punish, and income maximizing players would choose to defect. A 2004 study demonstrates that a near <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> (46%) are willing to pay to punish if one participant defects. If both parties defect, 21% are still willing to punish.|$|E
25|$|Whether people {{naturally}} {{adhere to}} an incompatibilist model {{of free will}} has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive – it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality). Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive – it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general. Joshua Knobe and Shaun Nichols have proposed that incompatibilism {{may or may not}} be intuitive, and that it is dependent to some large degree upon the circumstances; whether or not the crime incites an emotional response – for example if it involves harming another human being. They found that belief in free will is a cultural universal, and that the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> said that (a) our universe is indeterministic and (b) moral responsibility is not compatible with determinism.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{effectiveness}} of the small farmer outreach training and technical assistance programs as related to farmers of color. The items to be evaluated included financial considerations, educational effectiveness, access and acquisition of farm loans, participation in Extension sponsored events and involvement in community activities. The sample population for this study was small scale agricultural producers representing two ethnic groups, African Americans and Hispanics, located in Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr and Willacy counties and enrolled in the Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical Assistance Program (N= 68) between October 1, 2001, and September 30, 2004. Descriptive statistics were used for reporting personal characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>participants,</b> as well as to determine knowledge gained and effectiveness of the Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical Assistance Program. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences???? (SPSS) was used to calculate frequencies, percentages and variability of the variables. The major findings of the study were as follows: 1. The Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical Assistance Program is an effective educational program in teaching farm management techniques and assisting with the acquisition of financial resources. 2. Farm size was relatively small with over half of the farms being fewer than 50 acres. 3. The ethnic identity <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> was more likely to be Hispanic than African American. 4. Total household income for a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> was less than $ 50, 000. 5. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> were part-time farmers. 6.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the inter-participant {{agreement in the}} selection of symptoms for the description of seizure types. METHODS: We evaluated the inter-participant agreement for a number of seizure types by comparing the actual agreement to the agreement that would result from random symptom selection as well as the maximal attainable agreement among participants that selected a different number of symptoms. RESULTS: For all seizure types the agreement in the symptom selection among the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> is significantly higher than expected by chance, but not reaching the maximum agreement attainable. CONCLUSION: Although the maximum agreement possible is not obtained, the symptoms selected by a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> seem to be adequate for the description of seizure type...|$|R
2500|$|During summer 2003 {{a survey}} {{commissioned}} by Peter Strieder, Berlin's Senator for City Development and Traffic, and Deutsche Bahn director Hartmut Mehdorn was conducted among Berlin residents {{with the intention}} of selecting a name for the station. Of the three possibilities listed on the survey, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> opted for Lehrter Bahnhof; nevertheless, the station remained [...] "Berlin Hauptbahnhof – Lehrter Bahnhof", an option that was not listed. It was decided early in 2005 that the station would be renamed [...] "Berlin Hauptbahnhof" [...] on the date of its opening, 28 May 2006, to avoid confusing rail passengers. On the same day, Berlin Papestraße station, which was rebuilt as the city's second-largest station, opened officially under its new name, Berlin Südkreuz (South Cross), similar to the existing Ostkreuz and Westkreuz stations. It is also on the new north-south route. Although it was intended to open a further station as Berlin-Nordkreuz (North Cross), the name Berlin-Gesundbrunnen was retained for what became Berlin's fourth biggest railway station for commuter and long distance trains, located in a more northern part of Berlin, where the circle and north-south-line of the S-Bahn cross each other.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The study {{employed}} {{a case study}} method to investigate the affective effectiveness of integrating language awareness into grammar teaching in the Chinese EFL (English as a Foreign Language) context. In the case study, fifty-eight participants were given language awareness teaching interventions. Questionnaires and interviews were developed, and administered for data collection. The findings of the case study have showed the potentials of language pedagogy in relation to its affective effectiveness in grammar classrooms in three aspects: a) a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> showed positive changes in their attitudes toward and beliefs in learning grammar; b) a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> are found to apply more cognitive-affective grammar learning strategies; and c) a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> responded to positively integrate their learning of grammar with four language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing). To conclude, the case study has {{shed light on the}} potential of integrating language awareness into grammar pedagogy in the Chinese EFL context as well as its future development in second/foreign Language teaching and learning.
