25|$|From 1960 to 1995, the northward equinox always fell {{at such a}} {{time that}} New Year's Day in Iran {{occurred}} on the day called 21 March in the Western calendar. But this equivalence was not always true before March 1960, and the exact correspondence broke down again in 1996. In 1959, and at four-year intervals back to 1927, Iranian New Year's Day fell on 22 March in the Gregorian calendar. In 1996, and subsequent Gregorian leap years, Iranian New Year's Day falls on 20 March. The pattern will shift back to a <b>matching</b> <b>set</b> of leap years in AD 2096.|$|E

500|$|... "Small Victories" [...] {{is split}} into two {{parallel}} storylines, and several space shots of the B story onboard Thor's spaceship were cut at the script stage to allot more money to the A story submarine scenes. [...] "Small Victories" [...] was originally written to set on a fishing trawler until the producers got access to a real Russian Foxtrot class submarine, which was brought from Vladivostok to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where Stargate SG-1 was filmed. Several scenes were filmed in {{and outside of the}} submarine for two days. A <b>matching</b> <b>set</b> with removable walls was built later on because only three film crew members could fit into the real 25-feet-wide submarine. To enhance the submarine's narrowness, Martin Wood lit the ship with the actors' helmet lights and chose an agitated shooting style, holding the shots tight and handholding some of the cameras himself. The logistics of the submarine filming proved difficult and time-consuming, since the computer-generated Replicators needed to appear on Daniel's playback monitors in advance of filming. One scripted scene in which a Replicator piece is removed from Teal'c's shoulder was trimmed on-set because the actors felt it to be redundant.|$|E

For example; in a challenge where the player must clear out a lounge of rich people, players can either sneak in a poorly dressed man into the party, or have another character flatulate into an air vent to clear everyone out. There are also rewards for completing side missions, discovering unique dolls, finding and stacking a <b>matching</b> <b>set</b> of dolls and performing [...] "Hi-jinks" [...] with certain dolls.

2500|$|Earlier {{examples}} of the component pieces existed, as is clear from documentary records and stray surviving pieces, but the toilet service as a large <b>matching</b> <b>set</b> of pieces seems to become common among the rich in the 17th century, and especially the France of Louis XIV. [...] Sets of ewers and basins such as the Lomellini Ewer and Basin were a staple of display plate well before this, but the many paintings of the Toilet of Venus, for example by Rubens, show that until about 1650 even goddesses used mirrors with wooden frames. [...] Although many were made, very few Louis XIV toilet services survive, and these are all ones that left France quickly, and escaped the very effective drives {{at the end of}} Louis's reign to get the nobility to donate their plate {{to help pay for the}} ruinous Nine Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession. [...] Exiled Huguenot silversmiths helped to spread French styles in England and elsewhere. [...] Once established, the characteristic types of pieces changed little, but their style followed general fashions in the decorative arts.|$|E

30|$|The {{subset of}} {{population}} rules that match the current input (RBN state) is termed the ‘match set’. The rules within the <b>match</b> <b>set</b> will suggest {{a number of}} actions. The fitness-weighted payoff of each action is used to select a single action to implement in the environment. The <b>match</b> <b>set</b> rules that suggest this single selected action form {{a subset of the}} <b>match</b> <b>set</b> called the ‘action set’. The action selected is then fed to an ‘effector’ that performs the desired actions within the environment. Information is then gathered on the payoff associated with the actions taken and the fitness of the rules within the rule collection is updated.|$|R

For instance, the automatic generation of lexical and syntactic analyzers using notations based on regular expressions and context-free grammars is commonly used (see e. g. [1]). However, much research is still going on in the field of universal code-generator generators, which take a description of a machine as input and deliver a (good) code generator for that machine.
