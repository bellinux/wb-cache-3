5000|$|On 1 April 1949, the United States Navy {{formally}} {{established a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> flight test section under Flight Test Order No. 2-49 whereby all tests and trials of <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft and associated equipment would be conducted under a <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> {{section of the}} Naval Air Test Center's flight test division. This <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> section {{was responsible for the}} scheduling of tests and development of criteria for reporting the test results for <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft types. This designation was maintained until April 4, 1975 when rotary test and evaluation was established as its own separate aircraft test directorate known as the [...] "Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate" [...] (RWATD). RWATD was then redesignated into the Rotary Wing aircraft Test Squadron (RWaTS) on July 21, 1995. RWaTS finally became Air Test and Evaluation Squardron TWO ONE on May 1, 2002 to better align with fleet squadron naming conventions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{design in}} micro-air-vehicle using {{flapping}} <b>rotary</b> <b>wings</b> with different wing spanwise length and area is proposed. With the wings flapping, produced thrust makes the wings rotation. Furthermore, lift force from <b>rotary</b> <b>wings</b> increases and overcomes the MAV weight. On {{the basis of}} this principle, a mechanical model is made and sample experiments of averaged lift measurement in different wing length and area and angle of attack are executed. It is shown that the maximum averaged lift produced by micro flapping <b>rotary</b> <b>wings</b> can reach to 80 mN approximately close to the weight of MAV...|$|R

Indicial response functions for both fixed <b>wing</b> and <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> applications are obtained using these finite state unsteady aerodynamic models. It is shown that the <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> indicial response function has a fundamentally different characteristic when compared to fixed wing indicial response. The <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> indicial response function is oscillatory in nature while the fixed wing indicial response function is nonoscillatory. Furthermore {{it should be emphasized}} {{that this is the first}} that a rotary-wing indicial response function has been presented in the literature...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{lightweight}} <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> UAVs for applications at extreme high altitudes of up to 9000 m, such as search and rescue as well as different types of environmental monitoring. Up to now, such <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> UAVs have not been available. Consequently, experience in design and operation of <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> UAVs in such environments is lacking. This situation motivates our team from DLR and TUM to work on an all-electric prototype {{of this kind of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> UAV. The first experimental missions should be performed at altitudes of 5000 to 9000 m above sea level. This paper shows the project’s current status and preliminary results. We present procedures for preliminary rotor designs and electrical power supplies as well as a tool developed for exploration of the influence of critical design parameters from a mission based point of view. Using the described procedures and the tool, we present the preliminary design of the UAV prototype, which is a synchropter with two counter-rotating and intermeshing rotors. Some of preliminary calculations were verified with flight experiments (hover performance) at different altitudes of up to 5200 m above sea level. The results presented, illustrate the feasibility of developing <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> UAVs for selected applications at extremely high altitudes and will be the cornerstone for a detailed design of the first prototype...|$|R
