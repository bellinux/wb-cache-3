After one year of exposure, the AWPA specified reten-tion of 321 kg/m 3 effectively prevented <b>marine</b> <b>borer</b> attack in Oregon estuaries, but several panels treated to 160 kg/m 3 suffered internal attack by shipworms (Bankia setacea).

40|$|Non-indigenous {{marine species}} {{are a major}} concern worldwide. For some species, {{insufficient}} historical and biogeographical data can leave their origin and patterns of dispersal difficult to determine. Among such species are <b>marine</b> wood <b>borers.</b> This thesis uses an interdisciplinary approach, combining both historical and biological methods, to address <b>marine</b> <b>borer</b> impacts, management attempts, and their status in New Zealand. This research had two key components. Firstly, a historical review sought to improve the understanding and awareness of the historic impacts and responses to borers, with particular reference to New Zealand between 1850 and 1930. <b>Marine</b> wood <b>borers</b> have had profound impacts throughout history, responsible for significant structural and economic damage to wooden ships and marine infrastructure globally. In New Zealand, trade and economy {{played an important role}} in providing both the transportation vectors and infrastructure for <b>marine</b> wood <b>borers</b> to inhabit. Ongoing trialling of timber alternatives and chemicals for the preservation of infrastructure followed, with little success until the introduction of ferro-concrete in the early 1900 s. When considered in a global context, the New Zealand case study of borer impacts and management attempts highlights their significant role in environmental history. Mitochondrial DNA (COI) sequence analyses were used to examine the questionable invasion histories and status of common <b>marine</b> wood <b>borers</b> in New Zealand. It has been assumed that many <b>marine</b> wood <b>borers</b> invaded New Zealand via wooden ships. However, these purported introductions are historic, and the specific origins of many species are unclear. Species from three families and two phyla were collected around the North Island, New Zealand; Teredinidae (Bivalvia: Mollusca), Sphaeromatidae and Limnoriidae (Isopoda: Arthropoda). Low levels of genetic divergence (0 - 2 %) were found among the New Zealand populations of two species, Limnoria quadripunctata and Sphaeroma quoianum, suggesting a non-indigenous status. Limnoria quadripunctata also showed a close genetic affinity to populations in Chile, supporting a non-indigenous status, with its widespread distribution in New Zealand explained by multiple introductions. For Lyrodus pedicellatus, a lack of genetic affinity to conspecifics sequenced elsewhere (France), greater genetic diversity compared to the native Bankia australis, and evidence of population structuring among New Zealand locations, suggested L. pedicellatus may be native to New Zealand. Lyrodus pedicellatus from New Zealand was highly divergent (> 20 %) from global L. pedicellatus populations, suggesting that either identifications of specimens on global databases are incorrect, or the New Zealand species represents a morphologically undescribed cryptic congener. In conclusion, COI sequences provided a useful tool in elucidating the status of <b>marine</b> wood <b>borers</b> in New Zealand, and highlighted a need for taxonomic resolution of some species. Collectively the two chapters illustrate the knowledge gaps and lack of recognition surrounding <b>marine</b> wood <b>borers,</b> globally and in New Zealand. This research provides an extensive understanding of their significant historical role in marine environmental history and assists in re-evaluation of their current native or non-indigenous status in New Zealand...|$|R

The full-cell process for 2 hours and 150 psi during the pressure-keeping period was employed. The IUFRO method was applied for the determination of wood treatability class. The treated and untreated wood specimens were tied together using plastic cord, arranged into a raft like assembly, and then exposed for 3, 6, and 12 months to the brackish water situated at Rambut Island 2 ̆ 7 s coastal area.

40|$|Traditional pile {{materials}} for bridge foundations include steel, concrete, and timber.

Problems associated with traditional pile materials used in harsh environments include concrete durability, steel corrosion, and <b>marine</b> <b>borer</b> attack or degradation of timber piles. High repair and replacement costs have led several North American highway agencies and researchers to investigate the feasibility of using FRP composite piles, such as concrete-filled tubular FRP piles.
