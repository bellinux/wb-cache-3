5000|$|In 1973, Elliot {{hired as}} her manager Allan Carr, {{who was also}} {{managing}} the careers of Tony Curtis, Ann-Margret, and Peter Sellers. Carr felt Elliot needed to leave pop and rock music altogether and head into the cabaret circuit, so a show was put together comprising old standards {{along with a few}} new songs written for her by friends. The act included Elliot and two male singers who served as backing singers and sidekicks during the musical numbers.

2500|$|At first, William I {{refused to}} {{recognise}} Belgium's independence, and moreover {{he thought that}} if the Netherlands, then a powerful continental empire on paper, were again reduced to the old Dutch Republic's boundaries, {{there would be no}} point to a monarchy. His popularity suffered more and more because of his rejection to acknowledge Belgium, whilst maintaining an extremely expensive army that he intended to retake the South with. Opposition within the States-General became increasingly hostile until he finally agreed to sign the Treaty of London (1839). This necessitated a constitutional reform, during which the parliamentary opposition succeeded in introducing the principle of ministerial responsibility. King William vehemently detested this reform, so strongly that he was unwilling to continue his rule, {{and it was one of}} the reasons for his abdication on 7 October 1840. Another was that he threatened to lose what popularity he had left by his marriage with the half-Catholic Belgian courtesan Henrietta d'Oultremont, that many regarded as treason. Acknowledging his failed reign in 1840, he commented [...] "Ne veut-on plus de moi? On n'a qu'à le dire; je n'ai pas besoin d'eux." [...] ("Don't people want <b>me</b> <b>anymore?</b> They only have to say so; I don't need them.") and that [...] "je suis né republicain" [...] ("I was born as a republican").|$|E

3000|$|I {{would like}} to write about my {{interesting}} yet horrible memory which I have never experienced before. I had a class of all bully male teenagers sometimes terrifying to me, yet I tried to be very strict to show off my power over them. We didn’t have any fun moment in class because I didn’t even let them smile, otherwise they started to make chaos in class, {{and get out of}} control. One day, one of them came late to class and when he entered I made a frown in my face and told him {{this is the last time}} you come late or you are kicked out of the class. I showed them how angry I was. (I disclosed my anger) But there I made a mistake, I tried to show my anger towards the incident but I forgot to check out the look on the latecomer’s face, after 15  min I understood something is happening in the class, students weren’t listening to <b>me</b> teaching <b>anymore,</b> suddenly the latecomer attacked one of his friends. I didn’t know what to do at that moment, I tried to separate them but I couldn’t and unfortunately one of my students was injured. After that event I understood that this is my fault the latecomer did such a thing, cause if I had treated him kindly and created some humorous situations in the class, this burst of anger and violence would have never happened. So a teacher should never be so strict even with bully students, because this can have a negative effect on them. (Journal 82, June 20, 2015) [...]...|$|R
