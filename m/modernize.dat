5|$|Combat {{experience}} in the First Sino-Japanese War convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, and Japan embarked on a program to <b>modernize</b> and expand its fleet.

5|$|Combat {{experience}} in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships, and Japan embarked on a program to <b>modernize</b> and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations. In particular, Japan promulgated a ten-year naval build-up programme, {{with the construction of}} six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core.

5|$|Following Syria's secession, Nasser grew {{concerned}} with Amer's inability {{to train and}} <b>modernize</b> the army, and with the state within a state Amer had created in the military command and intelligence apparatus. In late 1961, Nasser established the Presidential Council and decreed it the authority to approve all senior military appointments, instead of leaving this responsibility solely to Amer. Moreover, he instructed that the primary criterion for promotion should be merit and not personal loyalties. Nasser retracted the initiative after Amer's allies in the officers corps threatened to mobilize against him.|$|E
5|$|Hügel-Marshall {{continued}} {{to study and}} achieved a license in child education and welfare. She then found work in a children's home in Frankfurt am Main, where she worked for twelve years.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{education}} in <b>modernizing</b> and traditional agricultures of Nepal is investigated by utilizing a production function framework. Education is found to have higher payoff to productivity in a <b>modernizing</b> environment than in traditional agriculture. Higher (college) education has {{a significant role in}} a <b>modernizing</b> environment but not in the traditional area. While both worker and allocative effects of education contribute positively to agricultural production, allocative effect surpasses worker effect in both environments. However, only the input-allocation component of the allocative effect is important in traditional areas, while both input-allocation and input-selection components are crucial in a <b>modernizing</b> agriculture. Key words: agricultural productivity, allocative effect, input-allocation effect, input-selection effect, modernizing/traditional agriculture, production function, worker effect. Education contributes to agricultural produc-tion and productivity through the worker and allocative effects (Welch). Its contribution to productivity is much higher in a <b>modernizing</b> environment than in traditional agricultur...|$|R
5|$|In 1961, Nasser {{sought to}} firmly {{establish}} Egypt {{as the leader}} of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist thinking.

Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ulema (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953.|$|E
