Among the many methods of studying ion channel function, patch clamp electrophysiology is considered the gold standard by providing the ultimate precision and flexibility. However, its utility in ion channel drug discovery is impeded by low throughput. Additionally, characterization of endogenous ion channels in primary cells remains technical challenging. In recent years, many automated patch clamp (APC) platforms {{have been developed to}} overcome these challenges, albeit with varying throughput, data quality and success rate. In this study, we utilized SyncroPatch 768 PE, one of the latest generation APC platforms which conducts parallel recording from two- 384 modules with giga-seal data quality, to push these 2 boundaries. By optimizing various cell patching parameters and a two-step voltage protocol, we developed a high throughput APC assay for the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1. 7. By testing a group of Nav 1. 7 reference compounds' IC 50, this assay was proved to be highly consistent with <b>manual</b> patch <b>clamp</b> (R > 0. 9).

40|$|Drug-induced Torsade-de-Pointes (TdP) {{has been}} {{responsible}} for the withdrawal of many drugs from the market and is therefore of major concern to global regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. The Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) was proposed to improve prediction of TdP risk, using in silico models and in vitro multi-channel pharmacology data as integral parts of this initiative. Previously, we reported that combining dynamic interactions between drugs and the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) with multi-channel pharmacology is important for TdP risk classification, and we modified the original O'Hara Rudy ventricular cell mathematical model to include a Markov model of IKr to represent dynamic drug-IKr interactions (IKr-dynamic ORd model). We also developed a novel metric that could separate drugs with different TdP liabilities at high concentrations based on total electronic charge carried by the major inward ionic currents during the action potential. In this study, we further optimized the IKr-dynamic ORd model by refining model parameters using published human cardiomyocyte experimental data under control and drug block conditions. Using this optimized model and <b>manual</b> patch <b>clamp</b> data, we developed an updated version of the metric that quantifies the net electronic charge carried by major inward and outward ionic currents during the steady state action potential, which could classify the level of drug-induced TdP risk across a wide range of concentrations and pacing rates. We also established a framework to quantitatively evaluate a system's robustness against the induction of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), and demonstrated that the new metric is correlated with the cell's robustness to the pro-EAD perturbation of IKr conductance reduction. In summary, in this work we present an optimized model that is more consistent with experimental data, an improved metric that can classify drugs at concentrations both near and higher than clinical exposure, and a physiological framework to check the relationship between a metric and EAD. These findings provide a solid foundation for using in silico models for the regulatory assessment of TdP risk under the CiPA paradigm...|$|R

In this article, we consider specifically the calculations of cam geometry, calculations of clamping force and clamping torque, conditions for self-locking, and conditions for contact strength. Machine fixtures are essential {{in the process of}} mechanical manufacturing. There are many different types of fixtures, such as <b>manual</b> jig, pneumatic <b>clamps,</b> hydraulic fixtures, electric fixtures, etc. There are also many ways of clamping, such as incline clamp, screw clamp, eccentric circle clamp, hinge clamp [1], among which the eccentric circle clamp finds wide applications, especially in fast-clamping devices. Although the circular eccentric fixture possesses the advantages of simple structure, convenient manufacturing, and low cost, it suffers the drawbacks of small clamping force, short clamping-surface travel distance, and unreliable self-locking mechanism. The cam-clamping device discussesed in this article involves replaceing the eccentric circle with a cam, as shown in Fig. 1. The cam profile curve can be designed according to any requirements. The advantages of this replacement are obvious, in addition to preserving the advantages of the circular eccentric fixture, the cam-clamping can be designed according to the actual needs of clamping paths and selection of the appropriate cam profile to improve the self-locking...|$|R
40|$|The {{voltage-gated}} {{potassium ion}} channel, Kv 1. 3, in human lymphocytes is a promising target {{for treatment of}} several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite the relevance of this ion channel for disease, current techniques to measure Kv 1. 3 activity are low-throughput, laborious, and require significant expertise. Consequently, studying ion channels in cells {{of the immune system}} is not accessible to most clinicians and immunologists. 	This thesis describes the development of a high-throughput assay to measure Kv 1. 3 activity in lymphocytes. The method is automated, specific for Kv 1. 3 channels, and able to measure Kv 1. 3 activity in 100 - 200 lymphocytes within 1 h. This throughput is over 20 -fold higher than the throughput of <b>manual</b> patch <b>clamp</b> techniques. 	Using this high-throughput assay enabled profiling Kv 1. 3 activity in T cells from peripheral blood of patients with MS and RA. Patients with chronic progressive (CP) MS exhibited significantly higher Kv 1. 3 activity compared to healthy controls or MS patients in remission. Development of metrics to quantify the percentage of T cells with “high” Kv 1. 3 activity made it possible to distinguish between CP-MS patients and controls with 100 % sensitivity and 94 % specificity. In addition, patients with an active form of RA exhibited higher Kv 1. 3 activity than patients with inactive RA. These results suggest that Kv 1. 3 activity may be a useful clinical marker for quantifying activity of inflammatory autoimmune disorders. 	Moreover, the assay developed here enabled immunological experiments to study the changes in Kv 1. 3 activity upon T cell stimulation. Kv 1. 3 activity increased ~ 3 -fold in T cells following stimulation. We showed that this upregulation was driven by signaling through the interleukin (IL) - 2 receptor. Interestingly, inflammatory cytokines IL- 2 and IL- 15 increased Kv 1. 3 activity {{even in the absence of}} signaling through T cell receptor pathways. These studies suggest that both direct activation of T cells and inflammatory cytokines lead to high Kv 1. 3 activity in vivo. 	High-throughput electrophysiology introduces a promising new strategy for clinical applications such as diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of autoimmune disease. This work also provides a general methodology that makes the study of ion channels in primary cell types accessible to laboratories not specialized in electrophysiology...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{accompanied}} by increased brain levels of soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers (McLean et al., 1999). It {{has been suggested that}} Aβ oligomers directly impair synaptic function (Haass and Selkoe, 2007) and modulate high voltage-activated calcium channels (Sberna et al., 1997; Bobich et al., 2004; Nimmrich et al., 2008 a). State-dependent drugs are hypothesized to target pathologically overactivated channels without altering physiological activity, which may reduce adverse side effects (Winquist et al., 2005). Here, the effect of Aβ globulomer, a synthetic, stable, and pathologically relevant oligomeric Aβ preparation (Barghorn et al., 2005; Gellermann et al., 2008), on high voltage-activated calcium channels was further elucidated. Furthermore, it was tested whether novel state-dependent calcium channel blockers can ameliorate oligomeric Aβ-induced deficits in synaptic transmission. First, the effect of oligomeric Aβ on excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Specific block of P/Q-type and N-type calcium channels by ω-agatoxin IVA and ω-conotoxin MVIIA, respectively, completely reversed Aβ oligomer-induced deficits. By contrast, (additional) L-type calcium channel block by nimodipine (Diochot et al., 1995; Furakawa et al., 1999), a potential antidementia medicine (Birks and López-Arrieta, 2002), was ineffective. As assessed by whole cell patch clamp analysis, oligomeric Aβ shifted the activation of P/Q-type and N-type calcium channels, recombinantly expressed in HEK 293 cells, to more hyperpolarized values. Application of non-aggregated Aβ peptide had no effect. These findings suggest that overactivation of presynaptic calcium channels by oligomeric Aβ may lead to functional synaptic deficits, which can be prevented with presynaptic calcium channel blockers. In a second part of this work, novel state-dependent calcium channel blockers were identified (published in Mezler et al., 2012 a) and their potential to protect from Aβ-induced functional deficits investigated. Compounds were initially detected by a fluorescence imaging plate reader-based primary high throughput screen (previously performed at Abbott) using HEK 293 cells recombinantly expressing P/Q-type calcium channels. For subsequent compound validation using a more direct measure of channel function, an automated patch clamp secondary screening assay was established and incorporated into the hit-to-lead cycle of a drug discovery process. Representative compounds out of this screen were characterized for state-dependent P/Q-type calcium channel block by <b>manual</b> patch <b>clamp</b> recordings. Finally, these blockers were able to protect from Aβ-induced functional decline in synaptic transmission similarly as the state-independent peptide toxins. Findings from this work hint towards the therapeutic potential of state-dependent presynaptic calcium channel block, which needs to be further elucidated in an in vivo model of AD. As P/Q-type calcium channel gain-of-function is also associated with migraine and epilepsy, novel specific channel blockers may also alleviate symptoms of other neurological diseases, beyond AD...|$|R
40|$|Ionenkanäle bilden therapeutische Schlüsselstellen für viele Erkrankungen und sind daher vor allem für die pharmakologische und medizinische Forschung von herausragender Bedeutung. Der Forschungsbedarf ist enorm und dementsprechend groß auch die Nachfrage nach elektrophysiologischen Systemen, die eine Analyse von Ionenkanälen und/oder Wirkstoffen im Hochdurchsatz erlauben. Derzeitige Hochdurchsatzsysteme basieren zumeist auf modifizierten Patch-Clamp-Verfahren, weisen aber im Vergleich zu manuellen Patch-Clamp-Systemen noch einige Nachteile auf. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde daher im Rahmen eines vom Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung geförderten BioChancePlus-Projektes eine {{alternative}} Methode, die Fakir-Methode, entwickelt und ihre Einsatzmöglichkeit in Hochdurchsatzsystemen evaluiert. Bei der Fakir-Methode werden Zellen in einem inhomogenen, elektrischen Wechselfeld mit Hilfe dielektrophoretischer Kräfte zu Metallnanoelektroden hin beschleunigt, aufgrund ihrer Bewegungsenergie von letzteren penetriert und dadurch elektrisch kontaktiert. Dies ermöglicht die anschließende, intrazelluläre Messung in physiologischer Lösung. Im Vergleich zur Patch-Clamp-Methode hat die Fakir-Methode die Vorteile, dass das Zytoplasma der Zelle erhalten bleibt und dass mit einer geringen Zelldichte gearbeitet werden kann. Auf der anderen Seite polarisiert die Elektrode schnell und die genaue, intrazelluläre Zusammensetzung während der Messung ist nicht bekannt. Für die Realisierung der Fakir-Methode im Experiment wurde eine Mikrofluidikkammer mit austauschbaren Metallmikro- und Metallnanoelektroden- Chips entwickelt, die die mikroskopische Beobachtung des Kontaktierungsprozesses ermöglichte. Die Charakterisierung der Elektroden erfolgte sowohl durch Potentialmessungen als auch mit Hilfe von Impedanzspektroskopie. Um die dielektrophoretische Attraktion von Zellen genauer steuern zu können, wurde zudem ein Amplitudenmodulator entwickelt. Zellen konnten sowohl einzeln, als auch in Gruppen kontaktiert werden. Intrazelluläre Potentialmessungen von HEK 293 -Zellen, die den blaulichtgesteuerten Kationenkanal Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) exprimierten, zeigten, dass mit Hilfe der Fakir-Methode von Membranproteinen verursachte Spannungsänderungen gemessen werden können. Beim Fakir-Modell auftretende Schwierigkeiten wurden analysiert und die Ergebnisse genutzt, um ein Konzept für eine hochreproduzierbare Herstellung von Nanoelektroden-Arrays unter Verwendung der 2 -Photonenpolymerisations- Technolgie (2 PP) zu entwerfen. Für den Einsatz als Biosensoren sind große Zellen besonders geeignet. Eine effektive Vergrößerung von Zellen kann durch die Multi-cell-Elektrofusion erreicht werden. Diese Art der Herstellung von Riesenzellen ist insbesondere deshalb so interessant, weil die Elektrofusion problemlos in ein automatisiertes Mikrofluidiksystem eingebunden werden kann. Neben HEK 293 -Zellen konnten nach Entwicklung geeigneter Protokolle für die Herstellung von Protoplasten auch Saccharomyces cerevisiae und Pichia pastoris zu Riesenzellen elektrofusioniert werden. Solche Riesenzellen wurden im Rahmen dieser Arbeit biophysikalisch charakterisiert. Neben Kapazitätsmessungen zeigten sowohl die Expression von YFP in den Membranen als auch die Verwendung von fluoresceinhaltiger Patch-Clamp- Pipettenlösung, dass es sich bei den Riesenzellen um einheitliche Kompartimente handelte und somit die gesamte Membranfläche für elektrophysiologische Experimente zur Verfügung stand. Vergleichende Patch-Clamp-Messungen von ChR 2 -exprimierenden Ursprungs- und Riesenzellen ergaben nicht nur, dass das überexprimierte Protein auch nach der Elektrofusion noch funktional war, sondern auch, dass die Expressionsdichte unverändert blieb. Damit bilden elektrofusionierte Riesenzellen weit über ihre Einsatzmöglichkeiten in Hochdurchsatzsystemen hinaus ein vielversprechendes Werkzeug, um zum Beispiel elektrogene Membranproteine mit geringer Stromamplitude nachzuweisen oder in der giant-inside-out- Konfiguration elektrophysiologische Messungen durchzuführen. Lipophile Anionen können eingesetzt werden, um die elektrischen Eigenschaften der Membranen zu verändern und die Zellstabiliät während des Elektromanipulationsprozesses zu verbessern. Daher wurde für vier verschiedene lipophile Anionen die Spannungsabhängigkeit der Erhöhung der spezifischen Membrankapazität in Patch- Clamp-Experimenten mit HEK 293 -Zellen analysiert. Ion channels provide therapeutical {{points of}} attack for many diseases. That {{is why they}} play {{a prominent role in}} pharmacological and medical research. The need of further research is enormous and, consequently, also the requirement of systems which allow the analysis of ion channels and / or a variety of drugs in highthroughput scale. Most current high-throughput systems are based on a modified patch clamp technique, but compared to <b>manual</b> patch <b>clamp</b> systems they still have some drawbacks. Therefore, in the present work within the framework of a “BioChancePlus” project (supported by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research) an alternative method, the Fakir-method, was developed. Its application in high throughput systems was evaluated. The Fakir method consists of the following principles: A cell is exposed to an inhomogeneous, electrical alternating field. It experiences a dielectrophoretic force and is accelerated in the direction of metal nano electrodes. Due to its kinetic energy the cell is penetrated and thereby electrically contacted by the electrodes. Thus, a subsequent, intracellular measurement under physiological conditions is possible. Compared to the patch clamp method the fakir method offers the advantage of cell cytoplasm preservation and the requirement of only a low cell suspension density. On the other hand, however, the electrode is quickly polarized and the intracellular composition of the cell is not precisely determined. To proof the Fakir-method in experiments a microfluidic chamber with disposable metal micro- and also nanoelectrode chips was designed. It allowed the microscopic observation of the contacting process. The characterization of the electrodes was performed by potential measurements as well as by means of impedance spectroscopy. For the exact dielectrophoretic attraction of cells an amplitude modulator was developed. Cells could be contacted either individually or in groups. Intracellular potential measurements of HEK 293 cells, expressing the blue light gated cation channel Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2), showed that membrane proteinmediated voltage changes can be measured by using the Fakir-method. Malfunctions of the Fakir-model system were analyzed. The results were then used to create a concept for a highly reproducable production of nanoelectrode arrays taking advantage of the 2 PP-technology. Particularly large cells are useful as biosensors. An effective enlargement of cells can be reached by multi-cell electrofusion. This kind of giant cell production is very promising because of the possibility to integrate the electrofusion process into an automated microfluidic system. Apart from HEK 293 cells it was possible to develop appropriate protocols for the production of protoplasts from both, S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris yeasts, and to produce giant cells by multi cell electrofusion. In the context of this work these giant cells were biophysically characterized. Capacity measurements, the expression of YFP in the membranes and the use of sodium fluorescein within the patch pipette solution demonstrated that the giant cells indeed are single compartments. Thus, the entire membrane surface is accessible for electrophysiological experiments. Comparative patch clamp measurements were performed on both, parental and electrofused, ChR 2 -expressing cells. The overexpressed protein was still functional after electrofusion and also the expression density remained unchanged. Hence, electrofused giant cells - far beyond use in high throughput systems - also provide an interesting tool, e. g. for the study of electrogenic membrane proteins with low current amplitude or for electrophysiological measurements on HEK 293 cells in the giant-inside-out configuration. Lipophilic anions can be used to vary the electrical parameters as well as to enhance the cell stability during electromanipulation processes. Therefore, the voltage dependency of the specific membrane capacity increase was analyzed in patch clamp experiments using HEK 293 cells in presence of lipophilic anions...|$|R
