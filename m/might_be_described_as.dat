5|$|Alertness is {{a global}} {{observation}} of level of consciousness i.e. awareness of, and responsiveness to the environment, and this <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> alert, clouded, drowsy, or stuporous. Orientation is assessed by asking the patient {{where he or she}} is (for example what building, town and state) and what time it is (time, day, date).|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{molecular}} structure, synephrine has a phenethylamine skeleton, with a phenolic hydroxy- group, an alcoholic hydroxy- group, and an N-methylated amino-group. Alternatively, synephrine <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a phenylethanolamine with an N-methyl and p-hydroxy substituent. The amino-group confers basic properties on the molecule, whereas the phenolic –OH group is weakly acidic: the apparent (see original article for discussion) pKas for protonated synephrine are 9.55 (phenolic H) and 9.79 (ammonium H).|$|E

25|$|In organic chemistry, {{electronegativity}} {{is associated}} more with different functional groups than with individual atoms. The terms group electronegativity and substituent electronegativity are used synonymously. However, {{it is common}} to distinguish between the inductive effect and the resonance effect, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> σ- and π-electronegativities, respectively. There are a number of linear free-energy relationships that have been used to quantify these effects, of which the Hammett equation is the best known. Kabachnik parameters are group electronegativities for use in organophosphorus chemistry.|$|E
25|$|When the {{dimension}} of the lattice rises to four or more, rotations need no longer be planar; the 2D proof is inadequate. However, restrictions still apply, though more symmetries are permissible. For example, the hypercubic lattice has an eightfold rotational symmetry, corresponding to an eightfold rotational symmetry of the hypercube. This is of interest, not just for mathematics, but for the physics of quasicrystals under the cut-and-project theory. In this view, a 3D quasicrystal with 8-fold rotation symmetry <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> the projection of a slab cut from a 4D lattice.|$|E
25|$|He practised as an {{architect}} in Bristol from 1888. His work includes schools, such as the board schools in Barton Hill, Easton, and Southville, Greenbank Elementary School and St George's School. He designed the schools of medicine and engineering at Bristol University and the Music School of Clifton College. He also undertook a number of domestic commissions for the King's Weston estate of Philip Napier Miles, including a number of substantial houses in Shirehampton, the Miles Arms public house in Avonmouth, the now-demolished King's Weston estate office and the public hall in Shirehampton. Cossham Memorial Hospital is also an example of his work. The style of his mature works in the Edwardian years <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> English Baroque or Queen Anne Revival. In addition he oversaw the restoration {{of a number of}} churches, became an acknowledged authority on the history of church architecture, and in 1909 published, with Dom Bede Camm, a two-volume treatise entitled Roodscreens and Roodlofts.|$|E

25|$|Belizean cuisine is an {{amalgamation}} of all {{ethnicity in}} the nation, and their respectively {{wide variety of}} foods. It <b>might</b> best <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> both similar to Mexican/Central American cuisine and Jamaican/Anglo-Caribbean cuisine.|$|R
500|$|Within each {{of these}} poker variants, a myriad of options exist. [...] For example, {{depending}} on the betting structure, a tournament <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> no-limit, limit, or pot-limit. Games may include other variations on the rules governing {{the execution of the}} specific game such as shootout, eight or better, or heads up.|$|E
500|$|Strictly speaking, {{replacing}} a component {{with one of}} an entirely different type {{is still the same}} topology. [...] In some contexts, however, these can loosely be described as different topologies. [...] For instance, interchanging inductors and capacitors in a low-pass filter results in a high-pass filter. [...] These <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> high-pass and low-pass topologies even though the network topology is identical. [...] A more correct term for these classes of object (that is, a network where the type of component is specified but not the absolute value) is prototype network.|$|E
500|$|The {{ultimate}} substantive {{legacy of}} Principia Mathematica is mixed. [...] It is generally accepted that Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there {{would in fact}} be some truths of mathematics {{which could not be}} deduced from them, and hence that Principia Mathematica could never achieve its aims. [...] However, Gödel could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book. [...] In this way, Principia Mathematicas legacy <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals. [...] But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy, the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.|$|E

500|$|Reception of the {{painting}} {{as a work of}} art has been predominantly negative. The historian David Starkey described it as [...] "an appallingly bad picture and there's absolutely no reason to suppose it's got anything to do with Lady Jane Grey", a sentiment which the art dealer Christopher Foley echoed. Tarnya Cooper of the National Portrait Gallery gave less sharp criticism, stating [...] "it's a paint-by-number, labored copy", and [...] "its value is as a historical document rather than a work of art". Zarin describes {{the painting}} as looking bleached in comparison with other portraits of monarchs, with [...] "the flat face of a paper doll". Edwards writes [...] "the quality <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> naive, primitive, or even folk art".|$|E
500|$|Abbey Road {{initially}} received {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, who criticised the production's artificial sounds and viewed its music as inauthentic. William Mann of the London Times {{said that the}} album will [...] "be called gimmicky by people who want a record to sound exactly like a live performance", although he considered it to be [...] "teem with musical invention" [...] and added: [...] "Nice as Come Together and Harrison's Something are – they are minor pleasures {{in the context of}} the whole disc … Side Two is marvellous …" [...] Ed Ward of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "complicated instead of complex" [...] and felt that the Moog synthesizer [...] "disembodies and artificializes" [...] the band's sound, adding that they [...] "create a sound that could not possibly exist outside the studio". While he found the medley on side two to be their [...] "most impressive music" [...] since Rubber Soul, Nik Cohn of The New York Times said that, [...] "individually", the album's songs are [...] "nothing special". Albert Goldman of Life magazine wrote that Abbey Road [...] "is not one of the Beatles' great albums" [...] and, despite some [...] "lovely" [...] phrases and [...] "stirring" [...] segues, side two's suite [...] "seems symbolic of the Beatles' latest phase, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> the round-the-clock production of disposable music effects".|$|E

2500|$|On a {{religious}} or spiritual level, Partridge described P-Orridge as representing [...] "a particularly interesting, influential and subversive example of contemporary Paganism." [...] Asserting that P-Orridge's [...] "Industrial Paganism" [...] {{was different from}} most forms of contemporary Paganism, Partridge described it as [...] "confrontational, subversive, experimental and, to a large extent, dystopian", with it serving as [...] "an ideological tool" [...] with which to analyse society [...] "from its underbelly; an immersion in the dark side; the subversion of Christian hegemony, conservative politics and what nowadays <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> neoliberalism." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hosam Aboul-Ela of the University of Houston <b>described</b> Ibrahim <b>as</b> [...] "a {{relentless}} internal {{critic of}} successive Egyptian regimes" [...] and wrote that [...] "Ibrahim <b>might</b> best <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> {{a sort of}} Egyptian cross between Jonathan Swift and Manuel Puig".|$|R
