5|$|After {{the rest}} day came the race's {{individual}} time trial. It was won by Dumoulin, who was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> ahead {{of all the}} other riders in the race. His time was good enough to put him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place.|$|E
5|$|On the Taaienberg, Tiesj Benoot (Lotto–Soudal) led the peloton, with Boonen {{right behind}} him. A ten-rider group {{broke away from}} the peloton over the climb, with Benoot and Boonen joined by Roelandts, Cancellara, Boom, Vanmarcke, Daniel Oss (BMC) and three other Etixx–Quick-Step riders (Terpstra, Štybar and Trentin). On the next climb, the Boigneberg, Cancellara's rear {{derailleur}} failed and it took <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> for his team to bring him a replacement bike, putting him a long way behind the other favourites. Shortly afterwards, the breakaway was caught by the chasing group; the combined group was then caught by another group that contained Sagan and Kwiatkowski to create a 20-man lead group, although Štybar soon suffered a puncture and fell out of the group. Cancellara, meanwhile, was in a group led by his teammates Yaroslav Popovych and Markel Irizar around two minutes behind.|$|E
5|$|Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose {{to second}} before stage 12, the {{very long and}} hilly {{individual}} time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages {{to make up the}} time difference, which was never <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at the finish line in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.|$|E

History repeated at the Eindhoven Marathon, where he entered as favourite but finished in fourth place.

25|$|An {{indirect}} {{public health}} problem posed by cigarettes is that of accidental fires, usually linked with consumption of alcohol. Enhanced combustion using nitrates was traditionally used but cigarette manufacturers have been silent on this subject claiming at first that a safe cigarette was technically impossible, then that {{it could only be}} achieved by modifying the paper. Roll your own cigarettes contain no additives and are fire safe. Numerous fire safe cigarette designs have been proposed, some by tobacco companies themselves, which would extinguish a cigarette left unattended for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, thereby reducing the risk of fire. Among American tobacco companies, some have resisted this idea, while others have embraced it. RJ Reynolds was a leader in making prototypes of these cigarettes in 1983 and will make all of their U.S. market cigarettes to be fire-safe by 2010. Phillip Morris is not in active support of it. Lorillard (purchased by RJ Reynolds), the US' 3rd-largest tobacco company, seems to be ambivalent.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic {{marathon}} {{was held}} in the afternoon of a very hot day, and the course provided little or no shade, except for the start and finish. Mihalić kept with the leading group, gradually advancing in the standings, but had a serious setback while approaching the first water station at the 15th kilometer. In a scramble for refreshment he tripped, collided with the water table and fell to the ground, injuring himself. Despite bruising his arms and legs he managed to get up and continue the race but only reconnected {{with the head of the}} pack at the 20th kilometer. Shortly after that, Mimoun suddenly broke away from the leading group. Mihalić decided against chasing him until the 35th kilometer, when he realized none of the other runners were able to follow. By that time however Mimoun had an advantage of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and Mihalić was unable to catch up with him. In the end, he was the second to cross the finish line in a time of 2:26:32, a minute and a half after Mimoun, and a minute in front of the bronze medalist Veikko Karvonen.|$|E
25|$|The team's winning ways {{continued}} at Paris–Nice in March. Goss won the field sprint finish to stage 3, after narrowly missing {{a victory in}} stage 2, maneuvering around riders who fell after 's Peter Sagan crashed on the course's final sharp turn. In the mountainous stage 5, Martin finished with the first group {{on the road to}} assume fourth place {{at the end of the}} day, ten seconds down on race leader Andreas Klöden. This was an advantageous position with the stage 6 individual time trial to come; Martin was viewed as a favorite for the time trial. The next day, Martin handily won the time trial, with only five riders finishing within a minute of his winning time. He took the race lead, with a 36-second lead over Klöden in the overall standings. His advantage largely held steady over the last two days, giving him the overall race crown. The team won the flat first stage of the Volta a Catalunya, but not in the manner by which they regularly win flat stages. New acquisition Smukulis made the morning breakaway and had it stick to the finish. Last shedding former teammate Ben Gastauer of , Smukulis soloed to victory 28 seconds ahead of the charging peloton. It was his first professional victory, and he was visibly emotional as he crossed the finish line. He held the race lead for a second day before giving it up on the high mountain stage 3, as he lost nearly 17 minutes that day. At the Tour of the Basque Country, Albasini won the mountains classification thanks to back-to-back nearly day-long efforts in the breakaways in stages 4 and 5. Also, Martin won the time trial which closed out the event, again besting Klöden, though this time the elder German was the overall race winner. The team was successful on two fronts at the Tour of California. Van Garderen showed solid climbing legs on the race's two summit finishes. Though he was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> back of the stage winner both days, he was well better than the majority of the field, including all his rivals for the youth classification. He won the award at the end of the race by almost six minutes over 's Andrew Talansky. The last stage featured a group sprint finish. Where their leadout train had been outmaneuvered by 's earlier in the race, this time Goss was successfully delivered to the line first. Van Garderen's final overall placing was fifth. Degenkolb and Albasini both found their way into the winner's circle at Bayern-Rundfahrt. First, Degenkolb edged out fellow young German sprinter Marcel Kittel in the finish to stage 2. Albasini won a breakaway sprint the next day, best of a nine-man group. This win gave him the race lead for a day, and he held on to finish on the event's final podium in third place.|$|E

500|$|After {{struggling}} in the 1989 Paris–Nice early-season race {{and failing to}} improve his condition, LeMond informed his wife Kathy {{that he intended to}} retire from professional cycling after the 1989 Tour de France.

He started the 1989 Giro d'Italia in May as preparation for the Tour to follow, but struggled in the mountains and was not in contention for any of the leaders' jerseys before the final [...] individual time trial into Florence.

He maintained the lead for several days, despite injuring his shoulder in a crash on stage 6. Contador lost the lead to Fabio Aru (...) on stage 13 after being held up in another crash, but regained it the following day, when he beat his rivals by several minutes in the race's only individual time trial.
