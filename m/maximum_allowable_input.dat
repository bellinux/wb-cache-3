40|$|International audienceA {{methodology}} {{for the design}} of printed magnetically coupled resonant wireless power-transfer (WPT) systems is proposed. The design methodology aims at a well-matched system with a maximized power-transfer efficiency for mid-range applications. The system consists of two identical resonant coils driven by high-quality factor loops. The proposed design criteria allows obtaining maximum achievable transfer efficiency and impedance matching at any defined distance without any external matching circuits connected to the driven loops. For validation purposes, a printed WPT system at 10 MHz is fabricated targeting 1 -m distance between the transmitting and receiving sides. Its performances in terms of reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as in terms of generated electric and magnetic fields, have been characterized numerically and experimentally. The impact of human body presence on the system has also been investigated observing the splitting in two frequencies of the common resonant frequency of the coils. A dosimetric study has been conducted using a detailed high-resolution anatomical human body model and considering E 99, J 1 cm 2, and specific absorption rate (SAR) (local and whole body averaged SAR) as exposure metrics. It has been observed that peak exposure levels appear in different tissues depending on the body location. Compliance with the international commission on nonionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP) reference level as well as basic restrictions has been studied followed by computing the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>input</b> power. It has been found that, with the body located 1 m away from the transmitting coil, the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>input</b> power satisfying E 99 is in the order of MW, whereas it reduces to tens of kilowatt when considering SAR and J 1 cm 2. The latter has been noticed to be the most restrictive dosimetric quantity. © 2016 IEEE...|$|E

Safety issues and performance (resonance, radiation) are analyzed for an experimentally validated implantable antenna (volume of 203. 6 mm 3), consider-ing five head models (3 - and 5 -layer spherical, 6 -, 10 -, and 13 -tissue anatomical) and seven scenarios (variations 20 % in the reference permittivity and conductivity values). Simulations are carried out at 403. 5 MHz using the finite-difference time-domain method. Anatomy of the head model around the implantation site is found to mainly affect antenna performance, whereas overall tissue anatomy and dielectric parameters are less significant. Compared to the reference dielectric parameter scenario within the 3 -layer spherical head, maximum variations of 19. 9 %, þ 3. 7 %, 55. 1 %, and 39. 2 % are computed in the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> net <b>input</b> power imposed by the IEEE Std C 95. 1 - 1999 and Std C 95. 1 - 2005 safety guidelines, return loss, and maximum far-field gain, respectively.

40|$|In this paper, the {{tracking}} control {{problem of a}} class of uncertain Euler-Lagrange systems subjected to unknown input delay and bounded disturbances is addressed. To this front, a novel delay dependent control law, referred as Adaptive Robust Outer Loop Control (AROLC) is proposed. Compared to the conventional predictor based approaches, the proposed controller is capable of negotiating any input delay, within a stipulated range, without knowing the delay or its variation. The <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>input</b> delay is computed through Razumikhin-type stability analysis. AROLC also provides robustness against the disturbances due to input delay, parametric variations and unmodelled dynamics through switching control law. The novel adaptive law allows the switching gain to modify itself online in accordance with {{the tracking}} error without any prerequisite of the uncertainties. The uncertain system, employing AROLC, is shown to be Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB). As a proof of concept, experimentation is carried out on a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot with various time varying as well as fixed input delay, and better tracking accuracy of the proposed controller is noted compared to predictor based methodology...|$|E
40|$|Receivers {{are being}} {{digitized}} in {{a quest for}} flexibility. Analog filters and programmable gain stages are being exchanged for digital processing {{at the price of}} a very challenging ADC. This paper presents an alternative solution where the filter and programmable gain functionality is integrated into a S¿ ADC. The novel filtering ADC is realized by adding a high-pass feedback path to a conventional S¿ ADC while a compensating low-pass filter in the forward path maintains stability. As such, the ADC becomes highly immune to interferers even if they exceed the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>input</b> level for the wanted channel. As a consequence, the ADC input range can be programmed dynamically {{to the level of the}} wanted signal only. This results in an input-referred dynamic range of 89 dB in 1 -MHz bandwidth and an intentionally moderate output signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 46 - 59 dB (depending on the programmed gain). The merged functionality enables a better overall power/performance balance for the receiver baseband.

40|$|In recent years, the {{collection}} of genomic data has skyrocketed and databases of genomic data are growing {{at a faster rate}} than ever before. Although many computational methods have been developed to interpret these data, they tend to struggle to process the ever increasing file sizes that are being produced and fail {{to take advantage of the}} advances in multi-core processors by using parallel processing. In some instances, loss of accuracy has been a necessary trade off to allow faster computation of the data. This thesis discusses one such algorithm that has been developed and how changes were made to allow larger input file sizes and reduce the time required to achieve a result without sacrificing accuracy. An information entropy based algorithm was used as a basis to demonstrate these techniques. The algorithm dissects the distinctive patterns underlying genomic data efficiently requiring no a priori knowledge, and thus is applicable in a variety of biological research applications. This research describes how parallel processing and object-oriented programming techniques were used to process larger files in less time and achieve a more accurate result from the algorithm. Through object oriented techniques, the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>input</b> file size was significantly increased from 200 mb to 2000 mb. Using parallel processing techniques allowed the program to finish processing data in less than half the time of the sequential version. The accuracy of the algorithm was improved by reducing data loss throughout the algorithm. Finally, adding user-friendly options enabled the program to use requests more effectively and further customize the logic used within the algorithm...|$|E
40|$|A {{control method}} is {{proposed}} to reduce vibrations in helicopters using active trailing-edge flaps on the rotor blades. The novelty {{of the method}} is that each blade is controlled independently, taking into account possible blade dissimilarities. This is different from previous control approaches that assumed blades were identical and generated a single control input, which is applied with adequate phase shift to each blade. The controller is developed in discrete time, with the control inputs updated every rotor revolution. The method consists of performing simultaneous system identification (using Kalman filtering technique) and closed loop control (using a deterministic control law) at each time step. For the system identification, different inputs are applied to each blade, {{and the relationship between}} the individual blade inputs and the resulting loads in the fixed frame is estimated on-line, assuming a linear-time-periodic model of the helicopter. A comprehensive rotor analysis, including all blade degrees of freedom and a free wake model for computing the inflow across the rotor disk, was used to investigate the controller performance in detail. The rotor model is based on a modern bearingless rotor that includes detailed modeling of trailing edge flap effects. The controller performance was tested at advance ratios from 0. 10 to 0. 40, both for a baseline rotor with identical blades and a damaged rotor with dissimilar blades. In the case of the dissimilar rotor, comprehensive analysis predicts that allowing independent control inputs for each blade dramatically improves the vibration reduction compared to restricting the control inputs to be specific phase shifted versions of each other. In order to test the controller experimentally, a Mach-scale rotor model was fabricated. The rotor model consists of 4 blades with piezo-ceramic actuated trailing edge flaps. A new type of hinge using flexures was designed to improve the flap articulation and incorporated in each blade. The smart rotor model is then fitted on a bearingless model-scale hub and tested both on a hover stand and in the Glenn L. Martin wind tunnel. Both rotating-frame as well as fixed-frame vibratory loads were targeted in the closed-loop control tests. These tests demonstrate the controller's ability to account for blade dissimilarities and generate different optimal inputs for each blade. For example, in hover, at 500 RPM, the 1 /rev bending moment at the root of three of the blades was simultaneously reduced by 77 % using three active blades. In forward flight, the controller could simultaneously reduce the baseline 4 /rev fixed frame vibration as well other harmonics of vibration such as 1 /rev and 3 /rev arising from blade dissimilarities. It was also possible to minimize vibration in the fixed frame for several loads simultaneously. However, for most control tests, increases in other loads (not included in the control objective) were observed. During most closed loop tests, the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>input</b> to the actuators was reached. It was found that the method used to account for actuator saturation and maintain actuator input within acceptable limits had an important effect on controller performance. The best controller performance was obtained when control inputs are computed by solving the constrained minimization problem. However, this procedure is very time consuming and could not be implemented in real-time with the available computer. It can be concluded that accounting for blade dissimilarities using individual inputs for each blade results in improved vibration reduction. However, to maximize the benefits of this control scheme, an efficient, practical method to limit control inputs needs to be devised...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, two filter banks {{optimization}} {{problems are}} studied. The first {{problem is the}} optimization of filter banks used in a subband coder under a bit constraint. In the second problem, a {{multiple input multiple output}} communication system is optimized under a power constraint. Three different cases on the filter lengths are considered: unconstrained length filter banks, transforms, and finite impulse response filter banks with arbitrary given filter lengths. In source coding and multiple input multiple output communication systems, transforms and filter banks are used to decompose the source in order to generate samples that are partly decorrelated. Then, they are more suitable for source coding or transmission over a channel than the original source samples. Most transformers and filter banks that are studies in the literature have the perfect reconstruction property. In this dissertation, the perfect reconstruction condition is relaxed, so that the transforms and filter banks are allowed to belong to larger sets, which contain perfect reconstruction transforms and filter banks as subsets. Jointly optimal analysis and synthesis filter banks and transforms are proposed under the bit and power constraints for all the three filter length cases. For a given number of bits used in the quantizers or for a given channel with a <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>input</b> power, the analysis and synthesis transforms and filter banks are jointly optimized such that the mean square error between the original and decoded signal is minimized. Analytical expressions are obtained for unconstrained length filter banks and transforms, and an iterative numerical algorithm is proposed in the finite impulse response filter bank case. The channel in the communication problem is modelled as a known multiple input multiple output transfer matrix with signal independent additive vector noise having known second order statistics. A pre- and postprocessor containing modulation is introduced in the unconstrained length filter bank system with a power constraint. It is shown that the performance of this system {{is the same as the}} performance of the power constrained transform coder system when the dimensions of the latter system approach infinity. In the source coding problem, the results are obtained with different quantization models. In the simplest model, the subband quantizers are modelled as additive white signal independent noise sources. The proposed unconstrained length filter banks, and it is shown that the proposed transform has better performance than the Karhunen-Loève transform. Also, the proposed transform coder has the same performance as a transform coder using a reduced rank Karhunen- Loève analysis transform with jointy optimal bit allocation and Wiener synthesis transform. The proposed finite impulse response filter banks have at least as good theoretical rate distortion performance as the perfect reconstruction filter banks and the finite impulse response Wiener filter banks used in the comparison. A practical coding system is introduced where the coding of the subband signals is performed by uniform threshold quantizers using the centroids as representation levels. It is shown that there is a mismatch between the theoretical and practical results. Three methods for removing this mismatch are introduced. In the two first methods, the filter banks them selves are unchanged, but the coding method of the subband signals is changed. In the first of these two methods, quantizers are derived such that the additive coding noise and subband signals are uncorrelated. Subtractive dithering is the second method used for coding of the subband signals. In the third method, a signal dependent colored noise model is introduced, and this model is used to redesign the filter banks. In all three methods, good correspondence is achieved between the theoretical and practical results, and comparable or better practical rate distortion performance is achieved by the proposed methods compared to systems using perfect reconstruction filter banks and finite impulse response Wiener synthesis filter banks. Finally, conditions for when finite impulse response filter banks are optimal are derived. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

30|$|We {{investigate}} {{a method to}} set the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power for a secondary base station in dynamic spectrum sharing among secondary users and primary users. In conventional methods, location information is assumed. Thus, the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power can be set by considering the shadowing between the secondary base station and the primary user receivers to satisfy a constraint. Specifically, {{the probability that the}} interference from secondary base station exceeds the acceptable level must be less than the constraint target probability. We assume that the location information is not available at the secondary network. Instead, the secondary base station uses the received signal strength from the primary user transmitter for distance estimation. In this case, we have to consider shadowing not only between the secondary base station and the primary user receivers, but also between the primary user transmitter and the secondary receiver(s). We also need to account for the uncertainty of the distance. In order to satisfy the constraint target probability, we proposed a two-step approach to setting the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power where a transmission decision margin and a transmit power margin are utilized. To reduce these margins, we also propose cooperative <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power setting method utilizing also received signal strength values from several secondary users.
