5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes {{back across the}} ER membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction of the <b>muscle</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} element {{in the human body}} and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role in}} the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E

Total collagen synthesis in cultured mesangial and arterial smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> was lower than in venous smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> Electrophoretic analysis showed type I collagen predominated in all cell types, although levels were highest in mesangial and arterial smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> Collagen V (alpha 3) occurred only in venous smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> Mesangial and arterial smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> showed cellbound fibronectin and laminin, which also were secreted into the medium. Venous smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> secreted fibronectin, but all laminin was cell bound. The findings suggest a strong similarity between mesangial and arterial smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origin of}} <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> in metazoans {{is a highly}} debated topic. In one line of thought scientists have believed that <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> evolved once and thus all animals with <b>muscles</b> <b>cells</b> have a single common ancestor. In the other line of thought, scientists believe <b>muscles</b> <b>cells</b> evolved more than once and any morphological or structural similarities are due to convergent evolution and genes that predate the evolution of muscle and even the mesoderm - the germ layer from which many scientists believe true <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> derive.|$|R

Gap {{junctions}} {{have been demonstrated}} in rare circumstances as one coupling mechanism between ICC and smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> Another potential coupling mechanism is the “Peg and Socket” theory which demonstrates that the membranes of smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> have the ability either form physical narrow “sockets” or “pegs” to lock onto other smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> and/or interstitial cells of Cajal.|$|R
5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the <b>muscle</b> <b>cell,</b> the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
5|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{is to treat}} shock and preserve kidney function. Initially this is done through the administration of generous amounts of intravenous fluids, usually isotonic saline (0.9% weight per volume sodium chloride solution). In victims of crush syndrome, it is recommended to administer intravenous fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures. This will ensure sufficient circulating volume {{to deal with the}} <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys. Amounts of 6 to 12liters over 24hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300ml/h in adults), unless there are other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a history of heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health, where {{he served as a}} senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important {{to our understanding of the}} early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins totalizing ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E
25|$|MiR-1 has {{key roles}} in the {{development}} and differentiation of smooth and skeletal muscles. For example, in the lineage-specific differention of smooth muscle cells from embroyonic stem cell derived cultures, MiR-1 is required; as its loss of function resulted in a reduction in smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> biomarkers and a reduction in the derived smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> population. There is evidence that the control of smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation by MiR-1 may be mediated by the down regulation of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), since a MiR-1 recognition site is predicted in the 3' UTR of KLF4 and inhibition of MiR-1 results in reversed down-regulation of KLF4 and an inhibition of smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. A mutation in the 3' UTR of the myostatin gene in Texel sheep creates a miR-1 and miR-206 target site. This is likely to cause the muscular phenotype of this breed of sheep.|$|E
25|$|Muscle cells work by {{detecting}} a flow {{of electrical}} impulses from the brain, which signals them to contract through the release of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Fatigue (reduced ability to generate force) may occur due to the nerve, or within the muscle cells themselves. New research from scientists at Columbia University suggests that muscle fatigue is caused by calcium leaking out of the <b>muscle</b> <b>cell.</b> This makes less calcium available for the <b>muscle</b> <b>cell.</b> In addition, the Columbia researchers propose that an enzyme activated by this released calcium eats away at muscle fibers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSynaptogenesis among {{developing}} motoneurons {{and muscles}} was {{examined in the}} nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans. In this animal embryonic precursor cells give rise to regionally localized, contiguous clones of <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> that form two dorsal and two ventral sets that run longitudinally along the body wall. Ablation of selected embryonic muscle precursors resulted in gaps in the posterior dorsal muscle quadrants. We compared the morphological development of GABAergic locomotory neurons in the presence and absence of their target <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> The results led to four main conclusions: (1) target <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> are not required for the morphological differentiation of the motoneurons; (2) target <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> appear to be required {{for the formation of}} presynaptic varicosities by the motoneurons; (3) embryonic <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> serve as a guide for migrating postembryonic <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> {{and in the absence of}} these guides the postembryonic muscles often assume ectopic locations; and (4) in the presence of ectopic <b>muscle</b> <b>cells,</b> the GABAergic locomotory neurons sprouted and formed branches that contributed to ectopic neuromuscular junctions...|$|R
40|$|Vascular medial smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> migrate, proliferate and {{transform}} to foam {{cells in the}} process of atherosclerosis. We have reported that the intimal smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> express proto-oncogene c-fms, a characteristic gene of monocyte-macrophages, which is not normally expressed in medial smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> In the present study, we demonstrated that combinations of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -BB and either epidermal growth factor (EGF) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) induced high expression of c-fms in normal human medial smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> to the level of intimal smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> or monocyte-derived macrophages, whereas c-fms expression by PDGF-BB alone was 1 / 10 and both EGF and FGF had no independent effect on c-fms expression. By contrast, interferon (IFN) -gamma and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) suppressed the induction of c-fms expression. These results indicate that multiple growth factors and cytokines {{may play a role in}} the phenotypic transformation of medial smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> to intimal smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> in atherosclerotic lesions by altering c-fms expression...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Endometriosis is a benign, chronic, estrogen-dependent {{gynaecologic}} disease affecting {{millions of women}} of reproductive age. Most of the patients suffer from cycle-dependent symptoms, such as dysmenorrhoea and pelvic pain, whereby 50 % of them require long-term treatment including recurring surgery and/or continuous hormonal treatment. Developing suitable healing options will not be feasible {{as long as the}} pathogenesis of endometriosis, especially the pathogenesis of pain generation, is not fully understood. In this perspective the smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> in endometriotic lesions have become a promising research area. Smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> are common components of endometriotic lesions and have been characterizied previously in peritoneal, ovarian and deep infiltrating endometriotic lesions. To date, the origin of these endometriosis-associated smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> is still unclear. However, {{there is some evidence that}} they are of metaplastic origin. Furthermore, their biological functionality is still not fully known. Therefore, this retrospective study aims for investigating the differentiation level among endometriosis-associated smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> in peritoneal endometriotic lesions. Methods: Biopsies from peritoneal endometriotic lesions (n = 60) and healthy peritoneum from patients without endometriosis (control tissue, n = 10) were obtained. The controls were hysterectomy specimens from patients without endometriosis or adenomyosis. An immunhistochemical examination of peritoneal specimens using antibodies against oxytocin receptor (OTR), vasopressin receptor (VPR) and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (sm-MHC) was performed during this study. To identify smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> and their level of differentiation, antibodies for smooth muscle actin (smActin), desmin (Des) and caldesmon (Cal) were used. Results: Smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> were detected in all endometriotic lesions. They were more abundant in the peritoneum of women with endometriosis (38 %) compared with women without endometriosis (6 %; p < 0, 001). Endometriosis-associated smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> were differentiated based on their association with the endometriotic lesion. Intrastromal smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells,</b> stroma surrounding smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> and peripheral smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> could be distinguished. The peripheral smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> contained an increased number of differentiated cells compared with intrastromal and stroma surrounding smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> (p < 0, 001). Depending on the level of differentiation, smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> stained for sm-MHC, OTR and VPR. OTR and VPR were only detected in fully differentiated smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> Conclusions: The present study provides first evidence for a possible metaplastic origin of endometriosis-associated smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> The identification of OTR and VPR leads to the hypothesis that endometriosis-associated smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> might be functionally active and possibly involved in the generation of pain associated with endometriosis...|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous {{release of}} {{neurotransmitter}} {{has been demonstrated}} in various types of synapses. Its physiological significance, however, is still unknown. In nerve-muscle cultures of embryonic Xenopus laevis, we observed that acetylcholine, which is released spontaneously at the synaptic terminal, caused frequent twitches of <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> These <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> developed cross-striations earlier than neighboring non-twitching cells. This effect of innervation was unaffected by tetrodotoxin but was blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin. Repeated iontophoretic application of acetylcholine or KCl to <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> caused twitches and also accelerated the formation of cross-striations. Thus twitching apparently promotes lateral alignment of myofibrils. It is also known that myosin synthesis is higher in twitching <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, successfully innervated twitching <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> may have an advantage for faster differentiation over neighboring non-twitching <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> We suggest that spontaneously released transmitter {{may serve as a}} mediator for trophic interaction at forming synapses...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to {{examine the effect of}} the major fibrinolytic protease, plasmin, on the production of nitric oxide from interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) -treated cultured human and rat aortic smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells.</b> Incubation of vascular smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> with IL- 1 β resulted in significant accumulation of nitrite and nitrate in the culture media. Plasmin, either added exogenously or generated by the reaction of tissue plasminogen activator with plasminogen, potentiated the IL- 1 β-mediated release of nitrite and nitrate from smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> in a concentration- dependent manner, without affecting the production of nitrite and nitrate from cells untreated with IL- 1 β. This potentiating effect was abolished when plasmin was incubated with the protease inhibitor, α 2 -antiplasmin. The perfusates from columns containing IL- 1 β-treated smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> relaxed detector blood vessels without endothelium, and the addition of IL- 1 β- treated smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> to suspensions of indomethacin-treated platelets inhibited their aggregation. Untreated smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> or cells treated with plasmin alone did not have such effects. However, the simultaneous treatment of smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> with IL- 1 β and plasmin markedly enhanced both the relaxing activities of the perfusates and the inhibition of platelet aggregation. Treatment of smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>cells</b> with N(G) -nitro-L-arginine inhibited the cytokine-mediated effects as well as the potentiating effect of plasmin.

In particular, the group focussed on the accumulation of nicotinic receptors in the post-synaptic region upon development, concommitent to a switch of receptor identity. They were able to decrypt the different signalling pathways involved in the response to synaptic activity, showing that the accumulation resulted from an inhibition of gene transcription outside the synaptic region due to electrical activity triggering an uptake of calcium and activation of PKC, and a stimulation of gene transcription at the synapse by the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) activating PKA and the ARIA (heregulin) activating tyrosine kinase cascades.|$|E
