5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is thought to be}} the result of an underlying <b>muscle</b> <b>disorder.</b> A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, Suzanne Rogers was {{diagnosed}} with a rare <b>muscle</b> <b>disorder</b> called Myasthenia Gravis. This disease affected her facial muscles and the medication she needed made her feel ill, with her face appearing swollen while also suffering hair loss. Rogers was forced to quit the show after 11 years when the effects of the disease became increasingly worse. Her entire appearance changed, and she did not return to the show for a year. Rogers, wanting to educate viewers about the disease, approached executive producer Betty Corday about her character being diagnosed with the disease. Corday agreed, and a storyline played out with Maggie learning she has myasthenia gravis. The actress went into remission in 1995, and has remained in remission since. In 2010, Maggie began to notice some symptoms of the disease returning.|$|E

Olivier's move from leading parts to supporting and cameo roles came about because his poor health meant he could not get the necessary long insurance for larger parts, with only short engagements in films available.|$|E

40|$|Purpose/Objective: Acceptance and {{commitment}} therapy (ACT), a newer {{type of behavior}} therapy that targets psychological flexibility, may have particular utility {{in the context of}} <b>muscle</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, there has been no formal investigation of psychological flexibility in this population. This longitudinal observational study investigated whether psychological flexibility is cross-sectionally related to, and prospectively influential on, life satisfaction and mood in <b>muscle</b> <b>disorders.</b> Methods: Data were collected via online questionnaire batteries, completed at baseline and then repeated 4 months later. Cross-sectional and prospective regression analyses examined relationships between validated measures of disability level, psychological flexibility (experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, and valued living) and illness perceptions (a psychological variable with known influence in <b>muscle</b> <b>disorders),</b> and outcomes (life satisfaction, anxiety, and depression). Results: A sample of 137 people with a range of <b>muscle</b> <b>disorders</b> participated. In cross-sectional analyses, psychological flexibility explained significant unique variance in addition to illness perceptions (ΔR 2 = 0. 17 – 0. 34, p <. 001). In prospective analyses, psychological flexibility alone was predictive of change in life satisfaction (ΔR 2 = 0. 04, p =. 01) and anxiety (ΔR 2 = 0. 03, p =. 04) over 4 months. No independent variables were predictive of change in depression over 4 months, and disability level had no significant influence on outcomes. Conclusions: Psychological flexibility influences important outcomes in <b>muscle</b> <b>disorders.</b> Experimental studies are required to establish if increased psychological flexibility leads to improved outcomes...|$|R

50|$|Diabetic {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{a disorder}} {{of the heart}} muscle in people with diabetes.
