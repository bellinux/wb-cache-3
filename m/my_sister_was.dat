25|$|<b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> {{slim and}} {{beautiful}} and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E
2500|$|Sarah Blasko is {{the stage}} name of Sarah Elizabeth Blaskow {{who was born}} on 23 September 1976 {{and grew up in}} Sydney. Her family had just {{returned}} from French-speaking Réunion, where both of her parents were Christian missionaries. Blasko's mother, Ellie (died c. 2000 of bowel cancer), was a nurse and her father, Nikolai David Blaskow, is a teacher. Her father is from a Bulgarian-German background. Blasko has an older sister, Kate. Upon their return to Australia, her parents frequently changed denominations including Anglican, Baptist, Uniting, and Charismatic; and settled at a Pentecostal church in Sydney, which later became the Hillsong Church. Blasko started singing at church with her tone-deaf mother alongside. She later recalled [...] "usic was something I kind of fell into. <b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> always the singer of the family, I wanted to be a vet. I grew up going to church which was often a very musical place".|$|E
2500|$|People {{close to}} Zahau {{expressed}} {{doubt that she}} would have committed suicide. Zahau's elder sister {{said in an interview that}} [...] "I still believe my sister didn't take her life", and in a written statement on behalf of the family wrote that [...] "Rebecca valued her life and lived her life to its fullest. Rebecca loved God, her family and life." [...] Her younger sister commented more strongly by e-mail, [...] "Becky did not commit suicide. <b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> murdered." [...] Her former trainer also stated that [...] "She was always happy [...] always smiling when she came in. I didn't see a problem or anything like that." [...] Family members disputed police characterizations of Zahau as depressed, describing her instead that as a happy person. Furthermore, they state that Zahau believed as a Christian that suicide was wrong. After the suicide ruling, Neil Nalepa was quoted as stating, [...] "I would not believe Rebecca would commit suicide. It’s out of character." [...] However, Sheriff Bill Gore, who investigated the death, stated of the family's reluctance to accept the suicide ruling, [...] "We laid out the case extensively to them in Missouri to answer their questions, and it’s unfortunate she can't accept the results." [...] On September 7, the family launched a website [...] seeking donations to fund their own investigation into Zahau's death. The site states: [...] "It was obvious that the Sheriff’s Department had worked too hard to paint this picture of suicide and they were not about to let the Zahaus ruin it." [...] In late September, they continued to demand that the case be re-opened.|$|E
