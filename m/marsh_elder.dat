5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} Eastern U.S.A. domesticated numerous crops. Sunflowers, tobacco, varieties of squash and Chenopodium, as well as crops no longer grown, including <b>marsh</b> <b>elder</b> and little barley, were domesticated. Wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested. The most common varieties of strawberry were domesticated from Eastern North America. Two major crops, pecans and Concord grapes, were utilized extensively in prehistoric times but {{do not appear to}} have been domesticated until the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Archaic {{the climate}} became {{more similar to}} modern {{with the end of}} the Hypsithermal. The number of Late Archaic Sites {{increased}} in Iowa, perhaps reflective of increased populations allowed by climate change and new subsistence strategies. The Late Archaic sees the first indication of mound building in Iowa, as well as direct evidence of domesticated plants, and large, long-term settlements. The Red Ocher Culture appeared in northeast Iowa, associated with copper artifacts and mound building. Numerous Late Archaic sites have been excavated in eastern Iowa, some showing the gradual adaptation of cultigens, including squash, little barley, <b>marsh</b> <b>elder,</b> and barnyard grass. Sites with evidence for early cultigens in Iowa include the Edgewater Park Site in Coralville, the Gast Spring Site, and the Sand Run Slough West Site. In western Iowa, Late Archaic sites are common, however large bison killing or processing sites are less common than before, and there is little evidence for the use of domesticated plants.|$|E
25|$|Other {{plants of}} the EAC include little barley (Hordeum pusillum), {{goosefoot}} or lambsquarters (Chenopodium berlandieri), erect knotweed (Polygonum erectum), maygrass (Phalaris caroliniana), sumpweed or <b>marsh</b> <b>elder</b> (Iva annua), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus).|$|E
50|$|Iva is a genus of {{wind-pollinated}} {{plants in}} the daisy family, described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753. Plants of this genus are known generally as <b>marsh</b> <b>elders.</b> The genus is native to North America.|$|R

5000|$|... α-Humulene {{has been}} found in many {{aromatic}} plants on all continents, often together with its isomer β-caryophyllene. Proven α-humulene emitters into the atmosphere are pine trees, orange orchards, <b>marsh</b> <b>elders,</b> tobacco, and sunflower fields. [...] α-Humulene is contained in the essential oils of aromatic plants such as Salvia officinalis (common sage, culinary sage), Lindera strychnifolia Uyaku or Japanese spicebush, ginseng species, up to 29.9% of the essential oils of Mentha spicata, the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), 10% of the leaf oil of Litsea mushaensis, a Chinese laurel tree, 4% of the leaf extract of Cordia verbenacea, a bush in coastal tropical South America (erva baleeira), but with 25% trans-Caryophyllene {{and is one of the}} chemical compounds that contribute to the taste of the spice Persicaria odorata or Vietnamese coriander and the characteristic aroma of Cannabis sativa.|$|R
25|$|In general, {{facilitation}} is {{more likely}} to occur in physically stressful environments than in favorable environments, where competition {{may be the most important}} interaction among species. This can also occur in a single habitat containing a gradient from low to high stress. For example, along a New England, USA, salt marsh tidal gradient, a presence of black needle rush (Juncus gerardii) increased the fitness of <b>marsh</b> <b>elder</b> (Iva annua) shrubs in lower elevations, where soil salinity was higher. The rush shaded the soil, which decreased evapotranspiration, and in turn decreased soil salinity. However, at higher elevations where soil salinity was lower, <b>marsh</b> <b>elder</b> fitness was decreased in the presence of the rush, due to increased competition for resources. Thus, the nature of species interactions may shift with environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{plant species}} at Riverton that can {{confidently}} {{be identified as}} domesticated was sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This {{is based on the}} larger size of the seed in the domesticated than in the wild varieties. Remains of plants that were used, but {{may or may not have}} been domesticated at Riverton, include bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), squash (C. pepo), wild barley (Hordeum pusillum) and <b>marsh</b> <b>elder</b> (Iva annua).|$|E
25|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Wichita {{have lived in the}} eastern Great Plains from the Red River north to Nebraska for at least 2,000 years. Early Wichita people were hunters and gatherers who gradually adopted agriculture. Farming villages began to appear about 900 CE on terraces above the Washita and South Canadian Rivers in Oklahoma. These 10th century communities cultivated maize, beans, squash, <b>marsh</b> <b>elder</b> (Iva annua), and tobacco. They also hunted deer, rabbits, turkey, and, increasingly, bison, and caught fish and collected mussels in the rivers. These villagers lived in rectangular, thatched-roof houses. Archaeologists describe the Washita River Phase from 1250 to 1450, when local populations grew and villages of up to 20 houses were spaced every two or so miles along the rivers. These farmers may have had contact with the Panhandle culture villages in the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles, Farming villages along the Canadian River. The Panhandle villagers showed signs of adopting cultural characteristics of the Pueblo peoples of the Rio Grande Valley.|$|E

50|$|In the Wensum Valley {{immediately}} {{above the}} flood plain between Hellesdon and Drayton over 100 species of vegetation {{have been recorded}} including hawthorn, guelder rose, wild rose, blackthorn, scrub oak, gorse and broom. Many wild flowers can be found such as shepherd's purse, ox-eye daisy, white campion and meadow saxifrage. Closer to the river the soil becomes heavier and wetter and vegetation includes alder, <b>elder,</b> <b>marsh</b> marigold and willow. To the north of Drayton the way passes over a variety of soil types. On the chalky soils typical plants found are the sycamore, birch and chalk grassland species such as wild carrot, self heal, bird's-foot-trefoil, knapweed and mullein. On the sandy soils bracken, birch and gorse are the more dominant species. Also, of note, are lichens which are colonising many of the concrete structures and bridges along the track. Because {{of the variety of}} wild plants that are found, the way is an important area for insects, birds and small mammals.|$|R
2500|$|Indians {{learned early}} that {{the seeds of}} these three species were edible and easily {{harvested}} in quantity because they grew in dense stands. [...] C. pepo was important also because the gourd could {{be made into a}} lightweight container that was useful to a seminomadic band. Chenopods have edible leaves, related to spinach and chard, that may have also been gathered and eaten by Indians. Chenopod seeds are starchy; <b>marsh</b> <b>elder</b> has a highly nutritious oily seed similar to sunflower seeds.|$|E

50|$|Pre-contact Cherokee are {{considered}} {{to be part of the}} later Pisgah Phase of Southern Appalachia, which lasted from circa 1000 to 1500. Despite the consensus among most specialists in Southeast archeology and anthropology, some scholars contend that ancestors of the Cherokee people lived in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee for a far longer period of time. During the late Archaic and Woodland Period, Indians in the region began to cultivate plants such as <b>marsh</b> <b>elder,</b> lambsquarters, pigweed, sunflowers, and some native squash. People created new art forms such as shell gorgets, adopted new technologies, and developed an elaborate cycle of religious ceremonies.|$|E

50|$|Situated in the Piedmont {{region and}} crossed by three creeks (Rock Creek, Cabin John Creek, and Watts Branch), Rockville {{provided}} an excellent refuge for semi-nomadic Native Americans {{as early as}} 8000 BC. By the first millennium BC, {{a few of these}} groups had settled down into year-round agricultural communities that exploited the native flora, including sunflowers and <b>marsh</b> <b>elder.</b> By AD 1200, these early groups (dubbed Montgomery Indians by later archaeologists) were increasingly drawn into conflict with the Senecas and Susquehannocks who had migrated south from Pennsylvania and New York. Within the present-day boundaries of the city, six prehistoric sites have been uncovered and documented, along with numerous artifacts several thousand years old. By the year 1700, under pressure from European colonists, the majority of these original inhabitants had been driven away.|$|E
50|$|The Harris's sparrow breeds in stunted {{coniferous}} {{forests and}} adjacent scrubs, especially {{areas of the}} grand boreal forests where stands of spruce abut mossy bogs. They often nest near the northern limit of tree growth in the forest-tundra ecotone. Typical plant life in the breeding grounds consist of white and black spruce (Picea glauca and P. mariana) and American larch (Larix laricina), dwarf birch-willow, and wet sedge meadow and shrubby tundra with dwarf ericad/lichen plant life. The species migrates mainly through tallgrass prairies to winter in open woodlands, woodland edges and clearings, hedgerows, dense riparian thickets and around brush piles. The Harris's sparrow regularly occurs at feeders in suburban and rural gardens during the wintertime. They typically avoid dry shortgrass prairies and dense woods during winter. Migrating sparrows may be attracted to <b>marsh</b> <b>elder</b> (Iva annua) and giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida).|$|E
