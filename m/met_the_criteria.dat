5|$|Based on {{combined}} {{data from}} SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, {{the rate of}} past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% {{of those who did}} not drink alcohol in the past month <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} why this {{hurricane}} went unnamed, {{even though it}} clearly <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> for doing so. Any statement about why is purely speculative at this point. The hurricane is the furthest north a tropical cyclone existed in the Eastern Pacific, and is also the northernmost existence for a Pacific hurricane. It was the only tropical cyclone {{to exist in the}} central Pacific this year. No damage or casualties were reported, although it did hassle a few ships.|$|E
40|$|Four pigeons {{were trained}} in a one-way shuttle box {{avoidance}} situation. Three of <b>the</b> birds <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> of 90 % avoidances; the fourth, although frequently avoiding successfully, was too erratic to meet <b>the</b> <b>criterion.</b> Avoidance responding {{in two of the}} birds was subsequently extinguished, showing that the response was true avoidance, and not escape from the buzzer warning stimulus. In Experiment 2, the three birds that had met criterion in Experiment 1 {{were trained in}} a two-way avoidance task, and all three <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> of 90 % avoidances. The shuttle box therefore provides a rapid and reliable method of obtaining avoidance performance in pigeons...|$|R

The PKS was the only party not to nominate candidates, but it threw its support behind PAN's Amien Rais.|$|E
5|$|By early August14, the shear had {{substantially}} {{disrupted the}} storm, leaving the low-level center of circulation exposed {{from the area}} of convection, which was also deteriorating. After meandering, the storm began to move westward. Forecasters expected it to resume a northwestward track as high pressure {{to the south of}} Bermuda was forecast to weaken and another high was predicted to form southwest of the Azores. By 1800UTC on August14, the strong shear had further weakened the storm, and it no longer <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> for a tropical cyclone. It degenerated into a remnant low, and the National Hurricane Center issued their final advisory on the cyclone. Moving westward, it occasionally produced bursts of convective activity, before dissipating on August18.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, extensive psychological effects were documented. Difficulty during clean-up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children. A sampling of 378adolescents by the University of South Carolina's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> for PTSD. Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60children discussed killing themselves between December1992 and January1993. A panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the University of Miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD. Within six months, the circumstances related to {{the aftermath}} of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{main source}} of noise in open plan office are conversations. Office work {{standards}} in such premises are attained by applying specific acoustic adaptation. This article {{presents the results of}} pilot tests and acoustic evaluation of open space rooms. Material and Methods: Acoustic properties of 6 open plan office rooms were the subject of the tests. Evaluation parameters, measurement methods and criterial values were adopted according to the following standards: PN-EN ISO 3382 - 3 : 2012, PN-EN ISO 3382 - 2 : 2010, PN-B- 02151 - 4 : 2015 - 06 and PN-B- 02151 - 3 : 2015 - 10. Results: The reverberation time was 0. 33 – 0. 55 s (maximum permissible value in offices – 0. 6 s; <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> was <b>met),</b> sound absorption coefficient in relation to 1 m 2 of the room’s plan was 0. 77 – 1. 58 m 2 (minimum permissible value – 1. 1 m 2; 2 out of 6 rooms <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion),</b> distraction distance was 8. 5 – 14 m (maximum permissible value – 5 m; none of <b>the</b> rooms <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion),</b> A-weighted sound pressure level of speech at a distance of 4 m was 43. 8 – 54. 7 dB (maximum permissible value – 48 dB; 2 out of 6 rooms <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion),</b> spatial decay rate of the speech was 1. 8 – 6. 3 dB (minimum permissible value – 7 dB; none of <b>the</b> rooms <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion).</b> Conclusions: Standard acoustic treatment, containing sound absorbing suspended ceiling, sound absorbing materials on the walls, carpet flooring and sound absorbing workplace barriers, is not sufficient. These rooms require specific advanced acoustic solutions. Med Pr 2016; 67 (5) : 653 – 66...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to train staff on {{implementing}} naturalistic teaching strategies to present learning opportunities within the context of play using video modeling. Two different types of video modeling were compared; the videos either demonstrated what therapists should do or what they should not do. Six participants were randomly assigned to watch each type of video. Participants who did not meet <b>the</b> mastery <b>criterion</b> after viewing <b>the</b> first video were presented with the other video modeling. If they still did not meet <b>the</b> <b>criterion,</b> feedback was presented. Results indicated that both types of video modeling and feedback were required for four participants. One participant <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> after watching <b>the</b> correct video modeling while another participant <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> after watching both types of video modeling without feedback.

5|$|By October5, {{the eye of}} Nora was {{no longer}} evident on {{satellite}} imagery, which indicated {{the beginning of a}} weakening trend. However, a Special Sensor Microwave/Imager observed a small eye that was open to the northwest. The convection became ragged, and on October6 the winds decreased below hurricane-force. Around the same time, a strong approaching mid-level trough caused Nora to slow and turn to the east. Continued wind shear and the presence of dry air stripped the thunderstorms away from the center, and by October7 all of the deep convection had dissipated. As a result, it was downgraded to a tropical depression, and Nora weakened {{to the extent that it}} barely <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> for being a tropical cyclone. The NHC maintained advisories due to the circulation's proximity to western Mexico, as well as the unlikely potential for redeveloping thunderstorms due to its movement over warmer waters. Nora accelerated to the east-northeast and later to the northeast due to the advancing trough. As it approached western Mexico, an area of curved convection unexpectedly developed over the center. Without additional redevelopment, the poorly defined circulation of Nora made landfall near Mazatlán, Sinaloa early on October9. It dissipated shortly thereafter over the high terrain of western Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Nora was {{the final}} of five {{tropical}} cyclones to make landfall in the 2003 Pacific hurricane season. The fourteenth named storm and fifth hurricane of the season, Nora developed on October1 from a tropical wave. It slowly intensified as it moved northwestward, intensifying into a hurricane on October4. That day, Nora rapidly intensified to its peak of 100mph (160km/h), but the larger Hurricane Olaf to its east prevented further strengthening. An approaching trough turned the rapidly weakening system to the east toward Mexico. By October7, it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Although it no longer <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> for being a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center continued issuing advisories due to the cyclone's proximity with land. Nora unexpectedly redeveloped an area of thunderstorms and moved ashore near Mazatlán, Sinaloa on October9 before dissipating. The depression dropped locally heavy rainfall in western Mexico, {{but there were no}} reports of damage. Later, the remnants combined with Olaf and an upper-level low to produce flooding and a tornado in central Texas.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{qualifications}} {{required of}} presidential candidates resulted in walkovers during {{the elections of}} 1999, 2005 and 2017. The incumbent President Ong Teng Cheong did not run {{for a second term}} at the 1999 presidential election, saying that he had no compelling reason to do so. In addition to the eventual winner, Sellapan Ramanathan (better known as S. R. Nathan), the other potential candidates were Tan Soo Phuan, a member of the opposition Workers' Party of Singapore; and Ooi Boon Ewe, a private tutor turned real estate executive. Both of them were found not to have <b>met</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> to stand for election. As a result, Nathan, a former civil servant and Ambassador to the United States, was deemed to have been elected President. At the presidential election of 2005, the persons who applied for a certificate of eligibility to contest the election were Nathan, Ooi and Ramachandran Govindasamy Naidu. However, as Nathan was again the only candidate issued with a certificate, he was elected by default on nomination day.|$|E

Results indicated that changes in cognitive profiles over time were similar for all groups and there was a slight improvement in growth scores suggesting developmental change. In terms of ASD and ADHD symptomology, we also found stable differences across groups over time. Collectively, these findings highlight the pressing need to explore symptomology longitudinally across disorders at high risk from comorbid ASD and ADHD diagnoses. © W. S.
