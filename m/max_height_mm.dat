40|$|Fiber Bragg Grating or FBG sensors {{are gaining}} {{more and more}} {{interest}} in structural health monitoring of composite materials. Often, the weakest point in such a system is the ingress point of the fiber sensing chain into the composite material. For this reason we have developed a strongly miniaturized FBG interrogator unit with wireless power and data transmission, which can be incorporated in the composite structure. The interrogator {{is based on an}} arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) filter fabricated in a SOI technology, which is tailored in such a way to give large cross-talk between neighboring channels. The AWG signals are read by a linear 128 pixel InGaAs array flip-chipped on top of the Photonic Circuit (PIC). The spectrometer unit is completed with a ROIC mounted on the same substrate. The SLED and remaining electronics are integrated on a small and thin substrate and surrounded by the wireless antenna. The interrogator has an overall dimension of 100 mm diameter by <b>max</b> 7 <b>mm</b> <b>height.</b> The power dissipation of the electronics unit is limited to 1. 5 W. The unit is capable of measuring strain values as low as 5 micro-strain...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{topography}} {{data on the}} NAMOC {{originate from}} wide-range sonar scans. With a total length of about 3800 km, NAMOC {{is one of the}} longest underwater channels in the world. It is 100-200 m deep and 2-5 km wide at the channel floor. The rising levees of the NAMOC (about 100 m above the sea bed) often hinder confluence of some tributaries, which instead run along NAMOC for hundreds of km. Its western (right-hand, <b>max.</b> <b>height</b> 250 m) levee rises some 100 m above the eastern one (<b>max.</b> <b>height</b> 150 m). This asymmetry is attributed to the Coriolis effect affecting the turbidity currents, which reach velocities of 6-8.5 m/s and deposit silt and clay over the channel. The levee is absent {{in some parts of the}} NAMOC, for example between 56°N and 57°N, due to the local side-flows of sand.|$|R
