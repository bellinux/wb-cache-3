5|$|MS usually {{appears in}} adults {{in their late}} twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in {{childhood}} and after 50 years of age. The primary progressive subtype is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> people in their fifties. Similar to many autoimmune disorders, the disease is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> women, and the trend may be increasing. As of 2008, globally it is about two times <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> women than in men. In children, it is even <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, Boletus pinophilus {{is found}} in Britain, where it is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> Scotland, and in France, where it is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> the south. The bolete is {{considered}} vulnerable in the Czech Republic. It is sold commercially in Finland.|$|E
5|$|LDLR {{mutations}} are <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> certain populations, {{presumably because}} of a genetic phenomenon known as the founder effect—they were founded by {{a small group of}} individuals, one or several of whom was a carrier of the mutation. The Afrikaner, French Canadians, Lebanese Christians, and Finns have high rates of specific mutations that make FH particularly common in these groups. APOB mutations are <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> Central Europe.|$|E

5|$|Within nations, it is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> higher {{socioeconomic}} groups. Males {{and females}} are affected in an equal ratio, and the peak age of onset between 10 and 19 years. About 80% {{of people with}} aphthous stomatitis first developed the condition {{before the age of}} 30. There have been reports of ethnic variation.

5|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is an autoimmune {{disorder in}} which the thyroid gland is infltrated by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> females than males, much more common {{after the age of}} 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease vitiligo.|$|E

5|$|Severe {{disease is}} <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause {{the full spectrum of}} disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
5|$|Strep throat is {{a common}} {{bacterial}} infection in children. It {{is the cause of}} 15–40% of sore throats among children and 5–15% among adults.
