40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a Gaussian two-hop network where {{the source and}} the destination can communicate only via a relay node who is both an eavesdropper and a Byzantine adversary. Both the source and the destination nodes are allowed to transmit, and the relay receives a superposition of their transmitted signals. We propose a new coding scheme that satisfies two requirements simultaneously: the transmitted message must be kept secret from the relay node, and the destination {{must be able to}} detect any Byzantine attack that the relay node might launch reliably and fast. The three main components of the proposed schemearethenestedlattice code, the privacy amplification scheme, and the algebraic <b>manipulation</b> <b>detection</b> (AMD) code. Specifically, for the Gaussian two-hop network, we show that lattice coding can successfully pair with AMD codes enabling its first application to a noisy channel model. We prove, using this new coding scheme, that the probability that the Byzantine attack goes undetected decreases exponentially fast with respect to the number of channel uses, while the loss in the secrecy rate, compared to the rate achievable when the relay is honest, can be made arbitrarily small. In addition, in contrast with prior work in Gaussian channels, the notion of secrecy provided here is strong secrecy.

40|$|Methods for the {{manipulation}} of single magnetic particles have become very interesting, in particular for in vitro biological studies. Most of these studies require an external microscope to provide the operator with feedback for controlling the particle motion, thus preventing the use of magnetic particles in high-throughput experiments. In this paper, a simple and compact system with integrated electrical feedback is presented, implementing in the very same device both the <b>manipulation</b> and <b>detection</b> of the transit of single particles. The proposed platform is based on zig-zag shaped magnetic nanostructures, where transverse magnetic domain walls are pinned at the corners and attract magnetic particles in suspension. By applying suitable external magnetic fields, the domain walls move to the nearest corner, thus causing the step by step displacement of the particles along the nanostructure. The very same structure is also employed for detecting the bead transit. Indeed, {{the presence of the}} magnetic particle in suspension over the domain wall affects the depinning field required for its displacement. This characteristic field can be monitored through anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements, thus implementing an integrated electrical feedback of the bead transit. In particular, the individual <b>manipulation</b> and <b>detection</b> of single 1 -μm sized beads is demonstrated...|$|R
