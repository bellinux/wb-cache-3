Hamilton took his pit stop on the 26th lap and handed back first place to teammate Rosberg. Bottas also fell behind Pérez but re-passed the latter going into the Rettifilo chicane. Hamilton's race engineer Peter Bonnington told him over the radio to remain at least {{two and a half}} seconds behind teammate Rosberg to gain the slipstream advantage without losing downforce and conserve tyre life for an attack in the race's closing period. Hamilton was aware from previous experience earlier in the season that the method to pass a driver was to do so when tyre grip was optimal otherwise {{it would not have been}} possible to draw close enough to affect a passing manoeuvre. He recorded the fastest lap of the race at that point to move within seven-tenths of a second behind teammate Rosberg by the start of lap 28, causing debate among the Mercedes pit lane members.|$|E

50|$|An {{interruption}} is {{a mechanism}} for automatically changing the program state; it is used for both synchronous and asynchronous events. The architecture defines 5 classes of interruption. There are two storage fields assigned to each class of interruption on the S/360; an old PSW double-word and a new PSW double-word. The processor stores the PSW, with an interruption code inserted, into the old PSW location and then loads the PSW from the new PSW location. This generally replaces the instruction address, thereby effecting a branch, and (optionally) sets and/or resets other fields within the PSW, thereby effecting a <b>mode</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly complex. A modern car, for example, requires a multitude of control tasks, such as braking, active suspension, and collision avoidance. These tasks not only exhibit different degrees of safety criticality but also change their criticalities as the driving <b>mode</b> <b>changes.</b> For instance, the suspension task is {{a critical part of}} the stability of the car at high speed, but it is only a comfort feature at low speed. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure timing guarantees for the system with respect to the tasks’ criticalities, not only within each mode but also during <b>mode</b> <b>changes.</b> This paper presents a partitioned multi-processor scheduling scheme for multi-modal mixed-criticality real-time systems. Our scheme consists of a packing algorithm and a scheduling algorithm for each processor that take into account both <b>mode</b> <b>changes</b> and criticalities. The packing algorithm maximizes the schedulable utilization across modes using the sustained criticality of each task, which captures the overall criticality of the task across modes. The scheduling algorithm combines Rate-Monotonic scheduling with a mode transition enforcement mechanism that relies on the transitional zero-slack instants of tasks to control low-criticality tasks during <b>mode</b> <b>changes,</b> so as to preserve the schedulability of high-criticality tasks. We also present an implementation of our scheduler in the Linux operating system, as well as an experimental evaluation to illustrate its practicality.

50|$|US Summary Comments on Draft Final Report of Aircraft Accident Flash Airlines flight 604, Boeing 737-300, SU-ZCF 3 January 2004, Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.Quote {{from page}} 5 of 7:"Distraction. A {{few seconds before}} the captain called for the {{autopilot}} to be engaged, the aircraft's pitch began increasing and airspeed began decreasing. These deviations continued {{during and after the}} autopilot engagement/disengagement sequence. The captain ultimately allowed the airspeed to decrease to 35 knots below his commanded target airspeed of 220 knots and the climb pitch to reach 22°, which is 10° more than the standard climb pitch of about 12°. During this time, the captain also allowed the aircraft to enter a gradually steepening right bank, which was inconsistent with the flight crew's departure clearance to perform a climbing left turn. These pitch, airspeed and bank angle deviations indicated that the captain directed his attention away from monitoring the attitude indications during and after the autopilot disengagement process.Changes in the autoflight system's mode status offer the best explanation for the captain's distraction. The following changes occurred in the autoflight system's mode status shortly before the initiation of the right roll: (1) manual engagement of the autopilot, (2) automatic transition of roll guidance from heading select to control wheel steering-roll (CWS-R), (3) manual disengagement of the autopilot, and (4) manual reengagement of heading select for roll guidance. The transition to the CWS-R mode occurred in accordance with nominal system operation because the captain was not closely following the flight director guidance {{at the time of the}} autopilot engagement. The captain might not have expected the transition, and he might not have understood why it occurred. The captain was probably referring to the <b>mode</b> <b>change</b> from command mode to CWS-R when he stated, “see what the aircraft did?,” shortly after it occurred. The available evidence indicates that the unexpected <b>mode</b> <b>change</b> and the flight crew’s subsequent focus of attention on reestablishing roll guidance for the autoflight system were the most likely reasons for the captain’s distraction from monitoring the attitude".|$|E

Previous research has shown that crews do not spend enough time on the flight mode annunciator, and skip mode call-outs as well as making call-outs in advance of annunciations; there has been no report of any system or regularity in the shedding and adaptation of callouts. One reason could be the contrived empirical simulator settings of such research, which we aimed to augment with natural observations of real cockpit work reported here. With the hope of answering, in more detail, how required verbal coordination of annunciated <b>mode</b> <b>changes</b> gets adapted to real settings we observed 19 line flights with three different airlines from the first observer's seat in the cockpit. We found that many callouts were simply shed in high-workload situations, and found regularity in the kind of callouts being shed.

Our results suggested that FMA callouts were not used as a tool to detect or remember automation <b>mode</b> <b>changes</b> but as a vehicle for coordinating between the pilots themselves, a finding that could serve as a reminder for future design of callout procedures.
