5|$|In 2007, Preckwinkle pursued {{disclosure}} of Chicago Police Department officers who used excessive force. The United States District Court had {{ruled that the}} records be unsealed and {{made available to the}} public. However, on July 13, 2007, the city filed an emergency motion to stay the judge's order. When the city argued in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to against disclosure, it <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that aldermen would have access to the information. Preckwinkle's August 23, 2007, request for disclosure was denied.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, Texas Tech made their third {{unanswered}} touchdown—a 20-yard pass to Crabtree—to bring the score to 56–17. The Owls scored their final touchdown {{of the game}} when C. J. Ugokwe rushed up the middle for a seven-yard gain. Fangmeier <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> after.|$|E

25|$|Microsoft, {{in their}} {{response}} to McGeady's testimony, <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that his testimony contained several pro-Microsoft threads, and that Intel practiced similar cross product subsidization, distributing free Intel Architecture Labs software funded by microprocessor revenues. They also claimed that Microsoft's influence over Intel and its microprocessors was unrelated to the downstream software segment.|$|E
25|$|The war effects also <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> in the economy, {{the kingdom}} {{continued}} suffering a trade serious paralysis {{with all its}} Atlantic traditional customers; England, France, Flanders, and even particularly serious with its main customer, Portugal, whose border had been closed for over three decades due to war with what the Habsburgs sought to avoid {{the independence of the}} Portuguese kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Another Harrell to Crabtree pass {{followed}} by successful PAT by Alex Trlica again tied the score. However, Oklahoma State answered when quarterback Zac Robinson rushed {{up the middle}} 48-yards for a TD and Ricks <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> after. The next two scores {{were made by the}} Red Raiders—a touchdown pass to Eric Morris and another to Michael Crabtree {{followed by}} PATs.|$|E

25|$|In {{his speech}} at the Fields Medal award {{ceremony}} in 1954, Hermann Weyl gave high praise to Serre, and also <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the award was {{for the first time}} awarded to a non-analyst. Serre subsequently changed his research focus. However, Weyl's perception that the central place of classical analysis had been challenged has subsequently been justified, as has his assessment of Serre's place in this change.|$|E
25|$|Eugène never led large {{formations}} into battle, yet Napoleon {{appointed him}} {{commander of the}} Army of Italy. To prepare his stepson Eugène for the role, the emperor wrote him many detailed letters advising him how to defend Italy. He urged Eugène to fall back from the Isonzo River line to the Piave River if the Austrians invaded in strength. Napoleon <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the Adige River was an extremely important strategic position. He did not believe Austria was going to attack in April {{and he did not}} want to provoke his enemy by massing his armies. Thus, Eugène's army remained somewhat dispersed.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 2009, the U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission, {{which had}} widely been {{expected}} to release its findings from the statistics-based audit, delayed the announcement again as U.S. and ally envoys pressured Karzai and Abdullah to state their acceptance of the findings before the ECC announcement and {{to work out a}} power-sharing deal. A senior American official <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of stating that Karzai and Abdullah together won more than 70% of the votes in the first round, ensuring the credibility of a government in which they shared power. A Karzai spokesman indicated that both foreign and Afghan officials were proffering formulas for power sharing, but that Karzai had rejected them and would not discuss power sharing until after a winner is declared. Abdullah also reiterated that he would consider negotiating after the results were announced.|$|E
50|$|Stoke <b>made</b> <b>the</b> trip to Goodison Park for {{the first}} time since 1985 still looking for their first away win in the Premier League. The Toffees took control early on and goals from Brazilian Jô and Joleon Lescott gave the home side a 2-0 half-time lead. Stoke responded in the second half through a Shawcross header and came close to getting an {{equaliser}} but Marouane Fellaini <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> safe for Everton in added time.|$|R

50|$|On {{his turn}} {{when he has}} the lead, a player may marry a Queen-King couple of the same suit by playing one and {{simultaneously}} showing the other. Regular marriages are worth 20 card points and trump marriages are worth 40. A marriage or meld is usually announced {{in some way to}} the other player, often by saying <b>the</b> number of <b>points</b> <b>made.</b> <b>The</b> <b>points</b> do not count towards the player's total until he has taken at least one trick.|$|R
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, Barth {{became an}} {{important}} voice in support both of German penitence and of reconciliation with churches abroad. Together with Hans-Joachim Iwand, he authored the Darmstadt Statement in 1947– a more concrete statement of German guilt and responsibility for the Third Reich and Second World War than the 1945 Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt. In it, he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the Church's willingness to side with anti-socialist and conservative forces had led to its susceptibility for National Socialist ideology. In the context of the developing Cold War, that controversial statement was rejected by anti-Communists in the West who supported the CDU course of re-militarization, as well as by East German dissidents who believed that it did not sufficiently depict the dangers of Communism. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. In the 1950s, Barth sympathized with the peace movement and opposed German rearmament.|$|E
25|$|Although British Prime Minister John Major {{rejected}} John Hume's {{requests for}} a public inquiry into the killings, his successor, Tony Blair, decided to start one. A second commission of inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville, was established in January 1998 to re-examine Bloody Sunday. The other judges were John Toohey QC, a former Justice of the High Court of Australia who had worked on Aboriginal issues (he replaced New Zealander Sir Edward Somers QC, who retired from the Inquiry in 2000 for personal reasons), and Mr Justice William Hoyt QC, former Chief Justice of New Brunswick {{and a member of}} the Canadian Judicial Council. The hearings were concluded in November 2004, and the report was published 15 June 2010. The Saville Inquiry was a more comprehensive study than the Widgery Tribunal, interviewing a wide range of witnesses, including local residents, soldiers, journalists and politicians. Lord Saville declined to comment on the Widgery report and <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the Saville Inquiry was a judicial inquiry into Bloody Sunday, not the Widgery Tribunal.|$|E

500|$|The court then {{heard that}} the CID started {{investigating}} the tombstone on 11 May 1983 and had seized the original piece of paper from the tombstone-maker's shop in Choa Chu Kang. Chu Boon's defence lawyer was J.B. Jeyaretnam who had long been a consistent thorn {{in the side of}} Singapore's political establishment. Jeyaretnam established that the instigation for the CID investigation and arrest had come from [...] "a government department". In mitigation, Jeyaretnam <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that, apart from immediate family and friends, the public would not have known about the 'subversive' tombstone nor its inscription in Singapore's biggest cemetery.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{continued}} making crank {{calls as}} MacPhisto, but the targets {{changed with the}} location of each concert. Many of them were local politicians that Bono wished to mock by engaging them in character as the devil. He enjoyed making these calls, saying, [...] "When you're dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, so if you tell somebody you really like what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment." [...] The band intended for MacPhisto to add humour while making a point. Said the Edge, [...] "That character was a great device for saying {{the opposite of what}} you meant. It <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> so easily and with real humor." [...] A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to the plot of the C. S. Lewis novel The Screwtape Letters.|$|E
500|$|Collider.com's Dave Trumbore gave The Flash episode an [...] "A-", saying, it was [...] "fun" [...] {{seeing the}} {{characters}} together. He {{noted that the}} episode pointed out the many challenges Barry Allen [...] "faces as a young up-and-coming crimefighter". He felt that Arrow's [...] "knocks" [...] <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that [...] "Barry's superpowers are an amazing gift ... he must hone and perfect to become a truly heroic character." [...] Trumbore also [...] "loved how Arrow's attention to detail and commitment to bettering himself through training clashed with Flash's carefree style and almost lazy attitude {{when it came to}} beating up baddies". Agard's expectations for the episode were [...] "not disappointed". He felt it delivered [...] "on both the action front" [...] with its impeccable, [...] "epic" [...] fight scene, and [...] "on the character front". While the viewer can enjoy the interaction between the teams everything that happens in the episode pushes [...] "this The Flashs stories forward".|$|E

500|$|Kelly {{has written}} songs with and for {{numerous}} artists, including Mick Thomas, Geyer, Kate Ceberano, Vika and Linda Bull, Nick Cave, Nick Barker, Kasey Chambers, Yothu Yindi, Archie Roach, Gyan, Monique Brumby, Kelly Willis, Missy Higgins, and Troy Cassar-Daley. He has described how some songs he writes are suited to other vocal ranges. [...] "Quite often, I'm {{trying to write}} {{a certain kind of}} song and it's more ambitious than what my voice will get to. That's how I started writing songs with other people in mind". Kelly and Carmody's [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow" [...] was analysed by Sydney University's Linguistics professor James R Martin. [...] " [...] render the story as a narrative ... with the familiar Orientation, Complication, Evaluation, Resolution and Coda staging". Martin finds that Kelly and Carmody <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that when people exert their rights with support from friends, they may defeat those with prestige.|$|E
500|$|Willy {{has always}} <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> to his sons that being popular and having {{contacts}} {{is the key}} to success. His older son, Biff, causes [...] "old hopes and boiling resentments" [...] to return by visiting home. Willy is loved by Biff, who nonetheless does not get along with him. [...] Their relationship is the emotional lynchpin of the production. “In fact, Willy's logical mind becomes blind…” Biff attempts to help his father see what has become of him. In the end, Biff decides that he must force his father to see the truth rather than his fanciful images, for his own good, regardless of its toll on his father. [...] This is the emotional climax of the show as he bares his soul saying [...] "Pop, I'm nothing! I'm nothing, Pop! Can't you understand that? There's no spite in it any more. I'm just what I am, that's all." [...] At Willy's funeral, Biff states that [...] "He had the wrong dreams...He never knew who he was.".|$|E
500|$|Nghiep {{was briefly}} jailed by Yunnan authorities, but {{continued}} to run the party from his cell. Upon his release in 1933, Nghiep consolidated the party with similar groups in the area, including some followers of Phan Bội Châu who had formed a Canton-based organisation with similar aims in 1925. Chau's group had formed {{in opposition to the}} communist tendencies of Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Youth League. However, Ho betrayed Chau to eliminate a potential rival and to pocket a reward. With nationalist Chinese aid, Chau's followers had set up a League of Oppressed Oriental Peoples, a Pan-Asian group that ended in failure. In 1932 the League <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of declaring a [...] "Provisional Indochinese Government" [...] at Canton. In July 1933, Chau's group was integrated into Nghiep's Yunnan organisation. In 1935, Nghiep surrendered to the French consulate in Shanghai. The remainder of the VNQDD was paralysed by infighting and began losing political relevance, with only moderate activity until the outbreak of World War II and Japan's invasion of French Indochina in 1940. They attempted to organise workers along the Yunnan railway, threatening occasional border assaults, with little success.|$|E
