500|$|A Billboard {{reviewer}} praised [...] "What Now" [...] {{and called}} the song an [...] "emotional highlight on an album filled with moments of resonance in its second half." [...] Giovanny Caquias of Culture Blues wrote that the song feels like the first [...] "candid" [...] and [...] "insightful" [...] track on Unapologetic. He continued, [...] "Rihanna gets a little introspective on What Now, and doesnâ€™t resort to being overtly sexual or defiantly callous (<b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> later), which gave me the feeling that she stripped away her armor {{for a moment and}} actually allowed herself to be 'real'." [...] Daily News Jim Farber wrote that the song shows a heft.|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall {{also had}} mixed comments, {{comparing}} the episode to House and stating, [...] "And yet {{as much as}} Veronica was annoying me, as much as I wanted to yell at her for automatically jumping to conclusions with Weevil (<b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> in a minute), this was maybe my favorite episode of the season. [...] Hell, they even had a cliffhanger ending to the mystery arc {{for the first time}} in forever. I dug it." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{early summer}} 1981, while Raiders of the Lost Ark was being promoted, Columbia Pictures met with Speilberg {{to discuss the}} script, after having to develop Night Skies with the {{director}} as the intended sequel to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. However, the head of Columbia Pictures' marketing and research development, Marvin Atonowsky, concluded {{that it had a}} limited commercial potential, believing that it would appeal to mostly young kids. The President of Columbia's worldwide productions, John Veitch, also felt that the script wasn't good or scary enough to draw enough crowd. On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia Pictures CEO Frank Price passed on the project, calling it [...] "a wimpy Walt Disney movie" [...] and thus putting it in a turnaround, so Spielberg approached the more receptive Sid Sheinberg, president of MCA, the then-parent company of Universal Studios. Spielberg told Sheinberg to acquire the E.T. script from Columbia Pictures, which he did for $1 million and struck a deal with Price in which Columbia would retain 5% of the film's net profits. Veitch later recalled that [...] "I think [...] we made <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> picture than we did on any of our films." ...|$|E

2500|$|The storyline {{received}} generally positive attention. Describing the storyline, David Knox said [...] "series baddie Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) {{may have}} met his match in Diana (Jane Badler) when his Lassiters empire {{is about to}} be pulled from under him. But he has more than one enemy and Friday's mysterious episode that asks 'Who pushed P.R.?' is a soapie homage to Dallas famous 'Who Shot J.R?'" [...] Knox later called the storyline an [...] "el-cheapo riff on 'Who Shot J.R?'". Television critic Andrew Mercado said [...] "we had [...] "Who Pushed PR" [...] which wasn't quite [...] "Who Shot JR" [...] on Dallas circa 1981 but it's amazing they got as much suspense as they did in an elevator and then shoving short Paul Robinson off a balcony just one floor off the ground". Mercado later praised the plot saying [...] "They did the 6000th episode really well" [...] and that the key to Neighbours staying relevant was to focus less on suburban storylines and <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> type of drama. Mary Papadakis from the Herald Sun called the plot [...] "sinister" [...] and commented [...] " [...] goes to show there's never really a dull day on Neighbours". A Channel 5 website writer deemed the plot [...] "one of the show's most dramatic storylines to date". Shortly after the 6000th episode aired in Australia, a Holy Soap reporter revealed that fans of the show had taken to online forums to praise it and the whodunnit plot.|$|E
