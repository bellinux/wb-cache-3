40|$|THE FUNCTIONS OF MORPHONOLOGICAL VOWEL CHANGE Summary The article {{deals with}} morphonological {{interpretation}} of vowel change. Non-automatic vowel change makes {{contrast between the}} motivated word (<b>marked</b> <b>member)</b> and simple word (unmarked member) more expresive. Changes in the stem of basic word performs an informative function: {šūk-} + {-is}, {bar-} + {-stīti}, {pastab-} + {-a}. There are some oppositions in which the function of vowel change becomes close to an internal flexion: {lauž}ti ‘ to break smth’ : {lūž}ti ‘to break up (spontaneously) ’. In the Lithuanian language there are such word-formation oppositions in which semiosis can be recog­nized (a parallel between the content and expression) : {snig}ti ‘to snow’ : {sneig}ėti ‘to snow quietly’. That, vowel change can perform not only informative, but also an iconic functio...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} correlation between grammatical markedness and the phonological properties of outputs inflected for morpho-syntactic categories on a grammatical markedness hierarchy. The main claim made in the thesis is that, under otherwise similar phonological conditions, outputs carrying specifications for a <b>marked</b> <b>member</b> (g) of a given grammatical category (G) can license a given type of marked phonological structure (M) to an extent that is equal or greater than outputs inflected for the unmarked category.; I label this generalization 'Marked in the Marked' (MIM). Within the theoretical framework assumed for the dissertation (Optimality Theory, Prince and Smolensky 1993 / 2004), I propose that the universal repository of constraints (CON) be enriched so as to include a family of formal licensing constraints LICENSE(M,g) that license marked phonological structure (M) in output words that carry the morpho-syntactic specifications of the <b>marked</b> <b>member</b> (g) of G. I propose that the licensing constraint is functionally grounded {{in the sense that}} the marked value g is determined by recourse to language use factors such as frequency of occurrence in discourse. Only licensing constraints for marked values g are allowed in CON.; The content of the notions 'grammatical markedness' and 'phonological markedness' is reviewed and criteria for the two kinds of markedness are discussed. Manifestations of phonological markedness and their grammatical category underpinnings are discussed at the following levels: prosodic (Old Saxon), segmental (Romanian) and phonotactic (Mayak). For all these cases, the Marked in the Marked constraint schema (in interaction with other relevant constraints) and the factorial typology associated with it are shown to make the correct empirical predictions.; A functional grounding account of the MIM effects discussed in the dissertation is laid out. MIM phenomena are assumed to arise from factors of economy in language production in the sense that confining marked phonological structure to less frequent, grammatically marked forms contributes to minimization of speaker's effort. Also, the presence of marked phonological material in outputs inflected for the marked grammatical category may have certain advantages in language perception, retrieval and acquisition...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to assess various {{predictions}} made by H. and E. Clark with respect to the acquisition of certain dimensional adjectives. In addition, the performance of children with impaired language skills was compared with that of children with normally developing language. Eighteen subjects in the age range 3, 3 to 4 years were divided into two groups; those with adequate language (C group) and those with impaired language (E group). The dimensional adjective pairs of  "length", "tallness" and "width" were investigated on comprehension tasks of increasing dimensionality. A qualitative analysis of  the data, for  both C and Ε groups, revealed findings supporting the predictions concerning the order of dimensional adjective acquisition in terms of semantic complexity, the acquisition of  the unmarked pair member before the <b>marked</b> <b>member,</b> and the acquisition of the concept of polarity before dimensionality.

40|$|This paper extends a {{previous}} claim that auxiliary selection {{in the present}} perfect of monadic verbs reflects a pattern grounded in lexico-aspectual properties of individual verbs though mediated through their syntax. A novel argument {{in support of this}} conclusion is made, based on the cross-contextual typology of auxiliaries, showing that the cross-linguistic distribution of auxiliaries in the present perfect cannot be understood in isolation of other constructions requiring an auxiliary. In particular, it is argued that two sets of constraints restrict the mapping from lexico-aspectual features to a particular auxiliary (have or be). One set restricts the mapping from lexical-aspectual features to argument structure at the lexicon-syntax interface, the other restricts the mapping from argument structure to the <b>marked</b> <b>member</b> of the auxiliary pair (have). The analysis succeeds in predicting exactly 15 possible languages or patterns of auxiliary selection with monadic verbs, a variety of which are discussed throughout the paper. While the fundamental syntactic distinction made by the Unaccusative Hypothesis is confirmed by the formal analysis, it is argued that the present perfect imposes restrictions of its own on the argumental status of any verb entering the construction, on a par with constructions such as passives and resultatives...|$|E
40|$|GENITIVE OF QUANTITY: GRAMMATICAL GOVERNMENT AND SEMANTICS Summary Genitives {{governed by}} lexical units of {{quantity}} and partitive genitives {{are used in}} the same syn­tactical positions, that of the subject and that of the direct object. Although both definite and inde­finite quantity can be expressed by lexical units which govern a genitive, grammatical concord is observed only in the expressions of definite quantity (cf. dešimt vyrų, and devyni vyrai), whereas indefinite quantity is expressed by the partitive genitive. However, the use of the genitive is deter­mined not by the opposition of definite quantity vs. indefinite quantity, but by the opposition of part vs. whole. The <b>marked</b> <b>member</b> of the latter opposition is the partitive genitive, the unmarked member being the objective accusative or the subjective nominative. In Lithuanian the part—whole opposition is considerably restricted by the semantic peculiarities of the verb, its actants and the linguistic context. The partitive genitive occurs in the position of the subject only with existential or motion verbs. Yet the partitive genitive is much more frequent in Lithuanian than, for instance, in Russian. As the part—whole opposition is in essence a quantitative opposition, {{there is no reason why}} we should speak about the expression of zero quantity or introduce a zero quantitative seme...|$|E
40|$|In recent {{analyses}} of Scandinavian tonal accent, two competing hypotheses can be identified, the privativity hypothesis {{and the timing}} hypothesis. The more widespread is the privativity hypothesis, which assumes {{that the difference between}} the accents consists in accent 2 having an initial, lexical tone that is absent from accent 1. Otherwise the melodies are identical. Due to greater, structural complexity, accent 2 is furthermore regarded as the <b>marked</b> <b>member</b> of the contrast. The timing hypothesis on the other hand assumes different timing of identical melodies to be the essence of the contrast. In this chapter, I argue that when East Norwegian dialect data are taken into consideration, the timing hypothesis appears as the only one that allows for a unified analysis {{of the differences between the}} three dialects discussed. At the input level, the three dialects are assumed to have the same melody. The well established privative pattern of Urban East Norwegian (UEN) emerges as a surface phenomenon that is the result of a constraint that bans low tones from metrical heads. The surface timing patterns of the two other dialects, North Gudbrandsdal and Oppdal can be accounted for by minimal adjustments of the UEN grammar.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the origins and the function of the objective verbal conjugation especially in Hungarian but with an eye to general typology and Uralic. Previous attempts at solving problems associated with it are given a critical survey. The author argues that since objective conjugation is neither specific to Hungarian nor to its relatives, whether close or distant, but is found in various language families and language types all over the world, one should seek explanations in universal tendencies rather than giving ad hoc accounts. The universal tendency of medialisation is pointed out here-especially in the first and second persons of the paradigm-, which differentiated what is now called the (unmarked) general or indefinite conjugation from the original unitary conjugation. It is here proposed that what now functions as the objective conjugation results historically from a reinterpretation of the original paradigm as in contrast with the medial (then general) paradigm. This explains the curious fact that although the objective paradigm is now seen as the new <b>marked</b> <b>member</b> of the opposition, it is this paradigm that preserves the personal endings going back to the ancestral pronouns. The author also argues that the emergence of an objective conjugation in those Uralic languages that have one represents independent developments, though the preconditions for its evolution may have been there in Proto-Uralic in the form of object syntagms...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the story}} of a markedness {{contrast}} between between two verbal complementation patterns, each of which appears to indicate a speaker 2 ̆ 7 s perspective on a change of situation. We suggest that the <b>marked</b> <b>member</b> of the contrast, which we will refer to as the start not or SNX pattern, indicates the decision of a speaker to focus attention on the onset of a new, revocable situation rather than on the cessation of a prior situation. The change of situation as expressed by the marked pattern, we believe, is characterized by the undesired cessation of some activity, state, or habit. This heretofore undescribed pattern, which appears in the simplified example after lunch I started not feeling well, is marked in comparison to the arguably synonymous after lunch I stopped feeling well. We will attempt to show that this unpredictable pattern has combinatoric or selectional properties that differ from stop as well as other uses of start, which can be understood as indicating the particular pragmatic function and communicative role of the utterance. This thesis will build on syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and discourse theories to establish (1) a theoretical motivation for why we should explore the difference between the two patterns start not and stop, and (2) that a substantive difference in both content and usage exists between the two patterns. Data collected were annotated and analyzed on the basis of syntactic context, and lexical semantic, combinatoric, pragmatic, and discourse features, which on the whole indicate that the SNX construction is indeed used to implicate something distinct from stop. We analyze these features in order to (1) determine in what forms this pattern exists and why, (2) describe what discourse purposes this pattern fulfills, and (3) develop more evidence in support of hypotheses which describe form/function relationships. Ultimately we will show that even small variations in form do matter for function...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} examines several interconnected binaries {{in music}} theory: flat/sharp, subdominant/dominant, and minor/major. Traditional theory positions the <b>marked</b> <b>member</b> of each pair (flat, subdominant, and minor, respectively) conceptually LEFT, DOWN and OUTSIDE of the privileged term (sharp, dominant, and major), leading to further marginalization. In my theoretical, historical, analytical and aesthetic {{inquiry into the}} ‘musical left,’ I take on Riemannian dualism, mirroring, flat side transformations, stacked fourths, and the pentatonic scale. My deconstruction of 19 th century major-minor dualism reveals the surprising “Othering” of the minor mode. Mirroring—from fugues to Riemannian dualism—cannot fully integrate with a ground-up, hierarchical practice like tonality; twentieth-century atonal musics constitute better vehicles for sustained, pure inversions. Unlike ‘structural’ authentic cadences, the subdominant is analyzed by Schenkerians as ‘surface-level’ embellishment, but I assert that composers use autonomous applied plagals to go the ‘wrong way’ around the circle of fifths. In contrast to applied dominants, secondary subdominants—the flatted seventh double plagal, the triple plagal “backdoor” cadence, and the flatted sixth quadruple subdominant—have rarely been studied. For composers of these structures, going flat serves revolutionary ends. Stacked fourths—commonly misinterpreted as purposeless for their tendency to “plane” non-functionally—are used by McCoy Tyner in “Blues on the Corner” to target the subdominant in what I term a “trapdoor cadence. ” My taxonomy of stacked fourth chords leads {{to an analysis of}} Paul Hindemith’s ic- 5 crossing over in Mathis der Maler. Motion in the flat direction is usually right to left—that is, it represents tracking back to the tonic-in-the-past, but by traveling 23 steps into the flatside, Hindemith transforms the past into the future. Quartals are the ideal vehicle for this kind of time travel, for they represent both the past (rustic antiquity) and the future (technological progress). Some theorists and composers have treated the ic- 5 / 7 pentatonic scale as ‘incomplete’ or primitive, but I present compositions, such as John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme, that use segmented pentatonics as building blocks for ic- 5 cyclic completion. Since pentatonic melodies are commonly accompanied by non-pentatonic harmonies (the so-called “melodic-harmonic divorce”), I propose a system of melodic-harmonic differentiation, as practiced by African-American musicians. I believe that this refusal to succumb to organic unity mimics heterophony, in which the individual stands out from the group...|$|E

40|$|THE VERBAL CONJUGATION SYSTEM OF THE ŠAUKĖNAI SUBDIALECT (SIMPLE FORMS) Summary The Šaukėnai subdialect {{belongs to}} the {{northern}} subdialects of the southern Žemaitian dialect and has retained their most characteristic features. However, due to considerable theoretical and practical obstacles, {{the description of the}} formation of the derived verbal forms in the Šaukėnai subdialect by applying the rules of the formation of derived verbal forms in Standard Lithuanian is impossible. The verb of the Šaukėnai subdialect possesses the morphological categories of person, number, tense, mood and voice. The inflected verbs (except the imperative mood) have three singular and three plural forms. The 3 rd person form is neutral with respect to the category of number, it denotes an action performed either by one or more than one agent. The <b>marked</b> <b>member</b> of the opposition singular / plural is the plural. The verb of the Šaukėnai subdialect possesses both simple and compound tenses. In the Šaukėnai subdialect, the paradigms of verbal forms indicate three types of modal oppositions: they distinguish four moods, i. e. indirect, direct, imperative and subjunctive. The direct and indirect moods possess the tense forms of present, past, past frequentative and future whereas the imperative and subjunctive moods do not possess the category of tense. In the Šaukėnai subdialect, there are two verbal conjugations which are distinguished according to the underlying form endings in the present tense of the indicative mood. The 1 st conjugation comprises verbs whose present tense underlying form ending is a zero morph (O) which is preceeded either by a consonant or – j, e. g. vèd, t í · l̑, šuokin í e, kaũlij, the 2 nd conjugation comprises verbs whose present tense underlying form ends in /-a/, e. g. mãt-a, b ì j-e, ž ì n-a, etc. The underlying simple past verbal forms of the 1 st (or (i̯) a- stem) conjugation end in /-a/ or /-i/, cf. rãd-a, l ì j-e and ãr-i. The a- stem verbs constitute a highly productive and stable class while in the subdialect there have remained only four i̯ a (former i) - stem verbs: t í · l̑ : ti·l í eti, gá l̑ : gal í eti, m í · l̑ : mi·l í eti  and gú l̑ : gul í eti. The verbs of the 2 nd conjugation (or a -stem) are also rather productive. The Šaukėnai subdialect has preserved some remnants of athematic conjugation. Some verbs are impersonal, e. g. pe r̃ št, the others possess all personal forms derived from underlying form stems, e. g. m ĩ · i̯ ktu, etc. The categories in the Šaukėnai subdialect indicate a variety of symbolization. The categories of person and number are usually represented by grammatical morphemes, or endings (i. e. the morphological markers of the categories) : /-u/, /-a·u/ symbolize the categories of person and number, i. e.   the 1 st person and the singular, /-i/, /-a· /, /-e· / [...] the 2 nd person and the singular /-am/, /-uom/, /-iem/, /-ma/ [...]   the 1 st person and the plural, /-at/, /-uot/, /-iet/, /-te/ [...] the 2 nd person and the plural. The ending forms of the 3 rd person represent the category of person, i. e. the 3 rd person only. The article rejects the opinion, which dominates in Lithuanian linguistic literature, as if the verbal form endings could also represent the category of tense. It is complete misunderstanding, cf. sak-á·u (present) and suk-á·u (past), mùš-ù (present) and mùš-ù (future), etc. As evidenced by the data from the Šaukėnai subdialect, the tense can be expressed by syntactic category markers, phonological means, cf. mat-á·u and ma č̑ -ǽ·u, various formants (infixes), such as –n-, -st-, -s-, cf. añk and ãka, k i̲m̃ b and k ì̲ ba, t i̲r̃ pst  and t i̲r̃ pa, d í̲́ rbu and d í̲́ rpsu, suffixes, cf. d í̲́ rb-a·u and d í̲́ rb-dav-a·u as well as vowel gradation, cf. ke r̃ t and k i̲r̃ ta, etc. However, only the simple form endings of the indicative and subjunctive moods can express the mood. The forms of the subjunctive mood, alongside their specific endings, possess a distinctive formant, -t- while the forms of the imperative mood differ from the forms of the other moods only in the underlying form which has a specific suffix, -k. The above suffix is the basis for the formation of plural forms whose endings do not express the category of mood.  The verbal forms in the Šaukėnai subdialect are derived from the underlying forms (see the list in the article) according to the additive rules by adding corresponding endings. The categoric asymmetry is realized additively. Therefore the coding of the derived forms is either maximally or minimally iconic. </p...|$|E
