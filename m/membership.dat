LDS Church <b>membership</b> statistics are different from self-reported statistics, mainly because the LDS Church does not remove an individual's name from its <b>membership</b> rolls based on disengagement from the church.|$|E

5|$|Although {{some historians}} have {{identified}} Garrard {{as a member}} of the Danville Political Club, a secret debating society that was active in Danville, Kentucky, from 1786 to 1790, his name is not found in the Club's official <b>membership</b> records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's <b>membership</b> in the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge for <b>membership</b> in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same time, and had several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} of contention was the Progress Party's policy on Norwegian <b>membership</b> in the European Union. Reportedly, Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone {{a decision on}} European Union policy from the national convention to a national board meeting in June. Others were {{not in favor of}} this. In an interview, Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion or the other. He stated an indifference towards EU <b>membership,</b> and that if accessing the Union, Norway could always use a veto against EU policies when needed. Central board member Terje Sæbø submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian <b>membership.</b>|$|E

30|$|<b>Memberships</b> of DIAS are {{the means}} to detect {{inaccuracies}} such as double-counting and outdated aggregation values. However, a decentralized system cannot explicitly store <b>memberships</b> of all aggregation values locally in each node. This approach is neither scalable, efficient nor decentralized. To overcome this challenge, the probabilistic data structures of bloom filters (Bloom 1970) are used in DIAS for management of <b>memberships.</b> Bloom filters provide tremendous space savings {{at a cost of}} false positive <b>memberships.</b> DIAS, however, is able to detect false positive inconsistencies and, therefore, maintain a high accuracy level in the computed aggregates without introducing additional communication cost.|$|R
5|$|Bosnia and Herzegovina began further {{cooperation}} with NATO within their Individual Partnership Action Plan in January 2008.

NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has stated that NATO <b>membership</b> is still an option for Ukraine, and support for NATO <b>membership</b> has risen to 63.9 percent in government-controlled Ukraine according to a July 2015 poll.

5|$|In 1958, {{the leader}} of the North Carolina branch of the CPUSA, Junius Scales, became the final CPUSA member convicted under the Smith Act, and the only one convicted after the Yates decision. Prosecutors pursued Scales' case because he {{specifically}} advocated violent political action and gave demonstrations of martial arts skills. Scales was accused of violating the <b>membership</b> clause of the Smith Act, not the clause prohibiting advocacy of violence against the government. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Scales contended that the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act rendered the Smith Act's <b>membership</b> clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that <b>membership</b> in a communist party does not constitute a per se violation of any criminal statute. In 1961, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, upheld Scales' conviction, finding that the Smith Act <b>membership</b> clause was not obviated by the McCarran Act, because the Smith Act required prosecutors to prove first, that there was direct advocacy of violence; and second, that the defendant's <b>membership</b> was substantial and active, not merely passive or technical. Two Justices of the Supreme Court who had supported the Yates decision in 1957, Harlan and Frankfurter, voted to uphold Scales' conviction.|$|E
