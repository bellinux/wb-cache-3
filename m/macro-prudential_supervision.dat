40|$|In the {{analysis}} of the credit crisis of 2007 - 2010 a clear distinction should be made between (i) the initial shock; (ii) the propagation and amplification of the initial shock to the systemic crisis of the financial markets; and (iii) the transmission of the credit crisis to the real economic sector causing a major cyclical downturn now known as the great recession. This paper argues that banking supervision failed to anticipate and repair the market failure that caused the huge amplification of the relatively small initial shock. As the repair of market failure is the only sound economic argument for regulation, banking supervisors should now focus on the externalities that caused the amplification of the shock and use that knowledge for adequate <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> in the future. Macro-economic models can be helpful in this search for externalities.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the global financial crisis on Brazil, India and South Africa whose financial markets have shown strong resilience to the global financial turmoil. The paper shows, that in contrast to advanced countries in these emerging market economies there is contagion from the real sector through a slump in exports and a decline in industrial production. Although exposure to toxic assets has been very low, financial markets of the economies under consideration have come under pressure {{in the second half of}} 2008 resulting in steep stock market corrections, and a strong volatility of prices, in particular exchange rates. However, there was no bail-out of financial institutions and in 2009 financial markets of these countries strongly recovered. The paper identifies a combination of a reduction of foreign debt exposure, a <b>macro-prudential</b> approach in <b>supervision</b> and rule-based approach in regulation complemented by a variety of country-specific rules applied by these countries already before the crisis together with non-orthodox monetary and fiscal policy during the crisis as the main features of their success.

40|$|Abstract. - The {{economic}} crisis, {{which has}} been with us since 2008, has called into question the supervision and financial regulation model in the European Union (EU). The economic governing system, which was born after the creation of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EEMU), {{has been shown to be}} clearly insufficient in order to deal with the impact of the recession which has hit the twenty seven Member States of the EU. This situation has illustrated the need for a wider cooperation between the States, some supervisory institutions with a more systematic vision and a better designed and more specific financial system. The objective of this article is to analyze the modifications which have been made to the supervision model of the European financial system, the problems which have resulted and the lines of improvement which must be studied if the intention is that the supervision model of the European financial system is going to be a trustworthy, efficient and effective model in the future. To do this, the changes in the renovation of the financial supervision model in the EU, which have been made since 2011, will be studied. In the first place, the <b>macro-prudential</b> and micro-prudential <b>supervision</b> through the restructuring of the three fundamental bases of the financial system will be analyzed: banking system, market values and insurance.

I also maintain that, when financial markets are liberalized and private-interests related self-regulation replaces public <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>supervision,</b> the financial system undergoes institutional deadlock and the ensuing confusion is transformed into a market gridlock.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse changes in securities market supervision and regulation by investigating the impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) on the conceptual framework of securities market supervision (SMS).

40|$|The {{financial}} and economic crisis {{that started in}} summer 2007 has shown that macroprudential supervision and regu-lation need to be significantly expanded.

We sought these indicators among the variables of micro-aggregated banking sector, macroeconomic variables and the combination of these two sets. At the end of this study, it appears that the claims on the private sector, foreign direct investment and the combination of exports and credits to the private sector, increase the risk of degradation of the banking system, while this risk is reduced by the exchange rate, the capital of the banking system and inflation. This set of indicators should therefore attract the attention of the regulator to allow a quick solve of any potential banking crisis in CEMAC. ...|$|E

To draw some lessons on why some countries weathered the negative spillovers of the global financial crisis better than others, we focus on the case of the Czech economy, and subsequently bring in some cross-country evidence from the new EU member states. The derived lessons indicate that it is effective to establish a consolidated supervisor at the national level, ideally within a strong and independent central bank. That, consolidation of financial regulation and supervision facilitates a fast-action response, comprehensive data collection and analysis, and increases respect for the supervisor in the financial community. The lessons further stress the role of <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> ensuring, among others, moderate loan-to-deposit ratios of the banking sector and low dollarization of loans through adequate pricing of foreign exchange risk by banks. Further, a prudent macroeconomic management appears to deliver low interest rate differentials and thus a lower share of reversible capital. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the current {{financial}} crisis, the stability of the financial system becomes a priority on the agenda of the national monetary authorities. Since “systemic risk” is widely accepted as the fundamental underlying concept for the study of financial instability, this paper attempts to highlight the new dimensions of the concept in the pursuit of effective crisis management. Today, the potential for increased systemic risk is particularly related to combinations of structural trends. The increasing use of credit risk transfer (CRT) instruments and other financial innovations have changed the nature of systemic risk in banking activity. Moreover, as banks have become broad-based financial institutions engaging in a full spectrum of financial services including investment banking, brokerage services, asset management or proprietary trading, their risk exposures have become considerably more complex and interdependent. Thus, the risk of bank failure triggering a chain reaction and generating negative externalities for the whole financial system is significantly grown. Consequently, there is a stringent need for appropriate regulation and for <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>supervision.</b> ...|$|E

In the wake of the crisis a new consensus is emerging, calling on central banks to take more responsibility for financial stability.

But increased discretionary decision making, coupled with shared responsibility for policy instruments, poses serious accountability and reputational risks for the ECB, which deserve to be addressed proactively.

40|$|The {{paradigm}} of self-stabilizing, equilibrating financial markets, respected {{for a long}} time, is seriously challenged by the recent financial crisis. Despite sophisticated bank risk management and comprehensive bank supervision interbank and corporate bond markets collapsed in 2007 - 2009. The state interventions required for saving banks are without precedent in modern economic history. In this essay we attempt to explain financial market instability. Key determinants of the crisis are, in our opinion, weaknesses of the information architecture which should provide credible information for investors. Three determinants of instability are identified: first, the utilization of debt instruments combined with high degrees of corporate leverage; second, the tradeability of securities combined with increased risk taking; and third, the increased degree of complexity of financial products and networks, combined with more homogeneous asset and risk structures of banks. These determinants strengthen financial system vulnerability {{and the role of}} the information architecture. We discuss several requirements for a meaningful regulatory reform, leaving out incentive issues (which are treated in Franke/Krahnen 2009), namely credible provision of information, <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>supervision,</b> robust capital standards, as well as a limitation of risk clustering in derivative markets.

40|$|The {{importance}} of banking system within {{the financial system}} requires a special attention {{in order to secure}} its stability. Thus, with the occurrence of the financial crisis, in the context of integration of the financial system and creation of unique financial market, became more stringent the need for the existence of specific tools to prevent financial crises and to guarantee the continuity of normal economic activity. In this category are the <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> tools whose role is to reduce the ability of banks to damage the economy by taking on excess risk. Among them is registered the dynamic provisions intended to be used for enhancing bank soundness and to help mitigate part of the pro-cyclicality of the banking system. The current study addresses the methodology for establishing specific provisions for credit risk {{at the level of the}} Romanian banking system, highlighting the direct implications over the credit institutions, and indirect implications over the economy as a whole. The study presents as well the possible course of actions in order to remedy the weaknesses in the recognition of loan losses. Thus, while listing the specialty literature, study presents the regulatory framework applicable to loan loss provisioning, underlining the weaknesses of the static provisioning model and the need to look forward to the dynamic model along with the accounting methodology. In this regard it was considered the worsening of a loan portfolio in macroeconomic context and a hypothetical comparative study between the static and dynamic model has been realized. The results of the study revealed that the current provisioning model has a procycle character without considering the influence of macroeconomic factors over the future worsening of the loan portfolio without allowing recognition of future loan losses due to failure to identify future risks generating events and their credible assessment. Therefore it is required the need to establish reserves during the economic growth periods to cover losses from loans in order to prevent disruption of the banking activity and to limit the risk of insolvency. To achieve this goal it is necessary that all the parties involved, namely the banks, the regulatory authority and accounting organizations, to realize the {{importance of}} loan loss provisioning and act accordingly...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{investigates the}} impacts of the 2008 GFC on the securities market supervision (SMS) by identifying how securities regulators {{have responded to the}} GFC, adapted to the post-crisis market conditions, and developed a more responsive supervisory structure.

Quantitative survey research and qualitative techniques with focus group interviews and documentary research are employed in a mixed-methodology under the paradigm of critical realism to generalize the crisis impacts on SMS. Findings of the research include: (i) the GFC has generated impacts on all areas of SMS framework. Discussion is focused on a paradigm shift in SMS philosophy, re-construction of SMS architecture, emerging of risk-based approach, involvement of securities regulators in <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>supervision,</b> disputable roles of self-regulatory organizations (SROs) in market conduct oversight, and re-regulation of securities products, market intermediaries, market gatekeepers and SROs; (ii) post-crisis SMS responsiveness improvement was a result of post-crisis policy reform; and (iii) developed markets and emerging markets followed the same trend of post-crisis SMS reform but their ways diverged in some areas. Post-crisis SMS paradigm shift, prevalence of integration model, choices of developed and emerging markets between twin-peaks and integration, post-crisis diminishing roles of SROs, emergence of central banks, divergence of developed markets and emerging markets in policies are explained. Critical implications were developed for emerging markets, including: (i) comprehending the post-crisis SMS paradigm shift and developing a new SMS philosophy; (ii) dealing with the dilemma of SMS restructuring post-crisis; (iii) identifying the tasks and challenges of applying risk-based approach; and, (iv) establishing a culture of responsive SMS. Contribution of this research is significant in terms of theory, body of knowledge, methodology and literature: (i) the research is the first that describes a comprehensive theoretical framework of SMS, defines the concept of SMS responsiveness and develops a complete SMS framework.

40|$|Analysis of the {{financial}} crisis has revealed not only major market and regulatory failures, but also shortcomings in supervisory approaches and in banks’ systems of internal and external controls. These failures and shortcomings {{played a significant role in}} the origin and evolution of the crisis. In some important cases, the crisis revealed that banks’ internal governance, and their internal control functions in particular, were ineffective or even unsuitable when faced with the demands of overseeing the growing levels of risk undertaken by intermediaries, and especially the interrelations between these exposures. The aim of this chapter is to investigate banks’ internal control functions, as a part of internal governance, in the light of the crisis and the subsequent regulatory and supervisory measures, first and foremost Basel 3. Ai nostri fini “internal controls” is used with its extensive meaning, comprendendo anche the risk mangement function mainly in the two phases of assesment and identification of risks [...] Therefore “internal control system” comprende: risk management, internal audit, compliance and risk control. L’analisi affronterà anche alcuni aspetti della corporate governance since internal control systems are considered part of the internal governance., The main research question is related to the implications of the crisis, the regulatory innovations now being implemented, and the changes in supervisory policies and practices, for banks’ internal control systems. The first step will be to survey internal control systems, ICS, within the regulatory and supervisory context at the international level. Given the role of internal control functions in risk-based supervision, it is important to investigate the exact relationship between supervisor and supervised as defined by Basel 3, Pillar 2, with regard to ICAAP and SREP. This will be followed by an investigation of the main regulatory failings and supervisory shortcomings which played a key role in the origin and evolution of the crisis, to identify the extent to which banks’ internal control functions can be blamed for the events which unfolded. In some cases the quality of these control functions, and the supervisory procedures adopted, made the crucial difference in terms of the impact of the crisis. The next topic to be examined will be the changes now being made at the international level to both regulation and the supervisory function, with specific reference to the European Union and the new supervisory pan-European architecture based on <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> and micro-prudential supervison, introduced in 2011. These changes are the outcome of the failures and shortcomings that emerged during the crisis. Within the framework being formed by Basel 3, points will be identified for comment and evaluation concerning the implications for internal governance and internal controls, in the context of the risk-based approach and Pillar 2. Attention will be focused in particular on the role of internal control functions in overseeing banks’ risk exposure, since it was these functions’ inability to monitor the ever-increasing risks undertaken, and their failure to consider or even understand the interrelations between them and thus their combined weight in a firm-wide perspective, that prevented them from providing effective protection against excessive levels of risk...|$|E
