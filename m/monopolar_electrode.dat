50|$|Intramuscular EMG can be {{performed}} {{using a variety of}} different types of recording electrodes. The simplest approach is a monopolar needle electrode. This can be a fine wire inserted into a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference; or two fine wires inserted into muscle referenced to each other. Most commonly fine wire recordings are for research or kinesiology studies. Diagnostic monopolar EMG electrodes are typically insulated and stiff enough to penetrate skin, with only the tip exposed using a surface electrode for reference. Needles for injecting therapeutic botulinum toxin or phenol are typically monopolar electrodes that use a surface reference, in this case, however, the metal shaft of a hypodermic needle, insulated so that only the tip is exposed, is used both to record signals and to inject. Slightly more complex in design is the concentric needle electrode. These needles have a fine wire, embedded in a layer of insulation that fills the barrel of a hypodermic needle, that has an exposed shaft, and the shaft serves as the reference electrode. The exposed tip of the fine wire serves as the active electrode. As a result of this configuration, signals tend to be smaller when recorded from a concentric electrode than when recorded from a <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrode</b> and they are more resistant to electrical artifacts from tissue and measurements tend to be somewhat more reliable. However, because the shaft is exposed throughout its length, superficial muscle activity can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles. Single fiber EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording areas, and allow for the discharges of individual muscle fibers to be discriminated.|$|E

The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS are unknown. In particular, the effect of the electrical stimulation on neuronal firing remains poorly understood. Previous reports have showed that uniform electric fields with both AC (continuous sinusoidal) or DC waveforms could suppress epileptiform activity in vitro. In the present study, we tested the effects of <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrode</b> stimulation and low-duty cycle AC stimulation protocols, which more closely approximate those used clinically, on three in vitro epilepsy models. Continuous sinusoidal stimulation, 50 % duty-cycle sinusoidal stimulation, and low (1. 68 %) duty-cycle pulsed stimulation (120 μs, 140 Hz) could completely suppress spontaneous low-Ca 2 + epileptiform activity with average thresholds of 71. 11 ± 26. 16 μA, 93. 33 ± 12. 58 μA and 300 ± 100 μA, respectively. Continuous sinusoidal stimulation could also completely suppress picrotoxin- and high-K+-induced epileptiform activity with either uniform or localized fields. The suppression generated by the <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrode</b> was localized to a region surrounding the stimulation electrode. Potassium concentration and transmembrane potential recordings showed that AC stimulation was associated with an increase in extracellular potassium concentration and neuronal depolarization block; AC stimulation efficacy was not orientation-selective.

40|$|OBJECT: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the efficacy of long-term deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posteroventral lateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) accomplished using a single-contact <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrode</b> in patients with advanced Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: Sixteen patients suffering from severe PD and levodopa-induced side effects such as dyskinesias and on-off fluctuations were enrolled in a prospective study protocol. There were six women and 10 men and their mean age at surgery was 65 years. All patients underwent implantation of a <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrode</b> in the posteroventral lateral GPi. Initially, nine patients received unilateral stimulation. Three of these patients underwent contralateral surgery at a later time. Ten patients received bilateral stimulation (contemporaneous bilateral surgery was performed in seven patients and staged bilateral surgery in the three patients who had received unilateral stimulation initially). Formal assessments were performed during both off-medication and on-medication (levodopa) periods preoperatively, and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. There were no serious complications related to surgery or to DBS. Two transient adverse events occurred: in one patient a small pallidal hematoma developed, resulting in a prolonged micropallidotomy effect, and in another patient a subcutaneous hemorrhage occurred at the site of the pacemaker. In patients who received unilateral DBS, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale activities of daily living (ADL) score during the off-levodopa period decreased from 30. 8 at baseline to 20. 4 at 3 months (34 % improvement) and 20. 6 at 12 months (33 % improvement) postoperatively. The motor score during the off period improved from 57. 2 at baseline to 35. 2 at 3 months (38 % improvement) and 35. 3 at 12 months (38 % improvement) postoperatively. Bilateral DBS resulted in a reduction in the ADL score during the off period from 34. 9 at baseline to 22. 3 at 3 months (36 % improvement) and 22. 9 at 12 months (34 % improvement). The motor score for the off period changed from 63. 4 at baseline to 40. 3 at 3 months (36 % improvement) and 37. 5 at 12 months (41 % improvement). In addition, there were significant improvements in patients' symptoms during the on period and in on-off motor fluctuations. CONCLUSIONS: Pallidal DBS accomplished using a <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrode</b> is a safe and effective procedure for treatment of advanced PD. Compared with pallidotomy, the advantages of pallidal DBS lie in its reversibility and the option to perform bilateral surgery in one session. Comparative studies in which DBS is applied to other targets are needed...|$|E

The change in serum sodium as a result of irrigant consumption, operating time, and amount of tissue removed were estimated. Results: A statistically significant reduction in mean serum sodium from 138.7  mmol/l to 133.8  mmol/l was seen in the monopolar group, compared with the case of the saline groups with no reduction. The amount of resected tissue in the monopolar and TCRis group was approximately 1.00  g/min, compared with 0.65  g/min in the Versapoint group. Loss of fluid during the procedure was significantly higher in the two bipolar groups. Conclusions: Bipolar electrodes appear to have a safer profile compared with <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrodes</b> because of the unchanged serum sodium.

A key detail is the spatial pattern of ganglion cells activated by stimulation. Therefore, we characterized the spatial extent of network-mediated electrical activation of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the epiretinal <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrode</b> configuration. Methods: Healthy mouse RGC activities were recorded with a micro-electrode array (MEA). The stimuli consisted of monophasic rectangular cathodic voltage pulses and cycling full-field light flashes. Results: Voltage tuning curves exhibited significant hysteresis, reflecting adaptation to electrical stimulation {{on the time}} scale of seconds. Responses decreased from 0 to 300 µm, and were also dependent {{on the strength of}} stimulation. Applying the Rayleigh criterion to the half-width at half-maximum of the electrical point spread function suggests a visual acuity limit of no better than 20 / 946. Threshold voltage showed only a modest increase across these distances. Conclusion: The existence of significant hysteresis requires that future investigations of electrical retinal stimulation control for such long-memory adaptation.

The current study found that, {{in contrast to the}} loudness-related measures, magnitudes of across-site means and the across-site variances of modulation detection thresholds were not dependent on electrode configuration, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying variation in these various psychophysical measures are not all the same. The data presented here suggest that bipolar and <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrode</b> configurations are equally effective in identifying good and poor stimulation sites for modulation detection but that the across-site patterns of modulation detection thresholds are not the same for the two configurations.

The threshold current was found for fibers stimulated with a 100 -[mu] diameter <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrode</b> at {{the surface of the}} dorsal columns 0. 5 - 2. 0 cm from the recording electrode. Shock artifact was greatly reduced because of the geometry of the stimulating and recording scheme. The distance of the stimulating electrode from a recorded fiber could be determined since fibers in the medial dorsal columns maintain a relatively constant relation to the midline and the surface for several segments. The stimulus was usually a single cathodal current pulse of 50 -[mu]sec duration. The conduction velocity was also determined for each fiber. Current-distance relations for threshold stimulation were determined for these fibers. In general, the further away the stimulating electrode, the greater the current required for stimulation. Moreover, fibers with larger conduction velocities required less current for stimulation. The fibers were also shown to be periodic in their longitudinal stimulation properties which probably was related to the length of their internodes. The time constant of the nodal membrane was determined from strength-duration data to be about 100 - 120 [mu]sec.

40|$|This study {{describes}} preliminary {{laryngeal electromyography}} (LEMG) data and botulinum toxin treatment {{in patients with}} dysphonia due to movement disorders. Twenty-five patients who had been clinically selected for botulinum toxin administration were examined, 19 with suspected laryngeal dystonia or spasmodic dysphonia (SD), 5 with vocal tremor, and 1 with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS). LEMG evaluations were performed before botulinum toxin administration using <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Electromyography was consistent with dystonia in 14 patients and normal in 5, and differences in frequency suggesting essential tremor in 3 and Parkinson tremors in 2. The different LEMG patterns and significant improvement in our patients from botulinum toxin therapy has led us to perform laryngeal electromyography as a routine in UNICAMP movement disorders ambulatory...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed {{electric}} field treatment is now {{widely used in}} diverse biological and medical applications: gene delivery, electrochemotherapy, and cancer therapy. This minimally invasive technique has several advantages over traditional ablation techniques, such as nonthermal elimination and blood vessel spare effect. Different electrodes are subsequently developed for a specific treatment purpose. Here, we provide a systematic review of electrode modality development in pulsed {{electric field}} treatment. For electrodes invented for experiment in vitro, sheet electrode and electrode cuvette, electrodes with high-speed fluorescence imaging system, electrodes with patch-clamp, and electrodes with confocal laser scanning microscopy are introduced. For electrodes invented for experiment in vivo, <b>monopolar</b> <b>electrodes,</b> five-needle array electrodes, single-needle bipolar electrode, parallel plate electrodes, and suction electrode are introduced. The pulsed electric field provides a promising treatment for cancer...|$|R
