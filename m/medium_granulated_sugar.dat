It {{can be used for}} making dessert, baked items, and even fruit. It is a common ingredient for macaroons.

In order to have a denser consistency, confectioners’ sugar is often used in cookie and cake recipes. <b>Granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> has larger crystals. Thus, it would create more air into doughs than confectioners sugar.3 ...|$|R

50|$|For example, if {{one were}} to make tablets from <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> versus {{powdered}} sugar, powdered sugar would be difficult to compress into a tablet and <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> would be easy to compress.

These small particles would have to be compressed very slowly {{for a long period of}} time to make a worthwhile tablet. Unless the powdered <b>sugar</b> is <b>granulated,</b> it could not efficiently be made into a tablet that has good tablet characteristics such as uniform content or consistent hardness.|$|R
