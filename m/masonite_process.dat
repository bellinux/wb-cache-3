40|$|Auto-adhesion is a {{phenomenon}} that is in general related to the manufacture of wood-basedfibreboards, e. g. to the <b>Masonite</b> <b>process</b> or similar processes based on lignocellulosic raw materials. Auto-adhesion as a mechanism for the bonding of solid wood or veneer has not met with the sameindustrial success, but interest is increasing for environmental reasons {{and as a result}} of theincreasing cost of adhesives in wood products. The temperature in the laminate is crucial for the autoadhesionprocess that will result in bonding between veneers during hot-pressing. This paper presentsa model for the temperature evolution during the hot-pressing of a porous material, which wasdeveloped and verified for a five-veneer beech laminate pressed at a temperature of 250 °C and apressure of 6 MPa in an open system for 280 seconds. The result shows good agreement between themodel and the experimental temperature data during the hot-pressing. It can be concluded that a goodcontrol of the temperature evolution during the manufacture of adhesive-free veneer boards is of majorimportance to reach the target properties of the product.
