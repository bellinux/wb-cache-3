However, the Earth's field is not large, and this kind of remanence would be weak and easily overwritten by later fields. A central part of rock magnetism is the study of <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanence,</b> both as natural remanent magnetization (NRM) in rocks obtained from the field and remanence induced in the laboratory. Below are listed the important natural remanences and some artificially induced kinds.|$|E
50|$|Data {{is stored}} in the {{magnetic}} media, such as hard drives, floppy disks, and magnetic tape, by making very small areas called magnetic domains change their magnetic alignment {{to be in the}} direction of an applied magnetic field. This phenomenon occurs {{in much the same way}} a compass needle points in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field. Degaussing, commonly called erasure, leaves the domains in random patterns with no preference to orientation, thereby rendering previous data unrecoverable. There are some domains whose magnetic alignment is not randomized after degaussing. The information these domains represent is commonly called <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanence</b> or remanent magnetization. Proper degaussing will ensure there is insufficient <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanence</b> to reconstruct the data.|$|E

30|$|The rock-magnetic {{measurement}} {{results indicate that}} the predominant carrier of <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanences</b> in the sediments is PSD, or a mixture of SD and MD-sized (titano)magnetite (Figs.  3 and 4), and the fluctuations in κ and κARM range within an order of magnitude (Fig.  6 g). From these results, the sediment satisfies the criteria for relative paleointensity reconstruction proposed by Tauxe (1993). To obtain an appropriate proxy for relative paleointensity, we compared the NRM/ARM ratios from three different coercivity fractions, which were between 20 and 40  mT, 30 and 50  mT, and 30 and 40  mT. The variations of the three coercivity fractions were almost identical, and we therefore used the NRM/ARM ratio between 20 and 40  mT as a proxy for relative paleointensity in this study (Fig.  6 f).|$|R
50|$|Strongly {{magnetic}} minerals have {{properties that}} depend on the size, shape, defect structure and concentration of the minerals in a rock. Rock magnetism provides non-destructive methods for analyzing these minerals such as magnetic hysteresis measurements, temperature-dependent remanence measurements, Mössbauer spectroscopy, ferromagnetic resonance and so on. With such methods, rock magnetists can measure the effects of past climate change and human impacts on the mineralogy (see environmental magnetism). In sediments, {{a lot of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanence</b> is carried by minerals that were created by magnetotactic bacteria, so rock magnetists have made significant contributions to biomagnetism.|$|E
50|$|The default {{definition}} of <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanence</b> is the magnetization remaining in zero field after a large magnetic field is applied (enough to achieve saturation). The {{effect of a}} magnetic hysteresis loop is measured using instruments such as a vibrating sample magnetometer; and the zero-field intercept {{is a measure of}} the remanence. In physics this measure is converted to an average magnetization (the total magnetic moment divided by the volume of the sample) and denoted in equations as Mr. If it must be distinguished from other kinds of remanence, then it is called the saturation remanence or saturation isothermal remanence (SIRM) and denoted by Mrs.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic media also deteriorates {{naturally}} {{with typical}} shelf lives between 10 and 20 years. [...] Magnetic tape can degrade from binder hydrolysis or <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanence</b> decay. Binder hydrolysis, {{also known as}} sticky-shed syndrome, refers to the breakdown of binder, or glue, that holds the magnetic particles to the polyester base of the tape. Tapes which have been stored in hot, humid conditions are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon and may suffer from accelerated degradation. Severe binder can cause the magnetic material to fall off or sheds from the base, leaving a pile of dust and clear backing. Archivists can bake the tape, which evaporates water molecules on the tape, to temporarily restore the binder before making a copy.|$|E

Sampling was performed {{on both sides of}} the Ama Drime Massif (ADM). Remanent magnetization resides in pyrrhotite formed during metamorphism and is related to the last cooling event through 325 _C (Curie temperature of pyrrhotite). The existence of antipodal pTRMs demonstrates that the ChRM is of thermoremanent origin and was acquired during cooling of the Tethyan metasediments. Penetrative deformation was still going on in Ronghbuk area until ca 250 _C, whereas it was already completed in Dinggye area. Significant departures from the expected field direction during the age of remanence acquisition cannot be interpreted by consistent vertical axis rotation of blocks.

Due to the high {{complexity}} and technological challenges that LISA will face, ESA decided to launch a technological demonstrator, LISA Pathfinder. The payload of LISA Pathfinder is the so-called LISA Technology Package, and will be the highest sensitivity geodesic explorer flown to date. The LISA Technology Package is designed to measure relative accelerations between two test masses in nominal free fall (geodesic motion). The magnetic, thermal and radiation disturbances affecting the payload are monitored and dealt by the diagnostics subsystem. The diagnostics subsystem consists of several modules, and one of these is the magnetic diagnostics unit. Its main function is the assessment of differential acceleration noise between test masses due to the magnetic effects. To do so, it has to determine the magnetic characteristics of the test masses, namely their <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanences</b> and susceptibilities.

50|$|The visible {{particulate}} matter in such smokes is most commonly composed of carbon (soot). Other particulates may {{be composed of}} drops of condensed tar, or solid particles of ash. The presence of metals in the fuel yields particles of metal oxides. Particles of inorganic salts may also be formed, e.g. ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or sodium chloride. Inorganic salts present {{on the surface of}} the soot particles may make them hydrophilic. Many organic compounds, typically the aromatic hydrocarbons, may be also adsorbed {{on the surface of the}} solid particles. Metal oxides can be present when metal-containing fuels are burned, e.g. solid rocket fuels containing aluminium. Depleted uranium projectiles after impacting the target ignite, producing particles of uranium oxides. Magnetic particles, spherules of magnetite-like ferrous ferric oxide, are present in coal smoke; their increase in deposits after 1860 marks the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. (Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles can be also produced in the smoke from meteorites burning in the atmosphere.) <b>Magnetic</b> <b>remanence,</b> recorded in the iron oxide particles, indicates the strength of Earth's magnetic field when they were cooled beyond their Curie temperature; this can be used to distinguish magnetic particles of terrestrial and meteoric origin. Fly ash is composed mainly of silica and calcium oxide. Cenospheres are present in smoke from liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Minute metal particles produced by abrasion can be present in engine smokes. Amorphous silica particles are present in smokes from burning silicones; small proportion of silicon nitride particles can be formed in fires with insufficient oxygen. The silica particles have about 10 nm size, clumped to 70-100 nm aggregates and further agglomerated to chains. Radioactive particles may be present due to traces of uranium, thorium, or other radionuclides in the fuel; hot particles can be present in case of fires during nuclear accidents (e.g. Chernobyl disaster) or nuclear war.|$|E
30|$|This study {{provides}} a paleomagnetic record, including directions and relative paleointensity, in a loess section {{from the northern}} piedmont of the Tianshan Mountain, eastern ACA. The results show that ferrimagnetic minerals dominate magnetic properties of the BYH section and serve as the main carrier for <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanences.</b> The <b>magnetic</b> domain state in this section is generally confined within pseudo-single-domain state, indicating that magnetic minerals remained originally depositional traits and underwent limited post-depositional alteration due to weak pedogenesis. There are three directional anomalies along with decreased intensities, two of which may chronologically be correlated to the Laschamp and Blake events, respectively. In this study, the possible Laschamp and Blake excursions were located in the loess horizon and third paleosol interval, respectively, generally corresponding to stratigraphic record of these excursions in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The Laschamp excursion shows an abrupt polarity reversal, while the Blake excursion {{is characterized by a}} quadruple structure, similar to other record in loess. The possibility of existence of the two excursions is further supported by relative paleointensity records, which indicate intensity lows in the excursion intervals. Moreover, the relative paleointensity of the BYH section may probably reflect the geomagnetic variations since last interglacial, correlated well with other global and regional RPI records.|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} particulate {{pollution is}} associated with premature mortality {{and a range of}} inflammatory illnesses, linked to toxic components within the particulate matter (PM) assemblage. The effectiveness of trees in reducing urban PM 10 concentrations is intensely debated. Modeling studies indicate PM 10 reductions from as low as 1 % to as high as ∼ 60 %. Empirical data, especially at the local scale, are rare. Here, we use conventional PM 10 monitoring along with novel, inexpensive magnetic measurements of television screen swabs to measure changes in PM 10 concentrations inside a row of roadside houses, after temporarily installing a curbside line of young birch trees. Independently, the two approaches identify > 50 % reductions in measured PM levels inside those houses screened by the temporary tree line. Electron microscopy analyses show that leafcaptured PM is concentrated in agglomerations around leaf hairs and within the leaf microtopography. Iron-rich, ultrafine, spherical particles, probably combustion-derived, are abundant, form a particular hazard to health, and likely contribute much of the measured <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanences.</b> Leaf <b>magnetic</b> measurements show that PM capture occurs on both the road-proximal and -distal sides of the trees.

5000|$|When a {{transformer}} is first energized, a transient current up to 10 to 15 {{times larger than}} the rated transformer current can flow for several cycles. Toroidal transformers, using less copper for the same power handling, can have up to 60 times inrush to running current. Worst case inrush happens when the primary winding is connected at an instant around the zero-crossing of the primary voltage, (which for a pure inductance would be the current maximum in the AC cycle) and if the polarity of the voltage half cycle has the same polarity as the remanence in the iron core has. (The <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanence</b> was left high from a preceding half cycle). Unless the windings and core are sized to normally never exceed 50% of saturation, (and in an efficient transformer they never are, such a construction would be overly heavy and inefficient) then during such a start up the core will be saturated. This can also be expressed as the remnant magnetism in normal operation is nearly as high as the saturation magnetism at the [...] "knee" [...] of the hysteresis loop. Once the core saturates however, the winding inductance appears greatly reduced, and only the resistance of the primary side windings and the impedance of the power line are limiting the current. As saturation occurs for part half cycles only, harmonic rich waveforms can be generated, and can cause problems to other equipment. For large transformers with low winding resistance and high inductance, these inrush currents can last for several seconds until the transient has died away (decay time proportional to ~XL/R)and the regular AC equilibrium is established. To avoid magnetic inrush, only for transformers with an air gap in the core, the inductive load needs to be synchronously connected near a supply voltage peak, in contrast with the zero voltage switching which is desirable to minimize sharp edged current transients with resistive loads such as high power heaters. But for toroidal transformers only a premagnetising procedure before switching on allows to start those transformers without any inrush current peak. Inrush current can be divided in three categories:- ...|$|E

The previous model uses a single smoothness parameter {{for the entire sample}} and the optimum smoothness is obtained by minimizing ABIC (Akaike’s Bayesian Information Criterion), while an additional parameter is introduced in the modified scheme for a layer where intensity fluctuation is strong.

40|$|A {{sequence}} of 88 m of continuous borehole cores of Lower Cretaceous shallow water carbonates from Southern Italy was obtained and studied lithologically and palaeomagnetically. It {{was found that}} the rocks are organized in cyclic lithofacies representing depositional environments from subtidal to supratidal and their <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanences</b> are all measurable and stable even if very weak. Cyclicities in the Milankovitch band were found using F. F. T analyses in both the sedimentological and palaeomagnetic records, and these matched the astronomical periodicities predicted for the Early Cretaceous. From this link it is possible to date the absolute time represented by the sediments, and the absolute time of acquisition of the palaeomagnetic signal. The palaeomagnetic signal is independent of sedimentological characteristics and lithofacies organization. The mean palaeolatitude and the tectonic results are consistent with other Lower Cretaceous structures in the Southern Apennines. The palaeomagnetic data, although still being studied, also shows shorter wavelengths signals than the Milankovitch cycles, some of which are likely to be comparable with secular variations of the geomagnetic field in the Early Cretaceous. Polarity changes are present, which correlate to the Geomagnetic Polarity Scale. Longer Normal polarities were found at about 1, 000, 000 years and in them the secular variations were found longer than usual. A repeatable magnetic behaviour characterises the polarity changes each about 230, 000 years. It is hypothesized that climatic variations and the sea level oscillations affect the thickness, type and cyclicities of sediments and geomagnetic variations control the palaeomagnetic data.

The characteristic remanence (ChRM) is likely of thermomagnetic origin related to post-peak metamorphic cooling occurring after the Eohimalayan phase (35 - 32 Ma). The ChRM postdates small-scale folding (main Himalayan folding F 1 and F 2) as shown by a negative fold test of site mean directions at 99 % confidence level, and has been probably acquired between 32 and 25 Ma. Late-orogenic long-wavelength folding associated with the Chako antiform (CA) is recorded by the spatial dispersion of ChRM directions {{and the distribution of}} the main axes of the AMS tensor. The mean tilting of the ChRM direction since remanence acquisition (≈ 20 - 30 °) approximately coincides with the tilting of the CA (31 °) at the study area indicating that the pyrrhotite remanence predates the CA (CA formed at < 18 Ma according to preliminary U/Pb dating). However, comparison of tilt angles of remanence directions and AMS tensor axes suggests that remanence acquisition was not completed before the onset of the CA formation. This could imply a younger age (Early Miocene or even younger) of the ChRM. Using the distribution of remanence directions along a small-circle as well as the distribution of AMS tensor axes, a clockwise mean rotation of 16 ° is obtained for a remanence age of ≈ 30 Ma. An Early Miocene remanence age would not change this result substantially.

Shatsky Rise, located in the Northwest Pacific, is covered with a thick cap of pelagic, carbonate-dominated sediments with a secondary aeolian component. Ocean Drilling Program Leg 132 recovered Pleistocene to Maestrictian oozes at Site 8 1 0, near the summit of the rise, using the advanced hydraulic piston corer to achieve virtually complete recovery in the upper 127 meters below the sea floor. The down-core stratigraphy of whole-core magnetic susceptibility displayed peaks with amplitudes of 30 - 40 x 10 - 8 SI and widths of tens of centimeters. Overall, magnetic susceptibility values correlated inversely with calcium carbonate percentages. Similar variations in other deep-sea sediments have been interpreted as records of glacial-interglacial climate cycles. A study of the magnetic properties of the Pleistocene-Pliocene sediments was undertaken {{to understand the nature of}} the magnetic susceptibility cycles. The acquisition and demagnetization properties of natural and artificial <b>magnetic</b> <b>remanences</b> were examined. The results indicated that the primary magnetic mineral is titanomagnetite, but there was also a secondary, higher coercivity component, perhaps hematite or goethite. The data also suggested that the magnetic susceptibility peaks resulted from high relative variations in magnetite concentration, and that the size of the magnetic particles is relatively uniform. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analyses confirmed that titanomagnetite was the primary magnetic carrier. Magnetic susceptibility peaks from Hole 8 1 OC were correlated to those from Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 577, 1 1 km to the west and at a water depth that is 50 meters deeper. Peaks in one or the other of the two holes were commonly missing or cannot be correlated. In all, only 35 % of the peaks in Hole 8 1 OC match those in Hole 577. These observations suggest that sedimentation atop Shatsky Rise has been irregular or disturbed by local erosion. Missing features in Hole 577 suggest a greater degree of erosion and perhaps stronger currents at that site.

It is envisioned that the present studies may offer guidance for the applications of the polymer bonded magnetic material. Department of Electrical EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: Y.
