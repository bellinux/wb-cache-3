5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|Seekers {{has also}} been {{published}} in original English-language manga form. The books are drawn by Bettina Kurkoski, who also drew The Rise of Scourge. The first one, Toklo's Story, was released on February 9, 2010, the same day The Last Wilderness was released. The second, featuring Kallik, called Kallik's Adventure was released on February 8, 2011. The third {{one was going to}} be called Lusa's Tale, But Tokyopop, the graphic novel company, decided not to make any more books for the USA.

25|$|Many of {{the rules}} for when to use ligatures, contractions, and {{abbreviations}} differ when a word is divided {{at the end of}} a line of text, because some of them <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> in contact with the hyphen that divides the word. See the references for details.|$|E
25|$|In honey bees, the {{genetics}} of offspring {{can best be}} controlled by artificially inseminating a queen with drones collected from a single hive, where the drones' mother is known. In the natural mating process, a queen mates with multiple drones, which <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> from the same hive. Therefore, in the natural mating process, batches of female offspring have fathers of a completely different genetic origin.|$|E
25|$|Because contractions that occupy {{only the}} lower half of the braille cell mostly double as basic {{punctuation}} marks, legibility requires that, with few exceptions, they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> in contact with actual punctuation marks; if they would, they should instead be spelled out. That is, any cell which follows without an intervening space should contain a dot in its top row. Most of the difficulties of when to use contractions are due to this complication.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{suggested}} Justice Kennedy's concurrence may be [...] "more consequential" [...] than Justice Harry Blackmun's dissent in Callins v. Collins, Mark Joseph Stern described Justice Kennedy's concurrence as [...] "myopic", noting that [...] "large {{chunks of the}} 'legal academy' in the 'public' were aware—and outraged—by the practice long before Kennedy condemned it". Dahlia Lithwick wrote that even though [...] "Kennedy <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> around on the death penalty" [...] and rule it unconstitutional, [...] "after reading his own words in Ayala—he probably should". In an interview with Harvard Law School dean Martha Minow, Justice Kennedy explained {{that when he was}} in the Army, he was locked in a cell for four hours and [...] "slightly tortured". Justice Kennedy remarked that [...] "fter four hours in a cell, I was going mad. These people are in, some for 40 years. It drives people mad and we don’t even think about it. We’ve got to do something about it".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the last}} two decades HSP90 has emerged as an {{intriguing}} target in the war on cancer. [...] HSP90 interacts and supports numerous proteins that promote oncogenesis, thus distinguishing Hsp90 as a cancer enabler as it is regarded as essential for malignant transformation and progression. [...] Moreover, through their extensive interactomes, both paralogs are associated with each hallmark of cancer. The HSP90AA1 gene however is not altered in a majority of tumors according to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Currently bladder cancer is found to have the largest number of alterations followed by pancreatic cancer. [...] This <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> as a surprise since overall Hsp90 expression levels are held at such a high level compared to most all other proteins within the cell., therefore further increasing Hsp90 levels may not provide any benefit to cancer growth. [...] Additionally, whole genome sequencing across all tumor types and cancer cell lines reveals that there are presently 115 different mutations within the HSP90AA1 open reading frame. The effects of these mutations on HSP90A function, however, remain unknown. Remarkably, in a number of tumors the HSP90AA1 gene is homozygously deleted, suggesting that these tumors may have a reduced level of malignancy. This is supported by a comparative genome-wide analysis of 206 gastric cancer patients that reported loss of HSP90AA1 is indeed associated with favorable outcomes after surgery alone. [...] This supports the possibility that the absence of Hsp90A in tumor biopsies may serve as a biomarker for positive clinical outcomes.|$|E

2500|$|Scholars often {{note that}} Machiavelli glorifies instrumentality in state building, an {{approach}} embodied by the saying [...] "The ends justify the means." [...] It {{should be noted}} that this quote has been disputed and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> from Niccolò Machiavelli or his writings. Violence may be necessary for the successful stabilisation of power and introduction of new legal institutions. Force may be used to eliminate political rivals, to coerce resistant populations, and to purge the community of other men strong enough of a character to rule, who will inevitably attempt to replace the ruler. Machiavelli has become infamous for such political advice, ensuring that he would be remembered in history through the adjective, [...] "Machiavellian".|$|E
2500|$|As for fielding a {{possible}} winner, the Army has over 1.1 million armed personnel, approximately half are front-line combat brigades. If a new carbine was selected, the Army would see 500,000 purchased for infantry brigade combat teams (IBCT), and the existing and improved M4s given to support troops to replace their M16s. If the improved M4 {{turned out to}} be the winner and the new carbine program scrapped, then the IBCTs will likely be fitted with the improved M4s, and the existing M4s would again be given to support troops to replace their M16s. On November 17, 2011 the US Marine Corps announced they will not participate or adopt any new weapon which may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> out of the competition. The USMC said they will continue to use standard M4s and M16A4s. They did mention they are considering upgrading the M16A4.

2500|$|Commonly {{observed}} {{signs are}} a runny nose, vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration, excessive salivation, coughing and/or labored breathing, loss of appetite, and weight loss. If neurological signs develop, incontinence may ensue. Central nervous system signs include a localized involuntary twitching of muscles {{or groups of}} muscles, seizures with salivation and jaw movements commonly described as [...] "chewing gum fits", or more appropriately as [...] "distemper myoclonus". As the condition progresses, the seizures worsen and advance to grand mal convulsions followed by death of the animal. The animal may also show signs of sensitivity to light, incoordination, circling, increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli such as pain or touch, and deterioration of motor capabilities. Less commonly, they may lead to blindness and paralysis. The length of the systemic disease may be as short as 10 days, or the start of neurological signs <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> until several weeks or months later. Those few that survive usually have a small tic or twitch of varying levels of severity. With time, this tic will usually diminish somewhat in its severity.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{institutions}} have undertaken zero-tolerance policies, for example, in the military, in the workplace, and in schools, {{in an effort}} to eliminate various kinds of illegal behavior, such as harassment. Proponents hope that such policies will underscore the commitment of administrators to prevent such behavior. Others raise a concern about this use of zero-tolerance policies, a concern which derives from analysis of errors of omission versus errors of commission. Here is the reasoning: Failure to proscribe unacceptable behavior may lead to errors of omission—too little will be done. But zero tolerance may be seen as a kind of ruthless management, which may lead to a perception of [...] "too much being done". If people fear that their co-workers or fellow students may be fired, terminated, or expelled, they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> forward at all when they see behavior deemed unacceptable. (This {{is a classic example of}} Type I and type II errors.) The Type Two error, where it occurs with respect to zero tolerance, leads to the situation where too stringent a policy may actually reduce reports of illegal behavior.|$|E
2500|$|The {{refloating}} {{of ships}} stranded or sunk in exposed waters is called offshore salvage. In {{this type of}} salvage, vessels are exposed to waves, currents and weather and are the most vulnerable and difficult to work on. They also tend to deteriorate more rapidly than such vessels in protected harbors. Offshore salvage may provide only a short window of opportunity for the salvage team due to unusually high tide or inclement weather for instance. The work window <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> around again {{for as long as}} weeks or months and in the interim, the vessel will continue to deteriorate. As a result, it is often imperative to work quickly. Typically, offshore salvage is conducted from pre-outfitted salvage tugs and other tugboats. In addition, portable diving facilities may be transported by helicopter or small boat to the work area. From a tactical point of view, working in unprotected waters is less hospitable for floating cranes, construction tenders, dredges and equipment barges. Plus, {{it is often difficult to}} depend upon a stable workforce (welders, carpenters, etc.) as all personnel must be present on site for the duration ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{letters of}} the fifth decade are often {{used in the past}} tense and other {{grammatical}} forms: when rub becomes rubbed, in braille the letter [...] is moved down a dot to indicate the bb. However, those letters which double as punctuation marks——may only occur sandwiched {{in the middle of a}} word, not at the beginning or end, in order to avoid confusion with the punctuation. That is, *sea, ebb, add, cuff, egg must be spelled out in full, though the ligatures are used in season, added (a-dd-ed), cuffs, and eggs. Because of legibility problems (see [...] "lower contractions" [...] in the next section), they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> in contact with an apostrophe or hyphen either. That is, in egg's and egg-plant, tea's and tea-time, the gg and ea must be spelled out in full. If the print letters span an obvious affix, the braille ligature is not used (preamble, reanalyze, pineapple, subbasement), but they are used in words such as accept and address where the morphology has become opaque. In order to keep the spelling regular, compounds of words starting with ea keep the ea spelled out: uneasy, anteater, southeast do not use the ligature [...] because easy, eater, east do not use it. These are the least-preferred ligatures: any other will be used instead. Thus wedding is w-ed-d-ing (not *we-dd-ing) and office is of-f-i-c-e (not *o-ff-i-c-e).|$|E
