40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} make the {{observation}} {{that it is possible}} for a network to well support <b>multi-services</b> by utilizing the diverse user requirements and the Internet traffic characteristics. Motivated by this observation, we propose a harmonious priority-based <b>multi-services</b> support scheme (HARP) to treat flows using different criteria based on their service requirements. HARP uses a Discrete Smallest Transmitted Flow first (DSTF) to assign dynamic priorities for Web and background flows {{based on the number of}} bytes transmitted, and a fixed priority assignment for real-time and streaming flows based on their delay requirements. HARP can harmonize the co-existence of different flows by providing low queueing delays for real-time and streaming flows, guaranteeing short response time for interactive Web flows, and offering comparable throughput for background flows as in the traditional best effort network. Furthermore, HARP increases the goodput of the network by significantly reducing the packet drop rate. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HARP, simulations are carried out using realistic Internet traffic sources such as Web traffic, real-time and streaming traffic, and traditional best effort traffic. Simulation results indicate that a simple, scalable, and easy-to-deploy scheme can be designed to support <b>multi-services</b> by utilizing the invariants of the Internet through HARP. 1...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{television}} {{terrestrial broadcasting}} (DTTB) networks {{can help to}} alleviate the congestion problem in cellular networks by delivering rich contents to {{a large number of}} clients simultaneously. In particular, recently, there is a strong interest of extending current DTTB systems to support multimedia broadcasting services. The lack of return channel and long transmission time interval however impose great challenge to the resource allocation for this application in DTTB networks. The reliable resource allocation is studied for <b>multi-services</b> with data delivery delay constraints in the second generation digital video broadcasting terrestrial (DVB-T 2) system. To solve this challenging problem, the data cells of a T 2 -frame are divided into data slices which are indexed by binary numbers. These data slices are organised in a binary tree, and each node in the tree is associated with a certain number of non-adjacent data slices. Then a node can be allocated to a service by using the predefined policies. Based on this scheme, this study proposes a heuristic algorithm to allocate resources to <b>multi-services.</b> Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its advantage over the current resource allocation scheme in DVB-T 2 networks...|$|R
