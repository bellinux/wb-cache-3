2500|$|I {{was obliged}} to read it because {{everybody}} was asking me about it. <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> that Dan Brown {{is one of the}} characters in my novel Foucault's Pendulum, which is about people who start believing in occult stuff.|$|E
2500|$|Benny {{was profoundly}} shaken by Allen's sudden {{death of a}} heart attack in 1956. In a {{statement}} released on the day after Allen's death, Benny said, [...] "People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> always the same. You couldn't have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney said of {{the measure}} overall, [...] "There really wasn't Republican or Democrat in this. People ask me if this is {{conservative}} or liberal, and <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> yes. It's liberal {{in the sense that}} we're getting our citizens health insurance. It's conservative in that we're not getting a government takeover." [...] The law was {{the first of its kind}} in the nation and became the signature achievement of Romney's term in office. [...] When Romney's official portrait was made for the Massachusetts State House, the composition included a leather binder with a medical seal representing the healthcare legislation.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> first a groan over my {{shattered}} illusion, {{and then}} a deep-throated curse at the folly that had made a mock of me.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what else}} did he say, if you please?" [...] {{explaining}} impatiently when <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> not of the kind expected: [...] "No, no, I mean about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "I think, sir, I would {{recommend}} you next, to order down such heavy furniture and lumber {{as can be}} moved, and make a barricade within the gate." ...|$|R
2500|$|Benny {{was profoundly}} shaken by Allen's sudden death {{from a heart}} attack in 1956. In a {{statement}} released on the day after Allen's death, Benny said, [...] "People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> always the same. You couldn't have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it." [...] Allen himself wrote, [...] "For years people have been asking me if Jack and I are friendly. I don't think that Jack Benny has an enemy in the world.... He is my favourite comedian and I hope to be his friend until he is forty. That will be forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{private sector}} {{should be given}} more {{autonomy}} to direct matters that deal directly with youth empowerment and job creation. In this regard, NASSI will lead a networking initiative that will include value chain-related organisations along with states and local governments. NASSI will, through this partnership, adequately address the issues and factors that militate against the growth of SMEIs and work out positive and workable frameworks that will {{once and for all}} ensure the growth of SMEIs. Government can not create jobs in a sustainable way. There is need to boost production and ensure that small-scale industries contribute 90 to 95 per cent to GDP. That is why I ask you, can government actually create jobs? To this particular question, <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> no! And I speak as an expert on this matter. The other sustainable way I know is to create a powerful private sector-driven entrepreneurial base, propelled and predicated on small and medium scale industries and the informal sector." ...|$|E
2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> that {{a homosexual}} {{is somebody who}} is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt. Rev. Muhanguzi ... asked the following question: ... How can God contradict himself by saying in the Book of Genesis that Adam {{should be given a}} wife, Eve, and then also create homosexuals? ... However, now that I have been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon. Kadaga, I can see the fallacy of Bishop Muhanguzi's position. ... Do Albinos create themselves? No. Simply, nature goes wrong in a minority of cases. ... The question at the core of the debate of the homosexuals is: [...] "What do we do with an abnormal person? Do we kill him/her? Do we imprison him/her? Or do we contain him/her?" ... Apart from the people who are born abnormal, it seems there is a larger group of those that become homosexual for mercenary reasons - they get recruited on account of financial inducements. ... How about the women lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that go into that practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation of our youth to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one I would agree with the Bill passed by Parliament. The unanswered question, however, is: What do you do with the really abnormal people? ... Only the other day, I saw on television that Dr. Allan Turing, the genius mathematician that cracked the German Enigma code for the anti-Hitler alliance ... was a homosexual. This man ... enabled them to win the war. Yet, the British chemically castrated him in 1952, where-upon he committed suicide, apparently. Were the British correct in handling that issue like that? The British no longer think so. Only the other day, the Queen had to apologize to this ... person ... much more useful to society than the millions of sexually normal people. ... he challenge is how to correctly handle the sexually abnormal on the one hand and those who use money or any other influence to recruit sexually normal people into this abnormal and disgusting behaviour. When we meet in the NRM caucus, we shall, I am sure, find a scientifically correct position.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean, Pathfinder, {{that you}} have talked of this match more to oblige my father than {{anything}} else; that your feelings are no way concerned, let <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>be</b> what it may?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know how}} I talked. And I {{also know that}} before the talk was {{finished}} you inquired how I stood as regards aristocracies, and <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> calculated to relieve your fears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He bade me {{beware of}} <b>my</b> soul. <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> very terrible, and I will not shock you with it. Ah me! {{it is easy}} to talk of repentance, but repentance will not come with a word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sire, {{bear with}} me. If I speak in heat, I speak in zeal. You {{ask me what}} I wish: <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> a {{national}} existence, which we have not. You ask me what I wish: <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> the Land of Promise. You ask me what I wish: <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> Jerusalem. You ask me what I wish: <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> the Temple, all we have forfeited, all we have yearned after, all for which we have fought, our beauteous country, our holy creed, our simple manners, and our ancient customs.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray do {{not think}} me ungrateful, Elbert," [...] she replied, [...] "nor insensible {{to the truth of}} what you say. But <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> no!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> that it {{was most}} {{probably}} just like {{the world in which}} we are living now, with the one exception that the plants and animals are different.|$|E
60|$|But too late. <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> a {{crashing}} blow. The next instant, as I {{sank back}} to my seat and covered my face, {{the two halves of}} the image fell at my feet, flung there by the friar.|$|R
6000|$|He {{opened it}} {{in the light of}} the coach-lamp on that side, and read--first to himself and then aloud: [...] "'Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.' It's not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> RECALLED TO LIFE." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{too much}} {{tenderness}} in this discourse not to affect me exceedingly. I told him I would perfectly resign myself unto his disposal. But as my father had, together with his love for me, a very nice judgment in his discourse, he fixed his eyes very attentively on me, and though <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> without the least reserve, yet {{he thought he saw}} some uneasiness in me at the proposal, and from thence concluded that my compliance was rather an act of discretion than inclination; and that, however I seemed so absolutely given up to what he had proposed, yet <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> really an effect of my obedience rather than my choice.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; not {{as strong}} as that, brother. Mr. Bayard has offered, and <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> {{deferred}} until you have met him. I would not engage myself, Mordaunt, until you approved of my choice." ...|$|E
6000|$|Even this {{confession}} {{failed to}} move Father Benwell. He obstinately crossed his arms, obstinately tapped {{his foot on}} the floor. [...] "No!" [...] he said. [...] "Plead as generously as you may, <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> No." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I am {{answering}} you, Barker, as {{your old}} partner, {{but also as}} the partner of a hundred other men, who have even a greater right to ask me. And <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> not a cent!" ...|$|E
25|$|But {{though these}} <b>my</b> <b>Answers</b> <b>are</b> not laid downe in a Schollerlik way, {{but by the}} plaine truth of holy Scripture; yet I beseech thee have the {{patience}} to take the paynes to reade them, and spare some time to consider them...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> to {{pass out}} at the gate immediately. She made a hasty gesture with her hand, as if to entreat my {{patience}} and my silence, and turned towards London, whence, as her dress betokened, she had come expeditiously on foot.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Mary (after a pause, {{coming forward}} passionately). Hush! I {{have given you}} <b>my</b> <b>answer,</b> <b>be</b> it Alexander Morton or Sandy. Go now: bring me the child this evening at my house. I will meet you there. (Leads the DUCHESS to wing. The DUCHESS endeavors to fall at her feet.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir, <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> that I, a poor Christian prisoner, {{a victim}} of war and fate, thank the Caliph Harun-al-Rashid for the honours and the {{benefits}} he would shower on me, and with humility decline them." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> {{that if it}} be true {{that every}} novel {{contains}} an element of autobiography--and this can hardly be denied, since the creator can only express himself in his creation--then {{there are some of}} us to whom an open display of sentiment is repugnant.|$|E
6000|$|We {{now have}} I and A [...] "asserting". Does this leave us {{free to make}} what {{supposition}} we choose as to E? <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> [...] "No. We are tied down to the supposition that E does not assert." [...] This can be proved as follows:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Permit me {{to mention}} a circumstance, and to leave <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> to <b>be</b> inferred. Jeanne is Lady Medhurst.|$|R
6000|$|... "'And {{what has}} brought you here, Mr. Morning Tatler?' asked my interlocutor, rather roughly. <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> frank--that the {{disappearance}} of a noble lady from the house of her friends had caused the greatest excitement in the metropolis, and that my employers were anxious to give the public every particular regarding an event so singular.|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} day I was allowed to leave my room and very soon I {{was able to get}} about. As my mother had anticipated, many people asked me questions concerning the events of that hideous night. To one and all <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> the same. I remembered nothing. My illness had left my memory a blank.|$|R
6000|$|Here is a {{definite}} question. <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> Yes, {{but we do not}} refer to the Thirty-nine Articles for a statement of the Gospel, but rather to the Apostles' Creed, which contains the simplest summary of the facts on which the Gospel rests. (See 1 Cor. xv. 1, etc.) ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> {{positive}} and direct, viz., that notwithstanding all this, they are chargeable with an unaccountable, unjustifiable, and, I had almost said, a most scandalous indolence and neglect, {{and that in}} respect to this woollen manufacture in particular; a neglect so gross, that by it they suffer a manifest injury in trade. This neglect consists of three heads: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That you {{suggested}} before," [...] said Fletcher, [...] "and <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> the same. I {{will be no}} man’s confederate in dishonesty; I will raise every penny at all costs, and save {{the name of the}} firm—and yours with it—but I will never have you darken the office again, or sit in this house after to-night." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. If he came himself, {{which he}} will not do, <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> would <b>be</b> the same. Remember I am your mother.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I wasn't soured, <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> would <b>be</b> no. But being soured, Mr Wegg, {{and driven}} to {{reckless}} madness and desperation, I suppose it's Yes.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "He's {{the only}} player I have ever known to get an ovation from the fans on the {{practice}} tee. I've seen him playing practice rounds before a tournament and half the gallery {{was made up of}} other professionals. Somebody asked me once, Who's better? Jack Nicklaus or Ben Hogan? Well, <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> I saw Nicklaus watch Hogan practice. But I never saw Hogan watch Nicklaus." ...|$|R
