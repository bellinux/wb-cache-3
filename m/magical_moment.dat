5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its release, Jurassic Park has frequently been cited by film critics and industry professionals {{as one of the}} greatest movies of the action and thriller genres. The American Film Institute named Jurassic Park the 35th most thrilling film of all time on June 13, 2001. The Chicago Film Critics Association also ranked Jurassic Park as the 55th scariest movie of all time and, in 2005, Bravo chose the scene in which Lex and Tim are stalked by two raptors in the kitchen as the 95th scariest movie moment ever. On Empire magazine's fifteenth anniversary in 2004, it judged Jurassic Park the sixth most influential film of the magazine's lifetime. Empire called the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus the 28th most <b>magical</b> <b>moment</b> in cinema. In 2008, an Empire poll of readers, filmmakers, and critics also rated it one of the 500 greatest films of all time. On Film Reviews fifty-fifth anniversary in 2005, it declared the film to be one of the five most important in the magazine's lifetime. In 2006, IGN ranked Jurassic Park as the 19th greatest film franchise ever. In a 2010 poll, the readers of Entertainment Weekly rated it the greatest summer movie of the previous 20 years. The popularity of the movie caused the management of the National Basketball Association expansion franchise founded in Toronto in 1995 to adopt the nickname Raptors.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{review of}} the {{painting}} shows that some practitioners of particular faiths are disappointed by the acceptance of all faiths expressed in Freedom of Religion. Claridge feels that the tight amalgam of faces... and even the crepey skin on elderly hands, which have become the objects of worship, push the theme over the edge from idealistic tolerance into gooey sentiment, where human differences seem {{caught up in a}} <b>magical</b> <b>moment</b> of dispensation from the Light. The restraint demanded by art that deals with heightened emotion is lacking. Claridge stated that the earlier version was [...] "clean, impressively sparse, in counterpoise to a dense narrative content. Beautifully painted even at the preliminary oil sketch stage." [...] Murray and McCabe note that the work is a divergence from the [...] "storytelling style" [...] that Rockwell is known for.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} design included themes of darkness, spirals, and clocks. There {{appears to be}} no sun in the city's world, and spiral designs that shrink when approached were used in the film. A major clock in the film shows no hours; Tatopoulos said, [...] "But in a <b>magical</b> <b>moment</b> it becomes something more than just a clock." [...] The {{production design}}er created the city architecture to have an organic presence with the structural elements.|$|E

2500|$|Thirty years later, {{the video}} of Fisk trying to wave the ball fair {{remains one of the}} game's {{enduring}} images. Game 6 is often considered one of the best games played in Major League history. The crowd remembered that <b>magical</b> <b>moment</b> at precisely 12:34a.m. ET early on the morning of October 22, 1975, when Fisk drove a 1–0 fastball from Cincinnati right-hander Pat Darcy high into the air, heading down the left-field line. [...] "The ball only took about two and half seconds", recalled Fisk. [...] "It seemed like I was jumping and waving for more than two and a half seconds." [...] Two and a half seconds later, the ball caromed off the bright yellow pole, ending {{one of the most dramatic}} World Series games ever played and giving the Red Sox a 7–6 win over the Reds in 12 hard-fought innings.|$|E
2500|$|Drake Hogestyn {{was fired}} in 2007 {{as a way to}} shrink down the budget. Later, in an attempt to {{stabilize}} ratings, he was brought back in 2008. As a result, it provided many storyline opportunities for the couple. However, with a vastly shrinking budget things didn't pan out as planned. Days of Our Lives was renewed in 2008, but the budget was slashed severely by 40%. To make do with the new restrictions, executive producer Ken Corday was forced to fire his two highest paid actors, Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn. Critics slammed the show for their firings, with TV Guide's Nelson Branco saying in an interview, [...] "The show became uglier after Hall and Hogestyn left the airwaves. Many claim {{it was the beginning of}} the end for our industry. You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who would disagree with that statement." [...] Matt Mitovich said their exit was, [...] "Truly the end of an era, as daytime television says goodbye to 'Days of Our Lives' John Black and Dr. Marlena Evans on Friday, Jan. 23. Drake Hogestyn and Deidre Hall, aka John and [...] "Doc," [...] have nearly 12,000 Days appearances between them over the past 32 years. As such, they will leave behind many memories for fans of NBC's long-running (and now only) sudser. The iconic couple will create another <b>magical</b> <b>moment</b> when they say goodbye to Salem and loved ones following this week's hospital bedside wedding ceremony." ...|$|E
60|$|Rose was so {{amazed by}} all this that she sat down {{trembling}} a little, not with fear or anger, but a feeling half pleasure, half pain, {{and a sense of}} some new power subtle, strong, and sweet that had come into her life. It seemed as if another Mac had taken the place of the one she had known so long an ardent, ambitious man, ready for any work now that the <b>magical</b> <b>moment</b> had come when everything seems possible to love. If hope could work such a marvelous change for a moment, could not happiness do it for a lifetime? It would be an exciting experiment to try, she thought, remembering the sudden illumination which made that familiar face both beautiful and strange.|$|E

6000|$|Passers-by {{probably}} thought them {{a pair of}} harmless lunatics, for they entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious of deepening dusk and fog. Little they cared what anybody thought, for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life, the <b>magical</b> <b>moment</b> which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven. The Professor {{looked as if he}} had conquered a kingdom, and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss.
