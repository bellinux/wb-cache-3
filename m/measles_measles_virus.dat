40|$|Measles virus {{causes a}} severe {{systemic}} illness. The rash occurs simultaneously {{with the onset}} of the effector phase of the antiviral immune response and substantial evidence of immune activation. This immune response is effective in clearing virus and in establishing long-term resistance to reinfection but is associated with immune suppression, autoimmune encephalomy-elitis, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections. This apparent paradox may be ex-plained in part by preferential long-term activation of type 2 CD 4 + T cells by measles virus infection. Preferential stimulation of type I CD 4 + T cells by inactivated virus vaccines is hypoth-esized to playa role in subsequent development of atypical <b>measles.</b> <b>Measles</b> <b>virus</b> infection is associated with several distinc-tive pathogenetic features that may be important for under-standing the disease and for the eventual eradication of measles through immunization.

40|$|Measles virus (MV), one of {{the most}} {{contagious}} viruses infecting humans, causes a systemic infection leading to fever, immune suppression, and a characteristic maculopapular rash. However, the specific mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the spread of MV into the respiratory epithelium in the late stages of the disease are unknown. Here we show the crucial role of PVRL 4 in mediating the spread of MV from immune to epithelial cells by generating a PVRL 4 “blind ” recombinant wild-type MV and developing a novel in vitro coculture model of B cells with primary differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells. We utilized the macaque model of measles to analyze virus distribution in the respiratory tract prior to and at the peak of MV replication. Expression of PVRL 4 was widespread in both the lower and upper respiratory tract (URT) of macaques, indicat-ingMV transmission can be facilitated by more than only epithelial cells of the trachea. Analysis of tissues collected at early time points after experimental MV infection demonstrated the presence of MV-infected lymphoid andmyeloid cells contacting respi-ratory tract epithelium in the absence of infected epithelial cells, suggesting that these immune cells seed the infection in vivo. Thereafter, lateral cell-to-cell spread of MV {{led to the formation of}} large foci of infected cells in the trachea and high levels of MV infection in the URT, particularly in the nasal cavity. These novel findings have important implications for our understanding of the high transmissibility of <b>measles.</b> <b>Measles</b> <b>virus</b> (MV), the prototype morbillivirus of the familyParamyxoviridae, remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world and is highly transmissible (1) ...|$|E

40|$|Upon the {{addition}} of antibody to <b>measles</b> <b>virus,</b> <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> antigens expressed {{on the surface of}} infected cells can be modulated from the cell's membrane in vitro.

Currently {{there are}} several variances in the nucleotide sequences of N, F, M and H genes across wild type <b>measles</b> <b>viruses,</b> hence <b>measles</b> <b>viruses</b> can be categorized into clades and genotypes. The antigenicity of the previous genotype of <b>measles</b> {{is different from the}} current genotype. Objective To determine the antigenic differences between wild type <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> and <b>measles</b> vaccine <b>virus.</b> Methods Analysis of the antigenic differences between wild type virus (G 2, G 3 and D 9) and vaccine virus (CAM- 70 and Schwarz) was performed by immunizing mice with the respective viruses. The serum was then tested with micro-cross-neutralization technique using the G 2, G 3, D 9 and CAM- 70 virus.

Using Moraten vaccine strain-derived <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> and isogenic mutants deficient for either V or C protein production (Vko and Cko, respectively), we {{observed that the}} Cko virus was a potent inducer of IFN-, while induction by Vko virus was {{an order of magnitude}} lower than that by the Cko virus. The parental recombinant Moraten virus did not significantly induce IFN-. The enhanced IFN-inducing capacity of the Cko virus correlated with an enhanced activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF- 3), NF-B, and ATF- 2 in Cko-infected compared to Vko or parental virus-infected cells. Furthermore, protein kinase PKR and mitochondrial adapter IPS- 1 were required for maximal Cko-mediated IFN- induction, which correlated with the PKR-mediated enhancement of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-B activation.

Nuclei which had been invaded by virus antigens were frequently swollen and the cells tended to have round rather than cuboidal morphologies.

Recently, we have shown that wild-type MeVs induce the suppression of protein synthesis in host cells (referred to as "shutoff") and that viral mRNAs are preferentially translated under shutoff conditions in infected cells. To determine the mechanism behind the preferential translation of viral mRNA, we focused on the 5  untranslated region (UTR) of nucleocapsid (N) mRNA.

Recombinant La enhanced the translation of luciferase mRNA containing the N- 5 UTR (N-fLuc), and RNA interference of La suppressed N-fLuc translation. Furthermore, recombinant MeV lacking the La-binding motif in the N- 5 UTR displayed delayed viral protein synthesis and growth kinetics at an early phase of infection.

It was concluded that the divergence time of the most recent common ancestor of current MeV was the early 20 th century.

40|$|<b>Measles,</b> {{caused by}} <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> (MV), {{is a highly}} {{contagious}} viral disease causing severe respiratory infection and a typical rash. Despite {{the availability of a}} protective vaccine, <b>measles</b> is still the leading vaccine-preventable cause of childhood mortality worldwide. The high mortality associated with the disease is mainly due to an increased susceptibility to secondary infections during the period of immunosuppression that continues for several weeks after recovery. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the role of cytoskeletal components in the regulation of MV infection. The most interesting finding was that MV replication was activated in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) when globular actin was converted into the filamentous form with jasplakinolide. This provides a new aspect in our understanding of MV infection in PBMC. In {{the second part of the}} thesis we investigated MV-induced structural changes of cellular nuclear matrix, which is a proteinaceous framework of the nucleus similar to the cytoskeleton in the cytoplasm. We showed that cleavage of nuclear markers was virusspecific and a general caspase inhibitor rescued MV-infected cells from cell death. Furthermore, we studied MV-induced innate immune mechanisms in lung epithelial and endothelial cells. Our results showed that MV infection resulted in activation of the double stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding molecules melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda- 5), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), and toll-like receptor 3 (TLR 3) gene expression, followed by high expression of antiviral cytokine mRNA...|$|R

40|$|Immunosuppression {{during and}} after <b>measles</b> results in {{increased}} susceptibility to other infections and 1 million deaths annually. The mechanism by which <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> (MV) induces immune suppression is incompletely understood, but a type 2 skewing of the cytokine response after infection has been documented. In vitro studies suggest that lack of interleukin (IL) – 12 production by monocytes and dendritic cells plays an early role in the skewed response. In addition, immunization with an inactivated <b>measles</b> vaccine before <b>measles</b> develops appears to lead to an even stronger type 2 skewing of the cytokine response and atypical <b>measles.</b> In this study, the cytokine responses in rhesus macaques were compared after vaccination with live and formalin-inactivated vaccines and after challenge with MV. In vivo production of IL- 12 was decreased during the viremic phase of the illness, and production of IL- 4 was increased {{during and after}} atypical <b>measles,</b> compared with <b>measles.</b> The outcome of infection with <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> (MV) is largely determined by unique interactions between the virus and the immune system. <b>Measles</b> was the first disease to be recognized to be immunosuppressive, and most deaths associated with mea...|$|R
40|$|COOPER 1 placed <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> in the deoxyvirus group. There is now {{considerable}} evidence {{which is}} contrary to this view. The appearance of acridine-orange stained inclusions in <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> infected cells under ultraviolet illumination suggests {{the presence of a}} ribovirus 2. This is in agreement with the observations of Atherton 3. Waterson et al. 4 reported similarity of <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> to myxoviruses, under the electron microscope. Waterson 5 further showed that the three serologically related <b>viruses,</b> <b>measles,</b> canine distemper and rinderpest, are structurally identical with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), representative of a myxovirus sub-group. Further support for the similarity of <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> and NDV is that these viruses undergo identical morphological changes during ether treatment, and the ability of <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> to cause hæmagglutination...|$|R
40|$|A {{relation}} {{has been}} assumed between {{the pathogenesis of}} subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) 1 and a preceding infection with <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> that had been contracted some 10 yr before (1). Although no formal proof exists that <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> has remained present in individual children suffering from SSPE, this is generally {{believed to be the}} case. Thus it is not known where the <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> resided during that period. It may be that, after a primary infection, resting lymphocytes or cells from the central nervous system harbor the virus. Indeed, {{it has been suggested that}} <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> remains in the body of everyone because levels of antibodies against <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> remain high during life, even in the absence of repeated antigenic stimulation from the environment (2). <b>Measles</b> <b>virus</b> has been isolated from human lymph nodes after recovery from the acute infection (3) and from lymph nodes of SSPE patients (4). Previously, we have reported that <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> inhibits the stimulation of lymphocytes in vitro (5). This effect is caused by the infection of lymphocytes rather than of monocytes (6) ...|$|R
40|$|Morphological and immunocytological {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the presence of paramyxovirus antigens in Paget's bone disease tissue and in particular antigens related to <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> and respiratory syncytial virus. To {{examine the relationship between}} <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> and Paget's bone disease we used in situ hybridization and a cloned <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> DNA probe specific for the nucleocapsid protein to detect and locate <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> RNA sequences in Paget's bone tissue. In five patients with the disease, <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> RNA sequences were detected not only in 80 to 90 % of the multinucleated osteoclasts where there is morphological and immunocytological evidence of <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> activity but also in 30 to 40 % of mononucleated bone cells, mainly osteoblasts, osteocytes, fibroblasts and lympho-monocytes. In contrast, no hybridization was observed in bone tissue from three control patients without signs of Paget's bone disease. These results indicate that the host cell range for <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> in Paget's disease is more widespread than has been supposed. They also demonstrate the usefulness of the in situ hybridization method to detect viral genetic information in cells where viral antigenic activity is not detectable.
