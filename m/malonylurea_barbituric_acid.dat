40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (1) we reported {{the results of}} our experi-ments with picrotoxin as an antidote in acute poisoning by the shorter acting barbiturates. As types of that group we selected ethyl l-methyl-butyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> (the free acid of nembutal (pentobarbital sodium)), sec-butyl fl-bromallyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> (pernocton), and iso-amyl ethyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> (amytal). The present report is a continuation of the work, showing the antidotal effectiveness of picrotoxin in case of acute poisoning from the longer acting barbiturates. This is a large group so we have selected only the following members as types: phenyl ethyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> (phenobarbital), ethyl n-butyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> (neonal), ethyl iso-propyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> of ipral), allyl iso-propyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid,</b> allyl iso-propyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> with dimethyl diethyl-amino pyrazolon (allonal), and diallyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> (dial).

In addition to these, the following compounds: sec-butyl j 9 -bromallyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> (pernocton), iso-amyl ethyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> (amytal), and iso-propyl bromallyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> (noctal) were given orally. These latter compounds when administered intraperitoneally are classed as shorter acting but when adminis-tered orally require a much larger quantity to cause death and act essentially similar to the longer acting members.

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of barbital as a hypnotic since its introduc-tion by Fischer and Von Mering (1) in 1904 has stimulated the investigation of other <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives. As a result {{a number of new}} synthetics of this series have been prepared; several have been studied pharmacologically; some have already appeared on the market as substitutes for barbital. The present investigation was made upon the suggestion of Dr. E. H. Voiwiler who, with the main purpose in view of in-. vestigating the allyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acids,</b> prepared a series of bar-bituric acid derivatives for comparison with barbital and other newer <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> hypnotics of promising character. The relative toxicity and efficiency of these hypnotics were determined on one and the same species of animal under identical conditions, according to the methods described later. The margin between the toxicity (minimum fatal dose) and the efficiency (minimum effective dose), of each hypnotic, expressed in percentage of the minimum fatal dose, was chosen as an index for its safety. It is understood that the safety margin for albino rats may or may not correspond to that for the human.

All other strains of N. coruZZinu investigated oxidized thymine, but varied in their abilities to oxidize uracil and cystosine. Organisms adapted to pyrimidines converted uracil to <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> and thy-mine to 5 -methylbarbituric acid. Oxidation of uracil by thymine-grown organisms was almost entirely by a pathway in which <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> was an intermediate. Oxidation of thymine by uracil-grown organisms was similarly almost entirely via b-methylbarbituric acid. Oxidation of uracil by uracil-grown organisms and of thymine by thymine-grown organisms occurred, a t least in part, through the respective <b>barbituric</b> <b>acids.</b> Discrepancies between the theoretical and observed values for 0, uptake suggested however that other pathways may also occur in these cases. Pyrimidine-grown organisms oxidized 2 -thiouracil to 2 -thiobarbituric acid and 2 -thiothymine to a compound which was probably 5 -methyl- 2 -thiobarbituric acid. These products were not further degraded by the organism. <b>Barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> was oxidized by uracil-grown organisms to CO,, NH, and urea with concurrent oxidative assimilation.
