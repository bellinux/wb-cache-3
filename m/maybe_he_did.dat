5|$|In {{his second}} {{meeting of the}} day with Scully and Doggett, Wells {{explains}} that he cannot remember the last few days. Scully suggests that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> do it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we emptied {{a bucket}} of water over his linstock and priming, d'ye see, so <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> all he could. But there's France, where that {{thickening}} is over yonder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{could he}} {{if he was}} at the ranch? But wait a minute! He said {{something}} about going fishing in that brook that flows through the woods. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> come up that way, after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Buster went one way, and {{the bags}} went tudder--leas'wise so I {{was given to}} understand. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> it to put me off the track," [...] {{continued}} Isaac Dowling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> won't <b>do</b> {{anything}}--after <b>he</b> calms down," [...] {{said the}} shipowner's son. [...] "He'll realize that Dave wouldn't {{do anything like}} that on purpose." ...|$|R
5000|$|... (The Boy and the Bridge, 1959 (d: Kevin McClory) SG {{worked on}} this but is not {{credited}} as AD, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> just <b>did</b> sketches? Locs: Tower Bridge, Bermondsey) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it means}} to pass the dollars out into circulation. Then {{he said he would}} split. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> split. I didn't wait to see. I just killed him and lighted out for the coal country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{did hear}} you say {{something}} about a gold piece," [...] the shellman admitted. [...] "You didn't talk very plainly and I understood very little. Haskett said he understood every word. Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> I've been in the navy so long that {{the noise of the}} big guns has affected my hearing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Milt did not listen. He was wondering, {{now that}} they had started, where they had started for. Certainly not for Seattle! Why not stop and see Pinky's gold-mine? <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> have one. Even Pinky had {{to tell the truth}} sometimes. With a good popular gold-mine in his possession, Milt could buy {{quantities}} of clothes like Jeff Saxton's, and---- ...|$|E
30|$|Lisi {{was doing}} dishes just now, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> is still <b>doing</b> now.|$|R
50|$|Back at Daniel's place, Sofia {{wakes up}} beside Daniel. Worried {{that she will}} miss her flight, she says that they need a {{breather}} {{so they can see}} if what they have is real. He insists that he loves her but Sofia says it's just hormones and sex. If this is real, he should see other women while she's gone. If he doesn't get sweaty palms with them, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> love her. <b>He</b> says that this is crazy but she tells him that this will convince her that he really feels this only for her.|$|R
50|$|When {{the group}} of cats are ready to leave, Ravenpaw was very sad and is {{reluctant}} to let them leave, but Barley was relieved. He then cleans the barn while Ravenpaw is sleeping. Later, Ravenpaw and Barley discuss the cats, Ravenpaw accuses Barley of treating the cats like they were intruders. Barley tells him that since his background was with the Clan, it made a difference. He also questions Ravenpaw's belonging in the barn which shocks and offends Ravenpaw. It also makes him think that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> belong in the clans.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dead" [...] came to Uncle John, {{as perhaps}} Susan had contrived; and shrugging up his shoulders, {{he went off}} to hide, and his whoop was {{presently}} heard. He was not VERY good game; <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not wish to be very long sought, for he was no further than in the tall French beans, generally considered as a stupid place to hide in. The children had been in hopes that he would catch Papa, which was always a very difficult matter, for the sailor was lighter of foot, as well as, of course, longer in limb, than any of the children; but they saw that Uncle John had not the slightest chance with him, and it was Bessie who was caught in her homeward race.|$|E
60|$|He was a {{nice young}} man of prepossessing {{appearance}} and amiable manners. They could not call to mind his name, but remembered having met him, somewhere, and {{on more than one}} occasion. The American girl is always sociable: they bowed and smiled, and said it was a fine day. He replied with volubility, and helped them down on to the ice. He was really most attentive. They saw their friend, the officer of noble family, and, {{with the assistance of the}} German gentleman, skated towards him. He glided past them. They thought that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know enough to stop, so they turned and skated after him. They chased him three times round the pond and then, feeling tired, eased up and took counsel together.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will tell}} his Highness of Babbiano," [...] he replied, [...] "that he {{reminds us of}} the boy in the fable who cried 'Wolf!' too often. Tell him, sir, that his threats leave this {{garrison}} as unmoved as do his promises. If so be that he intends in truth to bombard us, let him begin forthwith. We are ready for him, as you perceive. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not suppose us equipped with cannon; but there they stand. Those guns are trained upon his camp, and the first shot he fires upon us shall be a signal for such a reply as he little dreams of. Tell him, too, that we expect no quarter, and will yield none. We are unwilling for bloodshed, but if he drives us to it and executes his purpose of employing cannon, then the consequences be upon his own head. Bear him that answer, and tell him to send you no more with empty threats." ...|$|E
60|$|She kept on sobbing then {{without any}} noise, and Almayer {{stared at her}} in {{boundless}} astonishment. The idea that, <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> had <b>done</b> wrong by confiding in her, upset him so much {{that for a moment}} he could not find a connected thought in his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "It be, surely," [...] Harry said; [...] "but what a sight o' good {{it would}} do, {{and if his}} woife {{be willing to give}} oop her time to the girls, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would <b>do</b> as much for us." [...] There was a pause again. Several of the lads looked irresolute.|$|R
5000|$|O'Shaughnessy admits all this, but pleads {{that she}} {{is in love with}} Spade and he loves her. Spade refuses to protect her, listing several reasons. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> care for her; but he says [...] "I won't play the sap for you." [...] If she (a pretty young woman) can get off with a long prison term, he'll wait for her. But if she hangs, so be it. She kisses him one last time, just before the police arrive. He turns her in. The police tell him Wilmer has shot Gutman dead. At the office the next day, Effie is shocked that O'Shaughnessy was a {{ruthless}} killer, but also that Spade could so coldbloodedly turn her in. Then Iva Archer comes in, and the story ends.|$|R
60|$|One of the {{new friends}} who went out there with me was a large man, and I had been admiring his size all the way. I was still admiring it as he stood by the {{governor}} on the veranda, talking; then the Fijian butler stepped out there to announce tea, and dwarfed him. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not quite dwarf him, but at any rate the contrast was quite striking. Perhaps that dark giant was a king in a condition of political suspension. I {{think that in the}} talk there on the veranda it was said that in Fiji, as in the Sandwich Islands, native kings and chiefs are of much grander size and build than the commoners. This man was clothed in flowing white vestments, and they were just the thing for him; they comported well with his great stature and his kingly port and dignity. European clothes would have degraded him and made him commonplace. I know that, because they do that with everybody that wears them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was never}} served so before without giving a hard blow for it," [...] muttered Stubb, as {{he found himself}} {{descending}} the cabin-scuttle. [...] "It's very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well know whether {{to go back and}} strike him, or--what's that?-- down here on my knees and pray for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but {{it would be the first}} time I ever did pray. It's queer; very queer; and he's queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he's about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!--his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad! Anyway there's something's on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don't sleep then. Didn't that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it's a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say-- worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He's full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what's that for, I should like to know? Who's made appointments with him in the hold? Ain't that queer, now? But there's no telling, it's the old game-- Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think of it, that's about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em. But that's against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes again. But how's that? didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that! He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> kick me, and I didn't observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil's the matter with me? I don't stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though--How? how? how?-- but the only way's to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the morning, I'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{was a small}} boy, Lem Hackett was drowned--on a Sunday. He {{fell out}} of an empty flat-boat, where he was playing. Being loaded with sin, {{he went to the}} bottom like an anvil. He was the only boy in the village who slept that night. We others all lay awake, repenting. We had not needed the information, {{delivered}} from the pulpit that evening, that Lem's was a case of special judgment--we knew that, already. There was a ferocious thunder-storm, that night, and it raged continuously until near dawn. The winds blew, the windows rattled, the rain swept along the roof in pelting sheets, and at the briefest of intervals the inky blackness of the night vanished, the houses over the way glared out white and blinding for a quivering instant, then the solid darkness shut down again and a splitting peal of thunder followed, which seemed to rend everything in the neighborhood to shreds and splinters. I sat up in bed quaking and shuddering, waiting for the destruction of the world, and expecting it. To me there was nothing strange or incongruous in heaven's making such an uproar about Lem Hackett. Apparently it was the right and proper thing to do. Not a doubt entered my mind that all the angels were grouped together, discussing this boy's case and observing the awful bombardment of our beggarly little village with satisfaction and approval. There was one thing which disturbed me in the most serious way; that was the thought that this centering of the celestial interest on our village could not fail {{to attract the attention of}} the observers to people among us who might otherwise have escaped notice for years. I felt that I was not only one of those people, but the very one most likely to be discovered. That discovery could have but one result: I should be in the fire with Lem before the chill of the river had been fairly warmed out of him. I knew that this would be only just and fair. I was increasing the chances against myself all the time, by feeling a secret bitterness against Lem for having attracted this fatal attention to me, but I could not help it--this sinful thought persisted in infesting my breast in spite of me. Every time the lightning glared I caught my breath, and judged I was gone. In my terror and misery, I meanly began to suggest other boys, and mention acts of theirs which were wickeder than mine, and peculiarly needed punishment--and I tried to pretend to myself that I was simply doing this in a casual way, and without intent to divert the heavenly attention to them for the purpose of getting rid of it myself. With deep sagacity I put these mentions into the form of sorrowing recollections and left-handed sham-supplications that the sins of those boys might be allowed to pass unnoticed--'Possibly they may repent.' 'It is true that Jim Smith broke a window and lied about it--but <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not mean any harm. And although Tom Holmes says more bad words than any other boy in the village, he probably intends to repent--though he has never said he would. And whilst it is a fact that John Jones did fish a little on Sunday, once, he didn't really catch anything but only just one small useless mud-cat; and maybe that wouldn't have been so awful if he had thrown it back--as he says he did, but he didn't. Pity but they would repent of these dreadful things--and maybe they will yet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Dad, {{a little}} thing like a girl {{sticking}} close {{to her mother and}} room doesn't stop Mr. Chase. I think he's crazy. Anyway, he's a most persistent fool. I want to be charitable, because the man swears he loves me, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> but <b>he</b> is making me nervous. I don't sleep. I'm afraid to be in my room at night. I've gone to mother's room. He's always hanging round. Bold! Why, that isn't the thing to call Mr. Chase. He's absolutely without a sense of decency. He bribes our servants. He comes into our patio. Think of that! He makes the most ridiculous excuses. He bothers mother to death. I feel like a poor little rabbit holed by a hound. And I daren't peep out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Horacio then sits in {{the dark}} on the {{opposite}} side of the room, near the window, waiting to see what will happen. The hours pass slowly and painfully, but finally Traveler does try to come in, and the tumult that results brings Dr. Ovejero and the others out into the garden, where they find Oliveira leaning out the window of his room as if intending to let himself fall. Traveler tries to talk Horacio out of <b>doing</b> what <b>he,</b> for his part, insists he doesn't intend to do, though at the conclusion of this part of the book, he suddenly muses that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> mean to do such a thing after all, that maybe it is for the best, and the end of the passage is wholly open to this interpretation. Only by proceeding to read the [...] "Expendable Chapters" [...] will the reader be able to place Horacio firmly back inside mental institution, where, after being sedated by Ovejero, he succumbs to a lengthy delirium.|$|R
50|$|Everett {{interviews}} {{a prosecution}} witness, Dale Porterhouse (Michael Jeter), who saw Beechum {{at the store}} where the shooting took place and said in his statement to the police that he saw him carrying a gun. Everett questions Porterhouse's account, saying that, because of {{the layout of the}} store, he could not have seen a gun in Beechum's hand and that <b>he</b> <b>maybe</b> said what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in order to impress his co-workers.|$|R
5000|$|Engineer Chuck Britz said of Murry: [...] "I {{was one of}} the {{few people}} who liked Murry. I always did. I admired him for the way he got the kids mad at him that made them also {{conscious}} of what they were trying to achieve. I realize that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it the wrong way, but at the same time, he did make them work as a team which was the way it should be." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Burt, {{reviewing}} {{the work in}} the New Yorker , has said that Vollman is more confident about the photographic process in the work than the things that go into performing femininity. [...] "What if he had treated the arts of femininity with the same attention he gives to the arts of photography? <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> but his prose does not reflect it: instead, he comes off, by the end, as an anxious mansplainer, uneasy about the feminine subject he has chosen." ...|$|E
50|$|The sole {{remaining}} McLaren of Lewis Hamilton {{posted the}} fastest time with over five minutes remaining. Not much happened {{for the entire}} session as only 'banker' laps were set as a benchmark for the final two frantic minutes of action. Vettel went out on track for another lap with under two minutes left, but later decided to pit without a lap time as he thought of saving tyres for the race and that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have {{the pace of the}} top five cars.|$|E
60|$|The simple, logical {{interpretation}} of Wilson's words opened Columbine's mind to a disturbing possibility {{of which she}} had never dreamed. That he might love her! If <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> why had <b>he</b> not said so? Jealous, <b>maybe,</b> but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not love her! The next throb of thought was like a knock at a door of her heart--a door never yet opened, inside which seemed a mystery of feeling, of hope, despair, unknown longing, and clamorous voices. The woman just born in her, instinctive and self-preservative, shut that door before she {{had more than a}} glimpse inside. But then she felt her heart swell with its nameless burdens.|$|R
5000|$|Performance wise, Slydini never verbalized a magic word; {{there was}} no [...] "abracadabra" [...] or [...] "hocus pocus". His subtle magical {{gestures}} {{made it clear that}} he knew something not known, and probably unknowable, to his audience. Audiences saw an elfin quality in him that was unlikely to be duplicated. He created an ambiguous persona which allowed one to believe that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was an elf and that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> really <b>did</b> have magical powers. As a close-up performer, he was considered nonpareil by his peers. His almost casual manner of performing made the magical effects he offered those of true magic. His style of close-up was something that had never been seen before. He was one of the first to show close-up magic as an art in itself, rather than as a lead-in to bigger and grander illusions. Slydini's magic was impromptu and rather than follow a set sequence of tricks as most magicians <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> allowed his audience and the situation to dictate his show.|$|R
5000|$|Zarkandar {{began the}} new season by {{returning}} to France for the Grade 1 Grand Prix d'Automne over 4800 metres at Auteuil on 1 November. Ridden by the French jockey Vincent Cheminaud he started the 16/5 second favourite behind Gemix, with the other runners including Reve de Sivola, winner of the race in 2013. He won the race by five lengths from Gemix, with Dulce Leo three lengths back in third. On his return to England, Zarkandar started odds-on favourite for the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot. He tracked the pace-setting Reve de Sivola before taking the lead at the second last and going into a two length lead. On the run-in, however, he faltered when challenged by the resurgent Reve de Sivola and was beaten a head. After the race owner Chris Giles commented [...] "I don't blame the jockey, but <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would <b>do</b> it differently if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it again and wait a bit longer".|$|R

50|$|Pabo {{was present}} at the Battle of Arfderydd (Arthuret) in 573, which may have been fought for control of the Solway. Peredur and Gwrgi were also there, and these two were {{supposedly}} descendents of the Coeling family (Coel Hen) as well as being first cousins of Urien Rheged, (c. 550 - c. 590) so may have been associated with the Rheged area. The sources that mention the battle, however, (the Annales Cambriae and Aneirin's poem Y Gododdin) mention neither Rheged nor Urien, (casting doubt in the minds of some on the existence of both). It may be that Urien took advantage of the confusion and weakness {{as a result of this}} savage battle to make his move to take over Rheged, or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> this after the deaths of Peredur and Gwrgi some years later (the brothers were killed fighting the Angles in 580 or 584).|$|E
50|$|The collection’s {{destination}} after Vicksburg {{remains a}} little uncertain. California newspaper announcements from 1957 indicate that Richards intended {{to reopen the}} museum in Santa Cruz. A brochure exists for The National Civil War Museum of Santa Cruz that lists Richards as the owner. However, a 1961 Florida newspaper article about Richards states that he moved the collection to that state in 1957. Perhaps Richards intended to open the museum in Santa Cruz, but never quite made the move. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> go to California only to immediately turn around and take the collection to Florida. Either way, by 1960 the National Civil War Museum sat along the Suwannee River in Old Town, Florida. As the years advanced, Richards and his wife took less and less interest in the collection. Richard {{suffered a heart attack}} and he and his wife contemplated the future of the museum and its contents. A waning interest in the artifacts, coupled with ailing health, the Richards decided to sell the collection.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2006, Evans {{impressed}} for the Saints in an FAW Premier Cup semi-final against Wrexham, scoring an equaliser in extra-time {{to force}} the game into penalties, and joined Wrexham on a two-year deal in June 2006. He had made over 150 league and cup appearances for TNS. Wrexham manager, Denis Smith, said of him, [...] "He can {{be as good as}} he wants to be - <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> could even <b>do</b> a good job for Wales. Steve's good in the air, can pass well and reads the game. He's older and wiser and benefits from experience." ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{got away}} and looked back, all the boys had their clothes off and were dancing round the fire like Indians, {{and he would have}} liked to turn back after he got to the top, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> might have <b>done</b> so if <b>he</b> had not found Jim Leonard hiding in a hole up there and peeping over at the boys. Jim was crying, and said his tooth ached awfully, and he was afraid to go home and get {{something}} to put in it, because his mother would whale him as soon as she caught him.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{previous}} episode, executive producers Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen discussed how the title characters {{would be affected}} by the reveal that Hive was walking around in the body of Grant Ward, going into this episode, with Whedon saying, [...] "This {{is going to be the}} most shocking for Coulson because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> something dark but for a good reason, and now he knows he didn't achieve much. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> even <b>did</b> something or created something worse with that act. I think that Coulson's real feelings about Ward will come to the surface. For everybody else, obviously it's going to be a very large threat." [...] Tancharoen added, [...] "Up until this point, Coulson has been coping with what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> to Ward back on Maveth by just pushing forward, not really thinking about it. Now, basically Ward's face filled the screen in his office and he literally came face-to-face with the person that he killed. And he's no longer a person, so what is he is still a question. We've been alluding to the fact that he's the ultimate symbol of evil, so that's not good." ...|$|R
