25|$|In the 1990s virtual {{airlines}} utilized <b>manual</b> <b>processes</b> {{for reporting}} flights and tracking statistics for members, progressing through to online databases in 2000, and since 2010 {{the trend has}} been towards automated flight statistics integrated into the flight simulation software. One of these automated systems is the ACARS system. Pilots complete their flight, say in Microsoft Flight Simulator, while {{connected to the internet}} and the software tracks the flight as well as the pilots actions. At the completion of the flight the data is sent to the virtual airlines server and then processed into the online database. This has streamlined participation and opened up new avenues for statistics and tracking, enhancing realism for those involved.|$|E

[...] The ATOP program fully integrated flight and radar data processing, detects conflicts between aircraft, provides data link and surveillance capabilities, and automated the <b>manual</b> <b>processes</b> used previously. [...] ATOP also reduced the workload on controllers {{through the use of}} electronic flight strips instead of the paper strip method used for decades to track trans- oceanic aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Self-learning {{performance}} management: the use {{of technology}} to help automate the performance management of information technology systems. This is done through {{the use of}} software that employs applied mathematics (such as statistics, time series analysis, and forecasting), automated baselining, neural networks, pattern recognition, and other similar technologies. The intent is to automate <b>manual</b> <b>processes</b> and [...] "fixed baseline" [...] approaches used to determine when IT systems are operating out of normal ranges, which would indicate potential system problems. Self-learning performance management is complementary to the disciplines of systems management, network performance management, and application performance management, and is sometimes referred to by IT analyst firms like Gartner by the term behavior learning technology or behavior learning software.|$|E
