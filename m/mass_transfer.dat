5|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} general schemes in which diffusion may take place. Tracer diffusion and chemical diffusion {{differ in the}} level of adsorbate coverage at the surface, while intrinsic diffusion and <b>mass</b> <b>transfer</b> diffusion differ {{in the nature of the}} diffusion environment. Tracer diffusion and intrinsic diffusion both refer to systems where adparticles experience a relatively homogeneous environment, whereas in chemical and <b>mass</b> <b>transfer</b> diffusion adparticles are more strongly affected by their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>transfer</b> {{diffusion}} {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} types of supernovae, TypeIa supernovae {{generally}} occur in all types of galaxies, including ellipticals. They show no preference for regions of current stellar formation. As white dwarf stars form {{at the end of}} a star's main sequence evolutionary period, such a long-lived star system may have wandered far from the region where it originally formed. Thereafter a close binary system may spend another million years in the <b>mass</b> <b>transfer</b> stage (possibly forming persistent nova outbursts) before the conditions are ripe for a TypeIa supernova to occur.|$|E

40|$|Under {{specific}} conditions, ceramics can be deposited from gaseous precursors within porous substrates. This technique, {{referred to}} as chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) is particularly suited to the preparation of ceramic matrix composites (CMC). Pore filling by CVI results from two simultaneous phenomena : (i) a surface reaction and (ii) <b>mass</b> <b>transfers</b> of the reactants and products in the gas phase. In isothermal/isobaric CVI, <b>mass</b> <b>transfers</b> occur only by diffusion. As a result. ICVI has to be performed at low temperatures and under reduced pressures in order {{to lead to a}} deposit homogeneous in thickness along the pores. In forced-CVI, <b>mass</b> <b>transfers</b> are by forced convection due to a pressure gradient. Moreover, an inverse thermal gradient is applied resulting both in a much higher deposition rate. The feasibility of the CVI process is established for a number of ceramic matrices including carbon and Sic...|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This <b>mass</b> <b>transfer</b> between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E
5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104 days with a separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes {{in front of the}} other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant <b>mass</b> <b>transfer</b> to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to {{lower the risk of}} another insurrection. According to Maurice Rives, 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 Tirailleurs Tonkinois were moved, a transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent of insecurity among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, {{and the extent to which}} they were willing to go to make future Yen Bays impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDĐ cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The <b>mass</b> <b>transfer</b> of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation.|$|E
40|$|Compact object binaries, mostly double with dwarfs, are {{believed}} to be a potential source of confusionlimited noise for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In a specific frequency range, this noise may rise above the instrumental noise sources and hence hinder detection of other types of signals, e. g. extreme mass ratio inspirals of stellar mass objects into supermassive black holes. In most previous studies only detached populations of compact object binaries have been considered. Here, we investigate the influence of Galactic populations of compact <b>mass</b> <b>transferring</b> binaries on the shape and strength of the LISA signal and compare our results with the signal for detached binaries only. Our population synthesis includes all binary systems containing two compact remnants. It is found that 99. 5 % of these systems are double white dwarfs, and therefore we consider only binaries consisting of two white dwarfs when calculating the LISA signal. We find that the <b>mass</b> <b>transferring</b> binaries contributing to the confusion limited noise dominate the population of LISA systems by number (∼ 60 %), due to their long lifetimes (∼ few Gyrs). However, due to the very specific physical properties of <b>mass</b> <b>transferring</b> systems, it is found that their contribution to the noise is negligible at low frequencies and detached systems will set the magnitude of the confusion-limited signal in this range. However, the <b>mass</b> <b>transferring</b> system...|$|R

Fluidised bed bio-artificial livers – where liver cells are encapsulated within alginate beads – appear to be a valuable alternative to hollow fibre devices for improving <b>mass</b> <b>transfers</b> and enhancing treatment efficacy. This approach nevertheless deserves optimization in terms of bead production. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of alginate type and of two bead diameters (1000 µm and 600 µm) on <b>mass</b> <b>transfers</b> within beads and on the biological functions of encapsulated C 3 A cells. After assessing the effect of the encapsulation process on bead quality, we investigated cell viability and metabolic activities (ammonia, albumin, alpha-fetoprotein synthesis and glucose consumption). They were successfully maintained over 48 h within fluidised bed bioreactors, independently of alginate type and bead diameter. <b>Mass</b> <b>transfers</b> were not significantly influenced by the latter parameters.

5|$|Ultra-stripped supernovae {{occur when}} the {{exploding}} star has been stripped (almost) {{all the way to}} the metal core, via <b>mass</b> <b>transfer</b> in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (~0.1 MSun). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>transfer</b> {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The {{long-term}} prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very high. In a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E
