60|$|Clematis {{astonished}} {{every one}} by suddenly beginning {{to climb the}} <b>maple-tree</b> and shake her silvery tassels like a canopy over the Queen's head.|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{looked behind}} him, {{and saw that}} he was {{standing}} near a small <b>maple-tree,</b> which had been planted, a few years before, {{by the side of the}} road.|$|E
60|$|Over in a <b>maple-tree</b> on {{the edge}} of Farmer Brown's door yard lived Mr. and Mrs. Redeye the Vireos. Peter Rabbit knew that they had a nest there because Jenny Wren had told him so. He would have guessed it anyway, because Redeye spent so much time in that tree during the nesting season. No matter what hour of the day Peter visited the Old Orchard he heard Redeye singing over in the <b>maple-tree.</b> Peter used to think that if song is an {{expression}} of happiness, Redeye must be the happiest of all birds.|$|E
60|$|But, at this moment, a dog scenting {{along the}} ground, came in beneath the <b>maple-trees,</b> and gazed {{alternately}} {{at each of}} these wicked men, {{and then at the}} quiet sleeper. He then lapped out of the fountain.|$|R
50|$|Standing at an {{altitude}} of 1150 metres, it overlooks the resort towns of Bikfaya, Khinshara, and Shwayr, and a string of small mountainside villages such as Zighrine, Shwayya, Ayn Teffaha, Shrine, and Jouar. The entire region is covered with beautiful pine forests, and the area surrounding the monastery is unusually diverse in flora, with oak, eucalyptus, willow, and <b>maple-trees,</b> orchards of apples, pears, prunes, and peaches, and vines terraced on the slopes.|$|R
6000|$|... “The Eastern States {{be full of}} men, The Western Full of woods, sir, The hill be like a cattle-pen, The roads be full of goods, sir! Then flow away, my sweety sap, And I {{will make}} you boily; Nor catch a wood man’s hasty nap, For fear you should get roily. The <b>maple-tree's</b> a {{precious}} one, ‘Tis fuel, food, and timber; And when your stiff day’s work is done, Its juice will make you limber, Then flow away, etc.|$|R
6000|$|Tommy Tit the Chickadee hung {{head down}} {{from the tip of}} a slender branch of a <b>maple-tree</b> and winked a saucy bright eye at Peter. [...] "I've got a secret up here," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dee, dee, dee! See me! See me!" [...] cried Tommy Tit and flitted {{down from}} the <b>maple-tree</b> right on to the hand of Farmer Brown's boy, and his bright little eyes twinkled merrily as he helped himself to a bit of nut meat.|$|E
6000|$|At [...] "The First Settlements" [...] {{he had to}} stop, for {{the schoolhouse}} was reached, and the book must be returned. The <b>maple-tree</b> closet was easily found, and a little {{surprise}} hidden under the flat stone; for Ben paid two sticks of red and white candy {{for the privilege of}} taking books from the new library.|$|E
60|$|But {{he could}} not, for two reasons: {{none of those}} trees were <b>maple-trees,</b> and then, besides, they were all dry. There was no sap in them of any kind; at least, not enough to ooze out. While Rollo was looking there, one of Farmer Cropwell's large boys came out with an axe in his hand. He rolled out a pretty large log of wood, {{though it was not}} very long, and struck his axe into the end of it, as {{if he was going to}} split it.|$|R
50|$|Tara Mountain {{has long}} been a {{well-known}} tourist resort owing to its pleasant moderately continental and sub-continental climate. In 1981, Tara became a national park. It covers an area of 300 square kilometers and is the largest natural park in Serbia. The mountain has an abundance of flora and fauna. Apart from white pine tree, <b>maple-trees</b> and famous Serbian Spruce (Picea omorika), here you can find rare game including bear, roe deer, and chamois. The Drina River {{is a part of the}} local cultural identity and has great potential in rafting sports and fishing.|$|R
50|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{there has}} been an Information Center on the site to the memory of the losses of Operation Overlord, when in summer 1944 more than 100,000 people died: American, British, German, French, Canadian, Poles and members of other nations. Also at least 14,000 French civilians died. Human fates and {{reconciliation}} are special themes. Visitors can also view a permanent exhibition about the German War Graves Commission and have access to a database to locate the graves of dead German soldiers. An adjoint peace-garden with 1,200 <b>maple-trees</b> from gifts symbolizes that peace ought to grow.|$|R
60|$|School {{was just}} out as they passed; {{and it was a}} spectacle, I assure you, to see the boys and girls stare at Ben up aloft in such state; also to see the superb {{indifference}} with which that young man regarded the vulgar herd who went afoot. He couldn't resist an affable nod to Bab and Betty, for they stood under the <b>maple-tree,</b> and the memory of their circulating library made him forget his dignity in his gratitude.|$|E
6000|$|But it wasn't {{often that}} Redeye came down so near {{the ground that}} Peter could see his eyes. He {{preferred}} {{to spend most of}} his time in the tree tops, and Peter only got glimpses of him now and then. But if he didn't see him often it was less often that he failed to hear him. [...] "I don't see when Redeye finds time to eat," [...] declared Peter as he listened to the seemingly unending song in the <b>maple-tree.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tommy fairly bubbled {{over with}} joy. He {{knew what it}} all meant. He knew that Peter Rabbit and Happy Jack and Chatterer and Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow {{had come to see}} him make good his boast to Chatterer that he would eat from the hand of Farmer Brown's boy, and that not one of them really {{believed}} that he would do it. He tickled all over and cut up all sorts of capers, just for pure joy. Finally he flew over to the <b>maple-tree</b> that grows close by Farmer Brown's house.|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit was {{thinking}} of this as {{he sat at the}} edge of the dear Old Briar-patch, looking over to the Green Forest. The Green Forest was no longer just green; it was of many colors, for Old Mother Nature had set Jack Frost to painting the leaves of the <b>maple-trees</b> and the beech-trees, and the birch-trees and the poplar-trees and the chestnut-trees, and he had done his work well. Very, very lovely were the reds and yellows and browns against the dark green of the pines and the spruces and the hemlocks. The Purple Hills were more softly purple than at any other season of the year. It was all very, very beautiful.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>maple-trees</b> were by {{that time}} in full leaf, and the rich green verdure of bush and tree was {{bursting}} out on all sides, when not submerged. Swallows skimmed about in hundreds, dipping the tips of their blue wings in the flood, as though to test its reality, while flocks of little yellow birds--like canaries, but rather larger, with more black on their wings--flitted from bush to tree or from isle to isle. The month of May in those regions is styled the [...] "flower month," [...] and June the [...] "heart-berry month," [...] but flowers and heart-berries were alike drowned out that year in Red River of the North, {{and none of the}} wonted perfumes of the season regaled the noses of our voyagers as they returned home.|$|R
60|$|My {{grandmother}} {{sat in her}} {{own particular}} easy-chair by the open window of her back parlor. This was a pleasant {{place in which to}} sit in the afternoon, for the sun was then {{on the other side of}} the house, and she could look not only over the smooth grass of the side yard and the flower beds, which were under her especial care, but across the corner of the front lawn into the village street. Here, between two handsome <b>maple-trees</b> which stood upon the sidewalk, she could see something of what was going on in the outer world without presenting the appearance of one who is fond of watching her neighbors. It was not much that she saw, for the street was a quiet one; but a very little of that sort of thing satisfied her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Redeye {{believes}} in singing while he works," [...] said Jenny Wren. [...] "For my part I should think he'd wear his throat out. When other birds sing they don't do anything else, but Redeye sings {{all the time}} he is hunting his meals and only stops long enough to swallow a worm or a bug when he finds it. Just as soon as it is down he begins to sing again while he hunts for another. I must say for the Redeyes that they are mighty good nest builders. Have you seen their nest over in that <b>maple-tree,</b> Peter?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{spring was}} a hidden thing. You might have passed within ten feet {{of it and}} never have {{suspected}} its existence. Two generations past a huge old pine had fallen almost across it. Nothing {{was left of the}} tree but its crumbling trunk out of which the ferns grew thickly, making a green roof and a lacy screen for the water. A <b>maple-tree</b> grew beside it with a curiously gnarled and twisted trunk, creeping along the ground for a little way before shooting up into the air, and so forming a quaint seat; and September had flung a scarf of pale smoke-blue asters around the hollow.|$|E
60|$|Sunday, October 10th.--I visited my grapevine this afternoon, and ate {{the last}} of its clusters. This vine climbs around a young <b>maple-tree,</b> which has now assumed the yellow leaf. The leaves of the vine are more decayed {{than those of the}} maple. Thence to Cow Island, a solemn and {{thoughtful}} walk. Returned by another path of the width of a wagon, passing through a grove of hard wood, the lightsome hues of which make the walk more cheerful than among the pines. The roots of oaks emerged from the soil, and contorted themselves across the path. The sunlight, also, broke across in spots, and otherwheres the shadow was deep; but still there was intermingling enough of bright hues to keep off the gloom from the whole path.|$|E
60|$|He {{had slept}} {{only a few}} moments when a brown carriage, drawn by a {{handsome}} pair of horses, bowled easily along, and was brought to a standstill nearly in front of David's resting-place. A linchpin had fallen out, and permitted one of the wheels to slide off. The damage was slight, and occasioned merely a momentary alarm to an elderly merchant and his wife, who were returning to Boston in the carriage. While the coachman and a servant were replacing the wheel, the lady and gentleman sheltered themselves beneath the <b>maple-trees,</b> and there espied the bubbling fountain, and David Swan asleep beside it. Impressed with the awe which the humblest sleeped usually sheds around him, the merchant trod as lightly as the gout would allow; and his spouse took good heed not to rustle her silk gown, lest David should start up all of a sudden.|$|R
60|$|The {{carriage}} {{could not}} have gone above a mile or two, when a pretty young girl came along, with a tripping pace, which showed precisely how her little heart was dancing in her bosom. Perhaps it was this merry kind of motion that caused--is there any harm in saying it?--her garter to slip its knot. Conscious that the silken girth--if silk it were--was relaxing its hold, she turned aside into {{the shelter of the}} <b>maple-trees,</b> and there found a young man asleep by the spring! Blushing as red as any rose that she should have intruded into a gentleman's bedchamber, and for such a purpose, too, she was about to make her escape on tiptoe. But there was peril near the sleeper. A monster of a bee had been wandering overhead--buzz, buzz, buzz--now among the leaves, now flashing through the strips of sunshine, and now lost in the dark shade, till finally he appeared to be settling on the eyelid of David Swan. The sting of a bee is sometimes deadly. As free hearted as she was innocent, the girl attacked the intruder with her handkerchief, brushed him soundly, and drove him from beneath the mapleshade. How sweet a picture! This good deed accomplished, with quickened breath, and a deeper blush, she stole a glance at the youthful stranger for whom she had been battling with a dragon in the air.|$|R
6000|$|Rollo {{was coming}} home one morning after having been away on an errand, and he saw a large wood pile near Farmer Cropwell's door. Now it {{happened}} that Rollo had once been on a journey pretty far back into the country; {{it was at the}} time when Jonas told him and Lucy the stories related in the book called [...] "Jonas's Stories." [...] On that journey, Jonas had one day told him that the sap of the <b>maple-tree</b> was sweet, and had let him taste of some, where it oozed {{out at the end of}} the log. Seeing Farmer Cropwell's wood pile reminded Rollo of this; and he thought he would look at the ends of all the logs, and see if he could not find some drops of sweet sap there.|$|E
60|$|So {{every one}} who heard Tommy Tit's cheery voice that cold winter morning {{just had to}} smile. Yes, Sir, they just had to smile, even Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow. They just couldn't help themselves. When Tommy reached the stone wall that {{separated}} the Old Orchard from Farmer Brown's dooryard, his sharp eyes were not long in finding Peter Rabbit, and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, and Chatterer hiding in the old wall where they could peep out and see all that happened in Farmer Brown's dooryard. Looking back through the Old Orchard, he saw {{what looked like a}} little bit of the blue, blue sky flitting silently from tree to tree. It was Sammy Jay. Over in the very top of a tall <b>maple-tree,</b> a long way off, was a spot of black. Tommy didn't need to be told that it was Blacky the Crow, who didn't dare come any nearer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Forester, [...] "only {{they make}} {{a great deal of}} sugar in Vermont out of the sap of the <b>maple-tree.</b> We will go and see Mr. Warner's sugar bush next spring. But there are a great many things which the farmers must buy. One of the most {{important}} articles is iron. Now when a man concludes to open a store, the best place that he can have for his business is near the mills and the blacksmith's shop; because the people have to come there on other business, and so that is the most convenient place for them to visit his store. And so, by and by, when a carpenter and a mason come into the country, the little village which has thus begun to form itself, is the best place for them to settle in, for that is the place where people can most conveniently call and see them. After a while a physician comes and settles there, to heal them when they are sick, and a lawyer to prevent disputes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Besides the leather-leggings, moccasins, deerskin hunting shirt, cap, {{and belt}} which {{composed}} his costume, {{he had a}} short heavy hunting-knife, a piece of tinder, a little tin pannikin, {{which he had been}} in the habit of carrying at his belt, and a large cake of maple sugar. This last is a species of sugar which is procured by the Indians from the <b>maple-tree.</b> Several cakes of it had been carried off from the Pawnee village, and Dick usually carried one in the breast of his coat. Besides these things, he found that the little Bible, for which his mother had made a small inside breast pocket, was safe. Dick's heart smote him when he took it out and undid the clasp, for he had not looked at it until that day. It was firmly bound with a brass clasp, so that although the binding and edges of the leaves were soaked, the inside was quite dry. On opening the book to see if it had been damaged, a small paper fell out. Picking it up quickly, he unfolded it, and read, in his mother's handwriting, [...] "Call upon me in the time of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. My son, give me thine heart." ...|$|E
60|$|Captain John Asher was {{an older}} man than his brother, the naval officer, {{but he was in}} the prime of life, and able to hold the command of a ship if he had cared to do it. But having been in the {{merchant}} service for a long time, and having made some money, he had determined to leave the sea and to settle on shore; and, finding this commodious house by the toll-gate, he settled there. There were some people who said that he had taken the position of toll-gate keeper because of the house, and there were others who believed that he had bought the house on account of the toll-gate. But no matter what people thought or said, the good captain was very well satisfied with his home and his official position. He liked to meet with people, and he preferred that they should come to him rather than that he should go to them. He was interested in most things that were going on in his neighborhood, and therefore he liked to talk to the people who were going by. Sometimes a good talking acquaintance or an interesting traveler would tie his horse under the shade of the <b>maple-tree</b> and sit a while with the captain on the little porch. Certain it was, it was the most hospitable toll-gate {{in that part of the}} country.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mr. Bridges {{approved}} of this plan, and {{thought she was}} very clever to devise it. So everything was settled, and I went to the stable the day before, and told Peter I wanted him to get up very early the next morning, and put old Ripstaver in the buggy, and drive him over to Dr. Hendricks's. I told him he must be there before five o'clock, {{and that he was}} to tie the horse to a <b>maple-tree</b> this side of the front yard. I said one of the doctor's family had to get to the village very early because there were some things to be done before the train came, and it had been agreed we should lend our buggy. Peter was not quite pleased with the arrangement, and asked why we did not send the old mare--we only kept two horses; but I said she was too slow, and it had been specially arranged that the buggy, with Ripstaver, should be sent. Peter was a great friend of mine, so he agreed to do what I asked, and said he did not mind walking back.' ('I never would have believed,' said Miss Amanda, 'that the boy had such a mind. If I had only known what he was planning to do! If I had only known! But even if I had, it is so hard to tell what is right.') ...|$|E
60|$|I {{returned}} {{home by the}} high-road. On my right, separated from the road by a level field, perhaps fifty yards across, was a range of young forest-trees, dressed in their garb of autumnal glory. The sun shone directly upon them; and sunlight is like the breath of life to the pomp of autumn. In its absence, one doubts whether there be any truth in what poets have told about the splendor of an American autumn; but when this charm is added, one feels that the effect is beyond description. As I beheld it to-day, there was nothing dazzling; it was gentle and mild, though brilliant and diversified, and had a most quiet and pensive influence. And yet there were some trees that seemed really made of sunshine, and others were of a sunny red, and the whole picture was painted with but little relief of darksome lines, only a few evergreens. But there was nothing inharmonious; and, on closer examination, it appeared that all the tints had a relationship among themselves. And this, I suppose, is the reason that, while nature seems to scatter them so carelessly, they still never shock the beholder by their contrasts, nor disturb, but only soothe. The brilliant scarlet and the brilliant yellow are different lines of the maple-leaves, and the first changes into the last. I saw one <b>maple-tree,</b> its centre yellow as gold, set in a framework of red. The native poplars have different shades of green, verging towards yellow, and are very cheerful in the sunshine. Most of the oak-leaves have still the deep verdure of summer; but where a change has taken place, it is into a russet-red, warm, but sober. These colors, infinitely varied by the progress which different trees have made in their decay, constitute almost the whole glory of autumnal woods; but {{it is impossible to}} conceive how much is done with such scanty materials. In my whole walk I saw only one man, and he was at a distance, in the obscurity of the trees. He had a horse and a wagon, and was getting a load of dry brushwood.|$|E
6000|$|Several {{of the men}} {{followed}} Ben's lead, and the traveller {{pushed his}} horse on to the Green, as Dinah walked rather quickly and in advance of her companions towards the cart under the <b>maple-tree.</b> While she was near Seth's tall figure, she looked short, but when she had mounted the cart, and was away from all comparison, she seemed above the middle height of woman, though in reality she did not exceed it--an effect which {{was due to the}} slimness of her figure and the simple line of her black stuff dress. The stranger was struck with surprise as he saw her approach and mount the cart--surprise, not so much at the feminine delicacy of her appearance, as at the total absence of self-consciousness in her demeanour. He had made up his mind to see her advance with a measured step and a demure solemnity of countenance; he had felt sure that her face would be mantled with the smile of conscious saintship, or else charged with denunciatory bitterness. He knew but two types of Methodist--the ecstatic and the bilious. But Dinah walked as simply as if she were going to market, and seemed as unconscious of her outward appearance as a little boy: there was no blush, no tremulousness, which said, [...] "I know you think me a pretty woman, too young to preach"; no casting up or down of the eyelids, no compression of the lips, no attitude of the arms that said, [...] "But you must think of me as a saint." [...] She held no book in her ungloved hands, but let them hang down lightly crossed before her, as she stood and turned her grey eyes on the people. There was no keenness in the eyes; they seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations; they had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to give out, rather than impressed by external objects. She stood with her left hand towards the descending sun, and leafy boughs screened her from its rays; but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her face seemed to gather a calm vividness, like flowers at evening. It was a small oval face, of a uniform transparent whiteness, with an egg-like line of cheek and chin, a full but firm mouth, a delicate nostril, and a low perpendicular brow, surmounted by a rising arch of parting between smooth locks of pale reddish hair. The hair was drawn straight back behind the ears, and covered, except for an inch or two above the brow, by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows, of the same colour as the hair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the eyelashes, though no darker, were long and abundant--nothing was left blurred or unfinished. It was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals. The eyes had no peculiar beauty, beyond that of expression; they looked so simple, so candid, so gravely loving, that no accusing scowl, no light sneer could help melting away before their glance. Joshua Rann gave a long cough, as if he were clearing his throat in order to come to a new understanding with himself; Chad Cranage lifted up his leather skull-cap and scratched his head; and Wiry Ben wondered how Seth had the pluck to think of courting her.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{traditionally}} eaten included raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, cherries, wild grapes, hazelnuts, crab apples, red martagon bulbs, Indian potato, and <b>maple-tree</b> sap for sweetening. Cornmeal {{was traded}} with Iroquois, Algonquin, and Abenaki First Nations peoples, and made into apon (cornbread), which sometimes also included oat or wheat flour {{when it became}} available. Pine-needle tea kept away infections and colds resulting from the harsh weather.|$|E
50|$|Twinkle and Chubbins {{learn of}} their new <b>maple-tree</b> neighbors, a squirrel, an owl, and an o'possum; and Policeman Bluejay {{introduces}} them to the community of birds. The children see that the world of living beings in the forest has structure, relationships, and conflict. They hear stories of human cruelty to animals - and soon they witness it firsthand, when hunters enter the forest. The hunters kill Mrs. 'Possum and Mrs. Hootaway and Wisk the squirrel; Twinkle tries to protest, but she can only make a skylark's chirp. The hunters' dog almost catches Twinkle - but she and Chubbins are rescued by their friend the eagle, who swoops down, kills the dog, and leads them to safety.|$|E

40|$|The Acer (maple) genus {{of trees}} {{comprises}} over 120 species worldwide. Some of these contain the plant-toxin hypoglycin-A {{which has been}} {{proven to be a}} cause of the highly fatal condition called atypical myopathy (AM) in horses and ponies. In an earlier study of <b>maple-tree</b> samples (leaves and seeds) collected by owners of healthy and AM-affected horses it was shown that the seeds contain significantly more toxin than the leaves. There is a concern as to whether maple trees can be safely retained or planted around paddocks or pastures, and whether there is a difference in toxicity between different species. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the amount of toxin in different <b>maple-tree</b> species present in The Netherlands. The seeds of 20 different tree-species of the ‘Acer’ genus, present in the arboretum in Wageningen, The Netherlands, were analysed for hypoglycin-A; 8 species belonged to the ‘Platanoidea’ subgenus (section), 7 to the ‘Acer’, 3 to the ‘Palmata’ and 2 to the ‘Negundo’ subgenera. Assay was carried out using a newly validated method based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Seeds of the maple trees belonging to the ‘Platanoidea’ contained no hypoglycin-A. The seeds of species belonging to the ‘Acer’, ‘Palmata’ and ‘Negundo’ subgenera however contained 96 – 1744 mg/kg, 4 – 32 mg/kg and 3 – 444 mg/kg of the toxin respectively. These results indicate that the precise tree species is an important aspect when giving advice regarding the toxicity of maple trees and the consequent risk for horses...|$|E
