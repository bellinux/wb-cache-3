25|$|World of Birds, which {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades {{in the summer}} of 2010, and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of Sanford's tarictic hornbills (Penelopides exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, Cuban amazons, pink pigeons, Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain toucans, Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, a golden-headed quetzal, blue-billed curassows, white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. Golden lion tamarins, Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so. In March 2013, three <b>maleo</b> chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works towards preserving this species in the wild as well.|$|E
60|$|Out of {{eighteen}} Pigeons found in Celebes, eleven are peculiar to it. Two of them, Ptilonopus gularis and Turacaena menadensis, have their nearest allies in Timor. Two others, Carpophaga forsteni and Phlaegenas tristigmata, most resemble Philippine island species; and Carpophaga radiata {{belongs to a}} New Guinea group. Lastly, in the Gallinaceous tribe, the curious helmeted <b>Maleo</b> (Megacephalon rubripes) is quite isolated, having its nearest (but still distant) allies in the Brush-turkeys of Australia and New Guinea.|$|E
60|$|In the {{structure}} of the feet of this bird, we may detect a cause for its departing from the habits of its nearest allies, the Megapodii and Talegalli, which heap up earth, leaves, stones, and sticks into a huge mound, in which they bury their eggs. The feet of the <b>Maleo</b> are not nearly so large or strong in proportion as in these birds, while its claws are short and straight instead of being long and much curved. The toes are, however, strongly webbed at the base, forming a broad powerful foot, which, with the rather long leg, is well adapted to scratch away the loose sand (which flies up in a perfect shower when the birds are at work), but which could not without much labour accumulate the heaps of miscellaneous rubbish, which the large grasping feet of the Megapodius bring together with ease.|$|E
50|$|The Alliance for Tompotika Conservation {{works with}} {{communities}} in Sulawesi to educate locals about the <b>maleo's</b> endangered status {{and prevent the}} harvesting of eggs. The eggs are not a staple food source, but are a popular delicacy.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} endemic to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It {{is usually not}} present on altitudes {{exceeding}} 1,000 meters, and is usually found in lowland hills or rain forests. Ideal nesting locations include river banks, lake shores, and coastal areas of the island. <b>Maleos</b> are communal nesters.|$|R
2500|$|He defines Pelasgian Argos {{as being}} [...] "between the outlets of the Peneus River and Thermopylae {{as far as}} the mountainous country of Pindus" [...] and states that it took its name from Pelasgian rule. He {{includes}} also the tribes of Epirus as Pelasgians (based on the opinions of [...] "many"). Lesbos is named Pelasgian. Caere was settled by Pelasgians from Thessaly, who called it by its former name, [...] "Agylla". Pelasgians also settled around the mouth of the Tiber River in Italy at Pyrgi and a few other settlements under a king, <b>Maleos.</b>|$|R
6000|$|This {{being the}} {{district}} inhabited by that singular annual the Babirusa (Hog-deer), I inquired about skulls and soon obtained several in tolerable condition, {{as well as}} a fine one of the rare and curious [...] "Sapi-utan" [...] (Anoa depressicornis). Of this animal I had seen two living specimens at Menado, and was surprised at their great resemblance to small cattle, or still more to the Eland of South Africa. Their Malay name signifies [...] "forest ox," [...] and they differ from very small highbred oxen principally by the low-hanging dewlap, and straight, pointed horns which slope back over the neck. I did not find the forest here so rich in insects as I had expected, and my hunters got me very few birds, but what they did obtain were very interesting. Among these were the rare forest Kingfisher (Cittura cyanotis), a small new species of Megapodius, and one specimen of the large and interesting <b>Maleo</b> (Megacephalon rubripes), to obtain which was one of my chief reasons for visiting this district. Getting no more, however, after ten days' search, I removed to Licoupang, at the extremity of the peninsula, a place celebrated for these birds, {{as well as for the}} Babirusa and Sapi-utan. I found here Mr. Goldmann, the eldest son of the Governor of the Moluccas, who was superintending the establishment of some Government salt-works. This was a better locality, and I obtained some fine butterflies and very good birds, among which was one more specimen of the rare ground dove (Phlegaenas tristigmata), which I had first obtained near the Maros waterfall in South Celebes.|$|E
50|$|The {{hot sand}} of Sulawesi {{acts as an}} {{incubator}} for <b>maleo</b> eggs, which are warmed with geothermal heat or solar heat. A <b>maleo</b> chick is completely self-sufficient only hours after hatching. For this reason, <b>maleo</b> eggs are approximately five {{times the size of}} a domestic chicken’s, as they contain nearly full-formed <b>maleo</b> birds inside. It must dig its way up through the sand immediately after birth, and subsequently has the ability to fly and feed itself.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>maleo</b> (Macrocephalon <b>maleo)</b> {{is a large}} megapode and {{the only}} member of the {{monotypic}} genus Macrocephalon. The <b>maleo</b> is endemic to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It is found in the tropical lowland and hill forests, but nests in the open sandy areas, volcanic soils or beaches that are heated by the sun or geothermal energy for incubation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>maleo's</b> egg is large, {{about five}} times as large {{as that of the}} {{domestic}} chicken's. The female lays and covers each egg in a deep hole in the sand and allows the incubation to take place through solar or volcanic heating. After the eggs hatch, the young birds work their way up through the sand and hide in the forest. The young birds are able to fly and are totally independent. They must find food and defend themselves from predators such as monitor lizard, reticulated python, wild pig and cats.|$|R
60|$|My friends {{remained}} three days, and {{got plenty}} of wild pigs and two Anóas, but the latter were much injured by the dogs, and I could only preserve the heads. A grand hunt which we attempted {{on the third day}} failed, owing to bad management in driving in the game, and we waited for five hours perched on platforms in trees without getting a shot, although we had been assured that pigs, Babirusas, and Anóas would rush past us in dozens. I myself, with two men, stayed three days longer to get more specimens of the <b>Maleos,</b> and succeeded in preserving twenty-six very fine ones--the flesh and eggs of which supplied us with abundance of good food.|$|R
50|$|The <b>maleo</b> megapode is {{endemic to}} the island and is the park's mascot. <b>Maleo</b> birds have been bred {{successfully}} in this park, and as per February 2012, about 3,300 birds have been released to their habitat. Hungoyono camp in Bone Bolango is the largest <b>maleo</b> habitat which the conservationists have 4 breeding sites. Normally the birds need geothermal hot sand for their breeding as in Hungoyono camp.|$|E
50|$|To boost tourism, the Lore Lindu National Park {{decided to}} develop access road, electricity, {{clean water and}} resorts for {{visitors}} who visit the breeding ground for <b>Maleo</b> birds Macrocephalon <b>maleo</b> and the Tambing Lake. Nowadays the visitors are mainly college students and researchers from abroad.|$|E
50|$|<b>Maleo</b> birds breed {{all year}} round, but peak {{breeding}} season varies {{depending upon the}} location on the island. When prepared to lay her eggs, the female <b>maleo</b> bird, accompanied by her mate, will leave the cover of Sulawesian forest in search of historic coastal breeding grounds. Females can lay anywhere between 8-12 eggs {{over the course of}} a year. Once an optimal spot is chosen, the <b>maleo</b> dig a deep hole and lay the egg inside. After the egg is laid, the parents bury the egg securely in sand, sometimes covering the sand with other debris to better camouflage the hole. After the egg has been securely buried, the parents leave and never return, leaving the <b>maleo</b> chick to fend for itself.|$|E
