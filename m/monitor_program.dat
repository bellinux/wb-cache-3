Gregory, but was effectively run by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers, to whom was entrusted the power of setting general plans and ship specifications. Stimers, an ambitious man, was keen to take credit for the design of the new monitors and frequently visited Ericsson's bureau to make changes to the specifications.|$|E

50|$|Thus it is {{important}} a <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> be put into place {{at the onset of}} construction. A short-term <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> should be used to monitor the in-situ cap during construction and immediately following construction. This <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> should include frequent testing so real-time data is provided to allow quick adjustments to the overall cap design. A long-term <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> should be established to provide data about the overall effectiveness of the cap design and to make sure the cap is meeting all of its required regulations and that the cap is not excessively eroded. This long-term monitoring need only be assessed on a yearly to bi-yearly basis unless a problem is discovered; then more frequent testing will be required.|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s development of a water quality management program for pollutants in discharges from irrigated agriculture and managed wetlands in the Central Valley, there is considerable discussion {{about the nature of}} the water quality <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> that needs to be conducted. In {{connection with}} addressing this matter, there have been a number of reviews that provide guidance on how water quality <b>monitoring</b> <b>programs</b> should be developed/evaluated. These include the National Research Council (NRC, 1990) Managing Troubled Waters, and the Lee and Jones-Lee (1992) “Guidance for Conducting Water Quality Studies. ” As discussed in these reviews, the development of a comprehensive water quality <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> involves establishing the objectives of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>program.</b> In connection with developing a nonpoint source water quality <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> for the Central Valley, these issues have been reviewed by Lee and Jones-Lee (2002 a).

40|$|Information on the {{ecological}} functions of forests {{is important for}} sustainable forest management. In this study, we introduced the national <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> which {{has been used in}} China to evaluate the overall health status and ecological functions of forests. We also compared it to similar <b>monitoring</b> <b>programs</b> operating in Europe and the United States of America. We revealed the strength and drawbacks of China’s <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> by analyzing the initial evaluation results. Our analysis showed that among the three programs, the European program gives the most detailed measurements of conditions of forests while the U. S. program generates the most detailed information on individual trees. In comparison, China’s <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> has a higher spatial resolution but is narrowly focused on trees and uses coarse classifications of indicators. The health status of forests in China suggested that more resources should be invested to improve the health of existing forests, especially plantations. The limitations in China’s <b>monitoring</b> <b>program</b> need to be addressed to improve the accuracy of future assessments...|$|R

40|$|Waters of the United States {{requires}} that the agency that is conducting an aquatic weed control <b>program</b> <b>monitor</b> the impacts of this program on the water-quality-related beneficial uses of the waterbodies that could be impacted by the control program.
