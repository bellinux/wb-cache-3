5|$|It <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> that Soviet T-26 was one {{the most}} modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account.</b> Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|Repeating nines also {{turn up in}} {{yet another}} of Georg Cantor's works. They <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> to {{construct}} a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions, of the uncountability of the unit interval. Such a proof {{needs to be able}} to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.|$|E

5|$|Several {{countries}} employ {{government agencies}} to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories {{to the public}} in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. Knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) and Environment Canada's Meteorological Service (MSC). Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.|$|E

25|$|While it {{is clear}} that warfare {{undoubtedly}} took many lives during this period, the census figures do not support the idea that tens of millions were wiped out solely from warfare.

25|$|Tenerife was {{the last}} island of Canaries to be conquered {{and the one that}} took the longest time to submit to the Castilian troops. Although the {{traditional}} dates of conquest of Tenerife are established between 1494 (landing of Alonso Fernández de Lugo) and 1496 (conquest of the island), it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> that the attempts to annex the island of Tenerife to the Crown of Castile date back at least to 1464.

25|$|Given {{the very}} similar {{processes}} of place name formation in Sinhala and Tamil explicated above, {{it is not}} always easy to establish the original language of a place name, because loan translations are common in both directions.

Additionally, some place names draw on Sanskrit or Pali roots, which are then adapted to Sinhala and Tamil phonology in different ways.
