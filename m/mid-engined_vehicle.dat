25|$|In the mid-1970s, while Lamborghini {{was under}} the {{management}} of Georges-Henri Rossetti, Lamborghini entered into an agreement with BMW to develop, then manufacture 400 cars for BMW {{in order to meet}} Group 4 homologation requirements. BMW lacked experience developing a <b>mid-engined</b> <b>vehicle</b> and believed that Lamborghini's experience in that area would make Lamborghini an ideal choice of partner. Due to Lamborghini's shaky finances, Lamborghini fell behind schedule developing the car's structure and running gear. When Lamborghini failed to deliver working prototypes on time, BMW took the program in house, finishing development without Lamborghini. BMW contracted with Baur to produce the car, which BMW named the M1, delivering the first vehicle in October 1978.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s, Chapman progressed {{through the}} motor racing formulae, {{designing}} {{and building a}} series of racing cars, sometimes {{to the point of}} maintaining limited production as they were so successful and highly sought after, until he arrived in Formula One. Besides his engineering work, he also piloted a Vanwall F1-car in 1956 but crashed into his teammate Mike Hawthorn during practice for the French Grand Prix at Reims, ending his career as a race driver and focusing him on the technical side. Along with John Cooper, he revolutionised the premier motor sport. Their small, lightweight <b>mid-engined</b> <b>vehicles</b> gave away much in terms of power, but superior handling meant their competing cars often beat the all-conquering front engined Ferraris and Maseratis. Eventually, with driver Jim Clark at the wheel of his race cars, Team Lotus appeared as though they could win whenever they pleased. With Clark driving the Lotus 25, Team Lotus won its first F1 World Championship in 1963. It was Clark, driving a Lotus 38 at the Indianapolis 500 in 1965, who drove the first ever mid-engined car to victory at the [...] "Brickyard". [...] Clark and Chapman became particularly close and Clark's death in 1968 devastated Chapman, who publicly stated that he had lost his best friend.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1995, the NSX-T with a {{removable}} targa top {{was introduced in}} Japan as a special order option and in North America in March 1995. The NSX-T replaced the standard coupe entirely in North America as the only version available post 1994 and all NSXs thereafter were in targa form with the notable exceptions of the Zanardi Special Edition NSX in 1999 {{and a handful of}} special order post-1997/pre-2002 3.2-litre coupes. The European market continued to offer both body styles. The removable roof resulted in decreased chassis rigidity and Honda added about 100 pounds (45 kg) of structural reinforcements to compensate, including significantly thicker frame sidesill rocker panels (the body component which contributes most to the chassis's rigidity), bulkheads, roof pillars and the addition of new front/rear bulkhead and floorpan crossmembers. The targa models, produced {{for the rest of the}} NSX's production run thru 2005, sacrificed weight and some of the original coupe's chassis rigidity in return for an open cockpit driving experience. In addition to this major change, all subsequent NSX-Ts (1995-2001) had smaller-diameter front sway bars, slightly stiffer front springs, softer rear springs and firmer shock-dampers to improve ride comfort and tire wear while reducing the tendency towards oversteer common in <b>mid-engined</b> <b>vehicles.</b> All roofs post 1995 were now body-coloured instead of black, although in Japan, the two-tone black roof/body colour was still available as an optional feature. A lighter version of the variable ratio electric assisted power steering rack, previously found exclusively in the automatic transmission equipped NSXs, became standard on all models. Starting in 1995 the 5-speed transmission's second gear ratio was lowered by 4.2% to improve driveability and provide better response and automatic transmissions received an optional Formula One-inspired Sport Shift with a unique steering column mounted electronic shifter. Manual transmission cars received an improved Torque Reactive limited-slip differential - when combined with a new Throttle-By-Wire system, increased corner exit speeds by 10%. Other innovations beginning in 1995 included a new and lighter exhaust and muffler configuration for greater efficiency and lower emissions, an OBD-II onboard diagnostic system, improvements in the Traction Control System (TCS) and newly developed fuel injectors.|$|R
5000|$|Launched on October 9, 1998 the PA1 Honda Z was {{manufactured}} for Honda by Yachiyo Industry Co, a Honda subsidiary manufacturing light trucks. The {{basic structure}} of the Z, including its midship-mounted engine placement and 4WD drivetrain was shared with its Honda Acty sibling. Unlike the Acty though, it was a four-seater passenger car which also meant {{that it had to}} pass passenger car safety standards. The 656 cc E07Z three-cylinder engine was available in a naturally aspirated as well as in a turbocharged variant. The Z was only ever available with a four-speed automatic transmission, the same that was used on the EF Honda Civics. The centrally mounted engine was placed in an upright position underneath the rear seat, a layout called [...] "UM-4" [...] (stands for Under Midship 4WD) by Honda. Engine oil changes and minor maintenance work is done through an interior door. As with other <b>mid-engined,</b> four-wheel-drive <b>vehicles,</b> such as the Lamborghini Diablo VT, a viscous center differential was used. Some noteworthy and unusual design features of the Z included the comparatively large-diameter tires, chunky [...] "grip-style" [...] door handles, and the adoption of perspex double-cover headlights.|$|R
50|$|The Ferrari Mondial is a <b>mid-engined</b> <b>vehicle</b> of the R-M-R configuration. It was {{produced}} in 2-door coupé and convertible (or cabriolet) forms, with all vehicles offering 2+2 passenger accommodation. It {{was produced}} concurrently with Ferrari's 2-seater 308 GTB/GTS, 328, and 348 sports cars, and all major mechanical systems in the Mondial, including engine, transmission, steering and suspension, are either identical to, or very similar to, those used on the matching 2-seater vehicle being produced at the same time.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sourcing}} of suitable engine, gearbox and final-drive components {{was considered}} {{critical to the}} success of delivering a low-cost <b>mid-engined</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Chapman was keen to diversify beyond the Ford components heavily used in earlier Lotus vehicles, and settled on using the engine and combined transmission/final-drive transaxle units recently released by Renault for their Renault 16. The 1470cc Renault engine was a light and modern design (if somewhat pedestrian in the Renault), while the matching Renault 16 transaxle seemed almost ideal for the Europa project. In the Renault vehicle, the transaxle sat ahead of the engine, driving the front wheels. By relocating the combined engine/transaxle unit to the rear of the car and rotating it 180 degrees in plan, Lotus could obtain a ready-made modern mid-engine configuration - albeit one with 4 reverse gears! By repositioning the differential crownwheel within the final drive assembly, the direction of rotation of the output shafts was reversed, thus correcting this [...] "shortcoming".|$|E
5000|$|The Mondial name (French {{for world}} or global) {{originated}} from Ferrari's motor racing history [...] - [...] the 500 Mondial {{was a successful}} lightweight sports racer of the early 1950s which was named to celebrate Ferrari's consecutive Formula 1 World Championships in 1952 and 1953. The name was revived as Ferrari won the Formula 1 World Championships in 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1979. Conceived as a 'practical' Ferrari, the Mondial is a genuine long-distance four-seater, with sufficient rear head- and leg-room for children and smaller adults. It affords easy access via the long single doors, and has surprisingly good all-round visibility for a <b>mid-engined</b> car. The <b>vehicle</b> has a slightly higher roofline and greater all-round dimensions compared to its two-seater stable mates, resulting in a comparative weight penalty of around ten percent.|$|R
50|$|The Manta Mirage was a <b>mid-engined</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{produced}} by Manta Cars, owned by brothers Brad and Tim LoVette, in Costa Mesa, California* from 1974 to 1986. The Mirage, originally {{referred to as}} just the 'Manta', or the 'Manta Can-Am', was a light-weight road-legal car, based loosely on the McLaren M8 Can-Am racing car. The Mirage's steel space frame chassis was fitted with a high-output V8 engine and 4-speed transaxle. Most Mirages were equipped with 327 cu. in. (5.4 L) or 350 cu. in. (5.7 L) Chevrolet small block V8 engines, though some used 454 cu. in. (7.4 L) or 460 cu. in. (7.5 L) V8 engines. The original Mirage design mated the Chevy V8 to a Corvair transaxle via a Kelmark adapter and remote shifter. The bodywork was all hand-laid fiberglass, pre-colored {{in a range of}} gel-coat colors. Gull-wing doors were fitted to a removable top section, while the doors flip forward for entry. With curb weights as light as 1,900 lbs (680 kg), the cars could be built by the factory or their owners to be extremely fast.|$|E
50|$|The Cheetah's chassis was {{constructed}} of Drawn Over Mandrel (DOM) cro-moly tubing that was heliarc welded (more {{commonly referred to}} as TIG or tungsten inert gas welding) using a P&H Mining DAR-200 welder. The design of the car was unusual in that it was front engined, but with the engine sitting so far back in the chassis that the output yoke of the transmission connected directly to the input yoke on the differential, basically making the driveshaft only a universal joint linking the transmission with the differential. With the engine positioned in this manner, the driver's legs were beside the engine. The exhaust system headers passed {{over the top of the}} driver's and passenger's legs. The tops of the footboxes were curved to make room for Edmunds' handmade headers. This design takes the attributes of what is known as an FRM layout to an extreme. Consequently, this design gave a front/rear weight distribution roughly approximating a <b>mid-engined</b> <b>vehicle</b> without the cost of an expensive transaxle arrangement. This design style resulted in a hot driver's compartment - an issue that would impact the Cheetah's performance on the track.|$|E
