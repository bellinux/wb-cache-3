5|$|As {{is common}} in Northern Ireland, most of the schools in Lurgan are {{attended}} mainly by children from one or other of the two main ethno-religious blocs, reflecting the existence of deep-seated ethnic, sectarian and political divisions in society. Some schools are in the Catholic 'maintained' sector, i.e. maintained by the Council for Catholic <b>Maintained</b> <b>Schools,</b> and others are controlled directly by the state. Directly-controlled state schools generally have a predominantly Protestant intake.|$|E

5|$|The school {{also runs}} {{numerous}} outreach programmes for children from <b>maintained</b> <b>schools</b> {{in the local}} area, including a series of master-classes in science, mathematics, technology, languages and drama for local primary school children. Also for primary school children is the Tudor Experience Project where students can explore the Tudor past of the school {{through a number of}} activities. At the higher end of the school, numerous careers and university seminars are run for sixth form students from the local area, in addition to Oxbridge preparation classes and practice interviews for local sixth form students. The school also runs several more outreach programmes, {{and as a result of}} these initiatives was recently awarded the Independent School Award 2010 for Outstanding Community/Public Benefit Initiative.|$|E
25|$|Foundation schools, {{in which}} the {{governing}} body employs the staff and has primary responsibility for admissions. School land and buildings are owned by the governing body or by a charitable foundation. The Foundation appoints a minority of governors. Many of these schools were formerly grant <b>maintained</b> <b>schools.</b> In 2005 the Labour government proposed allowing all schools to become Foundation schools if they wished.|$|E
25|$|The {{college has}} {{gradually}} broadened its intake to include many students from state schools, often having the highest proportion of maintained school acceptances of the undergraduate colleges. Inevitably {{this has led}} to accusations of reactionary bias against public school pupils and of affirmative action (positive discrimination), although the relatively high proportion of state-school students reflects the far greater number of applications from pupils at <b>maintained</b> <b>schools</b> in comparison to other Cambridge colleges.|$|E

25|$|During {{his first}} year in office, Callaghan started what has since become known as 'The Great Debate', when he spoke at Ruskin College, Oxford about the 'legitimate concerns' of a public about {{education}} as it took place in the nation's <b>maintained</b> <b>schools.</b> This discussion led to greater involvement of the government, through its ministries, in the curriculum and administration of state education, leading to the eventual introduction of the National Curriculum some ten years later. Early in his premiership he caused controversy with the appointment of Peter Jay, his then son-in-law as the British Ambassador to the United States.|$|E
500|$|The school {{initially}} educated 30 of the [...] "poorest men's sons", though {{has since}} grown to have approximately 900 students, about 300 {{of whom are}} in the sixth form. The majority of pupils, approximately two thirds, enter at age 11 in the first form, a few (3-5 pupils) enter in the second form {{at the age of}} 12, with the remainder entering at 13 in the third form. Admissions are based on an entrance examination set by the school, and an interview. The school performs well academically, and as such is placed high on published league tables. A number of students achieve places at either Oxford or Cambridge universities. The school partakes in a number of sporting activities, and has enjoyed some success, including finishing within the top two in the Daily Mail Cup twice. The school maintains a grammar school ethos, and as such runs a number of outreach programmes for students from local <b>maintained</b> <b>schools,</b> for which it won the Independent School Award 2010 for Outstanding Community/ Public Benefit Initiative. The Headmaster {{is a member of the}} Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.|$|E

2500|$|In America the Machzikei Talmud Torah in New York City, an Ashkenazi Talmud Torah, was {{organized}} in 1883 by Israel (Isidor) Rosenthal. It <b>maintained</b> <b>schools</b> {{on its own}} premises at 225-227 East Broadway. It instructed over 1,100 boys at a yearly expense of about $12,000. On January 22, 1905, the society opened a branch at 67 East 7th street, to which Jacob H. Schiff donated $25,000. The society was managed by {{a board of directors}} and a committee of education. The studies comprised elementary Hebrew, the reading of the prayers, the translation of the Pentateuch into Yiddish and English, and the principles of the Jewish faith and practice.|$|E
2500|$|Galbraith's main {{argument}} is that as society becomes relatively more affluent, so private business must create consumer demand through advertising, and while this generates artificial affluence through the production of commercial goods and services, the public sector becomes neglected. He points out that while many Americans were able to purchase luxury items, their parks were polluted and their children attended poorly <b>maintained</b> <b>schools.</b> He argues that markets alone will under-provide (or fail to provide at all) for many public goods, whereas private goods are typically [...] "over-provided" [...] due {{to the process of}} advertising creating an artificial demand above the individual's basic needs. This emphasis on the power of advertising and consequent over-consumption may have anticipated the drop in savings rates in the USA and elsewhere in the developing world.|$|E
2500|$|Public {{debate in}} the United Kingdom {{continues}} over whether admissions processes at Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit based and fair; whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply to Cambridge; and whether these students succeed in gaining entry. In 2007–08, 57% of all successful applicants were from state schools (roughly 93 percent of {{all students in the}} UK attend state schools). Critics have argued that the lack of state school applicants with the required grades applying to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxbridge's reputation for many years, and the university has encouraged pupils from state schools to apply for Cambridge to help redress the imbalance. Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering. The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, and such applicants now form a (very large) minority (43%) of the intake. In 2005, 32% of the 3599 applicants from independent schools were admitted to Cambridge, as opposed to 24% of the 6674 applications from state schools. In 2008 the University of Cambridge received a gift of £4m to improve its accessibility to candidates from <b>maintained</b> <b>schools.</b> Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, is among those universities that have adopted formulae that gives a rating to the GCSE performance of every school in the country to [...] "weight" [...] the scores of university applicants.|$|E

2500|$|John David Buchanan {{took over}} from Talbot Griffith in 1958, and played himself in quietly until the Circular 10/65 which demanded comprehensivisation of <b>maintained</b> <b>schools,</b> of which Oakham was {{one as a}} Direct Grant school for the Rutland dayboys. He and the Rutland Local Education Authority did not {{see eye to eye}} on the {{possibilities}} of re-organisation of Rutland's schools, and as a result in 1970 the school (then 700 in size, all boys) reverted to full independence from the local authority, and in 1971, Oakham admitted female pupils for the first time, with the intention from the beginning of being co-educational throughout. The school is fully co-educational throughout the whole age range (10-18), with an approximately 50:50 split at all levels (c550 boys and c500 girls in 2011-12). There are an equal number of girls' houses (8) to boys' houses. When Buchanan retired in 1977 the school was 950 in total size (c550 boys and 400 girls), and the next headmaster, Richard Bull (1977-84, before he went on to be headmaster of Rugby) continued the co-education process; {{but it was not until}} 1990 that the process was completed during the headmastership of Graham Smallbone (1985-96) and equality of numbers gained. When Tony Little, later headmaster of Eton, took over in 1996 there were 528 boys and 510 girls in a school of 1038. Furthermore, the school is pretty evenly spread between boarders and day, although there do exist [...] "day boarders" [...] from 13 and [...] "transitional boarders" [...] from 10-13.|$|E
