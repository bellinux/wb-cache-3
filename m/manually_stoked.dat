2500|$|In practice, the C {{class was}} {{initially}} a somewhat less successful design than the A2.

2500|$|The 2-8-2 {{layout of}} the X class allowed a wide, deep firebox suited to the high ash, low calorific coals from the State Coal Mine {{typically}} used for goods haulage. This improved on some key shortcomings of the C class which were regarded as poor steaming and featured a very long [...] <b>manually</b> <b>stoked</b> firebox that was difficult to fire and prone to clinkering. The X class was also equipped with a much larger capacity tender of similar design to the S class Pacific introduced in 1928, enabling through runs from Melbourne to Bendigo without intermediate stops to restock the tender.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear. They {{were the}} only post-war Garratts on the SAR to be without mechanical stokers and {{also one of the}} largest designs of Garratt to be <b>manually</b> <b>stoked.</b>|$|E
50|$|Steam {{was raised}} by a Lancashire boiler and in 1947, when the {{warehouse}} needed extra steam for sizing, a Cornish boiler was added but disconnected in 1948 because of problems sharing the same flue. A Green's Economiser preheated the feedwater. The boiler was <b>stoked</b> <b>manually,</b> until a Proctor automatic stoker was fitted in the 1930s. Steam was raised to 160 psi. On closure in 1979, the Lancashire boiler required work, and the Cornish boiler that had been unused for 30 years was renovated, fired up and certificated. It is steamed at 50 psi, powered by donated scrap wood, to drive the engine on Heritage Steam Days. As this was a single boiler shed, it has a 130 ft chimney to provide the pressure difference needed to draw the air into the boiler. The Bancroft chimney was repaired and 'banded' by Fred Dibnah in 1997.|$|R
50|$|In practice, the C {{class was}} {{initially}} a somewhat less successful design than the A2. Key shortcomings included a very long, 9 ft <b>manually</b> <b>stoked</b> firebox that {{was difficult to}} fire and prone to clinkering, and an undersized boiler. The locomotives tended {{to run out of}} steam when worked hard.|$|E
50|$|It {{needs to}} be borne in mind, however, that the Type MR was not {{equipped}} with a mechanical stoker, an item which reduced the Type FT's water capacity. On the Type ET tender, for example, {{the inclusion of a}} mechanical stoker reduced its water capacity by 380 imp gal compared to the virtually identical <b>manually</b> <b>stoked</b> Type JT tender, while its empty weight was 1232 lb more due to the mechanical stoking equipment.|$|E
50|$|The pre-war Class 15Fs were <b>manually</b> <b>stoked</b> {{and were}} {{delivered}} without smoke deflectors. The original 21 Berliner- and Henschel-built engines remained hand-fired {{for the full}} duration of their working lives. On the pre-war NBL-built engines, on the other hand, provision {{was made in the}} design to later convert them to mechanical stoking. A mechanical stoker was tested on no. 2923 before the remaining locomotives of that group were all equipped with such stokers by the late 1940s. Their brake systems consisted of steam brakes on the engines and vacuum brakes on the tenders.|$|E

5000|$|Steam {{is raised}} by two Lancashire boilers built by Tinker, Shenton & Co, Hyde. The first was {{installed}} in 1894, and the second in 1901, when a 120-tube Greens Economiser was fitted. Feed water is now supplied by a Weir pump fitted in 1956. Both boilers were stoked manually, until secondhand Proctor automatic stokers were fitted in 1962. Boiler No.1 had the Shovel type and the coking type was fitted to No.2; the <b>manually</b> <b>stoked</b> 1901 boiler {{is the only one}} used today.Coal was obtained locally from Bank Hall Pit but now with pollution controls being stricter it has to be imported. At its peak it burnt 6 tonnes a day, but now uses only 10 tonnes a month. The steam raised to 100 psi in the boiler house, drives the original tandem compound horizontal stationary steam engine. The high-pressure cylinder (HP) is 16 in and the low-pressure (LP) 32 in. It uses Corliss valves. The engine drives a 14 ft flywheel running at 68 rpm. The [...] engine was built and installed by William Roberts of Nelson in 1895. It has never been moved from this location and runs perfectly true. Power is taken from the crankshaft by a series of directly driven line shafts. Currently the mill uses coal bought from the United States and Russia.|$|E
