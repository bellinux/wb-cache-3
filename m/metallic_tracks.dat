40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to increase the detection efficiency of the capacitive sensing devices, by growing vertically aligned nanowires arrays, localized and confined on small interdigited electrodes structures. The <b>metallic</b> <b>tracks</b> are made using optical lithography, and the nanowires are realized by electrochemical synthesis in nanoporous materials (i. e. supported alumina templates). By controlling the preparation conditions, both their positions and pitches can be easily tuned, as well as their geometrical design (i. e. diameters between 5 - 350 nm and lengths between 150 nm - 10 mu m). Based on these considerations, a capacitive sensor structure with high active surface is sensitized with polyaniline, for pH detection. Reported data show that the sensitivity of the sensor is substantially improved by using nanowires arrays...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{detailed}} bond reconstructions {{that occur in}} S vacancies within monolayer MoS 2 {{using a combination of}} aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, density functional theory (DFT), and multislice image simulations. Removal of a single S atom causes little perturbation to the surrounding MoS 2 lattice, whereas the loss of two S atoms from the same atomic column causes a measurable local contraction. Aggregation of S vacancies into linear line defects along the zigzag direction results in larger lattice compression that is more pronounced as the length of the line defect increases. For the case of two rows of S line vacancies, we find two different types of S atom reconstructions with different amounts of lattice compression. Increasing the width of line defects leads to nanoscale regions of reconstructed MoS 2 that are shown by DFT to behave as metallic channels. These results provide important insights into how defect structures could be used for creating <b>metallic</b> <b>tracks</b> within semiconducting monolayer MoS 2 films for future applications in electronics and optoelectronics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe "ligand induced {{electroless}} plating (LIEP) process" {{is a simple}} process to obtain localized metal plating onto flexible polymers such as poly(ethylene terephtalate) and polyvinylidene fluoride sheets. This generic and cost-effective process, efficient on any common polymer surface, {{is based on the}} covalent grafting by the GraftFast process of a thin chelating polymer film, such as poly(acrylic acid), which can complex copper ions. The entrapped copper ions are then chemically reduced in situ and the resulting Cu 0 species act as a seed layer for the electroless copper growth which, thus, starts inside the host polymer. The present work focuses on the application of the LIEP process to the patterning of localized <b>metallic</b> <b>tracks</b> via two simple lithographic methods. The first is based on a standard photolithography process using a positive photoresist masking to prevent the covalent grafting of PAA in designated areas of the polymer substrate. In the second, the patterning is performed by direct printing of the mask with a commercial laser printer. In both cases, the mask was lifted off before the copper {{electroless plating}} step, which provides ecological benefits, since only the amount of copper necessary for the metallic patterning is used...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of a new viscometer that {{takes the form of}} an oscillating plate, fabricated from silicon using the methods of micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) is considered. The instrument is designed principally for experimental use in the oil industry. The plate is 1. 6 mm wide, 2. 4 mm long, and 20 ?m thick. It is suspended from a 0. 4 mm thick support by 48 square cross-section legs, each of length 0. 5 mm width and depth of 20 ?m. The process of lithography is used to deposit layers atop the silicon. These layers can then be formed into resistors and <b>metallic</b> <b>tracks.</b> The tracks traverse the supporting legs to provide connections between the plate and external electronics. The oscillating plate is a mechanical element that can be set in motion by the force produced by the interaction between an electric current flowing in the plate and an externally applied magnetic field. The viscometer can be operated either in forced or transient mode and is intended for use in both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The motion of the viscometer is analyzed for incompressible fluids, using the Navier–Stokes equations to model the flow for both a Newtonian viscous fluid and a viscoelastic fluid where the stress is modeled by a reduced form of Maxwell’s equations...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT High contact {{pressures}} {{applied to}} soil {{result in a}} greater degree of compaction, in addition to promoting other negative effects. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify contact areas by using different methodologies, and pressures of farm equipment employed in production activity and evaluate structural changes caused in a Red Latosol with the presence and absence of straw cover. The design was completely randomized in a factorial scheme of type 4 (tire on front axle, tire on rear axle, tire on a sugarcane wagon and <b>metallic</b> <b>track</b> of sugar cane Harvester) x 2 (presence and absence of straw). The contact area (CA) of the run was obtained by three procedures: analytical measure of the area of an ellipse (CA 1); digital measurement of area of an ellipse (CA 2); and measurement of real contact area (RCA), with digital resources. The contact pressure was calculated from the ratio of mass of each machine's axle and the contact area of the run. The contact area obtained according to the procedure of the ellipse (CA 1 and CA 2) is overrated when compared to actual area obtained digitally (RCA). The straw reduces the contact pressure in the soil, due to the deep tire treads and consequently, increased contact area. Areas where the traffic of the machines occurred with soil covered with the presence of straw showed reduced soil resistance to penetration, cone index and pre-consolidation pressure, confirming that the increased contact area produced by straw reduced the pressure applied and the compression power dissipated in the soil...|$|R

The compatible processes, which are developed in this study, are the techniques:i) Si surface texturing, with the textured surface reflection of 15 % obtained by the formation of micro-pyramids (heights {{between 3 and 7}} μm) using NH 4 OH (ammonium hydroxide) alkaline solution, which is free of undesirable contamination by Na+ and K+ ions, when NaOH and KOH traditional solutions are used, respectively, and ii) of the ECR-CVD (ElectronCyclotron Resonance - Chemical Vapor Deposition) deposition of SiNx (silicon nitride) anti-reflective coating (ARC), which is carried out at room temperature and can be performed after the end of cell fabrication without damage on <b>metallic</b> <b>tracks</b> and without variation of p+/n junction depth.

40|$|Short-distance digital {{communication}} links, between chips on a circuit board, or between different circuit boards for example, {{have traditionally been}} built by using electrical interconnects [...] <b>metallic</b> <b>tracks</b> and wires. Recent technological advances have resulted in improvements in the speed of information processing, but have left electrical interconnects intact, thus creating a serious communication problem. Free-space optical interconnects, made up of arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, microlenses, and photodetectors, {{could be used to}} solve this problem. If free-space optical interconnects are to successfully replace electrical interconnects, they {{have to be able to}} support large rates of information transfer with high channel densities. The biggest obstacle in the way of reaching these requirements is laser beam diffraction. There are three approaches commonly used to model the effects of laser beam diffraction in optical interconnects: one could pursue the path of solving the diffraction integral directly, one could apply stronger approximations with some loss of accuracy of the results, or one could cleverly reinterpret the diffraction problem altogether. None of the representatives of the three categories of existing solutions qualified for our purposes. The main contribution of this dissertation consist of, first, formulating the mode expansion method, and, second, showing that it outperforms all other methods previously used for modelling diffraction in optical interconnects. The mode expansion method allows us to obtain the optical field produced by the diffraction of arbitrary laser beams at empty apertures, phase-shifting optical elements, or any combinations thereof, regardless of the size, shape, position, or any other parameters either of the incident optical field or the observation plane. The mode expansion method enables us to perform all this without any reference or use of the traditional Huygens-Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction integrals. When using the mode expansion method, one replaces the incident optical field and the diffracting optical element by an effective beam, possibly containing higher-order transverse modes, so that the ultimate effects of diffraction are equivalently expressed through the complex-valued modal weights. By using the mode expansion method, one represents both the incident and the resultant optical fields in terms of an orthogonal set of functions, and finds the unknown parameters from the condition that the two fields have to be matched at each surface on their propagation paths. Even though essentially a numerical process, the mode expansion method can produce very accurate effective representations of the diffraction fields quickly and efficiently, usually by using no more than about a dozen expanding modes. The second tier of contributions contained in this dissertation is on the subject of the analysis and design of microchannel free-space optical interconnects. In addition to the proper characterisation of the design model, we have formulated several optical interconnect performance parameters, most notably the signal-to-noise ratio, optical carrier-to-noise ratio, and the space-bandwidth product, in a thorough and insightful way that has not been published previously. The proper calculation of those performance parameters, made possible by the mode expansion method, was then performed by using experimentally-measured fields of the incident vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser beams. After illustrating the importance of the proper way of modelling diffraction in optical interconnects, we have shown how to improve the optical interconnect performance by changing either the interconnect optical design, or by careful selection of the design parameter values. We have also suggested a change from the usual `square 2 ̆ 7 to a novel `hexagonal 2 ̆ 7 packing of the optical interconnect channels, in order to alleviate the negative diffraction effects. Finally, the optical interconnect tolerance to lateral misalignment, in the presence of multimodal incident laser beams was studied for the first time, and it was shown to be acceptable only as long as most of the incident optical power is emitted in the fundamental Gaussian mode...|$|E
40|$|With the {{electromagnetic}} theory as basis, {{we present a}} sensor model for three-axis magnetometers suitable for localization and tracking as required in intelligent transportation systems and security applications.

40|$|Swarm {{robotics}} has {{the potential}} to combine the power of the hive with the sensibility of the individual to solve non-traditional problems in mechanical, industrial, and architectural engineering and to develop exquisite art beyond the ken of most contemporary painters, sculptors, and architects. The goal of this thesis is to apply swarm robotics to the sublime and the quotidian to achieve this synergy between art and engineering. The potential applications of collective behaviors, manipulation, and self-assembly are quite extensive. We will concentrate our research on three topics: fractals, stability analysis, and building an enhanced multi-robot simulator. Self-assembly of swarm robots into fractal shapes can be used both for artistic purposes (fractal sculptures) and in engineering applications (fractal antennas). Stability analysis studies whether distributed swarm algorithms are stable and robust either to sensing or to numerical errors, and tries to provide solutions to avoid unstable robot configurations. Our enhanced multi-robot simulator supports this research by providing real-time simulations with customized parameters, and can become as well a platform for educating a new generation of artists and engineers. The goal of this thesis is to use techniques inspired by swarm robotics to develop a computational framework accessible to and suitable for both artists and engineers.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} system for the {{automatic}} detection and <b>tracking</b> of <b>metallic</b> objects concealed on moving people in sequences of millimetre-wave (MMW) images. The millimetre-wave sensor employed has been demonstrated for use in covert detection because {{of its ability to}} see through clothing, plastics and fabrics. The system employs two distinct stages: detection and tracking. In this paper a single detector, for metallic objects, is presented which utilises a statistical model also developed in this paper. The second stage tracks the target locations of the objects using a Probability Hypothesis Density filter. The advantage of this filter is that it has the ability to track a variable number of targets, estimating both the number of targets and their locations. This avoids the need for data association techniques as the identities of the individual targets are not required. Results are presented for both simulations and real millimetre-wave image test sequences demonstrating the benefits of our system for the automatic detection and <b>tracking</b> of <b>metallic</b> objects.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} robust and {{efficient}} method to design a flap assembly to be resistant to a full scale experimental bird strike in according to the airworthiness certifications. In particular this paper analyses the full assembly of a CFRP flap including wing track attachments ready to be tested a birdstrike scenario. Before to introduce the impact simulations on the entire flap, a dedicated model calibration, which fully reflect ASTM procedure of tensile and compression tests have been prepared and simulation results, have been compared with typical experimental tests expected for a CFRP material. Furthermore the dimensioning of the roller carriages, which are the links between the flap tracks, has represented a critical issue in the interference aspects between the flap and the wing box, then a detailed evaluation of the links allowed to size the fixture for a fullscale test case. Using of an iterative approach, all failure parameter requested have been properly tuned. Then the calibration impact projectile is introduced to study the interaction between the bird (equivalent gelatine) and the target including the equation of state and contacts. Flap object of this work is equipped on a medium rage turbojet aircraft of about one hundred twenty seats. The flap model is a single slotted flap fixed to the main component with two tracks respectively, staring from the wing root. The impact condition presents for all flap deflections not affected by wing, fan cowl and track shadow. This paper present the analysis of bird strike with flap assembled on wing tracks. For this particular topic, a dedicated session has been developed in order to apply the most representative track installation. Finally an extensive campaign of impacts were performed on the inboard flap. Particular attention on the track zones is dedicated when the flap is fully opened. These zones are very critical because failure of links is a failure of complete systems. Results of the impacts analysis are presented in terms of visual damage and history forces reaction on link and carriage. Moreover the strain of the most critical items will be surveyed (rear spar damage). Result overview allows the selection of the bird impact points based on links and composite failure criteria, in particular on the flap <b>tracks</b> <b>metallic</b> attachments, and lower skin and rear spar damage; Result of current work have allowed to establish robust criteria and to define most critical impact points need to be investigated by means of a strike test. Reducing number of shots a two location allow laboratories to perform test bus using of a unique test specimen saving time and cost. The conclusion of this activity is dedicated a comparison of test result performed and relevant analysis. For the two shots strain gauge and force reaction history acquisition will be compared...|$|R
40|$|Because of the “Energiewende”, {{the energy}} {{transition}} in Germany, {{the demand for}} renewable energy has increased. However, the availability of renewable energy is not predictable. Thus, strong storage devices are needed to stabilize the electricity grid. One such storage device is the rechargeable oxide battery (ROB). An ROB is a new battery concept formed by modifying a high temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The storage and transport of hydrogen, needed for SOFCs, is cost intensive and controversial regarding several safety issues. Thus, high security standards have to be fulfilled and generate additional operational costs for SOFCs. Therefore, hydrogen is produced and/or stored in the ROB indirectly. A porous, iron-based storage material is placed inside the fuel-side of the cell. The metal oxidizes in the aggressive atmosphere of water vapor at high temperature (800 °C) and releases a constant flow of hydrogen, replacing the fuel fed of the SOFC. If the storage material is completely oxidized, the battery can either be recharged, or, if required, run as a SOFC. Since {{the concept of an}} ROB has grown out of the SOFC and the origin cell has not been designed for these application, the battery presents major potentials for optimization. So far, researchers have optimized the rechargeable oxide battery experimentally. But these experiments consume time and resources. Especially, the stack tests are financially burdened. Furthermore, the analysis methods used are partly dangerous due to the high temperature and the usage of hydrofluoric acid for wet chemical analysis. One of the main objectives of our model is to design efficient experiments in order to minimize the number of experiments needed. Thereby, the targeted multiple physics model needs to combine both the electrochemical process and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) inside the battery. As expected, the model results in a system of discontinuous partial differential equations, which can be solved by an advanced stable mathematical method like the Finite Elements Method (FEM). FEM is {{known as one of the}} most powerful and the state-of-art methods in numerical analysis for solving complex differential algebraic equation systems. This work uses an FEM framework (in 1 D/ 2 D) in matlab, based on the library object-orientated partial differential equation (OOPDE) to simulate inhomogeneous and non-smooth, multi-physics systems. At the present, the framework allows the calculation of mass fluxes on the one hand and the analysis of nonlinear interactions within and between different phases (gas, porous media and solids). The developed framework reproduces the fluid dynamics and the oxidation of pure iron particles in 1 D and 2 D. It realizes the evaporation of volatile <b>metallic</b> species to <b>track</b> the migration, for instance, of the storage material within the cell, and builds a base for further extensions planned in the future work, such as implementation of the heat and temperature profiles, reconstruction of the electromagnetic fields as well as analysis of the electrolyte, which are needed for the comprehension of all processes running inside the battery...|$|R
