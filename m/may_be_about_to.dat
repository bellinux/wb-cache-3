500|$|Observing that {{face-to-face}} communication {{of the type}} that online videos convey has been [...] "fine-tuned by {{millions of years of}} evolution", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that [...] "what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for {{face-to-face communication}}". Anderson asserted that it's not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> launch [...] "the biggest learning cycle in human history." [...] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what Forbes Michael Noer called [...] "the largest school in the world", with technology poised to disrupt how people learn. YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award, the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that [...] "both embodies and promotes democracy." [...] The Washington Post reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white. A Pew Research Center study reported the development of [...] "visual journalism", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation. The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.|$|E

Two days later, it suspended its shares from quotation. Initially, the company advised it intended to resume trading on the ASX the following week, but on 21 April, a local newspaper, WA Business News, speculated that [...] "One line of thought is that uncertainty on behalf of iiNet's bankers, {{will result in the}} company embarking on a capital raising to address concerns over banking covenants, and provide its bankers with a measure of confidence."

I would have some of them leave that work of theirs which will never lack hands, and begin to dig in Ireland, the garden of the future, understanding that here in Ireland the spirit of man <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> wed the soil of the world.|$|E
6000|$|The daily bulletins {{became more}} significant; {{the crisis was}} evidently at hand. A {{dissolution}} of parliament at any time must occasion great excitement; combined with a new reign, it inflames the passions of every class of the community. Even the poor begin to hope; the old, wholesome superstition still lingers, that the sovereign can exercise power; and the suffering multitude are fain to believe that its remedial character <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be revealed in their instance. As for the aristocracy in a new reign, they are all in a flutter. A bewildering vision of coronets, stars, and ribbons; smiles, and places at court; haunts their noontide speculations and their midnight dreams. Then we must not forget the numberless instances in which the coming event is deemed to supply the long-sought opportunity of distinction, or the long-dreaded cause of utter discomfiture; the hundreds, the thousands, who mean to get into parliament, the units who dread getting out. What a crashing change from lounging in St James's street to sauntering on Boulogne pier; or, after dining at Brookes and supping at Crockford's, to be saved from destruction by the friendly interposition that sends you in an official capacity to the marsupial sympathies of Sydney or Swan River! ...|$|E

60|$|Friedrich of Brandenburg-Hohenzollern, {{who came}} by course of natural {{succession}} to be Friedrich II. of Prussia, {{and is known}} in these ages as Frederick the Great, {{was born in the}} palace of Berlin, about noon, on the 24th of January, 1712. A small infant, but of great promise or possibility; and thrice and four times welcome to all sovereign and other persons in the Prussian Court, and Prussian realms, in those cold winter days. His Father, they say, was like to have stifled him with his caresses, so overjoyed was the man; or at least to have scorched him in the blaze of the fire; when happily some much suitabler female nurse snatched this little creature from the rough paternal paws,--and saved it for the benefit of Prussia and mankind. If Heaven will but please to grant it length of life! For there have already been two little Princekins, who are both dead; this Friedrich is the fourth child; and only one little girl, wise Wilhelmina, of almost too sharp wits, and not too vivacious aspect, is otherwise yet here of royal progeny. It is feared the Hohenzollern lineage, which has flourished here with such beneficent effect for three centuries now, and been in truth the very making of the Prussian Nation, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> fail, or pass into some side branch.
