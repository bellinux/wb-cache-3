Existing methods for building domain-specific Web search engines require human expertise or specific facilities. However, we can build a domain-specific search engine simply by adding domain-specific keywords, called “keyword spices, ” to the user’s input query and forwarding it to a general-purpose Web search engine. Keyword spices can be effectively discovered from Web documents using machine learning technologies. This paper will describe domain-specific Web search engines that use keyword spices for locating recipes, restaurants, and used cars.

Home modifications can appear as a straightforward solution to safety and occupational performance concerns; nevertheless, clients sometimes reject modifications or are unsatisfied with the completed works. To understand this phenomenon, this study aimed to determine what aspects of the {{home environment}} impact home <b>modification</b> <b>decision</b> making. Method In this qualitative descriptive study, 42 in-depth interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire were undertaken and analysed using a template analysis. The interviews explored {{the experience of the}} home modification process, including concerns and the decisions made about the modifications. Findings Four dimensions of the home environment were commonly found to affect decision making namely, the personal, societal, physical and temporal dimensions of home as well as social and occupational dimensions. Conclusions An understanding of the dimensions of home that impact decision making provides occupational therapists with a greater appreciation of the experience of home and allows them to enhance the effectiveness and acceptance of home modifications...|$|E

40|$|Ellis v. Carucci {{represents}} an evolution in Nevada’s child custody laws that should continue. Before Ellis, Nevada courts modified custody arrangements without explicitly considering {{the best interests}} of the child. Ellis cemented the legislative intent behind Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) § 125. 4803 to make the child’s best interest the focus of the judge’s decision in custody cases. However, Ellis and NRS § 125. 480 are not enough to accomplish this overarching goal. The Nevada legislature should revise NRS § 125. 480 so that the statute explicitly recognizes the instability and adjustments that children of divorce must endure. The statute should also be revised to identify factors that are not appropriate for consideration under the best interests standard and to provide for the possible use of a Court Appointed Special Advocate. Part I of this Note describes the historical development of Nevada’s child custody laws, from the early law in child custody to the contemporary law and the Ellis decision.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate whether the framing effect proposed by prospect theory can affect the auditor 2 ̆ 7 s decision making process. Prospect theory, a descriptive theory of decision making, posits that {{the manner in which}} information is presented (framed) can influence individual decision making by affecting the reference point from which alternatives are evaluated. Alternatives are evaluated as gains or losses from that reference point and the decision maker 2 ̆ 7 s risk preference can shift when an alternative is perceived as a gain versus a loss. ^ The audit decision context in which the framing effect is investigated is the auditor 2 ̆ 7 s decision regarding going concern modification of the audit report. In this context the auditor evaluates information from a variety of sources. Information that is framed in a positive or negative manner could potentially influence the reference frame from which alternatives are evaluated. Previous research has indicated that the auditor will consider consequences to the audit firm when making this decision. Therefore, another potential source of a framing effect is {{the manner in which the}} probability of occurrence of a specific outcome is presented. This study investigates the effect on the auditor 2 ̆ 7 s going concern <b>modification</b> <b>decision</b> of framing the information the auditor evaluates and framing the probability of resulting consequences. ^ The hypothesis of this study was tested by administering a case to 100 auditors with a wide range of experience who practiced primarily in Midwestern states. The subjects, randomly assigned to positive and negative treatment groups, were asked to evaluate the viability of a hypothetical client and make a decision with respect to audit report modification. ^ The results of this dissertation indicate that auditors are not immune to the framing effect posited by prospect theory. The implications of this finding and opportunities for future research are included in this dissertation. ...|$|E

40|$|The Clean Air Act and its {{subsequent}} amendments have been lauded {{as the primary}} stimulant to the impressive improvement in local air quality in the US since 1970. A key component of these regulations is the New Source Review (NSR) requirement, which includes the contentious stipulation that when an existing plant seeks to modify its operations, the entire plant must comply with current standards for new sources. This requirement was included to improve air quality in dirty areas, and prevent a deterioration of air quality in clean areas. Yet, whether NSR provides the proper plant-level incentives is unclear: there are strong disincentives to undertake major plant modifications to avoid NSR. In our examination of more than 2500 and 2200 plant-level <b>modification</b> <b>decisions</b> and closures, respectively, we find empirical evidence suggesting that NSR retards modification rates, while doing little to hasten the closure of existing dirty plants. ...|$|R

In this paper we present a mixed-initiative system for the task of schedule maintenance in a simulated shipping network.

The goal is to maximize throughput while minimizing disruptions to the original schedule.

40|$|In Turkey, {{after the}} 1999 G 6 lc Earthquake, urban {{redevelopment}} {{has been seen}} as a major solution for the removal or rehabilitation of low quality urban settlements. Several laws and bylaws have been passed to this end. One of the major task of this transformation and/or redevelopment is to convince relevant parties to participate into the process of change. This process always needs either significant side-payments from government, or land use change and/or density bonuses as much as to cover redevelopment costs in high-rent zones of urban land. This research utilizes the cooperative game theory concepts to achieve voluntary participation of property owners by satisfying their rational and reasonable requests from any forms of coalition. In this process, government as an outside institution is included as a central facilitator who has major public interest in solving low quality urban fabric problem with minimal/low-cost involvement of public funds. There are two types of government involvement: i) If the measurable benefits of coalition satisfy the parties, government may function as an only facilitator or coordinator, and may retain the extra benefits of coalition as a tax; ii) If the measurable benefits of coalition do not satisfy the parties, government may function as an external resource supplier to form a coalition. The obtained taxes, later, may be used in the necessary areas as subsidies to build stable coalitions. In the study, the cooperative game theory model utilizes the local governments' rezoning and density <b>modification</b> <b>decisions</b> favoring the financing of urban redevelopment, and sorts the involved parties' strategies. Game theory application results over a hypothetical case have shown that cooperative game theory is an efficient, effective, and rational tool to convince involved parties who may demand illogical and uneducated benefits from any form of coalition.

40|$|This thesis investigates female {{cultures}} of body modification in contemporary Britain. I begin from {{the premise that}} women in current UK society are concerned about their appearance and subjected to significant media pressures to engage in body modification. By body modification I mean the methods which women use in order to alter their physical body and appearance. All methods (invasive or non-invasive; self-administered or other-administered; permanent or temporary) are considered, provided the intention of their use is primarily to alter the user’s physical appearance. Based on qualitative life-history interviews with thirty university-educated British women aged between eighteen and twenty-five my research investigates the choices of, motives for, influences on and relationships of women to their practices of body modification. The analysis chapters of this thesis deal with three key stages in my participants’ development during which body modification emerged as important. These are the point when my participants went to school, their years at university and their entry {{into the world of}} work. The analysis chapters focus on these three stages. The first one explores participants’ initial engagement with and experience of body modification during the school years. The second centres on their use of body modification while at university, and the final analysis chapter explores their engagement with these practices in the world of work. I also discuss my participants’ expectation of their future engagement with body modification. Unlike third-wave feminist discourse, which frequently refers to body modification in terms of freedom and choice, my findings offer a completely different understanding of women’s engagement in these practices. In the life stages I focus on, sociality and taking cue from others emerged as the most important aspects of women’s body <b>modification</b> <b>decisions.</b> ...|$|R

Maize is a staple food {{and an important}} source of income for farmers in southern Benin. It is stored at village level in traditional storage structures and treated with conservation products. To improve control pest damage in stored maize, improved wooden granaries and a new product, Sofagrain®, were introduced in 1992. On-farm trials indicated that after six months of storage, the losses were reduced from 30 % to only 5 % for maize treated with Sofagrain® stored in an improved wooden granary. Although the effectiveness of storage innovations against pests is well documented, {{little is known about the}} socioeconomic aspects of promotion of these innovations in southern Benin. Using appropriate econometric models, this study investigates the perceptions of farmers regarding the characteristics of storage innovations and the causal effect of participation in extension on their formation, the adoption of storage innovations and effect of sources of information on the determinants of adoption, the impact of adopting storage innovation on schooling expenditure and the factors that affect the abandonment of storage innovations. First, the empirical results show that the effectiveness against pests and the length of the storage are the most important preferred characteristics and are provided by the storage innovation. Second, farmer’s participation in an extension program on these storage technologies has an important effect on the probability that positive perceptions of the quality of effectiveness against insects are provided by the improved wooden granary and the Sofagrain®. Third, there are differences in adoption and <b>modification</b> <b>decisions</b> between farmers who are informed by extension agents and those informed by other farmers.
