25|$|A {{person may}} {{sometimes}} experience better vision in daylight than at night {{because of an}} increased depth of field due to constriction of the pupil (i.e., <b>miosis).</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{is almost}} {{invariably}} a secondary uveitis present with corneal ulceration, {{and signs of}} this may also be seen: <b>miosis,</b> corneal oedema, aqueous flare, hypopyon, IOP changes.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance is {{a process}} {{characterized}} by neuroadaptations that result in reduced drug effects. While receptor upregulation may often {{play an important role}} other mechanisms are also known. Tolerance is more pronounced for some effects than for others; tolerance occurs slowly to the effects on mood, itching, urinary retention, and respiratory depression, but occurs more quickly to the analgesia and other physical side effects. However, tolerance does not develop to constipation or <b>miosis</b> (the constriction of the pupil of the eye to {{less than or equal to}} two millimeters). This idea has been challenged, however, with some authors arguing that tolerance does develop to <b>miosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Horner's syndrome* {{results from}} {{damage to the}} {{sympathetic}} innervation of the eye. Signs include enophthalmos (sunken eye), <b>miosis</b> (small pupil), elevated third eyelid, and ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid). Usually the syndrome in dogs is idiopathic, {{but it can also}} be caused by trauma, tumors, or ear infections.|$|E
25|$|An {{overdose}} of dextropropoxyphene {{may lead to}} various systemic effects. Excessive opioid receptor stimulation {{is responsible for the}} CNS depression, respiratory depression, aspiration pneumonia, <b>miosis,</b> and gastrointestinal effects seen in propoxyphene poisoning. It may also account for mood- or thought-altering effects. In the presence of amphetamine, propoxyphene overdose will increase CNS stimulation and may cause fatal convulsive seizures.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} the use of buprenorphine are similar to those of other opioids and include: nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, memory loss, cognitive and neural inhibition, perspiration, itchiness, dry mouth, shrinking of the pupils of the eyes (<b>miosis),</b> orthostatic hypotension, male ejaculatory difficulty, decreased libido, and urinary retention. Constipation and CNS effects are seen less frequently than with morphine.|$|E
25|$|Corneal ulcers are painful due to nerve exposure, and {{can cause}} tearing, squinting, and pawing at the eye. There may also be signs of {{anterior}} uveitis, such as <b>miosis</b> (small pupil), aqueous flare (protein in the aqueous humour), and redness of the eye. An axon reflex {{may be responsible for}} uveitis formation — stimulation of pain receptors in the cornea results in release inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, histamine, and acetylcholine.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone {{appears to}} be {{relatively}} benign in cases of single-drug overdose, although no definitive data on this subject appear to be available. In one clinical trial, buspirone was administered to healthy male volunteers at a dosage of 375mg/day, and produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, <b>miosis,</b> and gastric distress. In early clinical trials, buspirone was given at dosages even as high as 2,400mg/day, with akathisia, tremor, and muscle rigidity observed. Deliberate overdoses with 250mg and up to 300mg buspirone have resulted in drowsiness in about 50% of individuals. One death {{has been reported in}} association with 450mg buspirone together with alprazolam, diltiazem, alcohol, cocaine.|$|E
25|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{pethidine}} administration are primarily those of the opioids as a class: nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, diaphoresis, urinary retention, and constipation. Unlike other opioids, it does not cause <b>miosis</b> because of its anticholinergic properties. Overdose can cause muscle flaccidity, respiratory depression, obtundation, cold and clammy skin, hypotension, and coma. A narcotic antagonist such as naloxone is indicated to reverse respiratory depression and other effects of pethidine. Serotonin syndrome has occurred in patients receiving concurrent antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Convulsive seizures sometimes observed in patients receiving parenteral pethidine on a chronic basis {{have been attributed to}} accumumulation in plasma of the metabolite norpethidine (normeperidine). Fatalities have occurred following either oral or intravenous pethidine overdose.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, <b>miosis</b> (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (runny nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is a {{phenanthrene}} {{opioid receptor}} agonist– its main effect is binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptors {{in the central}} nervous system. Its intrinsic activity at the μ-opioid is heavily dependent on the assay and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a full agonist while in others {{it can be a}} partial agonist or even antagonist. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the μ-opioid receptors is associated with analgesia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Morphine is also a κ-opioid and δ-opioid receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with spinal analgesia, <b>miosis</b> (pinpoint pupils) and psychotomimetic effects. δ-Opioid is thought {{to play a role in}} analgesia. Although morphine does not bind to the σ-receptor, it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-pentazocine, inhibit morphine analgesia, and σ-antagonists enhance morphine analgesia, suggesting downstream involvement of the σ-receptor in the actions of morphine.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{experiments}} on frogs, the Japanese group {{carried out a}} series of classical pharmacological investigations of candicine on cats and rabbits, and on various isolated animal organs/tissues. In rabbits, doses of 0.6mg/kg, i.v., of candicine produced respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances lasting about 15 minutes. Body temperature was not affected; there was also mydriasis followed by <b>miosis,</b> and hypersalivation. In rabbits, i.v. doses of 2.1mg/kg produced apnea, followed by death. In anesthetized cats, doses of 0.06–0.12mg/kg, iv., also caused respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances: although the details were concentration-and time-dependent, the ultimate effects were ones of sustained respiratory stimulation and elevated blood pressure; the hypertension was not inhibited by atropine, but was antagonized by hexamethonium. Candicine caused contraction of the cat nictitating membrane. A concentration of 0.012mg/mL applied to the isolated guinea pig atrium caused a decrease in the amplitude and rate of contractions, these effects being enhanced by eserine, but inhibited by atropine pre-treatment. Concentrations of 3-6μg/mL produced contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum which were inhibited by pre-treatment with atropine, hexamethonium, tubocurarine or cocaine, but were not affected by the presence of pyribenzamine or chlorpheniramine. Summarizing the results of these and other observations, the authors concluded that: candicine was primarily a stimulant of autonomic ganglia; it liberated catecholamines from the adrenal medulla; it showed muscarine-like and sympathomimetic effects in some assays, and it was a neuromuscular blocker of the depolarizing type. In many of these respects, candicine resembled nicotine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP).|$|E
500|$|In 2004 the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) {{published}} {{a review of}} various research regarding [...] "visual training", which consisted of [...] "eye exercises, muscle relaxation techniques, biofeedback, eye patches, or eye massages", [...] "alone or in combinations". No evidence was found that such techniques could objectively benefit eyesight, though some studies noted changes, both positive and negative, in the visual acuity of nearsighted subjects as measured by a Snellen chart. In some cases noted improvements were maintained at subsequent follow-ups. However, these results were not seen as actual reversals of nearsightedness, and were attributed instead to factors such as [...] "improvements in interpreting blurred images, changes in mood or motivation, creation of an artificial contact lens by tear film changes, or a pinhole effect from <b>miosis</b> of the pupil." ...|$|E
2500|$|Atropine {{is given}} as a {{treatment}} for SLUDGE syndrome (salivation, lacrimation, urination, diaphoresis, gastrointestinal motility, emesis) symptoms caused by organophosphate poisoning. [...] Another mnemonic is DUMBBELSS, which stands for diarrhea, urination, <b>miosis,</b> bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, excitation (as of muscle in the form of fasciculations and CNS), lacrimation, salivation, and sweating (only sympathetic innervation using muscarinic receptors).|$|E
2500|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{laudanum}} are generally {{the same as}} with morphine, and include euphoria, dysphoria, pruritus, sedation, constipation, reduced tidal volume, respiratory depression, as well as psychological dependence, physical dependence, <b>miosis,</b> and xerostomia. [...] Overdose can result in severe respiratory depression or collapse and death. [...] The ethanol component can also induce adverse effects at higher doses; the side effects {{are the same as}} with alcohol.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{adverse effects}} {{associated}} with the use of codeine include drowsiness and constipation. [...] Less common are itching, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, <b>miosis,</b> orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, euphoria, dysphoria, and coughing. Rare adverse effects include anaphylaxis, seizure, acute pancreatitis, and respiratory depression. [...] As with all opiates, longer-term effects can vary, but can include diminished libido, apathy, and memory loss. [...] Some people may have allergic reactions to codeine, such as the swelling of skin and rashes.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the pain}} {{associated}} with corneal ulceration {{is due to the}} secondary uveitis and <b>miosis,</b> and effective relief can often be gained with topical atropine(1%), leading to mydriasis. [...] Dosing is generally q4h initially, and then as required to maintain dilation. [...] Mydriasis is also important to avoid some of the complications associated with uveitis, such as synechiae formation and glaucoma. [...] Pain is also associated with inflammatory response occurring in the adjacent sclera and conjunctiva, and systemic analgesia in the form of NSAIDs is usually indicated, for example, flunixin meglumin 1.1mg/kg, BID. [...] Topical NSAIDs are available (diclofenac, flurbiprofen) and effective, but have been shown to increase corneal healing time.|$|E
2500|$|Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} occurs {{exclusively in}} otherwise normal children and manifests mainly with infrequent autonomic epileptic seizures and autonomic status epilepticus. [...] Onset of seizures is from age 1 to 14 years with 76% starting between 3–6 years. Autonomic seizures consist of episodes of disturbed autonomic function with nausea, retching and vomiting as predominant symptoms. [...] Other autonomic manifestations include pallor (or, less often, flushing or cyanosis), mydriasis (or, less often, <b>miosis),</b> cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory alterations, {{incontinence of urine}} and/or feces, hypersalivation, and modifications of intestinal motility. In approximately one fifth of the seizures the child becomes unresponsive and flaccid (syncope-like epileptic seizures or ictal syncope) before or often without convulsions. Syncope-like epileptic seizures (ictal syncope) with the child becoming [...] "completely unresponsive and flaccid like a rag doll" [...] occur in one fifth of the seizures. [...] More-conventional seizure symptoms often appear after the onset of autonomic manifestations. The child, who was initially fully conscious, becomes confused and unresponsive. Eyes turn to one side or gaze widely open. Only half of the seizures end with brief hemiconvulsions or generalized convulsions. Autonomic symptoms {{may be the only}} features of the seizures. None of the above symptoms alone is a prerequisite for diagnosis. [...] Recurrent seizures may not be stereotyped. The same child may have brief or prolonged seizures and autonomic manifestations may be severe or inconspicuous. [...] The full emetic triad (nausea, retching, vomiting) culminates in vomiting in 74% of the seizures; in others only nausea or retching occur, and in a few, none of the emetic symptoms are apparent.|$|E
