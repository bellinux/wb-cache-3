It was a <b>Marie</b> <b>Curie</b> <b>Fellowship</b> at the Film School FAMU in Prague with the project: [...] "Hypertextual Film Presentation. Digital Editions for the European Cinematographic Heritage" [...] (2006-2008). With film historian Nikolai Izvolov, head of film history at NIIK, Natascha Drubek co-authored the method Hyperkino. Hyperkino is a standardized system of annotating films on digital carriers - attaching related content and analysis to individual frames. The pilot DVD of Alexander Hackenschmied`s Aimless Walk (1930) - finished in 2008 - was never published. A version of Drubek’s annotations appeared in the journal Bohemia. In 2012, in cooperation with Izvolov, Drubek published the Hyperkino the ibook “Happiness” (on Aleksandr Medvedkin’s 1934 film Happiness), the first scholarly filmbook with moving images.https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/happiness/id574212198?mt=11 Drubek served as a member of film festival juries at Docaviv (2016) and Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (2012, 2014).|$|E

Mark's closest colleagues were Mark Meier and W. Tad Pfeffer at INSTAAR, and David Bahr (now at Regis University). They helped Mark quickly integrate in the American glaciological community and feel at home in the U.S. In 2004, he received a fellowship from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, and in 2006-07 he was in Stockholm as a recipient of a prestigious <b>Marie</b> <b>Curie</b> <b>Fellowship.</b> At the time of his death, he had published over 120 scientific papers, including two in 2009, in the fields of glacier monitoring, causes of sea-level rise, methods of mass balance and runoff study, and all aspects of glaciers in relation to climate change and meltwater production. Until his last hours, he was working on a major compendium that he was planning to publish in Moscow as an issue of [...] "Materials of Glaciological Research." [...] The best known of Mark’s contributions to the scientific literature are his several global compilations and syntheses of glacier mass balance.

40|$|A {{critical}} component of ongoing ocean margin research in Europe is the involvement of young researchers, many of whom will eventually build careers in this field. As part of the European Commission's various Framework Programmes, a number of schemes provide opportunities and funding for young researchers to contribute to European ocean margin research. Within the current Framework Five (FP 5) Programme (1998 - 2002, but ongoing until 2006), the Improving Human Research Potential and the Socio-Economic Base Programme (also {{commonly known as the}} Human Potential Programme) was initiated to support training and mobility of researchers from virtually all scientific fields throughout Europe. Under this Human Potential Programme, opportunities for young researchers are channelled through two schemes: (1) the <b>Marie</b> <b>Curie</b> <b>Fellowships,</b> which are awarded to outstanding individual pre- and post-doctoral researchers; and (2) <b>Marie</b> <b>Curie</b> Research Training Networks (RTNs), which involve teams of researchers...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} shown steady {{progress}} towards molecular electronics, in which molecules form basic components such as switches, diodes and electronic mixers. Often, a scanning tunnelling microscope {{is used to}} address an individual molecule, although this arrangement does not provide long-term stability. Therefore, metal–molecule–metal links using break-junction devices have also been explored; however, {{it is difficult to}} establish unambiguously that a single molecule forms the contact. Here we show that a single hydrogen molecule can form a stable bridge between platinum electrodes. In contrast to results for organic molecules, the bridge has a nearly perfect conductance of one quantum unit, carried by a single channel. The hydrogen bridge represents a simple test system in which to understand fundamental transport properties of single-molecule devices. C. U. and Y.
