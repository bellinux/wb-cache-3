500|$|Prior to Greer's casting, Cheryl was {{initially}} intended to merely be a secondary character for Archer, {{and serve as}} a central figure in a proposed pregnancy angle.

2500|$|During 1985 John Hersey {{returned}} to Hiroshima, where he reported and wrote Hiroshima: The Aftermath, {{a follow-up to}} his original story. The New Yorker published Hersey's update in its July 15, 1985, issue, and the article was subsequently appended to a newly revised edition of the book. [...] "What has kept the world safe from the bomb since 1945 has not been deterrence, {{in the sense of}} fear of specific weapons, so much as it's been memory", wrote Hersey.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to prospective memory, retrospective memory involves remembering [...] people, events, or words {{that have been}} encountered in the past. [...] Whereas retrospective memory requires only the recall of past events, prospective memory requires the exercise of retrospective memory {{at a time that}} has not yet occurred. Prospective memory is thus considered a form of memory for the future. Retrospective memory involves the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we know, containing informational content; prospective memory focuses on when to act, rather than focusing on informational content. There is some evidence demonstrating the role of retrospective memory in the successful execution of prospective memory, but this role seems to be relatively small.|$|E
