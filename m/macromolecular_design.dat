40|$|The {{majority}} of anticancer drugs have poor aqueous solubility, produce adverse effects in healthy tissue, and thus impose major limitations on both clinical efficacy and therapeutic safety of cancer chemotherapy. To help circumvent {{problems associated with}} solubility, most cancer drugs are now formulated with co-solubilizers. However, these agents often also introduce severe side effects, thereby restricting effective treatment and patient quality of life. A promising approach to addressing problems in anticancer drug solubility and selectivity is their conjugation with polymeric carriers to form polymer-based prodrugs.

40|$|Recent {{synthesis}} of covalent organic assemblies at surfaces {{has opened up}} the promise of producing robust nanostructures for functional interfaces. To uncover how this new chemistry works at surfaces and understand the underlying mechanism(s) that control bond-breaking and bond-making processes at specific positions of the participating molecules, we study here the coupling reaction of tetra(mesityl) porphyrin molecules, which creates covalently connected networks on the Cu(110) surface by utilising the 4 -methyl groups as unique connection points. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) and Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations, we show that the unique directionality of the covalent bonding is found to stem from a chain of highly selective C-H activation and de-hydrogenation processes, followed by specific intermolecular C-C coupling reactions that are facilitated by the surface, by steric constraints and by anisotropic molecular diffusion.

50|$|Reversible Addition Fragmentation chain Transfer {{polymerization}} or RAFT is a degenerative {{chain transfer}} process and is free radical in nature. RAFT agents contain di- or tri-thiocarbonyl groups, {{and it is}} the reaction with an initiator, usually AIBN, that creates a propagating chain or polymer radical. This polymer chain then adds to the C=S and leads to the formation of a stabilized radical intermediate. In an ideal system, these stabilized radical intermediates do not undergo termination reactions, but instead reintroduce a radical capable of reinitiation or propagation with monomer, while they themselves reform their C=S bond. The cycle of addition to the C=S bond, followed by fragmentation of a radical, continues until all monomer or initiator is consumed. Termination is limited in this system by the low concentration of active radicals and any termination that does occur is negligible. RAFT, invented by Rizzardo et al. at CSIRO and a mechanistically identical process termed <b>Macromolecular</b> <b>Design</b> via Interchange of Xanthates (MADIX), invented by Zard et al. at Rhodia were both first reported in 1998/early 1999.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and validation of computational <b>macromolecular</b> modeling and <b>design</b> methods depend on suitable benchmark datasets and informative metrics for comparing protocols. In addition, if a method {{is intended to}} be adopted broadly in diverse biological applications, there needs to be information on appropriate parameters for each protocol, as well as metrics describing the expected accuracy compared to experimental data. In certain disciplines, there exist established benchmarks and public resources where experts in a particular methodology are encouraged to supply their most efficient implementation of each particular benchmark. We aim to provide such a resource for protocols in <b>macromolecular</b> modeling and <b>design.</b> We present a freely accessible web resource ([URL] to guide the development of protocols for protein modeling and design. The site provides benchmark datasets and metrics to compare the performance of a variety of modeling protocols using different computational sampling methods and energy functions, providing a "best practice" set of parameters for each method. Each benchmark has an associated downloadable benchmark capture archive containing the input files, analysis scripts, and tutorials for running the benchmark. The captures may be run with any suitable modeling method; we supply command lines for running the benchmarks using the Rosetta software suite. We have compiled initial benchmarks for the resource spanning three key areas: prediction of energetic effects of mutations, protein design, and protein structure prediction, each with associated state-of-the-art modeling protocols.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, living radical {{polymerization}} (LRP) has revolutionized academic {{research in the}} fields of free-radical polymerization and materials <b>design.</b> Sophisticated <b>macromolecular</b> architectures, <b>designed</b> for a variety of applications and end-use properties, can now be synthesized using relatively simple LRP chemistries that do not require stringent oxygen or moisture free environments, subzero reaction temperatures, or highly purified reagents. Publications abound not only in the fundamentals of LRP but also its use in designing tailor-made polymers and polymer–hybrid composites. Corporate research organizations have also been actively involved in LRP, with numerous patents being issued annually. Despite the intense research interest, however, comparatively few products have been commercialized, with high process costs being a primary factor. Most commercial free-radical polymerizations are conducted in aqueous dispersions due to significantly lower process costs compared to bulk or solution polymerizations. Successful widespread commercialization of LRP will be advantaged by the development of waterborne processes yielding aqueous dispersions of nanoparticles. Conducting LRP within nanoparticles (i. e., using nanoscale particles as self-contained chemical reactors or “nanoreactors”) enables faster reaction times and if harnessed properly will provide better control over the polymer livingness; it also has the potential in the control of the particle mesostructure and microstructure.

40|$|AbstractObjective To {{study the}} role of the {{superficial}} layer of articular cartilage in the transport of <b>macromolecular</b> solutes. <b>Design</b> The articular cartilage of intact bovine carpal bones was incubated with 125 I-labeled bovine serum albumin, human IgG, or horse ferritin for 4 hours. Quadruplicate samples were first incubated with polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase for 30 minutes to remove the outermost layer covering the articular surface. The rates of exchange of each macromolecule from excised tissue explants {{in the absence of a}} concentration gradient were measured at six different time points. The results were expressed as the fraction of radioactive protein exiting the cartilage per mm 2 of tissue, or as picomoles of labeled solute per mm 2. Results Exchange rates correlated well with molecular mass, and no apparent differences were detected between intact and elastase-treated tissues. However, when the results were expressed in terms of the total number of molecules within the tissue, it was apparent that IgG molecules accumulated in the intact cartilage in larger than expected numbers. This finding was not observed in experiments using elastase-treated tissue. Conclusion These observations suggest that the outermost surface layer does not constitute a barrier to the transport of macromolecules into the deeper zones of the tissue. The higher IgG accumulation observed in intact cartilage suggests that the acidic outer layer of cartilage exhibited attractive interactions, probably ionic in nature, with the cationic fraction of IgG. These observations may relate to our previous work demonstrating that the sequestered immune complexes in the superficial zone of articular cartilage in rheumatoid arthritis, and in the antigen-induced arthritis model, are formed because pre-existing antibody normally present in cartilage irreversibly traps antigen within the tissue...|$|R
