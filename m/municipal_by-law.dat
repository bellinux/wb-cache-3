2500|$|In 1984, Yeomans championed a <b>municipal</b> <b>by-law</b> to {{restrict}} abortion clinics, strip clubs, erotica shops, and tanning studios {{to a remote}} corner of the city. Council later introduced a further, supplementary by-law to require a [...] "buffer zone" [...] between areas reserved for abortion clinics and areas reserved for sex shops. Several feminist groups criticized the by-law for placing access to abortion {{on the same level}} as the purchasing of pornography. Yeomans responded that the legislation was not intended to pass any judgement on the subject of abortion, but rather to ensure that any confrontations or disruptions near abortion clinics would be kept away from residential areas. The by-laws were approved by Dorval city council in January 1985 and came into effect two months later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first is}} the term [...] "provincial court," [...] which has two quite {{different}} meanings, depending on context. [...] The first, and most general meaning, is that a provincial court is a court established by the Legislature of a province, under its constitutional authority over the Administration of Justice in the Province, set out in s. 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867. This head of power gives the Provinces the power to regulate [...] "... the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts". All courts created by a Province, from the small claims court or <b>municipal</b> <b>by-law</b> court, up to the provincial Court of Appeal, are [...] "provincial courts" [...] in this general sense.|$|E

The basic features of the <b>municipal</b> <b>by-laws</b> will be described, and their application in recent years will be analysed. This will be followed by a critique of their particular implications concerning the use of space, with emphasis on the issue of regulating behaviour in public spaces on the basis of substantive conceptions of the “good”, and on the intrinsic limitations of <b>municipal</b> <b>by-laws</b> as applied in Italy.|$|R

50|$|A police officer, or {{a person}} {{authorized}} by a jurisdiction's police powers act, may arrest anyone whom the officer has probable cause to believe has committed any criminal offence.

50|$|Within its {{jurisdiction}} {{and specific}} to those areas {{mandated by the}} higher body, a <b>municipal</b> <b>by-law</b> {{is no different than}} any other law of the land, and can be enforced with penalties, challenged in court and must comply with other laws of the land, such as the country's constitution. Municipal bylaws are often enforcable through the public justice system, and offenders can be charged with a criminal offence for breach of a bylaw. Common bylaws include vehicle parking and stopping regulations, animal control, building and construction, licensing, noise, zoning and business regulation, and management of public recreation areas.|$|E
5000|$|Stadtbezirk, a {{subdivision}} {{of a city}} {{in the sense of}} a borough (e.g. in Berlin, Hamburg or Vienna), often again subdivided into several quarters and neighbourhoods. According to German Gemeindeordnung codes, the city council resolves upon the implementation by <b>municipal</b> <b>by-law</b> (Satzung). In some cities the Bezirke have limited powers delegated to them by the city's local government, including an assembly resulting from local elections and an own 'mayor' (Bürgermeister). In the German states of Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate any municipality is authorized to implement Ortsbezirke with own advisory councils and local administrators. The state law in North Rhine-Westphalia commits the municipal administration of an independent city to subdivide the urban area into Stadtbezirke.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{significance}} of the rapid increase in <b>municipal</b> <b>by-laws</b> restricting the use of pesticides on lawns and their support by the courts and higher political jurisdictions in Canada. Using a review on the literature of lawn management, recent policy events in Canada, and a case study of the Town of Caledon in Ontario, the study confirms the power of local democratic forces in support of such initiatives, but cautions against an overly positive view. Selective community backing, the continued endorsement of an industrial lawn aesthetic, and the continued strength of the pesticide industry sector and its supporters, can compromise both the extent and quality of the effectiveness of a by-law. The study points to the value and urgency of further research and assessments of individual <b>municipal</b> <b>by-laws</b> and their local and cumulative impacts...|$|R

5000|$|In June 1984, {{the then}} {{landlord}} informed tenants {{that the building}} would be sold for conversion into a form of condominium, in which purchasers would have bought units as tenants-in-common (with each owner having {{a stake in the}} property, without owning a specific part of the building), thereby sidestepping a <b>municipal</b> <b>by-law</b> preventing apartment-condominium conversations in place at the time. In November of the same year, it was reported that the tenants successfully fought off the conversion scheme, and the owner of the day confirmed that the condo development deal was [...] "up the flue" [...] {{and that it would be}} more profitable to convert the ground floor units into offices.

50|$|Westendorp v R, 1983 1 S.C.R. 43 was a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of Canada on {{the scope of the}} federal Parliament's criminal law power under section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. A unanimous Court found that a <b>municipal</b> <b>by-law</b> that prohibited standing in the street for the purpose of prostitution was in the nature of a criminal law prohibition and therefore ultra vires of the provincial constitutional authority. The decision surprised many legal scholars who considered it to be inconsistent with previous Supreme Court cases where provincial laws of a moral nature were upheld under the provincial power (see Canada (AG) v Montreal (City of), 1978 and Nova Scotia (Board of Censors) v McNeil 1978). This was also the first case where the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was cited in argument to the Supreme Court, although the Charter argument was ultimately abandoned during the hearing.|$|E
50|$|Until 2014, Sudbury {{was one of}} the few {{cities in}} Ontario where a <b>municipal</b> <b>by-law</b> {{prevented}} stores from opening on December 26, meaning that retail stores in the city began their post-Christmas Boxing Day sales on December 27. Some of the city's business owners alleged that this restriction caused a loss of business, as some shoppers in the region travelled to Barrie or Toronto to take advantage of the earlier shopping day. With labour unions being a prominent political force in the city, the issue of balancing the rights of retailers to set business hours against the rights of workers to holiday time at Christmas has been a persistent debate in Sudbury's municipal politics. In the 2010 municipal election, mayoral candidate Marianne Matichuk made a campaign pledge to deregulate store hours in the city, including allowing Boxing Day shopping; although she won election to the mayoralty, her motion to repeal the by-law failed when she presented it to city council in 2011. In early 2012, city councillor Ron Dupuis proposed putting the question to a voter referendum in the 2014 municipal election.|$|E
50|$|Jacques Marcoux {{was born}} to Canadian parents in Greenville, Maine, in 1945 and moved to Canada with his family two years later. He worked for many years as a teacher, civil servant, and small {{business}} owner. He was a councillor in Potton from 1981 to 1985 and was elected as the community's mayor over his cousin, incumbent André Marcoux, in 1989. He served for one term before being defeated in a 1993 election rematch. In 1988, he helped defeat a <b>municipal</b> <b>by-law</b> that would have permitted three {{new developments in the}} town; Marcoux said that he wanted to preserve Potton's rural character. He later {{served as president of the}} board of directors for the Centre de Sante Memphremagog in the early 2000s. In 2008, he undertook an eleven thousand kilometre bicycle journey in the United States and Canada to raise thirty-six thousand dollars for community groups in Mansonville. When he launched his mayoral campaign in 2009, he was sixty-three years old and described himself as retired. One of his first initiatives after winning the election was to help pass an initiative to bring high-speed internet to the entire community. By virtue of being the mayor of Potton, Marcoux also serves on the Memphrémagog Regional County Municipality. In March 2010, he announced an increase in the region's rural transportation services. In January 2011, he became chair of the region's local development centre.|$|E
