The FAA had recommended that the Boeing 727 TOWS be changed from a system activated by the aircraft throttles to one activated by engine pressure ratio (EPR), and while Delta owned Boeing 727s which had an EPR-activated TOWS, these were all aircraft which Delta had acquired from other airlines, and Delta did not convert its own aircraft to an EPR-activated system.
