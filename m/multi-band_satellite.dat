In this research the different types of color coordinates models are tested on the spot {{satellite images}}, to compare the performance of the two parameters. The algorithms of color coordinate transformation tested on satellite images of different sizes and types, by converting the color images from the basic RGB model to LHS, HIS, YIQ, HSV, CMY, principle component transformation (PC) and vise versa. The results shows that the YIQ model takes the smallest time than the other models, and the RGb model takes longer time, and becomes unpractical for satellite images of big size, the principle component will be more effective in <b>multi-band</b> <b>satellite</b> images (spot of 3 bands, Landsat of 7 bands), since the process will be applied to only one band, not to all the bands, in this case the transformation work well in reducing the process time, with a less performance...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} introduces new {{and simple}} techniques for suppression of multispurious passbands, which are inherent {{to the conventional}} microstrip parallel coupleline bandpass filters. In addition, the operation of harmonic suppression is analyzed using a simple model. Special {{emphasis is placed on}} the applications of several new filter designs for microstrip diplexers and multiplexers. Compact, full-duplex beam scanning antenna transceiver systems with extremely broad bandwidth have also been developed. Recent advances in broadband monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) amplifiers make the realization of extremely broadband phased-array transceiver systems possible. The ultra-wideband phased-array transceiver systems can be used in <b>multi-band</b> mobile <b>satellite</b> communication systems and wideband radars. This dissertation presents a multi-band, compact, full-duplex, beam scanning antenna transceiver system for satellite communications and two designs of ultra-wideband, low-cost radar systems as applications of the MMIC amplifiers. In addition, a multi-frequency antenna has been developed. A single-feed triple frequency microstrip patch antenna is presented as an answer to the recent demand for multi-function systems in the wireless communications. In summary, the research presented in this dissertation covers every component required to build an ultra-wideband, full-duplex beam scanning phased-array antenna transceiver. The work done in this dissertation should have many applications in the wireless communication systems and wideband radar technologies...|$|R

40|$|The {{extent of}} land {{affected}} by degradation in Uganda ranges from 20 % in relatively flat and vegetation-covered areas to 90 % {{in the eastern}} and southwestern highlands. Land degradation has adversely affected smallholder agro-ecosystems including direct damage and loss of critical ecosystem services such as agricultural land/soil and biodiversity. This study evaluated the extent of bare grounds in Nakasongola, one of the districts in the Cattle Corridor of Uganda and the yield responses of maize (Zea mays) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to different tillage methods in the district. Bare ground was determined by a supervised <b>multi-band</b> <b>satellite</b> image classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). Field trials on maize and bean grain yield responses to tillage practices used a randomized complete block design with three replications, evaluating conventional farmer practice (CFP); permanent planting basins (PPB); and rip lines, with or without fertilizer in maize and bean rotations. Bare ground coverage in the Nakasongola District was 187 km 2 (11 %) of the 1741 km 2 of arable land due to extreme cases of soil compaction. All practices, whether conventional or the newly introduced conservation farming practices in combination with fertilizer increased bean and maize grain yields, albeit with minimal statistical significance in some cases. The newly introduced conservation farming tillage practices increased the bean grain yield relative to conventional practices by 41 % in PPBs and 43 % in rip lines. In maize, the newly introduced conservation farming tillage practices increased the grain yield by 78 % on average, relative to conventional practices. Apparently, conservation farming tillage methods proved beneficial relative to conventional methods on degraded soils, with the short-term benefit of increasing land productivity leading to better harvests and food security...|$|E
40|$|Open {{access to}} {{satellite}} data has boosted {{the development of}} new approaches to quantify and understand Earth's changes. The large spatiotemporal availability of satellite imagery, for example, has improved our capability to map and monitor land use and land cover changes over vast areas. Given the open availability of large image data sets, the Earth Observation community would get much benefit from methods that are openly available, reproducible and comparable. This paper presents the R package dtwSat, which provides an implementation of the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) method for land cover mapping using sequences of <b>multi-band</b> <b>satellite</b> images. Methods based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) are suitable to handle irregularly sampled and out-of-phase time series, which is frequently the case of those from remote sensing. TWDTW algorithm has achieved significant results using MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel- 2 time series to classify natural vegetation and crop types in different regions. Using existing R packages as building blocks dtwSat supports the full cycle of land cover classification using satellite time series, ranging from selecting temporal patterns to visualizing and assessing the results. To handle the satellite images, dtwSat uses well-known data structures from the R package raster, which offers the option to work with large raster data sets stored on disk instead of loading into memory (RAM) at once. The current version of the dtwSat package provides pixel-based time series classification, i. e., each time series is processed independently from each other, and therefore, the code is easily parallelizable. dtwSat is open source and distributed under a GNU General Public License GPL (≥ 2). A binary version is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([URL] and the development version from GitHub ([URL] Future versions of the package envisage new features to reduce border effects, increase spatial homogeneity (i. e., reduce the called 'salt and pepper effect') and improve the temporal consistency of land cover transitions. dtwSat makes it straightforward to apply and compare the TWDTW approach with other methods, contributing to rapid advance automated and semi-automated methods to analyze satellite time series...|$|E
40|$|Tropical Storm Debby brought severe {{flooding}} to {{portions of}} southwestern Florida {{during the summer}} of 2012. Remotely-sensed images were collected to document the flooding and test the results of Hydrologic and Hydraulic (H & H) storm water models constructed by the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). One image, a <b>satellite,</b> <b>multi-band</b> SPOT image was provided to the SWFWMD by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This image was collected within 48 h of the storm event. The SWFWMD also contracted for a very high resolution (60 cm Ground Sample Distance (GSD)) fCIR image to be captured for selected watersheds in Citrus, Hernando and Pasco counties, the areas most impacted by the flooding. Modeled floodplain results were compared to remotely-sensed images that were georeferenced and analyzed using remote sensing techniques. The higher resolution fCIR images more clearly identified flooding for better comparison with modeled results. Although the fCIR images, which were collected three to four days after the storm event, under predicted the overall extent of the modeled floodplain, as the images could not confirm the presence of flooding in areas obscured by dense vegetation, they did consistently confirm both the location and shape of flooding simulated by the model. By using image analysis methods on the Near-Infrared (NIR) band of the fCIR image in conjunction with the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), however, it was possible to identify the extent of flooding in those obscured areas. Field surveys of high water elevations indicated that many locations had receded within hours of the storm event, limiting the ability of the fCIR image from capturing peak flood level in all areas. Overall, these remotely-sensed images provided a good validation of predicted flood levels for a design storm of the magnitude of Tropical Storm Debby...|$|R
