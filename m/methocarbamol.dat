25|$|Spasmolytics such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and <b>methocarbamol</b> are {{commonly}} prescribed for {{low back pain}} or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome. However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants. Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs. In general, no high-quality evidence supports their use. No drug {{has been shown to}} be better than another, and all of them have adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness. Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs, especially if increased sedation is a risk, further limit their use.

50|$|<b>Methocarbamol</b> is {{a central}} muscle relaxant used to treat {{skeletal}} muscle spasms. Under the trade name Robaxin, it is marketed by Actient Pharmaceuticals in the United States and Pfizer in Canada. The mechanism of action of <b>methocarbamol</b> is currently unknown, but may involve the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. The muscle relaxant effects of <b>methocarbamol</b> are largely attributed to central depressant effects; however, peripheral effects of <b>methocarbamol</b> to prolong muscle refractory period have also been reported. As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is less than 25 USD.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methocarbamol</b> is marketed under {{different}} names when presented {{in combination with}} other active ingredients.

50|$|<b>Methocarbamol,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Robaxin, is a muscle relaxant {{commonly}} used in horses to treat muscle pain secondary to spasticity, tetanus, or tying-up. Both oral and injectable forms are on the market. Its use is regulated by many equine competitive governing bodies, since it {{is thought to have}} a CNS depressant effect and produces the metabolite guaifenesin, which is a pre-anesthetic veterinary drug. Guaifenesin has been found in the plasma of horses receiving oral, but not intravenous, <b>methocarbamol,</b> likely due to the high first-pass effect of the drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methocarbamol</b> is the {{carbamate}} of guaifenesin, {{but does}} not produce guaifenesin as a metabolite, because the carbamate bond is not hydrolyzed metabolically; metabolism is by Phase I ring hydroxylation and O-demethylation, followed by Phase II conjugation. All the major metabolites are unhydrolyzed carbamates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methocarbamol</b> {{has a high}} {{therapeutic}} index, i.e., a {{wide range}} of safe and effective dosages. Consumer (OTC) doses are in the range 3-6 g per day, while clinical doses can be as high as 24 g per day for severe conditions such as tetanus.|$|E
50|$|The active {{ingredient}} in Tylenol is paracetamol, {{also known as}} acetaminophen, a widely used over-the-counter analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).

5000|$|Meprobamate's {{mechanism}} of action is not completely known. It {{has been shown in}} animal studies to have effects at multiple sites in the central nervous system, including the thalamus and limbic system. Meprobamate binds to GABAA receptors which interrupts neuronal communication in the reticular formation and spinal cord, causing sedation and altered perception of pain. It has been shown that meprobamate has the ability to activate currents {{even in the absence of}} GABA. [...] This relatively unique property makes meprobamate exceptionally dangerous when used in combination with other GABA-mediated drugs (including alcohol). It is also a potent adenosine reuptake inhibitor (AdoRI), which is most likely responsible for its lesser degree of sedation compared to barbiturates.Related drugs include carisoprodol and tybamate (prodrugs of meprobamate), felbamate, mebutamate, and <b>methocarbamol.</b>|$|E

[...] Mephenesin was used by Dr. Bernard Ludwig and Dr. Frank Milan Berger to synthesize meprobamate, the first tranquilizer to see widespread clinical use.

40|$|Danielle Sawyer, Kathryn Gates Emergency and Critical Care Department, Advanced Critical Care and Emergency Specialty Services, Culver City, CA, USA Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe a case of severe lamotrigine toxicosis in a dog, which was successfully treated using minimal medical interventions. Case summary: A 7 -month-old male, intact, Labrador mix was evaluated because of acute onset of vomiting, rigidity, and dull mentation after ingesting lamotrigine tablets. The estimated oral dose that had been ingested was 278 mg/kg (611. 6 mg/lb). Physical examination was unremarkable other than abnormalities noted in the cardiovascular and neurological systems. Neurological examination revealed dull mentation, vertical nystagmus, four-legged extensor limb rigidity, and alligator rolling. Cardiovascular examination revealed pale pink mucous membranes and multifocal ventricular tachycardia. Intravenous (IV) fluids were started at three times maintenance (180 mL/kg/day). <b>Methocarbamol</b> (100 mg/kg [220 mg/lb], rectally) and lidocaine (2 Â mg/kg [4. 4 Â mg/lb, IV]) were administered. Twenty-four and seventy-two hours after presentation, the dog was clinically normal with no ventricular tachycardia being noted. Conclusion: Lamotrigine (6 -[2, 3 -dichlorophenyl]- 1, 2, 4 -triazine- 3, 5 -diamine) is an anticonvulsant medication used in humans, which inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels. The clinical success of this case suggests that administration of only <b>methocarbamol</b> for the neurologic effects and lidocaine for the arrhythmias, as well as supportive IV fluid therapy, could be a successful treatment strategy for dogs, even with severe lamotrigine toxicosis.
