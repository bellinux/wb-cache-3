5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} as Secretary of State by Daniel Webster. In response to concerns raised {{by one of}} the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit, Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> the treaty. Letcher brought these <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> the Mexican diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking with the blessing of the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded {{that they would not be}} able to resist such action, but still refused to accept the <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> the treaty.|$|E

5|$|Ecosystems are {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} abiotic and biotic components that function in an interrelated way. The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a <b>modification</b> <b>to</b> the two-timescale games {{studied in the}} evolution of preferences (EOP) literature. In this modification, the strategic process occurring on the long timescale is learning by an individual across his or her lifetime, not natural selection operating on genomes over multiple generations. This change to the longer timescale removes many of the formal difficulties of EOP models and allows us to show how two-timescale games can provide endogenous explanations for why humans sometimes adopt interdependent preferences and sometimes exhibit logit quantal response functions. In particular, we show that our <b>modification</b> <b>to</b> EOP explains experimental data in the Traveler 4 s Dilemma. We also use our <b>modification</b> <b>to</b> show how cooperation can arise in nonrepeated versions of the Prisoner 4 s Dilemma (PD). We then show that our <b>modification</b> <b>to</b> EOP predicts a crowding out phenomenon in the PD, in which introducing incentives to cooperate causes players to stop cooperating instead. We also use our <b>modification</b> <b>to</b> predict a tradeoff between the robustness and the benefit of cooperation in the PD...|$|R

The team also used an updated version of their engine the Peugeot A20 EV2 during the Friday practice sessions and reverted to the EV3 {{for the remainder of the}} weekend. BAR fitted their cars with a revised aerodynamic package which included new bargeboards and rear wings.|$|E

Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E
