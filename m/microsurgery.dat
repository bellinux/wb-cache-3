5|$|The first {{surgical}} {{intervention was}} performed by Norman Dott, who was a pupil of Harvey Cushing then working in Edinburgh. He introduced the wrapping of aneurysms in the 1930s, and was an early pioneer {{in the use of}} angiograms. American neurosurgeon Dr Walter Dandy, working in Baltimore, was the first to introduce clips in 1938. <b>Microsurgery</b> was applied to aneurysm treatment in 1972 in order to further improve outcomes. The 1980s saw the introduction of triple H therapy as a treatment for delayed ischemia due to vasospasm, and trials with nimodipine in an attempt to prevent this complication. In 1983, the Russian neurosurgeon Zubkov and colleagues reported the first use of transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH. The Italian neurosurgeon Dr. Guido Guglielmi introduced his endovascular coil treatment in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of <b>microsurgery</b> to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E

50|$|A Pennington clamp, {{also known}} as a Duval clamp, is a {{surgical}} clamp with a triangular eyelet. Used for grasping tissue, particularly during intestinal and rectal operations. Also used in some OB/GYN procedures, particularly caesarian section. Under the name 'Duval clamp' they are occasionally used much like a Foerster clamp to atraumatically grasp lung tissue. The clamp is named after David Geoffrey Pennington, an Australian surgeon who is a pioneer of <b>microsurgeries.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{potential}} limitations {{include the}} retrospective study design, although {{the description of}} the microanatomy was completed immediately after the operation for every case. Additionally, our data were based on the experience of a single surgeon who had performed various <b>microsurgeries,</b> thus these findings may not be applicable to inexperienced surgeons. However, the use of anatomical descriptions of all MSVs provided by a single surgeon at a single center can prevent the risk of bias with regard to the inter-surgeon variability and the learning curve. We did not evaluate the right varicocele and recurrent varicoceles, which have non-dominant patterns in the clinical setting, to avoid any potential bias.|$|R
25|$|<b>Microsurgery</b> is {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} reconstruction of missing tissues by transferring a piece of tissue to the reconstruction site and reconnecting blood vessels.

40|$|Leeching {{has enjoyed}} a good {{reputation}} in the past {{where it had been}} used in various ailments from fevers to flatulence. The present day scientists have limited its role and the leeching nowadays is being used only in <b>microsurgeries</b> to relieve the venous congestion. This study was designed to explore the possibility of revival of the leech therapy (leeching) which is still being used traditionally as therapeutic agent in various ailments. Leeching is not the outcome of the medieval period but has been in use during the times when there was no concept of the disease and medicament. The earliest clearly documented record of leeches being used for remedial purpose appears in a painting in an Egyptian Tomb of around 1500 BC. The journey of the leech therapy reached its zenith in 17 th and 18 th century AD in Europe while as during the Arab era the leeches were used medicinally but only for the bloodletting. During the 17 th and 18 th century AD there was shortage of leeches in certain European countries due to its rigorous use. During early 20 th century AD when germ theory was put forward and medical fraternity believed that every disease has its origin from germs and the era of antibacterial therapy gained a pace, the leech therapy was considered the myth of the past. It was in 1970 `s that the leech therapy was revived by only limited to the <b>microsurgeries</b> to relieve venous congestions. During the 21 st century there were certain studies when the leeches were tried in certain ailments like arthritis etc. and the Food and Drug Authority of USA (FDA) gave permission for sale and use of leeches in USA but limited its use in <b>microsurgeries</b> and plastic surgeries only. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore different diseases where the role of leech therapy can be seen and clinical trials can be started in this direction. Although the researchers in Regional Research Institute of Unani Medicine, Srinagar, Kashmir, India working under the aegis of Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine started the clinical trials for leech therapy in frost bite way back in 1999, but there are certain unexplored areas where leech therapy can prove beneficial and need is to take up the studies on other disease on larger sample size...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} shown that white light {{exposure}} during retinal <b>microsurgeries</b> is detrimental to patients. To address this problem, we present a novel device and image processing tool, which can be used to significantly reduce the amount of phototoxicity induced in the eye. Our device alternates between illuminating the retina using white and limited spectrum light, while a fully automated image processing algorithm produces a synthetic white light video by colorizing non-white light images. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that our system can provide reliable images using far less toxic light when compared to traditional systems. In addition, the method proposed in this paper may be adapted to other clinical applications in order to give surgeons more flexibility when visualizing areas of interest. ...|$|R
40|$|Magnification is an {{apparent}} increase in size especially {{by the use}} of lenses. History of the Magnification dates back to 1694 when Anton van Leewenhook constructed first compound lens microscope. Optical magnification has broadened the horizions of dentistry in general, and Periodontology, Restorative dentistry and Endodontics in particular. Various magnification systems used in dentistry include Dental Loupes & Surgical Operating Microscope. Magnification tools are utilized in routine dental practice for diagnosis, esthetically demanding prosthetic restorations, routine endodontic procedures, non- surgical periodontal procedures, periodontal plastic <b>microsurgeries,</b> implant dentistry etc for better visualization, improved treatment quality and ideal treatment ergonomics enhancing motor skills to improve surgical ability by maintaining the right posture.

25|$|Lymphaticovenous {{anastomosis}} {{was introduced}} by B. M. O'Brien and colleagues {{for the treatment of}} obstructive lymphedema in the extremities. In 2003, supermicrosurgery pioneer Isao Koshima and colleagues improved the surgery with supermicrosurgical techniques and established the new standard in reconstructive <b>microsurgery.</b> Studies involving long-term follow-up after LVA for lymphedema indicated patients showed remarkable improvement compared to conservative treatment using continuous elastic stocking and occasional pumping.|$|E
25|$|Vascularized {{lymph node}} {{transfers}} (VLNT) {{can be an}} effective treatment of the arm and upper extremity. Lymph nodes are harvested from the groin area with their supporting artery and vein and moved to the axilla (armpit). <b>Microsurgery</b> techniques connect the artery and vein to blood vessels in the axilla to provide support to the lymph nodes while they develop their own blood supply over the first few weeks after surgery.|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{surgery is}} a {{surgical}} specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration {{of the human}} body. It {{can be divided into}} two categories. The first is reconstructive surgery which includes craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, <b>microsurgery,</b> and the treatment of burns. The other is cosmetic or aesthetic surgery. While reconstructive surgery aims to reconstruct a part of the body or improve its functioning, cosmetic surgery aims at improving the appearance of it.|$|E
25|$|The A. Vassiliadis Pavilion for Advanced Surgery has 14 {{operating}} rooms of 650 sq ft each. It occupies {{the second and}} third floors of the medical center and is named for Carol Vassiliadis' $8.5 million gift on behalf of her deceased husband Alkiviadis. The pavilion is staffed by 200 surgeons and provides technology to perform surgeries not possible elsewhere in the county. These include minimally invasive surgeries to treat cancer and obesity; <b>microsurgeries</b> to restore voice, hearing, and facial function; MRI-guided gene therapy for brain cancer; heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy for abdominal cancer; spine and joint reconstruction; and robotic surgery for several cancers. The technologies at work include the region's only four intraoperative MRI machines, which allow real-time imaging of tumors and gene therapies during surgery to ensure complete treatment, as well as the nation's only Restriction Spectrum Imaging technology, which color code brain fibers to better plan for complex surgeries in advance. The area also includes three Intensive Care Units with 36 private rooms.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a novel, motorized, multi-degrees-of-freedom (DoF), microsurgical forceps tool is presented, {{which is}} based on a {{master-slave}} teleoperation architecture. The slave device is a 7 -DoF manipulator with: (i) 6 -DoF positioning and orientation, (ii) 1 open/close gripper DoF; and (iii) an integrated force/torque sensor for tissue grip-force measurement. The master device is a 7 -DoF haptic interface which teleoperates the slave device, and provides haptic feedback in its gripper interface. The combination of the device and the surgeon interface replaces the manual, hand-held device providing easy-to-use and ergonomic tissue control, simplifying the surgical tasks. This makes the system suitable to real surgical scenarios in the operating room (OR). The performance of the system was analysed through the evaluation of teleoperation control and characterization of gripping force. The new system offers an overall positioning error of less than 400 μm demonstrating its safety and accuracy. Improved system precision, usability, and ergonomics point to the potential suitability of the device for the OR and its ability to advance haptic-feedback-enhanced transoral laser <b>microsurgeries...</b>|$|R
50|$|The use of leeches {{in modern}} {{medicine}} made a small-scale comeback in the 1980s {{after years of}} decline, {{with the advent of}} <b>microsurgeries,</b> such as plastic and reconstructive surgeries. In operations such as these, problematic venous congestion can arise due to inefficient venous drainage. Sometimes, because of the technical difficulties in forming an anastomosis of a vein, no attempt is made to reattach a venous supply to a flap at all. This condition is known as venous insufficiency. If this congestion is not cleared up quickly, the blood will clot, arteries that bring the tissues their necessary nourishment will become plugged, and the tissues will die. To prevent this, leeches are applied to a congested flap, and a certain amount of excess blood is consumed before the leech falls away. The wound will also continue to bleed for a while due to the anticoagulant hirudin in the leech's saliva. The combined effect is to reduce the swelling in the tissues and to promote healing by allowing fresh, oxygenated blood to reach the area.|$|R
25|$|CO2 {{laser surgery}} is also {{another form of}} treatment. Transoral laser <b>microsurgery</b> allows {{surgeons}} to remove tumors from the voice box with no external incisions. It also allows access to tumors that are not reachable with robotic surgery. During the surgery, surgeon and pathologist work together to assess the adequacy of excision (“margin status”), minimizing the amount of normal tissue removed or damaged. This technique helps give the person as much speech and swallowing function as possible after surgery.|$|E

The hand surgery field is also practiced by orthopedic surgeons and general surgeons. Scar tissue formation after surgery can be problematic on the delicate hand, causing loss of dexterity and digit function if severe enough. There have been cases of surgery to women's hands in order to correct perceived flaws to create the perfect engagement ring photo.|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomical}} {{relation between}} the maxillary sinus and the nasolacrimal duct has gained greater importance {{with the advent of}} <b>microsurgeries</b> and endoscopic-assisted sinonasal procedures, and the growing use of endonasal surgery to perform middle meatus procedures and transnasal dacryocystorhinostomy. We did not find reports on maxillary sinus classification concerning its lacrimal recess, nor how often it is found. Objective: To assess how frequent the lacrimal recess {{can be found in the}} maxillary sinuses of dissected anatomical specimens. Method: We assessed 31 half-heads from cadavers. We dissected the area corresponding to the middle third of the face, by lateral access so as to be able to observe the most lateral portion of the nasolacrimal duct vis-à-vis the maxillary sinus. The maxillary sinuses were assessed by two examiners simultaneously, getting to a consensus in relation to the type of nasolacrimal duct. Results: We assessed 18 maxillary sinuses of the lateral type (58. 1 %) and 13 anterior sinuses (41. 9 %). The difference in frequency of the anterior type of maxillary type of the right side (35. 7 %) and left (47. 1 %) did not have statistical significance (p = 0. 524). Conclusion: We found a frequency of 41. 9 % of lacrimal recesses in the maxillary sinuses...|$|R
40|$|The chick Early B-cell Factor- 2 and 3 (cEbf 2 and cEbf 3) {{genes are}} members of EBF family of helix loop helix {{transcription}} factors. The expression, regulation and importance of these genes have been extensively studied in lymphatic, nervous and muscular tissues. Recently, a new role for some members of EBF in bone development has been investigated. However, the expression profile and regulation in the axial skeleton precursor, the somite, {{have yet to be}} elucidated. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the expression and regulation of cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 genes in the developing chick embryo somite from HH 4 to HH 28. The spatiotemporal expression study revealed predominant localization of cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 in the lateral sclerotomal domains and later around vertebral cartilage anlagen of the arch and the proximal rib. Subsequently, <b>microsurgeries,</b> ectopic gene expression experiments were performed to analyze which tissues and factors regulate cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 expression. Lateral barriers experiments indicated the necessity for lateral signal(s) in the regulation of cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 genes. Results from tissue manipulations and ectopic gene expression experiments indicate that lateral plate-derived Bmp 4 signals are necessary for the initiation and maintenance of cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 genes in somites. In conclusion, cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 genes are considered as lateral sclerotome markers which their expression is regulated by Bmp 4 signals from the lateral plate mesoderm...|$|R
40|$|Vasoepididymostomy (VE), as {{the most}} {{challenging}} procedure in <b>microsurgeries,</b> is often carried out with a double-armed two-suture technique. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the single-armed two-suture VEs on humans and studied the factors that could possibly affect the patency rates. From July 2012 to July 2013, we reviewed 81 patients with consecutive primary epididymal obstruction who underwent single-armed two-suture longitudinal intussusception microsurgical VEs by a single surgeon, Kai Hong (KH). At the same time, we analyzed seven factors that possibly related to the patency rates. With the single-armed technique, a total of 81 men underwent the microsurgical VEs. Data on 62 patients were completely recorded. 19 patients were lost to follow-up. Mean age was 31 years old. Mean follow-up time was 8. 8 (2 - 17) months. The patency rate was 66. 1 % (41 / 62). Natural pregnancy rate was 34. 1 % (14 / 41). Overall pregnancy rate was 22. 6 % (14 / 62). No severe surgical complications were noted. With logistic regression test analysis, there were two factors related to a higher patency rate: anastomosis sites (P = 0. 035) and motile sperm found in the epididymal fluid (P = 0. 006). Motile sperm found in the epididymal fluid were associated with a higher patency rate (OR = 11. 80, 95 % CI = 1. 79, 77. 65). The single-armed two-suture longitudinal VE technique is feasible for microsurgical practice. The patency and pregnancy rates are comparable to the doubled-armed technique. Anastomosis sites and motile sperm found in the epididymal fluid were the most two important factors related to higher patency...|$|R
25|$|Clinical studies {{involving}} LVA indicate {{immediate and}} long-term results showed significant reductions in volume and improvement in systems {{that appear to}} be long-lasting.

25|$|After {{the socialist}} revolution, the life {{expectancy}} for all age groups went up. This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system. These improvements continued into the 1960s, when {{the life expectancy}} in the Soviet Union surpassed that of the United States. It remained stable during most years, although in the 1970s, it went down slightly, possibly because of alcohol abuse. At the same time, infant mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on this. This trend can be partly explained {{by the number of}} pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was highest, while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union. The USSR had several centers of excellence, such as the Fyodorov Eye <b>Microsurgery</b> Complex, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov.|$|E

40|$|Advances {{in surgery}} {{have had a}} {{significant}} impact on cancer treatment and management. Recurrence, however, is still a major issue, and is often associated with incomplete tumour removal. Thus far, histopathological examination is still the “gold standard” for assessing tumour resection completeness. However, it is operator-dependent and too slow for intraoperative use. Recently developed endomicroscopy techniques enable the acquisition of high resolution images at a cellular level in situ, in vivo, thus significantly extending the information content available intraoperatively. The miniaturised imaging probes incorporate flexible fibre bundles and allow the ease of integration with surgical instruments. However, manual control of these probes is challenging, particularly in terms of maintaining consistent tissue contact and performing large area surveillance of complex, deformable, 3 D structures. This thesis explores the use of surgical robots and robotically-assisted probe manipulation to provide stable, precise, consistent and dexterous manipulation of endomicroscopy probes for surgical applications. Following a discussion of image enhancement techniques, a first approach towards robotically-assisted probe manipulation using existing surgical robotic platforms is demonstrated in the form of multi-purpose, pick-up probes. They also incorporate novel force adaptive mechanisms for consistent tissue contact. The development of bespoke, mechatronically-enhanced robotic devices is then presented. Firstly, a handheld robotic scanning device is proposed for breast conserving surgery, allowing accurate, high speed scanning over wide deformable tissue areas. An energy delivery fibre is integrated into the scanning mechanism for image-guided ablation or intraoperative marking of tumour margins. Secondly, a dexterous 5 -degree-of-freedom robotic instrument is proposed for use in endoluminal <b>microsurgeries.</b> The instrument offers increased flexibility and by using a master-slave control scheme, we demonstrate how efficient, large area scanning over curved endoluminal surfaces can be performed. Finally, the fusion of ultrasound imaging with endomicroscopy is investigated through the development of a robotically-actuated articulated instrument for multi-modality image fusion.

40|$|Biological {{applications}} have {{a limitation}} of creating tissue like structures in order to mimic the advanced real like structures, such as human tissues in a small scale. Conventional methods of using lab mice for cancer behavior have limitations due to observation complications. Fabricating an artificial human tissue which can behave similar to a human body tissue consists of components, such as Laminin and Collagen. Collagen in human tissue has elements, such as integrin and serum. Creating serum based proteins are somewhat challenging due to the conditional requirements. This particular approach will address the primary {{state of the art}} technique of observing the interaction with cells by mimicking the organs on a chip with blood circulation using a micro-fluidic pump. Bio-material hydrogel structures implanted on a silicon polymer based chip described in this thesis will overcome the limitations of in-vitro analysis. Water purification has become a vital issue in developing countries of the world. Water pollution due to Ammonia {{has been one of the}} major concerns with industrial revolution. Purifications were mainly done by chemical methods that can cause human health concerns. The analytically demonstrated method in this thesis using bio-compatible hydrogel will address a new dimension to the water conservation method without causing health issues and eliminating the environmental pollution due to complicated degradable structures. Filtration and efficiency are among the main concerns of using bacteria types such as AOB/NOB directly without encapsulating. Application of using bio-compatible hydrogel based dual encapsulated single pallet structure described in this thesis will address the issue of filtering capability. Pallets can be removed once nitrified, without letting it grow inside the water contaminating aqua based living breads and plants. The process will improve the efficiency of Ammonia removal due to encapsulation. Drug delivery using micro locomotives in neuro-surgery has become one of the future concerns with the development of science. Conventional delivery systems such as vaccines and open surgeries take longer response time once surgeries become more complex. Moreover there is a risk factor of injuring healthy nerves in the organ. Drug delivery approaches of drug encapsulated microspheres and drug embedded nematodes described in this thesis become more applicable to complex scenarios. Nematodes become useful in the future of <b>microsurgeries,</b> as many biologists are focusing on using their healthy nerves to implant in humans. Therefore, such applications like magnetizing nematodes help move locomotives to targeted locations and capture scan images for future medical approaches...|$|R

2500|$|These {{improvements}} in surgical techniques have allowed many tumours to be resected (removed) [...] by transoral (through the mouth) surgical approaches (TOS), using transoral endoscopic {{head and neck}} surgery (HNS). Consequently surgery became used more, increasing to 35% of cases by 2012. This approach has proven safety, efficacy and tolerability, and includes two main minimally invasive techniques, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser <b>microsurgery</b> (TLM). No direct comparisons of these two techniques have been conducted, and clinical trials in head and neck cancer such as ECOG 3311 allow either. They are associated with substantial postoperative morbidity, depending on extent of resection but compared to older techniques have shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, less pain, and less need for gastrostomy or tracheostomy, and less long term effects, which are minimal {{in the absence of}} postoperative radiation (RT), or chemoradiation (CRT). TORS has the practical advantage that angled telescopes and rotating robotic surgical arms provide better line of sight. Outcomes of minimally invasive procedures also compare favourably with more invasive ones. In early stage disease, including involvement of neck nodes, TORS produces a 2-year survival of 80–90%. TLM similarly, is reported to have a five-year survival of 78% and local control rates of 85–97%. In addition to early disease, minimally invasive surgery has been used in advanced cases, with up to 90% local control and disease specific survival. Postoperative swallowing was excellent in 87%, but long term dysphagia was associated with larger (T4) cancers, especially if involving the base of the tongue.|$|E
