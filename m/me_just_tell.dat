I said, 'Did you wake <b>me</b> up <b>just</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this?' As it turns out, two sticks is the number 11. A dash is a dash. And cake with a stick down is the number nine.

"By Heaven," [...] says Jack, {{sitting up}} on the bed, with his eyes glaring, [...] "I have a great mind, Florac, to wring your infernal little neck, and to fling {{you out of the}} window.

60|$|You may {{easily see}} that {{although}} we obtained from water {{twice as much}} in volume of the hydrogen as of oxygen, {{it does not follow}} that we have twice as much in weight--because one is heavy, and the other a very light gas. We have means of weighing gases or air; but without stopping to explain, that, let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> you what their respective weights are. The weight of a pint of hydrogen is three-quarters of a grain; the weight of the same quantity of oxygen is nearly twelve grains. This is a very great difference. The weight of a cubit foot of hydrogen is one-twelfth of an ounce; and the weight of a cubit foot of oxygen is one ounce and a third. And so on we might come to masses of matter which may be weighed in the balance, and which we can take account of as to hundredweights and as to tons, as you will see almost immediately.|$|E

Letitia has two thousand a year, {{and so has}} Margaret, from their mother. Margaret's husband, who is a decent fellow, won't touch her money and makes her an allowance, so that nearly all her two thousand, and all of Letitia's, except the few ha'pence she spends on clothes, go to keeping an establishment together. Reginald has sold every scrap of land he could, years ago. Mandeleys is the only estate he has left, and there isn't a square yard of that that isn't mortgaged to the very fullest extent. It's always a scramble between his poor devils of lawyers and himself, whether there's a little margin to be {{got out of the}} rents after paying the interest. If there is, it goes, I believe, towards satisfying the claims of a lady down at Battersea." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an October 19, 2010, {{debate at}} the Widener University School of Law in Wilmington, O'Donnell {{challenged}} Coons {{on the topic}} of {{the separation of church and}} state, asking, [...] "Where in the Constitution is separation of church and state?" [...] After laughter from the audience, Coons responded, [...] "The First Amendment establishes the separation and the fact that the federal government shall not establish any religion, and decisional law by the Supreme Court over many, many decades clarifies and enshrines that there is a separation of church and state that our courts and laws must respect." [...] O'Donnell replied, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> clarify. You're <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> that separation of church and state is found in the First Amendment?" [...] To which Coons said, [...] "Government shall make no establishment of religion," [...] a slight misquotation of the text of the First Amendment: [...] "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." [...] O'Donnell asked, [...] "That's in the First Amendment?" ...|$|R

[...] Bollywood Hungama wrote [...] "Frankly, watching YEH LAMHE JUDAAI KE is akin to watching two films within one film.
