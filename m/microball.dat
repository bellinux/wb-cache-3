They are prospective candidates for friction reduction in microelectromechanical system (MEMS), {{as well as for}} providing stable, robust support for moving micromechanisms. The characteristics of rolling element bearings need to be investigated to facilitate their applications in MEMS. It is well understood that the measured data on the macroscale cannot be directly applied to the microscale.

This {{is the first}} demonstration of a rotary micromachine with a robust mechanical support provided by microball-bearing technology. A six-phase bottom-drive variable-capacitance micromotor (φ = 14 mm) is designed and simulated using the finite-element (FE) method. The stator and the rotor are fabricated separately on silicon substrates and assembled with the microballs. Three layers of low-k benzocyclobutene polymer, two layers of gold, and a silicon <b>microball</b> housing are fabricated on the stator. <b>Microball</b> housing and salient structures (poles) are etched in the rotor and are coated with a silicon carbide film that reduces the friction without which the operation was not possible.

This is 44 {{times higher than the}} velocity previously demonstrated for linear micromotors supported on the <b>microball</b> bearings. A noncontact method is developed to extract the torque and the bearing coefficient of friction through dynamic response measurements. The torque is indirectly measured to be − 5. 62 ± 0. 5 µN · m at ± 150 -V excitation which is comparable with the FE simulation results predicting − 6. 75 µN · m.

30|$|In {{the past}} 10 years, with the {{important}} role of microdevices in industrial applications, fabrication technologies on the micron and nanometer scales are attracting more attentions. Recently, developed lithographic technologies like ion beam, electron beam, and near-field optics have been investigated and regarded as potential methods for microfabrication[1 – 4]. Due to the light diffraction limit, traditional laser optical manufacture is not available to fabricate the further microsturctures[5]. Many groups offered approaches to overcome the limit by using near-field effects through surface pattern designs. These are carried out by delivering a laser beam through a near-field tip or illuminating the tip with a pulsed laser. Huang et al. used single-pulse 248 nm KrF laser radiation to fabricate nano bump arrays[6]. Hong et al. reported that femtosecond laser (400 nm, 100 fs) irradiation went through a near-field scanning optical microscope and sub- 50 nm feature size was created[7]. The near-field enhanced laser irradiation with 248 and 355 nm UV lasers was applied to pattern a silicon surface in a massively parallel fashion[8]. However, these approaches need the expensive equipment with the related complex system. Zhang et al. used a 248 nm excimer laser with a pulse duration of 23 ns and obtained 100 nm hillocks at the original particle positions[4]. These glass <b>microballs</b> can only be used for processing micro-dimple structures. Zhou et al. also tried a low-cost method, in which an optical fiber was used as a focusing unit to etch parallel microgrooves with 2 to 6 μm width and 0.7 to 1.4 μm depth on Si surface[9]. This resolution still needed to be improved to overcome the diffraction limit. Meanwhile, it is necessary for the micro and nanofabrication to develop the low-cost and fast speed laser processing[10]. To further reduce the resolution to the nanometer scale, methods of near-field laser irradiation with the combination of advanced processing tools such as SPM, NSOM, transparent, and metallic particles are applied for the sizes as small as 20 nm. Laser interference lithography is also capable of fabricating sub- 100 nm periodic structures for large area, maskless, and noncontact nanofabrications[7]. In this work, we report a low-cost microprocessing technique, based on a microfiber-enhanced irradiation to fabricate groove structures under the diffraction limit.|$|R

It also has got considerable importance for pretransfusion testing of patients and for immunohematologic testing of blood donors. Immunohematology was the last among all medical laboratories into which automation was introduced. The use of robust techniques made it possible. These techniques are column agglutination carried out on gel or on glass <b>microballs</b> and solid phase technique. The latest method is Erytrocytes Magnetizer technology {{and it is not}} so widespread yet. The aim of this thesis is practical performance of immunohematologic methods blood group,antibody screening. Tube testing,testing on microtiter plates and using column agglutination. Manual performance was compared with Qasar and Techno analyzers. Other aims were quantitative description of reagent saving,human labor force and to assess other effects which are more sensitive methods,greater safety and exclusion of possible mistake during the automated testing process. The theoretical part deals with particular tests and their possible performance techniques. Automation contributes to minimize possible risks. Automation reduces process steps,the need for worker intervention and exponentially decreases the number of potential mistakes. Introduction of automation also helps to standardize procedures and reagents to increase reliability,result interpretation and results of the tested process. On top of that automation is useful for generation of reliable results,their objective interpretation,better documentation,monitoring and traceability and labour force saving. It brings security not only to patients but also to medical workers. Inseparable necessities are space conditions and device service. The practical part of this thesis was performed in the Blood Bank Department of Hospital České Budějovice. Samples examined in this thesis included 24 patient samples, 24 blood donor samples and 2 samples for inner quality control. In all 50 samples blood group was tested manually in test tubes and on microtiter plates. Antigen screening was tested in test tubes,on microtiter plates and using column agglutination. Patient samples were analysed using Techno analyser and blood donor samples were analysed using semiautomatic machine Qasar. 10 slightly positive screenings of patient antigens(previously tested using Techno analyser) and 10 positive screenings of blood donor antigens(previously tested using semiautomatic machine Qasar) were manually tested again in test tubes and on microtiter plates during 2013. It was found out that both manual and automatic testing give same results. Only in manual testing of antibody screening in test tube the reaction in both positive testing Basic QC,was a bit smaller which is caused by lower sensitivity of the test tube method. In antibody screening the quantitative saving of reagents in column agglutination is bigger when tested both manually and with the use of both analysers than when tested in test tube. Concerning the difficulty,longwindedness and especially lower sensitivity of tube testing,the decision not to use this method was a correct choice. This comparison confirms assessments described above and also the correctness of decision to use column agglutination for antibody screening tests. Different time consumption of testing of particular samples gave possibility for simple quantitative calculation of human labour force saving. It gave clear result saving of 2 human labour forces thanks to each analyser. Individual steps during testing are shown in table and the chance of bringing the possibility of a mistake. Manual testing includes possibility of making a mistake in all mentioned critical moments of testing.

The complexes have been characterized by m. p, elemental analyses, FT-IR, TG/DTG and single crystal X-ray analysis. The precursors (1), (2) and (3) were applied as a single source for the fabrication of CuO- 2 TiO 2 and CoTiO 3 -TiO 2 composites and MgTi 2 O 5 solid solution thin films, whereas film precursor (4) has been applied as a dual source along with Ag(I) acetate for the deposition of Ag-Mn 2 O 3 composite thin film by aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD). The electric field directed aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition technique (EFDAACVD) was used to make thin films of SnO 2, Mn 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, NiO, CuO, ZnO, CdO and PbO from precursor (5) and their respective acetates. Further CuPbI 3 was synthesized by heating co-precipitated mixture of copper(I) iodide and lead(II) iodide in an evacuated Pyrex ampule at 630 oC. The films of CuPbI 3 were decorated by electrophoretic deposition method. The phase purity, particle size and crystallinity of deposited thin films were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Raman spectroscopy, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to investigate the oxidation states, electronic structure, surface morphology, shape and elemental composition of the involved elements.

The applicability of fabricated CuO- 2 TiO 2 and CoTiO 3 –TiO 2 composite electrodes in electrochemical sensors has been investigated towards the sensitive and selective detection of NO 2 − ions and dopamine (DA), respectively. The CuO- 2 TiO 2 electrode showed the limit of detection (LoD) of 16. 6 nM with the linear range of 10 to 200 μM at + 1. 0 V due to the oxidation of NO 2 − ions. The CoTiO 3 –TiO 2 electrode showed good electrocatalytic activity for DA with the (LoD) of 0. 083 μM and a linear range of 20 to 300 μM. The SnO 2 micro balls provide unique network pores that could be easily penetrated by the electrolyte to give high reversible recycling stability for application in lithium ion batteries.

The improved photoelectrochemical behaviour of Ag-Mn 2 O 3, MgTi 2 O 5, Mn 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, NiO, CuO, ZnO, CdO, PbO and CuPbI 3 electrodes was attributed to the increased photon absorption ability, increased surface area, and more efficient electron/hole transfer which were confirmed by LSV, Chronoamperometery, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Mott‐Schottky plot...|$|R
40|$|The design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of a rotary micromotor supported on <b>microball</b> bearings {{are reported in}} this dissertation. This is the first demonstration of a rotary micromachine with a robust mechanical support provided by microball-bearing technology. One key challenge in the realization of a reliable micromachine, which is successfully addressed in this work, {{is the development of}} a bearing that would result in high stability, low friction, and high resistance to wear. A six-phase, rotary, bottom-drive, variable-capacitance micromotor is designed and simulated using the finite element method. The geometry of the micromotor is optimized based on the simulation results. The development of the rotary machine is based on studies of fabrication and testing of linear micromotors. The stator and rotor are fabricated separately on silicon substrates and assembled with the stainless steel microballs. Three layers of low-k benzocyclobutene (BCB) polymer, two layers of gold, and a silicon <b>microball</b> housing are fabricated on the stator. The BCB dielectric film, compared to conventional silicon dioxide insulating films, reduces the parasitic capacitance between electrodes and the stator substrate. The <b>microball</b> housing and salient structures (poles) are etched in the rotor and are coated with a silicon carbide film to reduce friction. A characterization methodology is developed to measure and extract the angular displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, mechanical power, coefficient of friction, and frictional force through non-contact techniques. A top angular velocity of 517 rpm corresponding to the linear tip velocity of 324 mm/s is measured. This is 44 times higher than the velocity achieved for linear micromotors supported on <b>microball</b> bearings. Measurement of the transient response of the rotor indicated that the torque is 5. 62  0. 5 micro N-m which is comparable to finite element simulation results predicting 6. 75 micro N-m. Such a robust rotary micromotor can be used in developing micropumps which are highly demanded microsystems for fuel delivery, drug delivery, cooling, and vacuum applications. Micromotors can also be employed in micro scale surgery, assembly, propulsion, and actuation...|$|E
40|$|The {{demonstration}} and characterization {{of a novel}} planar-contact encapsulated <b>microball</b> bearing using a radial in-flow microturbine are presented. Stable operation of the air-driven silicon microturbine is shown for over 1 000 000 revolutions at speeds, pressure drops, and flow rates of up to 10 000 r/min, 0. 45 lbf/in 2, and 3. 5 slm, respectively. Incorporation of a gas thrust plenum using a novel packaging scheme has enabled comprehensive spin-down friction characterization of the encapsulated <b>microball</b> bearing. An empirical power-law model for dynamic friction has been developed for speeds of 250 - 5000 r/min and loads of 10 - 50 mN, corresponding to torques of 0. 0625 - 2. 5 muNldrm and friction torque constants of 2. 25 - 5. 25 x 10 [superscript - 4] muNldrm/ r/min.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} development of an integrated electromagnetic micro-turbo-generator supported on encapsulated <b>microball</b> bearings for electromechanical power conversion in MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems) scale. The device is composed of a silicon turbine rotor with magnetic materials that is supported by microballs over a stator with planar, multi-turn, three-phase copper coils. The micro-turbo-generator design exhibits a novel integration of three key technologies and components, namely encapsulated <b>microball</b> bearings, incorporated thick magnetic materials, and wafer-thick stator coils. Encapsulated <b>microball</b> bearings provide a robust supporting mechanism that enables a simple operation and actuation scheme with high mechanical stability. The integration of thick magnetic materials allows for a high magnetic flux density within the stator. The wafer-thick coil design optimizes the flux linkage and decreases the internal impedance of the stator for a higher output power. Geometrical design and device parameters are optimized based on theoretical analysis and finite element simulations. A microfabrication process flow was designed using 15 optical masks and 110 process steps to fabricate the micro-turbo-generators, which demonstrates the complexity in device manufacturing. Two 10 pole devices with 2 and 3 turns per pole were fabricated. Single phase resistances of 46 &# 8486; and 220 &# 8486; were measured for the two stators, respectively. The device was actuated using pressurized nitrogen flowing through a silicon plumbing layer. A test setup was built to simultaneously measure the gas flow rate, pressure, rotor speed, and output voltage and power. Friction torques in the range of 5. 5 - 33 µNm were measured over a speed range of 0 - 16 krpm (kilo rotations per minute) within the <b>microball</b> bearings using spin-down testing methodology. A maximum per-phase sinusoidal open circuit voltage of 0. 1 V was measured at 23 krpm, and a maximum per-phase AC power of 10 µW was delivered on a matched load at 10 krpm, which are in full-agreement with the estimations based on theoretical analysis and simulations. The micro-turbo-generator presented in this work is capable of converting gas flow into electricity, and can potentially be coupled to a same-scale combustion engine to convert high-density hydrocarbon energy into electrical power to realize a high-density power source for portable electronic systems...|$|E
