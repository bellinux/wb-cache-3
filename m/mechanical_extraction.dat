The analysis concerns both spherical and sharp (pyramidal) indentations. We {{show that the}} uniaxial stress-strain curves inferred from hardness measurements in single crystalline units of material are coincidental with those attained under true uniaxial loadings along specific crystalline orientations. Landmark hardness relations that were originally developed for power-law strain hardening polycrystalline aggregates are extended to single-crystal indentations. <b>Mechanical</b> property <b>extractions</b> in crystals violating power-law hardening because of a marked critical resolved shear stress and/or extreme strain hardening saturation are subsequently addressed. The analysis is pertinent to the assessment of multiple-glide deformation stage-II and strain hardening saturation stage-III of cubic single crystals from indentation experiments.

Other possibilities are vacuum drying, where heat is supplied by conduction or radiation (or microwaves), while the vapor thus produced is removed by the vacuum system. Another indirect technique is drum drying (used, for instance, for manufacturing potato flakes), where a heated surface is used to provide the energy, and aspirators draw the vapor outside the room.

40|$|A {{number of}} extra-virgin olive oils were {{obtained}} by <b>mechanical</b> <b>extractions</b> from different Sicilian olive cultivars. High field NMR analyses showed, as expected, that the major components of the extra-virgin oils were triglycerides. The measurements of the proton longitudinal relaxation times (T 1) revealed that triglycerides were ellipsoidal-shaped. In fact, a multi-exponential mathematical model was applied to fit all the decay data from the classical inversion recovery experiments, thereby leading {{to the conclusion that}} anisotropic relaxation mechanisms arise into the triglycerides. Low field NMR experiments revealed two different components of the longitudinal relaxation times. The shortest T 1 value was attributed to an intra-molecular spin diffusion, whereas the longest T 1 was assigned to inter-molecular spin diffusion mechanisms. According to such hypothesis, it has been concluded that triglycerides in extra-virgin olive oils are assembled in contiguous supramolecular blocks. The present study showed {{for the first time that}} the combined use of different NMR techniques can be very helpful for obtaining information on the conformational assessment of natural systems such as extra-virgin oils. This is an important research issue in order to evaluate structure-activity properties of food materials which are recognised to have very relevant nutritional implications...|$|R

50|$|Cottonseed meal is a {{good source}} of protein. The two types of meal {{extraction}} processes are solvent extraction and <b>mechanical</b> <b>extraction.</b> Most of the meal is extracted mechanically through cottonseed kernels. The flaked cottonseed kernels are put into high pressure through a screw inside a barrel which is constantly revolving. The screw pushes out the oil through the openings made in the barrel. The dry pieces left in the barrel are preserved and ground into meal. During the solvent extraction process, the cottonseed kernels are subjected to fine grinding by pushing them through an expander and then the solvent is used to extract most of the oil. The solvent-extracted meals have a lower fat content of 0.5% than the mechanically extracted meals with a fat content of 2.0%. Cottonseed meal is considered to have more arginine than soybean meal. Cottonseed meal can be used in multiple ways: either alone or by mixing it with other plant and animal protein sources.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{steel drum}} mills the {{grinding}} process takes about 20 minutes. After grinding, the paste is stirred slowly for another 20 to 30 {{minutes in a}} particular container (malaxation), where the microscopic oil drops unite into bigger drops, which facilitates the <b>mechanical</b> <b>extraction.</b> The paste is then pressed by centrifugation/ the water is thereafter separated from {{the oil in a}} second centrifugation as described before.The oil produced by only physical (mechanical) means as described above is called virgin oil. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria (low free acidity, no or very little organoleptic defects). A higher grade extra virgin olive oil is mostly dependent on favourable weather conditions; a drought during the flowering phase, for example, can result in a lower quality (virgin) oil. It is worth noting that olive trees produce well every couple of years so greater harvests occur in alternate years (the year in-between is when the tree yields less). However the quality is still dependent on the weather.|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} the <b>extraction</b> of <b>mechanical</b> properties from instrumented indentation P-h(s) curves via extensive three-dimensional finite element analyses for pyramidal tips {{in a wide}} range of solids under frictional and frictionless contact conditions. Since the topography of the imprint changes with the level of pile-up or sink-in, a relationship is identified between correction factor beta in the elastic equation for the unloading indentation stage and the amount of surface deformation effects. It is shown that the presumption of a constant beta significantly affects <b>mechanical</b> property <b>extractions.</b> Consequently, a new best-fit function is found for the correlation between penetration depth ratios h(e) /h(max), h(r) /h(max) and n, circumventing the need for the assumption of a constant value for beta, made in our prior investigation [Acta Mater. 53 (2005) pp. 3545 - 3561]. Simulations under frictional contact conditions provide sensible boundaries for the influence of friction on both h(e) /h(max) and h(r) /h(max).

40|$|The {{extraction}} of vegetable oil from Jatropha from the Tanzanian variety with a fat content of 33. 84  ±  2. 58 % and a moisture content of 5. 4  ±  1. 97 %, was made using two methods: {{the traditional and}} the <b>mechanical</b> <b>extraction</b> method. The traditional consists in extracting the oil from the paste using boiling water as a solvent. While the mechanical consists of directly pressing the seeds of Jatropha using a ram press called Bielenberg press, to extract the oil contained in the seeds dried or heated before. The net yield of oil extraction by the traditional method was 22. 02  ±  2. 1 %, with a oil cake percentage of 67. 02  ±  3. 3 % and the ratio water/paste in mass adopted was 0. 36. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>extraction</b> has an average raw yield of 26. 15  ±  2. 74 %, with a recovery rate of 74. 71 %. After decanting for 10 days and filtration, the net yield was 15. 39  ±  2. 82 % with a decantation and filtration rate of 58. 67  ±  7. 24 %. The oil produced by traditional method has a water and volatile content of 1. 01  ±  0. 05 % and a density of 0. 884. The one produced by <b>mechanical</b> <b>extraction</b> has 0. 19  ±  0. 09 % and a density of 0. 891. The result of combustion test using two burners and one stove showed that the combustion rates were: 0. 177  ±  0. 034  g/min for the burner using one flame and 1. 06  ±  0. 04  g/min for the six flame burner and finally 3. 07  ±  0, 4  g/min for the ten-flame stove. This ten-flame stove allowed 3  L of water to be boiled at 100  °C for 32  min, although during combustion it was observed a release of black fumes which indicates incomplete combustion with Jatropha in this Stove.
