Many of the findings and techniques from census research may prove valuable in making a transition, which many governments have publicly endorsed, from single-species fisheries management to more holistic ecosystem management. Census researchers sampled continental margins, <b>mid-Atlantic</b> <b>ridges,</b> ocean floor vents and seeps, and abyssal plains and polar seas and organized massive amounts of past and new information in a public online database called the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (www. iobis. org). The census described and categorized seamount biology worldwide for its vulnerability to fishing, advanced large-scale animal tracking with acoustic arrays and satellite archival tags, and accelerated species identification, including nearshore, coral reef, and zooplankton sampling using genetic barcoding and pyrotag sequencing for microbes and helped to launch the exciting new field of marine environmental history.

40|$|The Lau Integrated Study Site (ISS) has {{provided}} unique opportunities for study of ridge processes {{because of its}} back-arc setting in the southwestern Pacific. Its location allows study of a biogeographical province distinct from those of eastern Pacific and <b>mid-Atlantic</b> <b>ridges,</b> and crustal compositions along the ridge lie outside the range of mid-ocean ridge crustal compositions. The Lau ISS is located above a subduction zone, at an oblique angle. The underlying mantle receives water and other elements derived from the downgoing lithospheric slab, {{with an increase in}} slab influence from north to south. Water lowers the mantle melting temperature and leads to greater melt production where the water flux is greater, and to distinctive regional-scale gradients along the ridge. There are deeper faulted axial valleys with basaltic volcanism in the north and inflated axial highs with andesites in the south. Differences in igneous rock composition and release of magmatic volatiles affect compositions of vent fluids and deposits. Differences in vent fluid compositions and small-scale diffuse-flow regimes correlate with regional-scale patterns in microbial and megafaunal distributions.

50|$|The post rift phase {{followed}} late Jurassic rift events {{during the}} late Mesozoic and Cenozoic thermal subsidence. As the rifting stopped, then regional subsidence occurred creating an intracratonic sedimentary basin. Subsidence occurred due to lithosphere cooling. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before. Intraplate compression was caused when the Atlantic Ocean basin formed. the <b>Mid-Atlantic</b> spreading <b>ridge</b> has been busy separating east from west. Greenland separated from North America and the rifting altered direction during the Paleogene, which caused Northern Europe to separate from Greenland.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are the {{investigation}} of the Earth's structure and dynamics at the continental margin between the mid-Atlantic-ridge system (Mohns and Knipovich Ridges) and the Bear Island (Bjørnøya) region from its top sedimentary cover to its imprint in the upper mantle. In this region the margin includes an extremely thick sedimentary wedge and steep slopes, with at least one major paleo-fracture zone cutting through the wedge. Recent studies in this area indicate very low seismic velocities in the lithosphere and the stress field undergoes an extensional-compressional transition. It is therefore of particular interest to understand the structural architecture, the stress and the dynamics of the whole region because of its natural hazard exposure and the processes involved {{in the formation of the}} margin and the opening of the North Atlantic. To obtain such information, detailed monitoring and analysis of the seismicity between the margin and the <b>mid-Atlantic</b> <b>ridges</b> are necessary. To achieve this, deep seismic sounding data, as well as records from temporary broadband installations, supplementary to data from existing seismic stations in the region were collected. In autumn 2007, we began withseismological field experiments along the continental margin of the Barents Sea near Bear Island (Bjørnøya) and the Mohns and Knipovich Ridges. The field experiments comprise the installation and parallel operation of several seismic instruments during 2007 - 2008 such as 12 broadband Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBSs), two new broadband seismometers, a small temporary seismic array with 13 sensors and active seismicrefraction/reflection experiments along two profiles crossing the region and recorded with additional short period OBSs and land stations.

5|$|The {{frilled shark}} is aplacental viviparous; the {{developing}} embryos are mainly nourished by yolk, though {{the difference in}} weight between the egg and the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means.

Unsurprisingly, there is no defined breeding season for either sex, as this shark inhabits depths at which {{there is little to}} no seasonal influence. A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a seamount on the <b>Mid-Atlantic</b> <b>Ridge.</b> The litter size ranges from two to fifteen, with an average of six. Females ovulate eggs into the uterus about once every two weeks; vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy, apparently due to insufficient space inside the body cavity.|$|E

40|$|Hotspots – large {{volcanic}} provinces – such as Iceland, Hawaii and Yellowstone, {{are almost}} universally assumed {{to come from}} plumes of hot mantle rising from deep within the Earth. At Iceland, perhaps the best-studied hotspot on Earth, this hypothesis is inconsistent with many first-order observations, such as the lack of high temperatures, a volcanic track or a seismic anomaly in the lower mantle. The great melt production there is explained better by enhanced fertility in the mantle where the <b>mid-Atlantic</b> spreading <b>ridge</b> crosses the Caledonian suture zone. The thick crust built by the excessive melt production encourages complex, unstable, leaky microplate tectonics, which provides positive feedback by enhancing volcanism further. Such a model explains Iceland as a natural consequence of relatively shallow processes related to plate tectonics, and accounts for all the first- and second-order geophysical, geological and geochemical observations at Iceland without special pleading or invoking coincidences...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{seafloor}} spreading {{in the ocean}} basins provides a detailed record of relative motions between Earth 2 ̆ 7 s tectonic plates since Pangea breakup. Determining how tectonic plates have moved relative to the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s deep interior is more challenging. Recent studies of contemporary plate motions have demonstrated links between relative plate motion and absolute plate motion (APM), and with seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle. Here we explore the link between spreading directions and APM since the Early Cretaceous. We find a significant alignment between APM and spreading directions at mid-ocean ridges; however, the degree of alignment is influenced by geodynamic setting, and is strongest for <b>mid-Atlantic</b> spreading <b>ridges</b> between plates that are not directly influenced by time-varying slab pull. In the Pacific, significant mismatches between spreading and APM direction may relate to a major plate-mantle reorganization.

40|$|Despite {{its impact}} in {{understanding}} oceanic crust formation and eruptive styles of related volcanism, magma dynamics at midocean ridges are poorly known. Here, we propose a new method to assess ascent rates of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) magmas, {{as well as}} their pre- and sin-eruptive dynamics. It is {{based on the idea that}} a rising magma can reach a variable degree of both CO 2 supersaturation in melt and kinetic fractionation among noble gases in vesicles in relation to its ascent rate through the crust. To quantify the relationship, we have used a model of multicomponent bubble growth in MORB melts, developed by extending the single-component model of Proussevitch and Sahagian [A. A. Proussevitch, D. L. Sahagian, Dynamics and energetics of bubble growth in magmas: analytical formulation and numerical modeling, J. Geophys. Res. 103 (1998), 18223 – 18251. ] to CO 2 –He–Ar gas mixtures. After proper parameterization, we have applied it to published suites of data having the required features (glasses from Pito Seamount and <b>mid-Atlantic</b> <b>ridges).</b> Our results highlight that the investigated MORB magmas display very different ranges of ascent rates: slow rises of popping rock forming-magmas that cross the crust (0. 01 – 0. 5 m/s), slightly faster rates of energetic effusions (0. 1 – 1 m/s), up to rates of 1 – 10 m/s which fall on the edge between lava effusion and Hawaiian activity. Inside a single plumbing system, very dissimilar magma dynamics highlight the large differences in compressive stress of the oceanic crust on a small scale. Constraints on how the systems of ridges work, as well as the characteristics of the magmatic source, can also be obtained. Our model shows how measurements of both the dissolved gas concentration in melt and the volatile composition of vesicles in the same sample are crucial in recognizing the kinetic effects and definitively assessing magma dynamics. An effort should be made to correctly set the studied samples in the sequence of volcanic submarine deposits where they are collected. Enhanced knowledge of a number of physical properties of gas-bearing MOR magmas is also required, mainly noble gas diffusivities, to describe multicomponent bubble growth at a higher confidence level...|$|R

To predict subsurface mass flow patterns, temperature-dependent Newtonian rheology is considered in the finite-element models (FEM).

Low concentrations of Se, Cu and platinum-group elements (PGE) in harzburgites drilled at around 35 - 85 m below seafloor {{are consistent with the}} consumption of mantle sulfides after high degrees (> 15 - 20 %) of partial melting and redistribution of chalcophile and siderophile elements into PGE-rich residual microphases. Higher concentrations of Cu, Se, Ru, Rh and Pd in harzburgites from the uppermost and lowest cores testify to late reaction with a sulfide melt. Dunites were formed by percolation of silica- and sulfur-undersaturated melts into low-Se harzburgites. Platinum-group and chalcophile elements were not mobilized during dunite formation and mostly preserve the signature of precursor harzburgites, except for higher Ru and lower Pt contents caused by precipitation and removal of platinum-group minerals. During serpentinization at low temperature (< 250 °C) and reducing conditions, mantle sulfides experienced desulfurization to S-poor sulfides (mainly heazlewoodite) and awaruite. Contrary to Se and Cu, sulfur does not record the magmatic evolution of peridotites but was mostly added in hydrothermal sulfides and sulfate from seawater.

The profiler instrumentation payload included a high-resolution chlorophyll-a fluorimeter, a fast sampling, precision conductivity, temperature and depth sensor (CTD) and a fragile, high resolution oceanic microstructure and turbulence sensor. A bespoke guard was used to help protect the fragile microstructure and turbulence sensors from damage. The mooring surface buoy instrumentation included telemetered GPS at nominally 30 minute intervals, a backup telemetered position indication, a VHF radio beacon based position locator and a solar powered night time light. The experiment was designed to resolve time-variability of upper-ocean mixing and chlorophyll-a fluorescence over the <b>Mid-Atlantic</b> underwater <b>Ridge,</b> an internal wave generation hotspot.

In my recent visit to Iceland as the visiting lecturer for the UNU geothermal program, I was able to collect some of the more current issues. A review of the older issues and most of the new ones are described and shown below. In historical times, since AD 850 - 900, more than 250 volcanic eruptions have occurred in Iceland [...] an average of one every four years! Four volcanic events have had a major impact on Iceland, and are thus, reflected in many of their stamps: (1) Hekla, has erupted 20 times since Iceland was settled. The 1947 eruption, lasting 13 months, produced almost 800 million m 3 of lava and 210 million m 3 of tephra and sent falling ash as far away as Finland. (2) The Laki eruptions (Skaftareldur episode) in 1783 produced lava flows of 800 m 3 per second and resulted in 14 to 15 km 3 of volume covering almost 600 km 2. The gas and acid rain and the resulting pollution killed 50 % of the domestic animals and 20 % of the population in Moduhardindi (Haze Famine).

40|$|The Porcupine basin is a north-south {{trending}} graben of Jurassic age {{filled with}} Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments lying unconformably on upper Palaeozoic rocks. The basin {{formed as a}} result of an early abortive northeasterly arm of the <b>Mid-Atlantic</b> spreading <b>ridge.</b> It continues to be a subsiding basin at present time. The Connemara field is located in the northern part of the basin. Structurally, it lies at the confluence of two principal fault systems: a N-S fault regime characteristic of the main Porcupine basin, and the E-W and NE-SW trends of reactivated Caledonian faults. It can be imaged as a broad, tilted block faulted structure trending northeast-southwest, bounded by major faults to the east and west. Between these faults appears a structure broadly synclinal in section, dipping southwest, with an axis parallel to the trend of the major faults, filled of mesozoic sediments, and partly closed by the base of the Cretaceous unconformity. Hydrocarbons were found at the end of the 70 sŠ in three reservoirs within the middle Jurassic in the synclinal structure. Tight 2 D and 3 D seismic coverage over the Connemara field showed the presence of vertical paths of fluid and/or gas migrating upward in the formation. Most of these chimneys stop at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary, about 0. 1 msec TWT below the seafloor. None of them reaches the present-day surface. They are mostly located above the structural high corresponding to the tilted fault block (horst), and are found along a south-north trend starting above the N-S fault bounding the horst to the west. Some isolated chimneys were also detected in the western part of the field. Detailed interpretation of chosen seismic cross-sections throughout the field, constrained by well-logs and core analysis allowed to propose a scenario for the genesis of these features. Some of the oil generated in the middle Jurassic source rocks, further south of the Porcupine basin, migrated updip to the north where it has either become entrapped within Jurassic reservoir layers, or percolated up fault planes to shallower layers where fluid and gas could escape through the more permeable upper Cretaceous and Tertiary sandstones. Another interesting feature is the abundance of pockmarks throughout the entire field. More than 1100 were mapped from 2 D survey seismic profiles. They are known to form through the eruption of methane gas trapped in the sediments. They are proposed to be the expression at the surface of the fluid and gas that migrated from deeper parts of the basin, first through fault planes, then through the formation using more or less energetic ways (shock waves, percolation, diffusion) ...|$|R

One of the relationships concerns the fluids derived from seawater-basalt interaction processes existing in emerged rifts such as those of Iceland (Reykjanes, Svartsengi, and Seltjarnarnes geothermal fields) and Djibouti (Asal-Ghoubbet and Obock geothermal areas), or in numerous oceanic <b>ridges</b> and rises (<b>Mid-Atlantic</b> and Middle-Valley <b>ridges,</b> East Pacific rise, etc.). The best adapted Na/Li relationship for geothermal fluids discharged from emerged rifts between 0 and 365 °C is: T(K) = 920 /[log(Na/Li) − 1. 105] (r 2 = 0. 994; n = 27) where Na and Li are the aqueous concentrations of these elements given in mol/L. The other Na/Li relationship was determined using dilute waters collected from wells located in different hightemperature (200 - 325 °C) volcanic geothermal areas of Iceland (Krafla, Námafjall, Nesjavellir and Hveragerdi). This relationship can be expressed as follows: T(K) = 2002 /[log(Na/Li) + 1. 322] (r 2 = 0. 967, n= 17). These two relationships give estimations of temperature with an uncertainty close to ± 20 °C. The second Na/Li relationship was also successfully applied to HT dilute geothermal waters from the East African Rift (Ethiopia, Kenya). Some case studies in the literature and thermodynamic considerations suggest that the Na/Li ratios for this type of fluids could be controlled by full equilibrium reactions involving a mineral assemblage constituting at least albite, K-feldspar, quartz and clay minerals such as kaolinite, illite (or muscovite) and Li-micas. Unlike the Na/Li ratios, no thermometric relationship using Li isotopes could be determined for this type of water. However, it was noticed that δ 7 Li values higher than 16 ‰ are always associated with low- to medium-temperature waters...|$|R
