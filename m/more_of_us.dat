2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} with The Washington Examiner, guitarist Brian Baker {{was asked if}} Bad Religion {{was going to make}} another album after The Dissent of Man. His response was, [...] "It's all very punk [...] just like it's always been. We will record when we have enough songs. For us, it just kind of happens." [...] During the Boston show on April 29, 2011, frontman Greg Graffin said [...] "after this year you probably won't be seeing much <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> We're going to try one more album and then all join the navy, do honest work", hinting at a possible split or hiatus. In an interview at the KROQ Weenie Roast on June 4, 2011, Graffin stated that Bad Religion would record and release a new album in 2012. Bassist Jay Bentley also mentioned an early 2012 timeframe for going back into the studio in an interview at Live 105's BFD festival, which took place on the day after the Weenie Roast. In February 2012, it was reported that Brett had written two songs for the album.|$|E
