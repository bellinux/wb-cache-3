500|$|... "Baby Boy" [...] is {{considered}} to be a sequel in ways to [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde"; a 2002 Jay-Z song featuring Beyoncé. The lyrics detail a woman's fantasies, and in keeping with the album's overall theme, Beyoncé's deemed them as personal to her. Paul remarked, [...] "She's telling <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> fantasies and picturing me and her going here and there, all over the world... I'm answering back, like, 'I'm wit it'." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the toast–chorus–verse form; Sean Paul performs the toasting while Beyoncé sings all other verses and choruses. The pattern is repeated twice; a further chorus and verse follow, resolving at the toasting and final verse.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing about}} this horrific event, Chang strives to portray {{it as an}} unexamined Asian holocaust. Unfortunately, she {{undermines}} her argument—she is not a trained historian—by neglecting the wealth of sources in English and Japanese on this event. This leads her into errors such as greatly inflating the population of Nanjing (Nanking) {{at that time and}} uncritically accepting the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and contemporary Chinese figures for the numbers of Chinese civilians and soldiers killed. What particularly struck <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> argument was her attempt to charge all Japanese with refusing to accept the fact of the 'Rape of Nanking' and her condemnation of the 'persistent Japanese refusal {{to come to terms with}} its past.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Well, it wasn't {{really my}} idea ... I didn't like {{the thought of}} doing it like {{everyone}} else–maybe a mix through the back catalog and a few exclusive new tracks by some key artists... I wanted something more special. Then a while ago I met Emika, she’s making music herself on Ninja Tune. We sat together one day last summer and she told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> last visit to Berghain. It was a regular Sunday morning and she noticed how everything in the building was resonating and vibrating and swinging and humming–she realized that there were lot of sounds coming from the building itself. That led {{to the idea of}} doing field recordings within the building while it's not open to the public ... It took about two or three weeks ... It was a four gigabyte library.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2004, Vine {{said that}} she had only seen Thomson once, in an art shop, in the {{previous}} two years. She later told The Times that it was [...] "impossible to explain" [...] why she married Thomson, that he didn't [...] "give a s*** about art or the Stuckist movement", and that he saw her as a means of gaining his own publicity: [...] "When I met him and he saw some of my history, he saw dollar signs. He is a very exploitative man." [...] Thomson said she showed herself in a manner to gain the largest amount of attention or sympathy, avoided reality and created a fantasy world : [...] "Now it makes me question a lot of things she told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> past." [...] In June 2007, Vine said that the marriage was consummated in 2001, {{a few weeks after the}} ceremony—"I owed him that"—and Thomson then paid off her debts of £20,000, after which [...] "I've never seen him again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Piper starred as Hannah Baxter in Secret Diary of a Call Girl, an ITV2 {{adaptation}} of Brooke Magnanti's The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl, a memoir detailing {{the life of}} a high-class prostitute who adopted [...] "Belle de Jour" [...] as her pseudonym, which aired from September 2007. As part of her preparation for the role, Piper met the memoir's author two years before her identity as a research scientist was revealed in a Sunday newspaper: [...] "I absolutely had to meet the person behind the words {{to be able to take}} the part... people did ask <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> and I just had to smile, to avoid giving anything away." [...] A second season, with Piper again in the starring role, started filming in May 2008, during which two body doubles were hired to hide Piper's pregnancy during the sex scenes. The third season began airing in January 2010. For the third and fourth series Piper was credited as executive producer.|$|E

6000|$|... "In this case, a very {{convenient}} thing, for {{she tells}} <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>her</b> brother's wedding, {{as no one}} else would take the trouble to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I don't regret it,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Do you {{remember}} what you told <b>me</b> once, <b>about</b> <b>her</b> making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know, my dear," [...] {{said the}} Curate, turning away and {{proceeding}} with his undressing. [...] "You were telling <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> only this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless the boy!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You don't {{call this}} bothering her with questions, do you? She can tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> people, can't she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Moths {{and candles}} to wit," [...] he returned; [...] "but don't be afraid, I attract no notice, and I think she trusts <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> boys." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Me!" [...] {{said the}} captain, purpling. [...] "I don’t talk <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> You don’t hear <b>me</b> talk <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> I’m not {{always talking about}} anybody. I might just have {{mentioned}} her name when talking about Truefitt’s troubles; that’s all." ...|$|R
60|$|Although no {{suspicion}} {{of the truth}} came to <b>me,</b> something <b>about</b> <b>her</b> reminded <b>me</b> of Hester. Even so had Hester liked to wander about the garden in the twilight. I had seen her thus a thousand times.|$|R

6000|$|Oct. 3.—I {{have seen}} the Queen again this morning. She conversed [...] longer, near an hour, and was visibly better and stronger, and in [...] good spirits. She told <b>me</b> much <b>about</b> <b>her</b> illness. ... She wished [...] me a {{pleasant}} journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can {{you tell}} <b>me</b> more <b>about</b> <b>her</b> without {{referring}} to yourself?" [...] he went on. [...] "I am sure I can protect you, {{if you will}} only help me a little. Her name, for instance--you can tell me her name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then why do {{you talk}} to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> sending <b>her</b> away? I don't send her away. Urmand comes and takes her away. I did the same when I was young. Now I'm old, and I have to be left behind. It's the way of nature.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] he replied, [...] "you'd better {{give it to}} Bridget; for she's been bothering <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> wages lately, and {{the present}} will keep her quite for a month longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{heard of}} Mrs. Ford," [...] broke in Faith. [...] "Bertie Shakespeare Drew told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> She was married {{fourteen}} {{years to a}} dead man {{and then he came}} to life." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{moreover}} as if, thus unprecedentedly positive, {{his child}} {{had an effect}} upon him that Mr. Verver really felt as a new thing. [...] "Why then haven't you told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Capadose {{appeared}} not {{to perceive}} {{it or not}} to heed it if she did. 'There was a person, not far from your door, whom Clement called my attention to. He told <b>me</b> something <b>about</b> <b>her</b> but we were going the other way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only heard}} it {{yesterday}} evening, Mrs. Cunningham; after that {{shot through the}} window my father thought I ought to know all about it, for the attempt might be repeated more successfully. He told <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>about</b> the treasure." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't talk to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> John: I {{told you}} not to go near her; she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should {{associate}} with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dus Malbone," [...] {{interrupted}} the girl, {{with a faint}} laugh. [...] "Zeph has told <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> for Zeph and I be great friends--he tells me everything, and I tell him everything.

6000|$|... "I {{asked him}} {{to let me go}} with him because Louise had {{tortured}} <b>me</b> <b>about</b> making <b>her</b> go out in his boat, till I could n't bear it any longer.

6000|$|... "What! was {{she lost}} at sea? But hold on, I {{remember}} hearing something about that." [...] Jack Rooney scratched his head. [...] "Let's see, {{who was it}} told me?
