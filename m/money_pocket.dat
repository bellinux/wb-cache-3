This study examined family correlates of children's <b>pocket</b> <b>money,</b> associations of <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> with eating behaviors and weight status, {{and how the}} associations may be modified by schools' unhealthy food restrictions in urban China. Data were collected in 2015 from 1648 students in 16 primary and middle schools in four mega-cities in China (4 schools/city) : Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Xi'an. Cluster robust negative binomial regression models were fit to assess family correlates of <b>pocket</b> <b>money,</b> associations of <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> with child eating behaviors and weight outcomes, and possible modifying effects of schools' unhealthy food restrictions. Sixty-nine percent of students received <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> weekly. Students received more <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> if mothers frequently ate out of home (IRR =  2. 28 [1. 76, 2. 94]) and/or family rarely had dinner together (IRR =  1. 42, 95 % = [1. 01, 1. 99]). Students got less <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> if parents were concerned about child's future health due to unhealthy eating (IRR =  0. 56 [0. 32, 0. 98]). Students with more <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> more frequently consumed (by 25 – 89 %) sugary beverages, snacks, fast food, or at street food stalls, and were 45 – 90 % {{more likely to be}} overweight/obese. Associations of <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> with unhealthy eating and overweight/obesity were weaker in schools with unhealthy food restrictions. <b>Pocket</b> <b>money</b> is a risk factor for unhealthy eating and obesity in urban China.

40|$|In this research, {{interviews}} were held with Chinese Korean, and analysis was conducted, focusing on children's cognition about {{the ownership of}} <b>pocket</b> <b>money.</b> Children's cognition about <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> appeared to shift from "parents' money" to "my money" at a glance, but, actually, it was not simple like that. Interview data obtained in Japan and questionnaire survey data obtained in Japan and Korea were also analyzed {{to point out the}} ambiguity of children's cognition about <b>pocket</b> <b>money.</b> The mutual-subjective structure in cognition of <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> was proposed to urge such strucure helps us grasp children's cognition about <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> more dynamically. We discussed the structure from the aspects of children's sense of self, ambiguity of <b>pocket</b> <b>money,</b> mutual-subjects of parents and children, and cultural differences. Finally, the possibility of future research to explain the cultural differences of <b>pocket</b> <b>money</b> based on this mutual-subjective structure was discussed. 本研究では中国朝鮮族の子どもに対してお小遣いに関するインタビューを実施し，そのうち，子どもはお小遣いを誰のお金だと認識しているかという問題に焦点を当てて分析を行った。子どものお小遣いに関する認識は一見したところ，「親のお金」から「私のお金」へと移行するように見えるものの，実際はそう単純ではないことに注目した。また，日本のインタビューデータや，日本と韓国の質問紙データなどを総合的に分析し，子どものお小遣い認識が両義性をもっていることを指摘した。さらに，お小遣い認識における相互主体的構造を提案し，この構造によって子どものお小遣い認識をもっとダイナミックに捉える必要性を強調した。お小遣いに関する相互主体的認識について，子どもの自己認識，お小遣いの両義性，相互主体としての親と子ども及び文化差などの側面から理論的考察を試み，最後にこの相互主体的構造に基づいてお小遣いの文化差を説明する可能性を展望した...|$|R

60|$|So {{while the}} q-b stands guard over sack and bag, I {{plunge into the}} fray. It {{literally}} is a fight. Some thirty men all at once want to get at a tiny wicket in a blank wall. There are no queue-rails, there is no order: just a hole in a blank wall, and thirty fellows, mostly military, pressing at it in a mass. But I have done this before. The way is to insert the thin end of oneself, and without any violence, by deadly pressure and pertinacity come at the goal. One hand must be kept fast over the <b>money</b> <b>pocket,</b> and one must be free to clutch the wicket-side when one gets there. And thus one is ground small in those mills of God, Demos struggling for tickets. It isn't very nice--so close, so incomparably crushed. And never for a second must one be off one's guard for one's watch and money and even hanky. When I first came to Italy after the war I was robbed twice in three weeks, floating round in the sweet old innocent confidence in mankind. Since then I have never ceased {{to be on my}} guard. Somehow or other, waking and sleeping one's spirit must be on its guard nowadays. Which is really what I prefer, now I have learnt it. Confidence in the goodness of mankind is a very thin protection indeed. Integer vitae scelerisque purus will do nothing for you when it comes to humanity, however efficacious it may be with lions and wolves. Therefore, tight on my guard, like a screw biting into a bit of wood, I bite my way through that knot of fellows, to the wicket, and shout for two first-class. The clerk inside ignores me for some time, serving soldiers. But if you stand like Doomsday you get your way. Two firsts, says the clerk. Husband and wife, say I, in case there is a two-berth cabin. Jokes behind. But I get my tickets. Impossible to put my hand to my pocket. The tickets cost about a hundred and five francs each. Clutching paper change and the green slips, with a last gasp I get out of the knot. So--we've done it. As I sort my money and stow away, I hear another ask for one first-class. Nothing left, says the clerk. So you see how one must fight.|$|E

40|$|To explain motives {{underlying}} intergenerational transfers {{within a}} family, economists put two theoretical hypotheses forward: altruism and exchange. Empirical tests performed until now do not favor {{any of these}} models. One reason to explain this inadequacy could lie in the spurious assumption of homogeneity of behaviors. Little consideration has been given, {{in the study of}} motives, to the possibility that one or the other model could be more appropriate to characterize the behavior of a particular group. And the assumption that a single transfer motivation would be universally true seems to be questionable. This paper seeks to thoroughly analyze the diversity of inter vivos transfers' motivations through the study of a theme that economists have so far ignored: pocket money. This is done by using a particularly rich data set about parental <b>money</b> <b>pocket</b> given to children. The Education survey, carried out in 1992 in France, offers two main advantages for this study. First, it provides information both on the level of financial gifts and on parents and children's characteristics, including both generations ' level of income.
