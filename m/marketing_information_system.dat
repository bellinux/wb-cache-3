It means that the whole of actions {{in the sphere of}} marketing information, indispensable fol creation and proper realization of a certain concept of exporting enterprise management, should be concentrated in a proper functional service. In this way, the system's activity is based on central (forced) flow of marketing information what eliminates it's casualty. Other information activities (collecting, initial processing, as well as information transmission) are de-concentrated. They belong to competence of particular enterprise units. Such solution is fully concordant with the modern management model, in which only strategic decisions are centralized while decisions in operative actions are decentralized. The principle of <b>marketing</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> functioning presented in the article are of a model character.

The instruments for data collection are documentation, interviews and questionnaires on the company management. The result of measurement and matrix analysis of Marketing Mix indicates that the position of "Laron" soya company is in the quadrant I, meaning that the company is still strong and potential.
