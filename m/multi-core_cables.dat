[...] It houses {{emergency}} stop controls, and communications to each barge using wireless ethernet, and headset communication to the Globe barge driver. [...] All barges are wired with <b>multi-core</b> <b>cables,</b> and most functions within these cables have a redundant wireless backup. Show audio and announcements also originate from the booth.|$|E
50|$|At first {{all these}} cameras used tube based sensors, but Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) imagers {{came on the}} scene in the mid-80s, {{bringing}} numerous benefits. Early CCD cameras could not match the colour or resolution of their tube counterparts, but the benefits of CCD technology, such as introducing smaller and lightweight cameras, a better and more stable image (that was not prone to image burn in or lag) and no need for calibration meant development on CCD imagers quickly took off and, once rivaling and offering a superior image to a tube sensor, began displacing tube-based cameras - the latter of which were all but disused by the early 1990s. Eventually, cameras with the recorder permanently mated to the camera head became the norm for ENG. In studio cameras, the camera electronics shrank, and CCD imagers replaced the pickup tubes. The thick <b>multi-core</b> <b>cables</b> connecting the camera head to the CCU were replaced in the late seventies with triax connections, a slender video cable that carried multiple video signals, intercom audio, and control circuits, and could be run for a mile or more. As the camera innards shrunk, the electronics no longer dictated the size of the enclosure, however the box shape remained, as it is necessary to hold the large studio lenses, teleprompters, electronic viewfinder (EVF), and other paraphernalia needed for studio and sports production. Electronic Field Production cameras were often mounted in studio configurations inside a mounting cage. This cage supported the additional studio accessories.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews, adapts {{and compares}} two {{analytical}} models for computing the steady-state temperature in <b>multi-core</b> <b>cables.</b> Both models {{are based on}} the transformation of the complex geometry of a real cable into a new single-core cable having equivalent thermal properties and simplified geometry. The first simulation model is used in the automotive sector for the estimation of temperatures in bundle of wires for road vehicles. The second simulation model is based on the standard of the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC 60287, which is widely used in the industrial sector for determining the rating of electrical cables. However, these two models have never been compared before for <b>multi-core</b> <b>cables</b> having from two and up to five conductors carrying heavy current loads. Solving this problem requires an iterative computation of the heat-equation and allows the estimation of temperatures within the cable {{as a function of the}} electric current load. The model predictions are compared with each other, taking results obtained from finite element analysis (FEA) and measurement data as references. Finally, both analytical models are found to give results in good agreement with numerical and experimental analysis...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the terminating load voltage of the unshielded <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> coupled with lightning electromagnetic pulse(LEMP), we simulate LEMP within the bounded-wave transmission line which is input with a lightning surge signal produced by WU- 800 -type MARX generator and conduct the relevant experiments towards <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> lines radiated by LEMP. We can get the respond laws of induced voltage of the load by changing the length of unshielded <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable,</b> angles between LEMP and cable, waveforms of LEMP as well as cable terminal loads including linear and non-linear loads. Results show that the amplitude of induced voltage is mainly determined by rising part of electromagnetic field waveforms and the pulse width has {{little effect on the}} induced voltage. The respond amplitude and the respond frequency are obviously affected by the length of cable. The polarization direction of the electric field has a great impact on the amplitude of terminal response, but it does not change the waveforms of the induced voltage. With the termination of test side increasing, the induced voltage is gradually increased, but the load in the other side has no effect on the induced voltage...|$|R
50|$|A third {{problem is}} the {{inductance}} of the loop cable, and its effect upon the higher frequencies of sound. To overcome this, many loop drivers operate as current mode amplifiers instead of voltage mode. By setting the amplifier characteristic between voltage and current mode, the overall performance is optimised for good bandwidth with minimum distortion. There are other options for reducing the effect of cable inductance, including reducing inductance with a <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> where the conductors are connected in parallel.|$|R
50|$|Strictly speaking, a {{textbook}} installation will only actually use pins 2, 5 (for the voice) and 3 (for the ringer). Having said this, most modern telephones contain their own ringing capacitor, to cater for the Irish telephone system {{which does not}} have a capacitor built into the socket, and 2-wire extensions, which means that extension wiring can usually be run with only pins 2 and 5. Often where <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> is used, the remaining cables are used for wiring extensions on additional incoming telephone lines.|$|R
50|$|A single pair {{of wires}} {{comprise}} the bus used for communication to all devices on a DALI network. The network {{can be arranged}} in a bus or star topology, {{or a combination of}} these. DALI is not classified as SELV (Separated Extra Low Voltage) and therefore its wiring may be run next to mains cables or within a <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> that includes mains power. Data is transmitted using Manchester encoding and has a high signal to noise ratio which enables reliable communications in the presence of significant electrical noise.|$|R
50|$|When I {{was about}} fifteen the group I was in was booked into a four-track studio {{to do some}} demos, and I got a taste for {{recording}} then. I got an Akai reel-to-reel at home and I built a studio in the front room, with <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> running into my bedroom which acted as the control room... it snowballed... eventually I was able to afford an eight-track Teac and it was with that machine that I came up to London and set-up the studio here, which I called Blackwing and it took off in earnest...|$|R

40|$|Most robot arms use {{a central}} control box that {{contains}} the power electronics, the motor controllers and the coordinating computer. This paper presents a distributed control network that allows the power electronics and motor controllers to be placed adjacent to the motors. Each controller uses a DSP for all motor control, with the individual controllers communicating {{with each other and}} a host computer using a Controller Area Network (CAN). The design eliminates the bulky <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> that is a major source of downtime for robots such as the PUMA 560, while improving controller bandwidth and facilitating greater software control of motor response. ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{style of}} tamper {{resistance}} is most {{commonly found in}} burglar alarms. Most trip devices (e.g. pressure pads, passive infrared sensors (motion detectors), door switches) use two signal wires that, depending on configuration, are normally open or normally closed. The sensors sometimes need power, so to simplify <b>cable</b> runs, <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> is used. While 4 cores is normally enough for devices that require power (leaving two spare for those that don't), cable with additional cores can be used. These additional cores can be wired into a special so-called [...] "tamper circuit" [...] in the alarm system.|$|R
40|$|The {{conducted}} {{electromagnetic interference}} (EMI) and overvoltage characteristics for a spindle permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) driven by {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) converter are comprehensively presented. The high power, ultra-precision PMSM is applied to a computer numerical control (CNC) grinding machine. The conducted EMI prediction model mainly includes <b>multi-core</b> shielded <b>cable,</b> high frequency (HF) converter and PMSM models. The multi-transmission line (MTL) theory is employed to establish the <b>multi-core</b> shielded <b>cable</b> considering their coupling effect caused by the control pairs. The parasitic capacitance for the PWM converter is calculated by using the analytical formula. The HF equivalent circuit model of the PMSM is obtained combining the methods of impedance measurement and vector fitting method. The influence of the rotor position on the PMSM impedance measurement is considered. The common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) interference voltage and current both for the output of inverter and the input of PMSM terminals are conducted by using the prediction model. The parametric influence of the long <b>multi-core</b> shielded <b>cables</b> on the overvoltage for the PMSM terminal is discussed...|$|R
50|$|In stage lighting, a multicable (otherwise {{known as}} <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> or mult) {{is a type}} of {{heavy-duty}} electrical cable used in theaters to power lights. The basic construction involves a bundle of individual conductors surrounded by a single outer jacket. Whereas single cables only have three conductors, multicable has ten or more. They are configured to run in six or eight-circuit varieties. Typically, both ends of multicable have a specific connector known as a Socapex Connector. Technicians then combine the cables with break-outs and break-ins, which essentially are an octopus-like adapter with one Socapex end and six to eight Edison, twist-lok, or stage pin style connectors.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{discusses}} direct resistance projection welding of a <b>multi-core</b> copper <b>cable</b> to a discharge brass terminal. Resistance welding {{was carried out}} with a conventional machine. The upper tungsten electrode, which comes {{into contact with the}} <b>multi-core</b> copper <b>cable,</b> and the lower copper electrode, on which the brass terminal is lying during welding, are described. In the experimental research, the optimum welding parameters for direct welding (i. e. welding without an intermediate layer or a brazing filler material) of the two workpieces concerned were found. The welded joints obtained were subjected to a strength test, and metallurgical and resistance investigations. The strength test showed that the welded joint was quality welded and had higher strength than the brazed joint. With a heat resistance test during current conduction, {{it was found that the}} joint heated much less than the brazed joint. Metallographic investigations of macro-specimens and a chemical analysis at the copperžbrass joining line are described...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{were done}} {{measuring}} resistivity and time domain induced polarisation using standard <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> spreads {{and a special}} layout with separate cable spreads for transmitting current and measuring potentials. For both types of cables spreads both normal and reciprocal measurements were done in order to estimate the measurement errors. The tests were done along a planned tunnel stretch outside Olso in Norway. The electrode contact was variable with resistances in the range 0. 6 - 25 kΩ. The results gave low median error levels for both types of cable spreads, but the single cable spread showed a significantly larger variation with more scatter in the IP data. Data for both types of spreads gave models that are consistent and appear to delineate the complex geology in a useful way. It is concluded that the single cable spread gives surprisingly good IP data considering the large layouts at this site, which is adequate for inversion of the integrated full decay. If {{on the other hand}} the data were to be used for spectral IP inversion of the decay curves for recovering the Cole-Cole parameters the extra effort of measuring with separated cable spreads would probably be well motivated...|$|R
40|$|The 10. 5 km {{diameter}} Bosuntwi {{impact crater}} in Ghana {{is occupied by}} a lake of about 8. 5 km in diameter. The multi-electrode gradient array {{has been used to}} carry out 2 D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey at different locations around the crater. The 2 m take-out cable of the ABEM LUND Resistivity Imaging System was modified to function as a 5 m take-out. 2 D electrical resistivity survey was carried out along six (6) radial profiles running from the shore of the lake towards the crater rim. The least-square inversion technique was used to invert the topographically corrected data. The area extending from the lake shore towards the crater rim contains essentially three formations: the low resistivity regions from the shore of the lake towards uphill with resistivities 128 Ω. m from the lake sediments and the breccias due to their geometry and lateral extent. The ERT models allowed us to locate faults and fractures and also the thickness of the post impact lake sediments and the breccias. The results showed that the cables take-outs of the <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> can be modified to suit the requirements of a particular survey thus highlighting the utility of this technique in impact cratering studies and geo-electrical imaging studies in general...|$|R
40|$|The DC {{electrical}} resistivity geophysical method is fairly used in geological and groundwater studies, {{as well as}} environmental monitoring activities. The purpose of electrical surveys {{is to determine the}} subsurface resistivity distribution by making measurements on the ground surface. Electrical resistivity is mainly influenced by soil moisture and, in this work, moisture is the main soil property that is being studied. The field technique used was horizontal electrical profiling with Wenner arrangement for electrodes which is characterized by the equidistant disposal of potential and current electrodes, according to a straight line. The objective {{of this study is to}} demonstrate how is possible to visualize the progress of soil moisture through {{electrical resistivity}} data. Measurements were obtained using a resistivity meter with 25 electrodes connected to a <b>multi-core</b> <b>cable</b> in a 2 -D electrical imaging survey. The Res 2 dinv software allowed the construction of four geoelectrical sections. The sections allowed the visualization of the progress of water plume, and demonstrated a progressive increase in soil moisture, related to the low resistivity area. These results demonstrated the applicability of this method for visualization of the soil moisture advance in a four hours period. 350 liters of clean water were used in this work, which was conducted in the region of Planaltina, Distrito Federal on the campus of the Brasilia University.

40|$|A net-changing {{device for}} use with the Lowestoft {{multipurpose}} sampler is described. The unit consists of four nets mounted on stainless steel rods which are spring loaded and slide between stainless steel runners. The nets are held by metal "fingers " when not fishing, and by operating an electric motor they can be released instantaneously to the fishing posi-tion. Water enters the net through a standard nose cone via a trumpet-insert of fibreglass. The amount of water filtered is registered by an electric flowmeter mounted in the nose cone, and the depth at which the sample is taken is recorded by a pressure transducer. Nets can be selected by depressing a switch on the control unit, and the flow, depth and number of the net fishing register on meters mounted in the same unit. The underwater electronic equipment {{is connected to the}} console in the deck laboratory by a stainless steel <b>multi-core</b> electric <b>cable</b> via the slip rings of the winch.

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems bolted short-circuits are rare and the fault usually involves arcing and burning; mostly the limit value of minimum short-circuit depends really on arcing-fault. In AC low voltage systems, the paper examines the arcing-fault branch circuits as weak points. Different protection measures are available against the arc-faults. A first measure that can guarantee a probabilistic protection is {{allowed by the}} adoption of overcurrent protective devices (OCPD), optimizing {{the design of the}} structure of the system and/or the coordination of protection. A well known complete protection is allowed by adopting are-fault circuit interrupters (AFCI) for the protection of branch circuits. The authors suggest a new complete protection allowed wiring the branch circuits, including particularly extension cords, with special power cables, protected by ordinary ground fault protective devices (GFPD). The suggested design for single-core or <b>multi-core</b> power <b>cables</b> is that each insulated core has a concentric conductor shield. Converting the line-to-line fault into a line to ground fault or into a mixed type is the goal of this special cable type Faults Ground-Forced Cable (FGFC) ...|$|R
40|$|Measuring induced {{polarization}} {{in the time}} domain with relatively compact multi-channel multi-electrode systems is attractive because of {{the simplicity of the}} procedure and thus its efficiency in the field. However the use of this technique is sometimes discouraged by the bad quality of the measurements in cases of high electrode contact resistances that can render data interpretation infeasible or at least unreliable. It is proposed that capacitive coupling in the <b>multi-core</b> electrode <b>cables</b> has a significant role in creating this problem. In such cases separation of current and potential circuits by using separate multi-conductor cable spreads can yield significant improvement in data quality. The procedure is relatively simple and can be implemented with common resistivity and time-domain IP equipment. We show here three field examples from Southern Sweden, all measured as 2 D electrical imaging sections. The first one is an example where the use of a single cable spread is sufficient thanks to moderate electrode contact resistance and high signal levels. The following two examples are from sites where {{induced polarization}} measurements could not yield consistent results using only a single multi-conductor cable spread. Useful results were subsequently obtained by using separate cable spreads. The first example is a 280 m long line measured over an old covered municipal waste deposit where the waste body stands out as a zone of high chargeability. The second example is a 120 m line measured on a sandy glaciofluvial structure that is host to an aquifer of regional importance. The improvement led to discrimination between materials of different grain sizes, with potential bearing for understanding the aquifer. The third example is a 300 - 400 m line measured across an esker lying on clay till. The improvement led to a clear visualization of the esker and to the identification of a possible fault in the underlying gneissic bedrock. In all cases pseudosections and examples of chargeability decay curves are shown and discussed as tools for assessing data quality. Inversion results are shown together with background geological information and it is concluded that they are in good agreement...|$|R
