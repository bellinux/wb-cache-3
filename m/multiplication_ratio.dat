5000|$|One classic {{design for}} a {{harmonic}} mixer uses a step recovery diode (SRD). The mixer's subharmonic input is first amplified to a power level that might be around 1 watt. That signal then drives a step recovery diode impulse generator circuit that turns the sine wave into something approximating an impulse train. The resulting impulse train has the harmonics of the input sine wave present to a high frequency (such as 18 GHz). The impulse train can then be used with a diode mixer (also called a sampler).The SRD usually has a very high frequency <b>multiplication</b> <b>ratio,</b> {{and can be used}} as the basis of a comb receiver, monitoring several harmonically related frequencies at once.

The Gocken Multiplication Technology is a new technology developed at the National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI), Umudike, Nigeria, for very rapid multiplication of cocoyam by recycling ‘wastes’ of cocoyam (≤ 7. 0 g cormels) in cocoyam production. The technology utilizes a seed rate of about 0. 35 - 0. 45 t/ha compared to 1. 0 - 2. 0 t/ha currently in use. Total corm + cormel yield ranged from 7. 34 - 15. 5 t/ha.

40|$|Abstract—In this brief, a novel all-digital and large-{{frequency}}-multiplication-ratio {{audio frequency}} synthesizer for high-definition multimedia interface applications is presented. The proposed large-N frequency synthesizer is designed in an all-digital manner to reduce circuit complexity and design efforts in advanced CMOS process technology, {{as compared with}} prior studies. The proposed frequency synthesizer does not require an extra high-frequency reference clock source but employs a single locking loop to reduce lock-in time and enhance loop stability. Based on the proposed frequency search algorithm and the high-resolution digitally controlled oscillator, the frequency synthesizer cannot only provide a large frequency <b>multiplication</b> <b>ratio,</b> but it also achieves low-jitter performance. Measurement {{results show that the}} frequency <b>multiplication</b> <b>ratio</b> has a range of 4096 to 25 088 and that the power consumption of the proposed frequency synthesizer can be improved to 591 µW (at 24. 576 MHz) with a peak-to-peak jitter of 1. 23 %. In addition, the proposed frequency synthesizer can be implemented with standard cells, making it easily portable to different processes and very suitable for system-on-a-chip applications.

50|$|Discrete {{component}} VIGs (pictured) {{consist of}} a stack of well-coupled common mode chokes interconnected {{with a stack of}} capacitors. The inductors present a high inductance to currents that are in-phase in the two windings, and a far lower inductance when the winding currents are flowing in opposite directions. The capacitors are charged with alternating polarity and when the switch (usually a triggered or free running spark gap in practice) is closed the voltage across every second capacitor rapidly inverts as a half cycle of oscillation at a frequency set by the capacitance resonating with the differential mode inductance of the chokes. At the same time the other capacitors discharge very slowly due to not having a differential current flowing to cancel the reactance.So after a half period, all the capacitors are in series and the voltages add. This arrangement has a conceptual equivalence to the distributed component spiral VIG, with the alternating capacitors representing the two transmission lines of alternating polarity and the spiral turns representing successive stacked stages.Discrete components allow large lumped capacitors to be used thus storing much more energy, but have difficulty replicating the high voltage <b>multiplication</b> <b>ratios</b> and extremely short rise times of spiral transmission line types.|$|R

50|$|Even {{with the}} benefit of the one-way stator clutch, a {{converter}} cannot achieve the same level of efficiency in the coupling phase as an equivalently sized fluid coupling. Some loss is due to the presence of the stator (even though rotating as part of the assembly), as it always generates some power-absorbing turbulence. Most of the loss, however, is caused by the curved and angled turbine blades, which do not absorb kinetic energy from the fluid mass as well as radially straight blades. Since the turbine blade geometry is a crucial factor in the converter's ability to multiply torque, trade-offs between torque multiplication and coupling efficiency are inevitable. In automotive applications, where steady improvements in fuel economy have been mandated by market forces and government edict, the nearly universal use of a lock-up clutch has helped to eliminate the converter from the efficiency equation during cruising operation. The maximum amount of torque multiplication produced by a converter is highly dependent on the size and geometry of the turbine and stator blades, and is generated only when the converter is at or near the stall phase of operation. Typical stall torque <b>multiplication</b> <b>ratios</b> range from 1.8:1 to 2.5:1 for most automotive applications (although multi-element designs as used in the Buick Dynaflow and Chevrolet Turboglide could produce more). Specialized converters designed for industrial, rail, or heavy marine power transmission systems are capable of as much as 5.0:1 multiplication. Generally speaking, there is a trade-off between maximum torque multiplication and efficiency - high stall ratio converters tend to be relatively inefficient below the coupling speed, whereas low stall ratio converters tend to provide less possible torque multiplication.|$|R

Using all the same six points as above and adding two more lines which intersect, a Seven-Point Six-line geometric figure is formed. Applying Ceva’s Theorem to this geometric figure, which is also an established Euclidian Plane geometric theorem, will also result in obtaining “ 1 ” on <b>multiplication</b> of <b>ratios</b> of the map distances.

While mountains and peaks exist in nature without human intervention to define their height, the harbour boundary lines are artificially determined.

40|$|One of {{the molding}} {{injection}} Komatsu 80 T in the PT Yogya Presisi Teknikatama Industry {{has a problem}} on its performance. The performance of this injecton molding can be calculated by Overall Equipment Effectiveness(OEE). OEE is a factor {{which can be found}} by <b>multiplication</b> of Availability <b>Ratio,</b> Performance Efficiency and Rate of Quality. The values of OEE then be compared to the standart values of JIPM (The Japan Institute of Plan Maintenance) which JIPM defined a minimal standard value of OEE is 85 %. If the result of OEE calculation less than 85 %,what causes it be analysed by the Six Big Losses Analysis. The Result of analysis showed the sequence as Reduced Speed Loss, Setup and Adjusmnet loss, and Rework Loss. Then by Fishbone diagram, it can be known the causes of the decreasing OEE values, so the management can do the repairment...|$|R
