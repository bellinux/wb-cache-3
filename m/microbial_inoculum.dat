40|$|The most {{accepted}} {{theories in}} soil ecology suggest that broad (e. g. respiration) and specialized (e. g. denitrification) functions are affected differently by resource availability and microbial communities in terrestrial ecosystems. However, {{there is a}} lack of experimental approaches quantifying and separating the role of microbial communities from the effect of soil abiotic properties on different aspects of soil ecosystem functionality. Here, we conducted a full-factorial design microcosm experiment and used random forest and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses to evaluate the role and the relative importance of soil properties (sterile soils A, B and C differing in abiotic attributes) and <b>microbial</b> communities (<b>microbial</b> <b>inoculums</b> from soils A, B and C) in driving soil respiration (i. e. broad functioning), denitrification (i. e. specialized functioning) and four enzyme activities and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability in soil. Soils with the higher total C (soils B and C) promoted the highest soil C and N availability, enzyme activities and broad functioning (i. e. soil respiration); however, we did not find any effect of total C on specialized functions (i. e. denitrification rates). Random forest analyses showed that both soil properties (i. e. total C and pH) and microbial abundance determined broad functioning (i. e. soil respiration), as well as the production of enzyme activities, and C and N availability in soil. However, we found that microbial communities were more important than soil properties for modulating specialized functioning (i. e. denitrification rates) in soil environments. Finally, our SEM also indicated that broad functioning, which is widely distributed across living organisms, is limited by both resource availability and microbial abundance. Furthermore, specialized functioning, which is conducted by particular groups of organisms, may be highly sensitive to changes in the microbial community. Overall, our findings provide direct experimental evidence for the relative importance of soil properties and microbial communities on broad and specialized functioning. Such evidence helps advance our understanding of different drivers of soil ecosystem functioning which will be crucial to developing an ecologically relevant theory about below-ground ecosystem functioning...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Crude oil soil {{contamination}} is widespread, {{and due to}} the complex chemical nature of crude oil, remediation can be expensive and challenging. Crude oil that remains in soil {{for long periods of}} time can become sequestered in the soil matrix and become difficult to biodegrade. Heavier, more complex hydrocarbons are persistent in the environment due to resistance to biodegradation, which makes remediation problematic. Earthworms ingest soil, exposing it to intense physical and chemical processes and can increase soil microbial activity and therefore are promising candidates for enhancement of crude oil bioremediation. I examined if different earthworm species could tolerate and degrade crude oil. Toxicity tests established that Eisenia fetida and Apporectodea caliginosa were crude oil tolerant and suitable for use in crude oil degradation experiments. Two primary degradation experiments were performed. In the first, laboratory made soil was mixed with crude oil at concentrations of approximately 30, 000 mg/kg, with and without the addition of a <b>microbial</b> <b>inoculum</b> consisting of contaminated, native soil from an active remediation site. Petroleum degradation was examined in the presence and absence of E fetida. This experiment measured the importance of a hydrocarbon adapted microbial community to crude oil degradation rates. In the second, petroleum degradation in the contaminated, native soil from the remediation site was examined in the presence and absence of the E. fetida and A. caliginosa. The second experiment measured the effectiveness of earthworms on real-world soils that had weathered in the field for several decades. In the first degradation experiment, petroleum concentrations declined significantly (p< 0. 01) in the presence of E. fetida compared to controls. After 342 days, concentrations declined by 56 % without the <b>microbial</b> <b>inoculum</b> and 63 % with the <b>microbial</b> <b>inoculum.</b> Heavier and more complex hydrocarbons were more resistant to degradation. In the second experiment, petroleum concentrations declined by approximately 93 % in the native soil in the presence of each of the worm species, significantly more than the declines observed in the controls. The results of these experiments show that earthworms accelerate degradation of crude oil and are a promising candidate for the enhancement of crude oil bioremediation (vermiremediation) ...|$|E

Increased salinity in some wetlands {{has been found to}} accelerate leaf litter decomposition, an important driver of nutrient availability and carbon sequestration. Research at Timberlake Observatory for Wetland Restoration (TOWeR) and two reference wetlands in eastern North Carolina has documented periods of increased salinity associated with drought. Here, I examined breakdown rates of leaf litter from common wetland tree species (Nyssa biflora and Liquidambar styraciflua) in TOWeR and two reference wetlands. I also examined macroinvertebrate abundance and microbial enzyme activity on the litterbags. Leaf breakdown and microbial activity was also measured in a microcosm experiment that exposed <b>microbial</b> <b>inoculums</b> from both reference wetlands to high and low salinities. Microbial extracellular enzyme activity for the acquisition of carbon (beta-glucosidase, BG), nitrogen (N-acetylglucosaminidase, NAG, and leucine aminopeptidase, LAP), phosphorus (acid phosphatase, AP), sulfate (arylsulfatase, AS), and the breakdown of phenol groups (phenol oxidase, PO) was obtained using standard fluorometric (absorbance for PO). Leaf litter breakdown rates, as well as BG, NAG, LAP, PO, and AP activity were expected to increase with higher salinity, while the activity of AS and macroinvertebrate abundance was expected to decrease. During the 29 weeks of the field experiment, salinity incursion was not as prevalent as in previous years; reaching conductivities of 111. 59 and 1863. 37 [mu] S cm⁻¹ for the sites with the lowest and highest respectively. Despite the lack of a large change in salinity, I observed a tripling of field leaf litter breakdown rate (from 0. 001 ± 0. 0001 d⁻¹ to 0. 0029 ± 0. 0001 d⁻¹) and a linear increase of breakdown rates with increasing conductivity across the sites (R²= 0. 84 p= 0. 027). Microcosm breakdown rates were higher than field breakdown rates (0. 0026 ± 0. 007 d⁻¹ to 0. 0033 ± 0. 0006 d⁻¹) and did not correspond with salinity but did have a strong negative linear relationship with the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) available (R²= 0. 96 p= 0. 006). Enzyme activity increased in response to increased salinity in the field and microcosm experiment but responses were not consistent between lab and field and overall were low compared to literature values. Macroinvertebrate presence was low, only being present in 49 out of 315 litter bags, and did not correlate to salinity or increased breakdown rates. Overall, the lack of consistent results between field and microcosm suggest that small changes in salinity are unlikely to lead to major changes in leaf decomposition and microbial enzyme activity.  M.

40|$|Olive oil {{production}} {{is a traditional}} agricultural industry in Mediterranean countries and Portugal {{is one of the}} ten major producers. This industry generates an effluent, olive mill wastewater (OMW), which does not undergo any treatment and, usually, is stored in evaporation lagoons or spread on the land. Disposal of olive oil mill wastewaters is a serious environmental problem due to its high organic loading, presence of polyphenols and tannins, high content in suspended solids and acidity, which contributes to its ecotoxicity. In this work it was intended to study the biodegradation of OMW by microrganisms naturally present in these wastewaters. Thus, an aerobic biological treatment system: a packed-bed batch reactor was applied to a OMW from a mill on northern of Portugal, exploring its autochthon <b>microbial</b> population as <b>inoculum.</b> The biodegradation ability of OMW by microrganisms naturally present in these wastewaters was assessed, by following the evolution of the process and monitoring several of its physico-chemical parameters.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effectiveness of faecal extract from the yak (Bos grunnienes) as an alternative <b>microbial</b> <b>inoculum</b> to rumen fluid for estimation of digestibility of several forage species. Forage samples produced at high altitude were tested in this study: four legumes (Lathyrus sativus L., Lotus corniculatus L., Onobrychis viciaefolia L. and Trifolium pratense L.), three forbs (Achillea millefolium L., Potentilla reptans L. and Teucrium flavum L.) and one grass (Brachipodyum pinnatum L.) were incubated with yak rumen fluid or faecal extract. A large variability in chemical composition was observed among the species collected. Rumen liquor and faecal samples were collected from adult healthy yak. The DaisyII incubator was used to evaluate the nutrient digestibility of forages using rumen liquor as control and faecal extract as alternative <b>microbial</b> <b>inoculum</b> sources. Filter bags containing samples of browse species were added to the four digestion vessels along with their respective inoculum and then incubated for 48 h and dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral and detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility was determined. There was a significant relationship between estimates, indicating that faecal liquor has the potential to be used instead of rumen fluid for estimation of in vitro digestibility of plants. It is concluded that the DaisyII incubator results are appropriate for the determination of in vitro digestibility of nutrients using faecal liquor to define the potential for adaptation of yak to new pastures.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of decline in biodiversity for ecosystem functioning {{is a major}} concern in soil ecology. Recent research efforts have been mostly focused on terrestrial plants, while, despite their importance in ecosystems, little is known about soil microbial communities. This work aims at investigating the effects of fungal and bacterial species richness on the dynamics of leaf litter decomposition. Synthetic microbial communities with species richness ranging from 1 to 64 were assembled in laboratory microcosms and used in three factorial experiments of decomposition. Thereafter, the functionality of the different microcosms was determined by measuring their capability to decompose materials with different chemical properties, including two species of litter (Quercus ilex L. and Hedera helix L.), cellulose strips and woody sticks. Incubation was done in microcosms at two temperatures (12 °C and 24 °C) for 120 days. The number of microbial species inoculated in the microcosms positively affected decomposition rates of Q. ilex and H. helix litters, while relationships found for cellulose and wood were not statistically significant. Diversity effect was greater at higher incubation temperature. We found lower variability of decay rates in microcosms with higher inoculated species richness of microbial communities. Our study pointed out that the relationships between <b>inoculum</b> <b>microbial</b> diversity and litter decomposition is dependent on temperature and litter quality. Therefore, the loss of microbial species may adversely affects ecosystem functionality under specific environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) {{as one of}} {{lignocellulosic}} biomass, {{consists of}} three main components: cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses. Cellulose may occur in a crystalline form in addition to amorphous form. Cellulose and hemicelluloses can be converted into fermentable sugar, i. e. glucose and xylose, by chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis. These sugar usually used as a feedstock of bio ethanol production. Lignin and high-crystallinity of cellulose are inhibits the performance of enzymatic hydrolysis process. Therefore pretreatment is necessary to remove lignin, decrease the crystallinity and improve the yield of enzymatic hydrolysis. One of the developed pre-treatment processes is soaking with aqueous ammonia solution or called by SAA process.  In this study, the advantage of SAA pre-treatment process was investigated using ammonium solution prior to the enzymatic hydrolysis. The pre-treatments were carried out in various ammonium concentrations (5 %, 7. 5 %, and 10 %) at mild conditions (25 o C and 1 atm) for 24 hrs, and {{with or without a}} following additional diluted-acid pre-treatment (92 – 98 o C and 1 atm for 1 hour). The pre-treated materials were then enzymatic hydrolyzed by cellulose and β-glycosidase for 96 hrs and anaerobic digested by <b>inoculums</b> <b>microbial.</b> The changes in cellulose crystallinity were analyzed by FTIR Spectroscopy. The OPEFB pre-treated by 10 % ammonium solution without a following dilute-acid pre-treatment shows low crystallinity with a crystallinity index (CI) of 0. 80 compared to that of the untreated material (2. 11). The method could increase the yield of hydrolyzed glucose to 79 % compared with that of untreated material (13 g/g glucan added).
