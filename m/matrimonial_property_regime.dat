Despite it being a fundamental problem, it is not well known to the general public. For this reason {{the aim of this}} diploma thesis is to clearly and systematically summarize the issue of contractual marital property law. For better understanding, the thesis defines basic terms of statutory <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime,</b> and focuses on parts of community property of spouses.

Except for the statutory <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime,</b> spouses are allowed to negotiate different property regime by using a contract of modification of community property of spouses. The contractual <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> represents a major part of this thesis.

40|$|Alexandra Kuper’s {{doctoral}} thesis holds a study into the applicable law on <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property.</b> In international cases {{it is not}} always intelligible that Dutch law is applicable. In the present study, the main question is how the current Dutch conflicts-of-laws rule for international <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> law functions and how European conflict-of-law rules on international <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> law should be formed from a Dutch perspective. Chapter 1 outlines the problems of the international property law. The complexity of the Dutch law on international <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> is caused by the existence of different legal regimes in this area. Depending on the time of marriage one of the two regimes is applicable. The second chapter contains an examination of the Hague Effects of marriage Convention of 1905 in the Netherlands. Both the establishment and the results of this Convention are outlined. Chapter 3 discusses the rules of domestic international <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> law, which apply {{in the absence of an}} applicable convention. The fourth chapter concerns the Hague Conference of 1976 as well as a study of the establishment of the Hague <b>Matrimonial</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Regimes</b> Convention of 1978. Chapter 5 discusses the application of the Hague <b>Matrimonial</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Regimes</b> Convention of 1978 in the Netherlands. Chapter 6 explores some of the most important aspects of the legislation in France, Germany and Switzerland. The seventh chapter concerns the most desirable regulation of the applicable law regarding <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regimes</b> at a European level. The proposal for a Regulation on <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regimes</b> is discussed in chapter 8. It is examined how this Regulation relates to the conclusions that Kuper has drawn in the seventh chapter.

This thesis consists of an introduction, three parts that are further divided into chapters and a conclusion. The first part is an analysis of Italian provisions. It deals with the fundamental principles of the Italian legal system and <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regimes</b> as codified in the Codice civile. First of all, it examines statutory community of property, marital assets (marital property, deferred community of property and liabilities), personal property and also deals with mandatory rules of the management of marital assets. Then it deals with contractual regimes, namely the separation of property, the property fund and other marital and prenuptial agreements. Subsequently, it examines the termination of community of property and the division of marital assets. The second part concerns the Czech provisions [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{assumption}} {{according to}} the Czech regulation of statutory joint ownership of property during a settlement is that the share of both spouses in the joint property is equal. However, the principles of settlement under § 149 ObčZ are to be considered. According {{to one of these}} principles, it has to be considered to what extent each spouse has provided for the family and contributed to the acquisition and preservation of the joint property. The joint ownership of property acquired under German law is more promoting the sole breadwinner model. This is particularly evident in the scheme of consequences in case of divorce. Gain equalization enables that spouse to take share in the property acquired (i. e. gain) {{in the course of the}} marriage who for reasons of homemaking forwent taking part in property acquisition. The statutory <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> according to Swiss law is the joint ownership of property acquired which includes both the gain during marriage and the personal property of each spouse.

From this time <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> converts into a compulsory system of separate estates in matrimony. The joint matrimonial estate shall be included in the bankruptcy estate. The rules of management of matrimonial estate are converted. From this moment the course of bankruptcy proceeding depends on the bankrupt spouse’s activity. They can pursue amounts resulting from their share in the joint matrimonial estate, filing the claim with the judge – commissioner. They can also demand exemption from the bankrupt estate assets which do not belong to the bankrupt. Sometimes they do not have any impact on the activity of a bankrupt spouse, for example, they cannot resist the petition to declare bankruptcy. During bankruptcy proceeding a bankrupt spouse is limited in their rights which regard joint matrimonial estate. This situation lasts to the valid conclusion of bankruptcy proceeding. The article emphasizes different depiction of time in the aspect of bankruptcy law. On the one hand, time assigns limits of divagations.

The EU legislator {{has been working on}} those for almost a decade, after years of struggle and discussions between the member states, seventeen of them decided to go forward, following the enhanced cooperation procedure. This paper aims, firstly, at briefly explaining the genesis of the regulations, going through the different obstacles and success that have paved the way (The Stockholm programme in 2009, the impact assessment and the first Commission proposal in 2011, its rejection in 2015 and the latest proposal in March 2016). Subsequently, the different provisions of the actual proposal will be analyzed. This part will especially focus on jurisdiction and applicable law, reflecting upon the different connecting factors and the inclusion of party autonomy within the related articles. Last but not least, the contribution will discuss the articulation of the new norms with the existing instruments such as the 2010 “divorce” and the 2012 “successions” Regulations. For each of them, the EU legislator has opted for similar but not always equivalent measures. As an example, we can mention the choice of connecting factors referred to (habitual residence and nationality for all of them but adding forum for divorce and registration place or closest connection respectively for <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> and property consequences of registered partnerships). Another illustration is the use, or not, of freedom of choice (direct for successions and matrimonial property or registered partnership and indirect for divorce). Those inconsistencies lead to a patchwork of articles in which legal practitioners and citizens will probably get lost.

Although the acts expanded the definition of married women's property, they were only significant to {{a small minority of}} married women in Newfoundland {{at the time of their}} passage. This was because the legislation largely put in statutory form an existing matrimonial property system which had evolved since the earliest days of English contact. Three broad factors had contributed to the formation of this system. The first was the reception of English law of property, marriage and inheritance. Although they were clearly defined by English law they were applied as far as they could be to local circumstances in Newfoundland. A second factor was the meaning and significance of property in light of Newfoundland's place on England's agenda. From the time of England's earliest interest in Newfoundland, the cod fishery determined the definition of property on the island. As the number of permanent residents increased, there were legislative and judicial attempts to provide a framework for a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime.</b> Finally, the prominent place of customary practice in the ways that residents acquired property and passed it on to future generations was a third factor influencing the evolution of matrimonial property rights. The partible inheritance system that evolved up to the end of the nineteenth century suited the social and economic conditions of the island and reflected the long-standing custom of possessory claim. Property was conveyed through gifts, deeds of conveyance, trusts, wills and by intestacy by family members who were motivated by custom, affection, and desires to provide for the economic security of the next generation as well as to recognize the beneficiaries' contribution to the survival and well-being of the family.

40|$|Until {{recently}} few jurisdictions {{have allowed}} arbitration of family law disputes, considering such arbitration to be contrary to public policy. But policies favouring private ordering, combined with pressures on family courts have encouraged reconsideration {{of the policy}} issues. This is notably true in common law jurisdictions. Similar developments in civil law jurisdictions are inhibited by the wording of national civil codes. Differences in substantive laws and in legal institutions also contribute to diverse assessments of the utility of arbitration: {{the role of the}} civil law notary in drawing up and dissolving a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> may be influential in this respect, while competitors to arbitration also include mediation, private judging, and the use of special masters and parenting co-ordinators. Where arbitration has been promoted, its scope has been limited to the financial consequences of divorce in some jurisdictions, while in others it extends also to child arrangements. Policy concerns are addressed through the development of enhanced protection for the parties to arbitration as compared to commercial cases, whether through case law or legislation. Key areas in which this has occurred include: the permissibility of an arbitration (as opposed to a submission) agreement; availability of an appeal or the intensity of review of an award; specification of the qualifications for arbitrators; and specific measures for the protection of children...|$|E
40|$|The {{bulk of the}} matrimonial {{property}} regimes operating in Botswana were inherited from the country's colonial past. Since independence there ha'> not been any realistic attempt to reform them. The thesis set out to appraisal the legal regimes governing the determination of {{matrimonial property}} on divorce to ascertain their efficacy in realising the legitimate aspiration of married couples. Comparisons were made with similar countries to determine how these have tackled problems relating to determination of matrimonial property on divorce. The study found that {{where there is a}} dispute about matrimonial property in marriages out of community, the courts have no discretion to readjust the rights of the parties. This situation adversely affect nonworking wives who spent most of their time looking after their husbands and children without being able to acquire capital assets. Recognition is not given to such domestic contribution to the welfare of the family. It was also found that the exercise of the marital power by husbands of marriages in community of property deprives wives of those marriages the right to administer the joint estate. The patriarchal nature of customary law, which governs the majority of disputes about matrimonial property, discriminates against women. Consequently, the following, inter alia, are suggested as reform measures. (a) The courts should be g 1 ven a wide discretionary power, circumscribed by statutory guidelines, to reallocate matrimonial property on divorce irrespective of the <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> that governs the marriage. TI 1 e underlying principle should be equality of sharing but this may be departed from where the circumstances of the particular case warrant it (b) A spouse's domestic contribution towards the welfare of the family should be recognised. (c) The marital power of husbands should be abolished. (d) The provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act should be made applicable to customary marriages. Private LawLL. D...|$|E

Annotation This {{thesis is}} devoted to the concept of ‘matrimonial property’ under {{statutory}} <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> (see Sections 89 – 110 of the Civil Law). The objective of the thesis is to express a well-reasoned point of view (to provide a uniform solution) as to important problem issues, i. e. 1) the issue related to determination of the composition of joint matrimonial property and division thereof (incl. separation of joint property from the separate property of each spouse) where significant role is played by the provisions of law imposing the burden of proof on spouses; 2) the issue related to acts by one spouse with the property acquired during the course of marriage (in particular, immovable property) and legal consequences of such acts where significant role is played by the provisions of law protecting third parties (acquirers in good faith); and 3) the issue related to correct understanding of the division of joint matrimonial property where it is important to determine the objective of such division. As a result of analysis of rules of law, case law and legal literature, there are conclusions and suggestions provided in this thesis on how to interpret and apply the provisions of law governing the above mentioned issues. Considering that Sections 89 – 110 of the Civil Law governing the statutory <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> as applicable today are drawn based on respective provisions of 89 – 110 of the Civil Law dated 1937 (by harmonising them with the principle of equality between spouses) {{the first part of the}} thesis explores the basic provisions of matrimonial property concept, which set forth ‘husband’s management system’ (and which were applicable in late 30 -ies of 20 th century), and basic provisions governing the so called ‘equal spouses’ management system’ nowadays. It is concluded in this thesis that both systems are based on the so called ‘principle of separate ownership’. In the second part of the thesis, opinions on all three above mentioned problem issues expressed in the existing legal literature and case law have been summarised and described, reasons (causes) of variety of existing opinions have been clarified, as well as criteria (principle of separate ownership, concept and types of matrimonial property, aggregations of property, objective of separation of joint property of spouses) have been identified, according to which criteria a uniform solution needs to be found in relation to the said issues. 2 The third part of the thesis reviews the term ‘property’ (its legal nature, contents and types thereof, principle of surrogation, as well as the issue related to segregating the property from similar aggregations). In consideration of the concept of property the thesis establishes the concept of ‘matrimonial property’, types thereof and aggregations of matrimonial property, as well as analyses the legal segregation of aggregations of property of the spouses. In addition, this part analyses the issue related to interaction of aggregations of matrimonial property, reasons thereof and legal consequences in case of termination of marriage. In the fourth part, the concept of ‘separate property’ of each spouse has been reviewed and types of such property, i. e. the basis of creation (acquisition) thereof, as set forth in Section 91, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Law, have been analysed. Particular attention {{is devoted to}} the contract on designation of separate property (see Section 91, Paragraph 1, Sub-Paragraph 1 of the Civil Law) and to the income from separate property of one spouse (legal nature of such income) with the participation of other spouse (see Section 91, Paragraph 1, Sub-Paragraph 1 of the Civil Law in the light of Section 89, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Law). The fifth part of the thesis explores the concept of ‘joint property’ of spouses, basis of creation (acquisition) thereof, issue related to division of joint matrimonial property (or proportion of ownership) between the spouses, as well a...|$|E

Also, considering the fact that Romania is a member state of the European Union and that more and more Romanian people are living abroad or marry foreigners, we consider the harmonization of legislation {{in order to determine the}} law applicable to such relationships as a highly important requirement. Given these issues we will devote the present study: to primary qualification of the matrimonial regime notion...|$|R

This essay illustrates both instruments {{from the perspective of}} the Italian legal order, as to highlight how the new European legislation will affect the Italian system of Private International Law (law 218 / 1995). The resulting scenario will be fragmented and quite complicated.

The new conflict-of-law rules for same- sex marriage and same-sex unions (articles from 32 -bis to 32 -quinquies of Law 218 / 1995) will also affect the characterization of the cross-border situations at stake in order to define the scope ratione materiae of Regulations 2016 / 1103 and 2016 / 1104...|$|R
