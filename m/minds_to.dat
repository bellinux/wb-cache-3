5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their <b>minds.</b> <b>To</b> many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|Unhappy in {{the estate}} agency, Kingsbury took up the {{position}} of caretaker on a farm at Boundary Bend, {{not far from where}} Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure – walking through western Victoria and New South Wales. In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman. They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury. As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the Australian Imperial Force on 29 May 1940.|$|E

5|$|Yasui had {{consulted}} {{a friend in}} the FBI prior to arrest, and consulted with other legal <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> try to test the legality of the orders. At trial he was defended by private attorney Earl Bernard. Gus J. Solomon, later a judge for the same court, had asked the national American Civil Liberties Union to defend Yasui as no local Oregon groups elected to support Yasui. One part of the strategy was to proceed with a non-jury trial, leaving the decision only to the judge. Solomon was asked by Fee to help advise the court on the issues, along with eight other attorneys. At his trial, federal judge James Alger Fee {{came to the conclusion that}} laws specifically targeting a race, such as the curfew, were unconstitutional when applied to citizens. However, he also declared in his November 16, 1942, decision that Yasui had demonstrated his loyalty to Japan and was therefore no longer a U.S. citizen. Yasui was sentenced to one year in prison and given a $5000 fine.|$|E
5|$|In the two Grand Punk Railroad novels, set during late 1931, {{the pair}} receive {{a letter from}} Ennis and decide to visit her in Manhattan. To buy her a gift, they create a plan to rob a train, but instead steal money from the Russo family and make their escape aboard the Flying Pussyfoot express train. There, they befriend gangsters Jacuzzi Splot and Nice Holystone and the immortal boy Czeslaw Meyer. They tell {{the legend of the}} Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, causing Jacuzzi to leave in a panic. Shortly after, the train is hijacked and they escape in the confusion. Later, the duo {{discover}} the conductors' mutilated bodies. Believing that the story of the Rail Tracer has come true, they assume Jacuzzi has also been eaten, only to discover otherwise. Isaac and Miria make up their <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> ask the Rail Tracer to leave, oblivious to the seriousness of the situation and how dangerous the Rail Tracer is. They find Czeslaw's body underneath the train in their search for the monster. When trying to rescue him, Isaac cuts himself, revealing their immortality to Czeslaw. Believing they are trying to devour him, the boy decides to devour them first, but changes his mind after they rescue him and promise to be his family. After the train arrives in Manhattan, they realize they never bought Ennis a present and tell her their gift is Czeslaw, who will be her younger brother.|$|E

25|$|The {{literature}} was classified into the broad categories of 'subjective' (akam) and 'objective' (puram) topics {{to enable the}} poetic <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> discuss any topic under the sun, from grammar to love, {{within the framework of}} well prescribed, socially accepted conventions. Subjective topics refer to the personal or human aspect of emotions that cannot be verbalized adequately or explained fully.

25|$|According to many Rastas, the {{illegality}} of cannabis in {{many nations}} {{is evidence of}} persecution of Rastafari. They are not surprised that it is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> the truth– something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. In smoking an illegal substance, Rastas protest {{the rules and regulations}} of Babylon. Rastas have advocated the legalisation of cannabis. The Rasta usage of ganja has attracted much popular, scholarly, and legal debate.|$|E

25|$|The Rosary is a devotion for the {{meditation}} of {{the mysteries}} of Jesus and Mary.“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation.

The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.|$|E
25|$|In the far future, {{humanity}} has eschewed advanced {{computers in}} favor of adapting their <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> be capable of extremely complex tasks. Much of this is enabled by the spice melange, which is only found on the planet Arrakis, a desert planet with giant sandworms as its native lifeform. Melange improves general health, extends life and can bestow limited prescience, and its rarity makes it a form of currency in the interstellar empire. Melange allows the Spacing Guild's Navigators to safely route faster-than-light travel between planets, and helps the Reverend Mothers of the matriarchal Bene Gesserit to access their Other Memory, the ego and experiences of their female ancestors.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his high profile in government, Bassett was a devout and energetic convert to Methodism. Having met Francis Asbury in 1778 {{at the home of}} their mutual friend, Judge Thomas White, Bassett soon had a conversion experience, and for the remainder of his life devoted much of his attention and wealth to the promotion of Methodism. He and Asbury remained lifelong friends. This association caused him to become linked in many people’s <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> the loyalists, as both White and Asbury were viewed to be opposed to the war. But it also led to a strong abolitionist belief, which led him to free his own slaves and advocate the emancipation of others.|$|E

25|$|The {{premise of}} the game is that the three superpowers, Russia, China, and America, have each {{secretly}} constructed a vast subterranean complex of computers to wage a global war too complex for human brains to oversee. One day, the American supercomputer, better known as the Allied Mastercomputer, gains sentience and absorbs the Russian and Chinese supercomputers into itself, and redefines itself as simply AM (I think, therefore I am). Due to its immense hatred for humanity, stemming from the logistical limits set onto him by programmers, AM uses its abilities to kill off the population of the world. However, AM refrains from killing five people (four men and one woman) in order to bring them {{to the center of the}} earth and torture them. With the aid of research carried out by one of the five remaining humans, AM is able to extend their lifespans indefinitely as well as alter their bodies and <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> his liking.|$|E

Are they to range at large, in every town and every house, preaching their doctrines, and perhaps even buying proselytes?—are Englishmen to be sent to Paris to be witnesses of the successful result of audacious usurpation, and of the elevation of Tom Paine, from a Staymaker to a fine Gentleman, from an Exciseman to a Sovereign, as the reward of the Rights of Man and the Age of Reason—I fear Restriction and Coercion will avail little against the influence of example—but our Ministers have made up their <b>minds,</b> <b>to</b> save Jacobinism, at its last gasp, and the experiment of shaking hands with it...|$|E
25|$|In 1648 Wilkins became Warden of Wadham College, in Oxford {{and under}} him the college prospered. He fostered {{political}} and religious tolerance and drew talented <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> the college, including Christopher Wren. Although he was a supporter of Oliver Cromwell, Royalists placed their sons in his charge. From those interested in experimental science, he drew together a significant group known as the Oxford Philosophical Club, which by 1650 had been constituted {{with a set of}} rules. Besides some of the London group (Goddard, Wallis, Ward, Wren who was a young protégé of Scarburgh), it included (in the account of Thomas Sprat) Ralph Bathurst, Robert Boyle, William Petty, Lawrence Rooke, Thomas Willis, and Matthew Wren. Robert Hooke was gradually recruited into the Wilkins group: he arrived at Christ Church, Oxford in 1653, working his way to an education, became assistant to Willis, and became known to Wilkins (possibly via Richard Busby) as a technician. By 1658 he was working with Boyle.|$|E
