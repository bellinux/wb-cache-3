No Hungarian after Communism, or Cuban after Castro, is {{not aware that}} human rights are {{incompatible}} with cruelty. The debate here isn’t only how to protect the country. It’s how to protect our values." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{mother was}} a captive princess here," [...] replied A-Kor. [...] "I but do for the Princess of Helium what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> me do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} was {{impossible}} or unreasonable," [...] he said. [...] "I could have been ordained as curate there, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gladly given land, and means, and all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know," [...] she answered. [...] "But even to {{the last}} Monsieur Feurgéres hesitated. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> wished me to be miserable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, indeed, count. Certainly, when I {{crossed the}} seas to take service here, I little thought how terrible was the {{struggle}} that was approaching. If we had known it, I {{am sure that}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> let me leave home." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> fain <b>have</b> had the vaults {{under the}} mullion rooms bricked up, but Mr. Stafford cried {{out on the}} barbarism of such a proceeding. The mystery was {{declared}} to be solved, and was added to Mr. Stafford's good stories of haunted houses.|$|R
60|$|From {{any other}} than Hal <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken such a remark, made even in jest, as {{an insult to}} her sex. But Hal's smile was a coating that could sugar any pill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very; but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been unhappy if I {{had stayed}} away. It is the leaving the poor child that grieves me. She is in a fearful state, between sore throat, starvation, and blows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then, I {{will have}} the {{drawbridge}} raised and the gates closed. I am glad, indeed, {{that we have had}} time given us for them all to enter. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been very grieved, if harm had come to any of them.|$|E
6000|$|Raymond {{felt for}} the mortification, and was unwilling to cross her again, so he said, [...] "I will ask whether <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> object to <b>having</b> the piano moved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} your feeling, Cyril, but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> assuredly <b>would</b> always <b>have</b> been {{pleased to see}} you. You know you were a favourite of hers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So would I," [...] {{returned}} Roger Morr, wistfully. [...] "I know <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>have</b> somebody find it--just {{to learn}} {{if it is}} really as valuable as Uncle Maurice thought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know that}} I behaved badly," [...] she murmured, [...] "but think how poor we were, and oh, how weary I was of poverty. If I had refused Major Delahaye I think that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> turned {{me out of}} doors. I wrote and told you all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{one that}} I know of," [...] she replied quickly. [...] "I care {{not for the}} braves; but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a sore heart if I did not return. Yet I fear to go back, for that Idazoo will tell, and perhaps they will kill me for helping you to escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Mr. Caryll's soul fell {{once more}} into travail. [...] "Wait!" [...] he cried. [...] "Ah, wait!" [...] His level glance met Sir Richard's in earnestness and entreaty. [...] "Answer {{me the truth}} upon your soul and conscience: Do you in your heart {{believe that it is}} what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had me do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} her brother falteringly, beseechingly--in awe of his decision, yet unable to go without making a plea for this father who was like {{something}} that had grown in her flesh with pain. She went close to her brother, and putting her hand in his, said, in a low voice, but not so low as to be unheard by Lapidoth, [...] "Remember, Ezra--you said <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> shut him out." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{grandfather}} Mordaunt, notwithstanding {{his handsome}} bequests to me, left {{the bulk of}} his estate to <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made {{the rest of the family}} rich, had it not been for the dilapidations produced by the war. But the houses and stores in town were without tenants who paid, having been mainly occupied by the enemy; and interest on bonds was hard to collect from those who lived within the British lines.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{no right}} to talk to me so," [...] she answered, with {{flashing}} eyes, [...] "though I am your daughter, and it is cowardly to reproach me with my birth, my sex, and my dependence. Am I responsible for any of these things? But I will not burden you long. And as to what you wanted me to do, and think such a little of, I ask you, is it what <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wished her daughter----" ...|$|R
60|$|That the old man-at-arms {{should have}} exerted a strong {{attraction}} upon my young mind, you will readily understand. His intimate connection with that dimly remembered father, who stood secretly {{in my imagination}} in the position that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had St. Augustine occupy, drew me to his equerry like metal to a lodestone.|$|E
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. Well, sir, to {{you that}} have an estate in it, it would feel like your country. But the divil a perch of it ever I owned. And as to the king: God help him, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken the skin off my back if I'd ever let on to have any other king than Parnell.|$|E
6000|$|She {{followed}} the girl down stairs; recalling to her memory the strange words addressed {{to her by}} Geoffrey, {{in the presence of}} the servants, on the evening before. Was she now to know what those words really meant? The doubt would soon be set at rest. [...] "Be the trial what it may," [...] she thought to herself, [...] "let me bear it as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> borne it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{say that}} it is nonsense. If you had never sent that wretched blackguard down to {{fabricate}} lies at Nuncombe Putney, <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> repose <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been all right. As it is, Mrs. Trevelyan can remain where she is till after Christmas. There is not the least necessity for removing her at once. I only meant to say that the arrangement should not be regarded as altogether permanent. I must go to my work now. Good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{can never}} be sure of a woman," [...] he answered. [...] "And it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been so difficult. There was a girl down in Scotland, one of the village girls. It wasn't {{anything}} really. We had just been children together. But they all thought I had gone away to make my fortune so as {{to come back and}} marry her--even <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> looked so mean if after getting on I had married a fine London lady. I could never have gone home again." ...|$|R
60|$|And Chapman was right. The unaccountable noises {{broke out}} again-- screaming, wailing, sobbing--sounds {{scarcely}} within {{the power of}} cat or rat, but possibly {{the effect of the}} wind in the old building. At any rate, Griff could not stand them, and declared that sleep was impossible when the wind was in that quarter, so that he must shift his bedroom elsewhere, though he still wished to retain the outer apartment, which he had taken pleasure in adorning with his special possessions. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> scarcely <b>have</b> tolerated such fancies in any one else, but Griff had his privileges.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea, sir," [...] said Cis, {{recovering}} herself, [...] "none {{save the}} very few who tended her, the Queen at Lochleven, know who I verily am. Such as {{were aware of the}} babe being put on board ship at Dunbar, thought me the daughter of a Scottish archer, a Hepburn, and she, the Queen <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>would,</b> <b>have</b> me pass as such to those who needs must know I am not myself." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{found these}} winter days very long {{had it not}} been for baby Jessie, for father was busily hauling wood from the Cedar River some six or seven miles away, and the almost incessant, mournful piping of the wind in the chimney was dispiriting. Occasionally Mrs. Button, Mrs. Gammons or some other of the neighbors would drop in for a visit, but {{generally}} mother and Jessie were alone till Harriet and Frank and I came home from school at half-past four.|$|E
6000|$|She was {{the chief}} {{disappointment}} to me. I had expected to find, not indeed my little playfellow, but my own loving sister Nan; and this young lady was like a stranger. I thought, too, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been less lively, she {{seemed to me to}} have forgotten everything in the satisfaction of being at Paris. At first I feared she was looking at me with displeasure, but presently I observed that she had discarded her widow's veil, and looked annoyed that I still wore mine. Otherwise she was agreeable surprised in me, and turned to M. de Solivet, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|To her, however, at once {{imaginative and}} of a feeble and {{dependent}} spirit, the name was fateful. St. Monica was made the special object of her devotions in girlhood, and remained so later when she became a wife. The Life of St. Monica was the most soiled and fingered portion of an old manuscript collection of the life histories of a score or so of saints {{that was one of}} her dearest possessions. To render herself worthy of the name she bore, to model her life upon that of the sainted woman who had sorrowed and rejoiced so much in her famous offspring, became the obsession of <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> soul. And but that St. Monica had wed and borne a son, I do not believe that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> adventured herself within the bonds of wedlock.|$|R
60|$|It was Henry {{who called}} <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> {{attention}} to the fact that the thread with which she had sewed my collar together to keep me from going in swimming, <b>had</b> changed color. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> discovered it but for that, and she was manifestly piqued when she recognized that that prominent bit of circumstantial evidence had escaped her sharp eye. That detail probably added a detail to my punishment. It is human. We generally visit our shortcomings on somebody else when there is a possible excuse for it--but no matter, I took it out of Henry. There is always compensation for such as are unjustly used. I often took it out of him--sometimes as an advance payment for something which I hadn't yet done. These were occasions when the opportunity was too strong a temptation, and I had to draw on the future. I did not need to copy this idea from <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and probably didn't. Still she wrought upon that principle upon occasion.|$|R
60|$|It {{gave me a}} {{great deal}} to consider, knowing, as I did full well, that poor Dermot's {{acquaintance}} was not likely to bring him into favour with society, even if it were not dangerous in itself. And <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been delighted at my day, a thing I had totally forgotten in the pleasantness of having someone to talk to; for it was six weeks since I had spoken to anyone beyond the family, except Miss Woolmer. Besides, it was Dermot! And that was enough to move me in itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite true. Poor young gentleman, {{he was to}} {{have married}} that cousin of his mother's, Mistress Martha Browning, living at Emsworth. She came on a visit, and they think she brought the infection, for she sickened at once, and though she had it favourably, is much disfigured. Master Oliver caught it and died in three days, and all the house were down with it. They say poor Mrs. Oakshott forgot her ailments and went to and fro among them all. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone to help in their need {{if she had been}} as well as she used to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, {{after the}} {{purchase}} of the estate was made, and my papers for selling out were sent home, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had me marry a person of her choosing, but by no means of mine. You remember Miss Betsy Pitts at Williamsburgh? She is in no wise improved by having had her face dreadfully scarred with small-pock, and though Madam Esmond saith the young lady hath every virtue, I own her virtues did not suit me. Her eyes do not look straight; she hath one leg shorter than another; and oh, brother! didst thou never remark Fanny's ankles when we were boys? Neater I never saw at the Opera.|$|E
60|$|At {{that time}} I think my father, Thorvald, {{was away from}} home {{with most of the}} men, I do not know why; but Ragnar, Steinar and I were {{lingering}} about the stead with little or nothing to do, since the time of sowing was not yet. At the news of the club-footed man, we ran for our spears, and one of us went to tell the only thrall who could be spared to make ready the horses and come with us. Thora, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> stopped us--she said she had heard from her father that such bears were very dangerous beasts--but Ragnar only thrust her aside, while I kissed her and told her not to fret.|$|E
60|$|So I {{gave him}} my word that I would come, {{and then all the}} rest of the day I went about the most sad-faced lad in Sussex. It was all very well for Boy Jim! It was that pride of his which was taking him there. He would go because there was no one else on the country side that would dare. But I had no pride of that sort. I was quite of the same way of {{thinking}} as the others, and <b>would</b> as soon <b>have</b> thought of passing my night at Jacob's gibbet on Ditchling Common as in the haunted house of Cliffe Royal. Still, I could not bring myself to desert Jim; and so, as I say, I slunk about the house with so pale and peaky a face that <b>my</b> dear <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> it that I had been at the green apples, and sent me to bed early with a dish of camomile tea for my supper.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{present and}} the future are both in His hands, Mrs. Orme. I know <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> innocence, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done a son's part towards {{establishing}} it;--but she would not allow me. All this will soon be over now, and then, I trust, she and I will once again understand each other. Till then I doubt whether I shall be wise to interfere. Good morning, Mrs. Orme; and pray believe that I appreciate at its full worth all that you are doing for her." [...] Then he again lifted his hat and left her.|$|R
500|$|In 1874, Wallace {{visited the}} spirit {{photographer}} Frederick Hudson. A photograph {{of him with}} his deceased mother was produced and Wallace declared the photograph genuine, declaring [...] "even if he had by some means obtained possession of all the photographs ever taken of <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> they <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been of the slightest use {{to him in the}} manufacture of these pictures. I see no escape from the conclusion that some spiritual being, acquainted with <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> various aspects during life, produced these recognisable impressions on the plate." [...] However, Hudson's photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in 1872.|$|R
