50|$|The <b>Mache</b> (<b>unit)</b> is {{the amount}} of radon in one liter that will produce a {{saturation}} current of 0.001 electrostatic unit (ESU) of current and is equivalent to 364 pCi L−1. The eman (emanation) unit, used in the 1920s and 1930s, is equivalent to 100 pCi L−1.|$|E
40|$|The author {{determined}} the radon {{content of the}} thermal waters of Misasa, Tottori Prefecture Japan, at various times after flowing out, and obtained the following results: 1) The velocity of variation is expressed by a simple equation {{with respect to the}} radon content. At thermal temperaturee of 41. 5 - 41. 8 °C and room temperature of 24. 3 - 28. 0 °C, a following exrerimental equation was obtained, u:;ing a beaker with a inner diameter of about 17 cm and a height of 27 cm, log a = - 0, 0048 t + 2. 59 a: radon content in <b>Mache</b> <b>unit.</b> t : time in minute. 2) A close relation was observed between the room temperature and the rate of variation of radon, and also between the thermal temperature and the rate of variation of radon, that is, the rate of variaton of radon was proportional to the room temperature and the thermal temperature respectivly, as it is clearly seen from the distribution coefficient of radon. 3) There exists a c 1 ose relation between the velocity of variation of radon and the surface area being in contact with air, that is, the velocity was generally proportional to the square root of the surface area, or to the radius of the surface. 4) The velocity of variation of radon content was roughly inversely proportional to relative humidity of air. 5) Betweeen the range of sodium chloride concentrations from 0. 1 to 40. 1 g. per liter no difference was proved concerning the velocities of variation in radon content...|$|E
50|$|The three springs {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} spa town of Therma (located 3 km East of Agios Kirykos port and 12 km from the island's airport) have a water temperature ranging between 45 and 52.8 degrees celsius (113-127 Fahrenheit). The radioactivity of the water covers a spectrum from 65 to 557 <b>Mache</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
40|$|The author {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the radioactive thermal bath upon the carbohydrate metabolism and the leucocyte picture in alloxan-diabetic rabbits. 1. The author injected 100 - 200 mg. of alloxan per kg. of body weight intravenously into normal rabbits and produced alloxan diabetes. The triphasic blood sugar response to the injection of alloxan is illustrated in Table 1. and Fig. 1. About a week after the injection of alloxan, the fasting blood sugar values ranged 127 to 331 mg. /dl. (Table　 3.). 2. In this experiment the alloxan-diabetic rabbits were put in radioactive hot spring and plain water bath, 42 - 44 ℃. in temperature. The radioactive hot springs put in use are "Hisui-no-Yu" and "Kenkyusho-sen" (the Loboratory-Spring), both in Misasa Spa, the chemical compositions of which are given in Table 2. 3. In any case, the blood sugar level rose temporarily after the thermal baths for 5 minutes, but the 24 -hour blood sugar value after taking a　bath was lower in "Hisui-no-Yu" (Rn: 300 - 400 <b>Mache</b> <b>units)</b> than in "Kenkyusho-sen" (Rn: 10 - 30 <b>Mache</b> <b>units)</b> (Table 3 and Fig. 2). 4. The glucose tolerance was found to be abnormal in alloxan-diabetic rabbits even 3 months after the injection of alloxan, but this abnormal carbohydrate metabolism tended to become normal by the radioactive thermal bath (Table 5, 6 and Fig. 3, 5.). 5. The radioactive thermal bath in "Hisui-no-Yu" caused increase of leucocyte counts of alloxan-diabetic rabbits more remarkably than the bath in "Kenkyusho-sen" (Table 8. and Fig. 6) ...|$|R
50|$|His {{research}} was mainly radioactivity, thermodynamics, atmospheric electricity, and {{the physics of}} combustion phenomena. He developed with Ludwig Flamm a theory of combustion of explosive gas mixtures. Due to his work with radon, the now unusual <b>unit</b> <b>Mache</b> was named for describing the activity of radioactive medicinal waters.|$|R
