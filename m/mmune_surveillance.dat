40|$|Dendritic cells {{provide a}} {{critical}} link between innate and acquired immunity. In this study, we {{demonstrate that the}} bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can efficiently kill these professional phagocytes via a mechanism that is dependent on sipB and the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 -encoded type III protein secretion system. Rapid phosphatidylserine redistribution, caspase activation, and loss of plasma membrane integrity were characteristic of dendritic cells infected with wild-type Salmonella, but not sipB mutant bacteria. Caspase- 1 was particularly important in this process because Salmonella-induced dendritic cell death was dramatically reduced {{in the presence of}} a caspase- 1 -specific inhibitor. Furthermore, dendritic cells obtained from caspase- 1 -deficient mice, but not heterozygous littermate control mice, were resistant to Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that Salmonella have evolved the ability to selectively kill professional APCs to combat, exploit, or evade immune defense mechanisms. The Journal of Immunology, 2003, 171 : 6742 – 6749. I <b>mmune</b> <b>surveillance</b> mediated by dendritic cell is of centralimportance in innate and acquired immunity. To engage Tlymphocytes during infection, dendritic cells internalize and destroy invading microbes and display pathogen-derived peptides on their surface in the context of MHC molecules (1 – 4). Recog-nition of Ag by T cells is critically important in acquired resistance against a variety of microbes, including the facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S...|$|E
