5|$|The {{handwriting}} of {{the text}} {{from the beginning of}} Luke to 1 Corinthians 10:8, differs from that of the rest parts of the manuscript. Some letters have Coptic shapes (f.e. Α, Μ, Δ, and Π). The letters are more widely spaced and are a little larger than elsewhere. Delta has extended base and Pi has extended cross-stroke. Numerals are not expressed by letters except in Apocalypse 7:4; 21:17. In the past the codex had been judged to be carelessly written, with many errors of transcription, but not so many as in the Codex Sinaiticus, nor <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Codex Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|After his selection, Hextall {{remained}} with Brandon for two further seasons. He played 44games in 1982–83, recording a GAA of 5.77 during {{a season in}} which the Wheat Kings did not qualify for the playoffs. The following year was his most successful in the WHL: a GAA of 4.29 across his 46regular season games, which included 29wins – <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous two seasons combined. He played in ten of the twelve playoff games, recording five wins and five losses, with a GAA of 3.75. During the 1983–84 season, Hextall set a record for the most penalty minutes accumulated by a goaltender, being assessed for 117 minutes during the regular season.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the emphasis on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose was {{a smaller}} {{community}} during the war, but it kept going. Once again, union with Lincoln College was discussed: {{but in other}} areas, temporary merger was more appropriate; thus, Brasenose and Christ Church fielded single sports teams. The College hosted military personnel {{as it had in}} the First World War; a Nissen hut was even set up in Deer Park. Brasenose sent a flood of undergraduates into the forces; in particular, the college's sporting, masculine ethos meant many joined the Royal Air Force. This would contribute significantly to a high death total– 123 for the Allies and 1 for the Germans– <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First World War, although proportionately less. Many of Brasenose's sporting heroes died; among survivors were future Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie and cricketer Pieter van der Bijl.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to retelling the plot from Metroid, Metroid: Zero Mission introduces new cinematics {{to push the}} story forward. Sakamoto believed {{in the importance of}} having a story to complement a game. He found it particularly difficult to convey the game's plot accurately {{in a way that the}} player can understand, because of the sparse use of dialogue in the Metroid series. The story for Metroid: Zero Mission was rewritten to explore Samus Aran's backstory <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original Metroid. Cinematics are used to show Samus' memories to move the story forward and to keep the plot open for interpretation. Sakamoto claimed that this was intended to expand the original story while retaining some mystery. The game is the first Metroid game to let the player choose a difficulty level at the start of the game; each of three levels varies in the amount of damage caused by enemies. The battle with Mother Brain marked the end of the original Metroid; however, Metroid: Zero Mission offers players extra levels to play after the battle.|$|E

Members of this group work to help people locally by {{collecting}} food and delivering it to food banks in and around New Kensington. Within the church, it is seen as a great honor {{to be part of this}} society and the members believe that the best help lies in the people they are <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> caring acts they perform. They all work together to help others and they continually strive to become better Catholics.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the XVIII Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Nagano, Japan, from 7 to 22 February 1998. A total of 2,176 athletes {{representing}} 72 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) (5 <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1994 Olympics) participated in 68 events (7 more than in 1994) from 14 sports and disciplines (2 more than in 1994). The sport of curling returned after a single appearance in the 1928 Olympics, snowboarding was added as a new sport, and women's ice hockey made its first appearance in the Olympics. Twenty-four NOCs earned medals at these Games, and fifteen won at least one gold medal; forty-eight NOCs left the Olympics without winning a medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. The mandate applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. Critics claimed that the mandate created a perverse incentive for business to keep their full-time headcount below 50 and to hire part-time workers instead. Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} full-time jobs increased by 2 million. In the public sector full-time jobs turned into part-time jobs much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> private sector. A 2016 study found only limited evidence that ACA had increased part-time employment.|$|E

5|$|U2's 2005–2006 Vertigo Tour was {{preceded by}} several complications. A sudden illness to the Edge's {{daughter}} nearly resulted in the tour's cancellation, before the group decided to adjust the tour schedule to accommodate her treatment. Additionally, ticket presales on the band's website were plagued with issues, as subscribing members encountered technical glitches and limited ticket availability, partially due to scalpers exploiting the system. Commencing in March 2005, the Vertigo Tour consisted of arena shows in North America and stadium shows internationally across five legs. The indoor stage replaced the heart-shaped ramp of the Elevation Tour with an elliptical one and featured retractable video curtains around the stage, while the stadium stage used a massive LED video screen. Setlists on tour varied <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group's past and included songs they had not played in decades. Like its predecessor, the Vertigo Tour was a commercial success, ranking as the top-earning tour of 2005 with US$260million grossed.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009 close season, {{there were}} rumours linking Žigić with moves to clubs {{including}} Sunderland, Monaco, and Bordeaux, but the player insisted his intention was and {{always had been}} to be successful with Valencia. He made 26 appearances for the club in 2009–10 in all competitions, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous two seasons combined, but only 5 were league starts. Within four minutes of replacing the injured David Villa in the league match against Racing in October, he took advantage of a defensive error to score the only goal of the game; {{out of respect for}} his former club, he did not celebrate. On 2 January 2010, his 93rd-minute header against Espanyol took Valencia third in the table, and his double against Deportivo La Coruña in the 2009–10 Copa del Rey put Valencia 2–0 up at half-time; the game finished 2–2 and Valencia lost 4–3 on aggregate. With four minutes left of the Europa League quarter-final second leg, Valencia were denied a penalty when an Atlético Madrid defender pulled Žigić to the ground so forcefully that a large hole was torn in the front of his shirt, apparently unnoticed by referee or goalline official; the tie ended goalless, so Atlético progressed on away goals from the first leg and {{went on to win the}} competition. Away to Espanyol on 1 May, again as a substitute for Villa, he scored both goals in a 2–0 win that secured Valencia a place in the next season's Champions League.|$|E
