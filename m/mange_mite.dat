The study showed that the prevalence of <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> in sheep and goats was 3. 34 % and 5. 94 %, respectively. From 197 and 613, young and adult small ruminants examined for mange mites the recorded prevalence rate was 6. 09 % and 4. 61 %, respectively whereas among 373 and 437, male and female small ruminants examined for mange mites the prevalence rate of 4. 02 and 5. 26 % was recorded, respectively. The prevalence rate recorded in lowland and midland was 4. 22 % and 2. 77 %, respectively. No statistically significant association was observed between the prevalence rate and different species, age and sex of the animals (p> 0. 05). However, there was statistically significant association between the prevalence rate of mange infestation and agro-ecological zones (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{determine}} the prevalence of <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> of goats, their species composition and associated risk factors in and around Kombolcha, Northeastern Ethiopia. Both questionnaire and cross-sectional study were employed. The result of the questionnaire survey indicated that goats were the main species of animals owned by the farmers and mange was a known and considered as an important disease by small ruminant holders. The cross sectional study {{was carried out}} on 350 goats (238 female and 112 male). Accordingly the overall infestation rate of mange mites was 11. 7 % (41 of 350). Prevalence of 5. 1 % and 6. 6 % was observed in and around Kombolcha, respectively; however, there was insignificant difference (P> 0. 05) in the two study areas. The highest level of infestation was observed in female adult goats (9. 1 %) than in male adult goats (2. 6 %). However, there was no statistically significant difference (P> 0. 05) between the different age and sex groups. On the other hand, the prevalence of mange mites in poor body conditioned (7. 4 %) animals was significantly higher than (P< 0. 05) those of the good body condition (3. 1 %) animals. With regard to species composition Sarcoptes sp. and Demodex sp. were identified with the prevalence of 10. 6 % and 1. 1 %, respectively. Demodex sp. was not observed on good body conditioned and young goats, whereas, Sarcoptes sp. were found on both poor and good body condition as well as in different age groups. In conclusion, <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> of goats had been observed to decrease in its extent of infestation problem because of the endeavors on disease control launched in the study area.

The structures of all compounds, including 12 new ones, were elucidated by analysis of UV, IR, NMR, ESI-MS, HR-MS spectra and X-ray diffraction experiments.

Compound 1 showed the strongest activity, with a 50 % lethal concentration value (LC 50) of 0. 2421 μg/mL and 50 % lethal time value (LT 50) of 7. 79 h, comparable to the standard drug ivermectin (LC 50 = 0. 2474 μg/mL; LT 50 = 20. 9 h).

40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{the spread of}} parasites by animal movements in small ruminant farms; it focuses in dissemination of parasitic forms {{that would lead to}} subsequent infection of sheep or goats. Systems of small ruminant production involve a component of animal movement (e. g., grazing) as part of routine husbandry, which favors spread of parasitic forms; that refers mainly to parasites of the digestive system (nematodes, trematodes, cestodes, protozoa), as well as helminthes of the respiratory system, although dissemination of the various parasitic forms in the environment would not always result to subsequent infection; external parasites may also be disseminated during movements, e. g., to inhabit wooden poles used in fencing. New livestock into a farm constitutes a biosecurity hazard and the most common means to introducing new parasitic pathogens into a farm; in contemporary small ruminant health management, this contributes in dissemination of anthelmintic resistant parasitic strains; other parasitic disease agents (e. g., <b>mange</b> <b>mites,</b> ticks) may also be spread into a farm that way. Often, especially in small scale farming, visits of rams or bucks take place from one farm to another during the mating season; in such cases, ectoparasites (e. g., <b>mange</b> <b>mites)</b> can be disseminated through direct contact of animals, as well other pathogens (e. g., Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum) via the semen. During transportation of sheep/goats, parasitic forms can also spread, as well as during movement of sheep or goats to slaughterhouses, in which case dogs present in these places would contribute to their dissemination. Spread of life forms of various parasites can also occur from animal species present in the environment of sheep or goats; these include animals present within a farm, stray dogs roaming around a farm (e. g., for spread of Multiceps multiceps, Echinococcus granulosus, Taenia hydatigena, N. caninum), cats commanding the environment of a farm (e. g., for spread of T. gondii), cats or rats responsible for dissemination of fleas, which may also be spread by humans as well, and, finally, wildlife animals. Finally, life forms of parasites of small ruminants may be also spread indirectly, by material associated with sheep or goats (e. g., materials of humans visiting farms, animal feeds) that had been contaminated by faecal material of animals. © 2015 Elsevier B.
