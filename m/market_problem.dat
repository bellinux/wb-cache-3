According to the results, the most important problems of these managements are: the difficulty of following technology,inadequte demand, difficulty of costumer satistification, cheating and confusing advertisements, excessive competition, and not having talented and educated salesmen. Against these problems, it is understood that service, product, pricing and advertising are mostly focused by the managements. The research results indicate a meaningful relationship between <b>marketing</b> <b>problems</b> and the <b>marketing</b> applications. On the other hand, it’s seen that marketing applications aren’t used efficiently by the hotels and as a result, the managements are inefficient in solving their <b>marketing</b> <b>problems.</b> SMEs, hotel managements, <b>marketing,</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>problems.</b> ...|$|R

In a 2013 interview with Nautilus magazine, Zhang said he did not get a job after graduation. [...] "During that period it was difficult to find a job in academics. That was a job <b>market</b> <b>problem.</b> Also, my advisor did not write me letters of recommendation." [...] The reason behind this is that Zhang's research pointed out the mistakes made by his advisor Tzuong-Tsieng Moh's previous work. Moh was very unhappy with this and refused to write the job recommendation letter for Zhang. Zhang made this claim again in George Csicsery’s documentary film Counting From Infinity while discussing his difficulties at Purdue and in the years that followed. Tzuong-Tsieng Moh, his Ph.D. advisor at Purdue, said that Zhang never came back to him requesting recommendation letters. In a detailed profile published in The New Yorker magazine in February 2015, Alec Wilkinson wrote Zhang [...] "parted unhappily" [...] with Moh, and that Zhang [...] "left Purdue without Moh’s support, and, having published no papers, was unable to find an academic job". After some years, Zhang managed to find a position as a lecturer at the University of New Hampshire, where he was hired by Kenneth Appel in 1999.|$|E

However, quite a few <b>marketing</b> <b>problems</b> are “extraordinary ” and “wicked ” since they tend to arise from non-deterministic, socially complex and economically turbulent environments. We argue here that many <b>marketing</b> <b>problems</b> a) are “wicked”, b) to begin with, one can merely tame (rather than totally resolve) them using distributive and corrective justice principles, and c) over time with each successive resolutions, organizations can learn paths toward more complete resolutions.

40|$|In my dissertation, I {{focus on}} {{resource}} reallocation problem. Specifically, I consider the housing <b>market</b> <b>problem.</b> In this problem, {{there is a}} group of agents and a group of objects. Each agent owns at most one object and each object is owned by at most one agent. Agents have preferences over objects. The goal is to reallocate these objects among agents while satisfying desirable properties; Pareto efficiency (not possible to make someone better-off without making someone worse-off), individual rationality (each agent is assigned an object at least as good as her endowment), strategy proofness (no agent has an incentive to lie) and weak-core selection (no group of agents can trade among themselves such that each of them becomes better-off). In addition, I consider this problem while allowing agents to be indifferent between objects. Recently, favorable results have been established for such problems. It has been proved that Pareto efficient, weak-core selecting (hence, individually rational) and strategy proof rules exist for such problems. I consider additional properties for the housing <b>market</b> <b>problem</b> with indifferences. I show that there are rules which, in addition to the aforementioned properties, satisfy no justified-envy for agents with identical endowments and weak group strategy proofness even though Pareto efficiency and group strategy proofness are incompatible under the assumption of indifferences. I achieve this by providing sufficient conditions for weak group strategy proofness. Then, I propose a procedural enhancement which prioritizes the outcome achieved without violating strategy proofness. I show that some of the existing rules do not satisfy this criterion. So, I propose a new mechanism which satisfies this property in addition to other desirable results. Additionally, I present an amended version of sufficient condition for strategy proofness for housing <b>market</b> <b>problem</b> with weak preferences. I also consider random assignment solutions to housing <b>market</b> <b>problem</b> which is referred to as fractional housing <b>market</b> <b>problem</b> in literature. For general and strict preferences, several impossibility results have been established for such problems. I show that for a restricted class of preferences, trichotomous preferences, these impossibility results do not hold...|$|E

40|$|In 1957, 1567 {{acres of}} hybrid seed corn were {{approved}} for certification. This was the smallest annual number of acres reported {{during the period}} 1948 through 1957. Two of the factors responsible for this decline were:(1) intensive price competition between certified grower-sellers had resulted in low prices and elimination of many certified growers, and (2) most of the certified grower-sellers had very small seed volumes and could not finance adequate advertising and sales promotion programs. The <b>marketing</b> <b>problems</b> of certified growers were discussed during {{the annual meeting of}} Nebraska Certified Hybrid Seed Corn Producers Association in March 1958 and in June 1958 the Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association was formed and incorporated as a marketing cooperative of certified growers. The objectives of this study are: To describe the marketing system of hybrid seed corn in Nebraska, including the channels of distribution for certified hybrid seed corn and commercial hybrid seed corn, and the importance of the various distributors. To describe the hybrid seed corn market in Nebraska with respect to: its structure, supply and demand, production, processing, and marketing cots, average seed prices, and marketing margins. To evaluate the success of the Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association in resolving the <b>marketing</b> <b>problem</b> of certified hybrid seed corn growers. Certified growers have been doing an excellent job of producing and processing hybrid seed corn. Although the quality of the certified growers’ processing operations is high, costs could be reduced by hiring custom operators to perform these operations. In addition, marketing operations of some of the certified grower-sellers have not been too effective. From the limited marketing information obtained in the survey of certified growers, there were indications that small volume (200 to 1000 bushels) certified grower-sellers still have <b>marketing</b> <b>problems</b> which were prevalent in 1957. Larger volume certified grower-sellers apparently have solved some of their <b>marketing</b> <b>problems,</b> and have been more effective than small volume certified grower-sellers in marketing their seed. The Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association, established in 1958 to market hybrid seed corn for its certified grower-members, has encountered and apparently solved some of the <b>marketing</b> <b>problems.</b> However, other <b>marketing</b> <b>problems</b> remain for future solution. Since the Association has been in operation only two years, its success in resolving the <b>marketing</b> <b>problems</b> of certified grower-members cannot be substantiated at this time. Advisor: C.
