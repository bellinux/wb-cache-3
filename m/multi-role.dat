40|$|Abstract- In general, {{software}} development consists of requirements analysis, system analysis, system design, implementation, and testing. Among these phases, requirements analysis {{plays an important}} role during the {{software development}}. How to capture customerâ€™s desired requirements precisely is a great challenge. Many efforts {{have been made in the}} area of requirements engineering. The most used approach is using goal-oriented approach to capture, analyze, and elaborate requirements. However, few efforts have been invested to investigate software requirements development by a group of team members. In this paper, we present a collaborative method and process to develop software requirements on a network-based collaborative platform. There are <b>multi-roles</b> and each of the roles performs a number of tasks of requirements writing, reviewing, and commenting at the same time on the network-based environment. Different roles are in charge of different tasks. Based on the collaborative method, a number of role relationships are proposed. In order to achieve the purpose of collaborative working, the platform provides several collaborative services to satisfy the need of developing requirements of a software system. All users carry out their work through different collaborative patterns. After all stakeholders finish their authoring of requirements, the integrated software requirements document will be generated...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the association between involvement in bullying and victimization and internalizing difficulties such as self-esteem, social anxiety, depression and body image. Possible gender differences were also examined. The participants, high school students from Southern Ontario (N= 533), were drawn from a larger, data set as part ofa study that was completed by the Youth Lifestyle Choices: Community Research Alliance (YLCCURA). The students completed a self-report questionnaire on a number ofmeasures; including, bullying, victimization, self-esteem, social anxiety, depression and body image. The {{results of this study}} suggest that those students who self-identified as victims and bully-victims also report higher levels of anxiety and depression than controls and bullies. Severe victims and bullyvictims had a lower body image than severe bullies and controls, whereas severe bullies seem to have a higher body image score than controls. These results are relevant when considering treatments and interventions for students experiencing adjustment difficulties who may also be at risk for bullying victimization. The results also suggest that particular attention needs to be focused on those adolescents who play <b>multi-roles</b> in bullying situations (i. e., bully-victims), since these students may come to the attention ofthe school system for externalizing behaviours, but may also need assistance for internalizing maladjustments...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} aspects for teachers is to identify the different strategies students have used for problem solving. In our current study, this has been performed manually, using the video coding scheme and analysis. The outcome of these efforts reveal the identification of several patterns which are as follows: (P 1) active users: Several students were exploring the scene and trying out the touchscreen before starting the video; (P 2) passive users: The students were not interested in touching the screen but just stared at it as a static video; (P 3) single user pattern: One member of the group reads and answers the questions; (P 4) <b>multi-roles</b> pattern: Some members of the group read the questions, another one approved the answer, while other members read the questions by themselves. We have also noticed that in the single user pattern (P 3), students knew each otherâ€™s knowledge, thus trusting their skills and knowledge to answer specific questions related to previous experiences. This led to having one leader in the group (probable the one with the best level of knowledge), even though the scenario targets multi-disciplinary nursing specialists, that were reading and answering the questions with less discussions. At the end, this group had several wrong answers to the questions. The video analysis also provided us with some interesting information about the students and their knowledge. Analyzing the discussion, they had while answering the questions, could help their teacher understand why they answered a question wrong. The ACCURACY/CORRECTNESS, RELEVENCE, and TIMELINESS code events (see Additional file 1 : Appendix A) were used several times and allowed the researchers to understand the rationale behind the wrong answer. The latest could be used for future developments, if required, to send students personalized feedback and help them understand the subject better.|$|R
40|$|This thesis extends {{research}} on marketing communication and promotional mix strategies. Extant literature reveals {{that there is}} a dearth of academic research and literature on marketing communication, promotional mix, and IMC in Lao PDR HEIs. Promotional mix is defined as a form of marketing communication consisting of advertising, publicity, sales promotion, direct marketing, personal selling, events, and sponsorships. Promotional mix tools have been employed as a significant component of marketing communication strategies. In today&rsquo;s complex and highly competitive marketplace, promotional mix can {{play a major role in}} the process of increasing student recruitment and building image and reputation of higher education institutions (HEIs). This thesis applied a mixed methods approach, consisting of two separate but interrelated studies. Study 1 (Chapter 4) involves semi-structured interviews with directors (n= 5), marketing managers (n= 5), and academics (n= 5). This study aims to determine the ways in which PHE providers employ promotional mix tools as a part of their marketing communication strategies to influence students and parents&rsquo; choice of college. Study 2 (Chapter 5) comprises two phases: Phase 1 is a survey of private college students (n= 250). Phase 2 involves semi-structured interviews with parents (n= 3) of prospective students. Findings from Study 1 indicate that traditional media advertising, electronic media, discount offers, provision of sponsorships and college activities, college information, orientation and open days, brochures, school visits and internships, face-to-face, and word-of-mouth communication are considered to be effective PM tools. The analysis also confirms that directors, marketing managers, and academics adopt <b>multi-roles</b> and functions in their institutions despite having limited experience and knowledge in educational marketing communication, promotional mix, and the integrated marketing communication field. Lack of systematic marketing planning and strategy and funding are commonly found among private higher education institutions (PHEIs). Findings of Study 2, reveal that advertising, direct communication; special information, scholarships, college guide books, social media, financial incentives, and discount offers have an impact on students and parents&rsquo; choice of college. Importantly, students and parents report that social media, including Facebook, college websites, and YouTube played a significant role in influencing their college choice. Findings from Studies 1 and 2 have a significant practical, research and government policy implications. Key recommendations are provided for improving marketing communication, promotional mix and IMC practices in PHEIs...|$|R
5|$|While {{funding for}} the UKVG in the United Kingdom was seriously restricted, the British {{government}} sought to find partners {{in the form of}} NATO members, promoting the concept of creating and procuring a common NATO strike aircraft. In July 1968, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Britain, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada. This memorandum eventually led to the launch of the multinational <b>Multi-Role</b> Combat Aircraft (MRCA) project, which in turn went on to produce a variable geometry aircraft to perform strike, reconnaissance, and interception missions {{in the form of the}} Panavia Tornado.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{observed}} that {{the requirements of the}} specification were of a <b>multi-role</b> nature, akin to the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 and variable geometry General Dynamics F-111K. In RAF service, the AFVG had originally been intended to serve as a fighter, replacing the English Electric Lightning in the interceptor mission. However, following the decision to procure the American-built McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II instead, the AFVG's expected role was changed in 1966 to supplementing the F-111K strike aircraft in replacing the English Electric Canberra and the V bomber force.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s and 1990s, Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) {{produced}} 232 Block 30/40/50 F-16s on a production line in Ankara under license for the Turkish Air Force. TAI also produced 46 Block 40s for Egypt {{in the mid-1990s}} and 30 Block 50 from 2010. Korean Aerospace Industries opened a production line for the KF-16 program, producing 140 Block 52s from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s (decade). If India had selected the F-16IN for its Medium <b>Multi-Role</b> Combat Aircraft procurement, a sixth F-16 production line would be built in India. In May 2013, Lockheed Martin stated there were currently enough orders to keep producing the F-16 until 2017.|$|E
5|$|However, {{another major}} reason for rising costs was {{the need to develop}} a {{separate}} variant for the photo-reconnaissance mission when the underwing pods caused too great a performance penalty. The differences between the IIIS and the IIIRS (as the reconnaissance version was designated) resulted in only 36Mirage IIIS fighters and 18IIIRS reconnaissance aircraft actually built by the Federal Aircraft Factory at Emmen. Twelve were allocated to a reconnaissance squadron, three to a training group and the rest to two fighter squadrons. It was found that such a small number was insufficient to provide the <b>multi-role</b> capacity deemed essential for the new doctrine. The Mirage IIIS went into service in 1967, and the IIIRS in 1969.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the Tornado to perform well as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs in being a <b>multi-role</b> aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E

This new mission for the company was essential for force protection, troop transportation, search and cordon operations, and to protect against sabotage on fixed bridges. In September 2003, with the inactivation of the 38th Engineer Company (Medium Girder Bridge), the 502nd Engineer Company became a <b>multi-role</b> bridge company with both float and fixed bridging capabilities and the only active bridge company in USAREUR.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier II is a {{single-engine}} ground-attack {{aircraft that}} constitutes {{the second generation}} of the Harrier Jump Jet family. Capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. Named after a bird of prey, it is primarily employed on light attack or <b>multi-role</b> missions, ranging from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance. The AV-8B {{is used by the}} United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Spanish Navy, and the Italian Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force {{operates}} combat, maritime patrol, {{transport and}} training aircraft. As at July 2015 the combat aircraft force comprised 71 F/A-18A and B Hornets and 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets. The Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance force {{was equipped with}} 15 AP-3C Orions and 6 Boeing E-7A Wedgetail AEW aircraft. The air transport force operated 12 C-130J-30 Super Hercules, 6 C-17 Globemaster IIIs with 2 on order, 2 C-27 Spartans with 8 on order and 9 Super King Air 200/300 utility transport aircraft. The RAAF also operates 3 Bombardier Challenger and 2 Boeing Business Jet 737 aircraft as VIP transports. 5 Airbus KC-30B <b>Multi-Role</b> Tanker Transports were in service. The RAAF also operates 67 Pilatus PC-9, 8 Beechcraft B300 King Air and 33 Hawk 127 training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The first variant was {{designed}} during the 1980s as an upgrade of the Su-27, and was initially {{known as the}} Su-27M. This derivative incorporated canards and a multi-function radar that transformed the aircraft into a <b>multi-role</b> aircraft, and was structurally reinforced to support its heavier weight. The first prototype made its maiden flight in June 1988. As the aircraft was not mass produced due {{to the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, Sukhoi re-designated the aircraft as Su-35 to attract export orders. At the same time, the fourteen aircraft produced were used for tests and demonstrations; one example had thrust-vectoring engines installed, and the resultant Su-37 was used as a technology demonstrator. A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that strongly resembled the Su-30MK family.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Australian {{government}} decided to retire the F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets as an interim replacement, pending {{the arrival of}} the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning then being developed. The F-111 fleet was considered to be at risk due to fatigue, and too expensive to operate as each aircraft required 180 hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time. No.1 Squadron ceased operating the F-111 in January 2009, in preparation for converting to the Super Hornet. Former F-111 aircrew, familiar with side-by-side seating and a different performance envelope, found conversion more challenging than pilots experienced in the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighters, which shared many characteristics with the newer model. No.1 Squadron re-equipped between 26March 2010 and 21October 2011, making it the first Australian unit, and the first squadron outside the United States, to fly the Super Hornet. It became operational with its new aircraft on 8December 2011. The <b>multi-role</b> Super Hornet allowed No.1 Squadron to augment its previous offensive strike role with an air-to-air combat function. The RAAF attained full operational capability with the Super Hornet in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent {{a letter}} to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the US informing them that the fighter project had been {{launched}} in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with <b>multi-role</b> fighters. The project has been named the HX Fighter Program. The JAS-39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The request for information concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016. The five responses were received in November 2016. The official Request for Quotation will be sent to all five aircraft manufacturers that provided responses to the RFI, through their four governments, in the spring of 2018. The goal is to start the fighter candidatesâ€™ environmental testing in Finland in 2019. The buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.|$|E
5|$|No. 77 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{squadron}} headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales. It {{is controlled}} by No.81 Wing, and equipped with McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet <b>multi-role</b> fighters. The squadron was formed at RAAF Station Pearce, Western Australia, in March 1942 and saw action in the South West Pacific theatre of World WarII, operating Curtis P-40 Kittyhawks. After the war, it re-equipped with North American P-51 Mustangs and deployed to Japan {{as part of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The squadron was about to return to Australia when the Korean War broke out in June 1950, after which it joined United Nations forces supporting South Korea. It converted from Mustangs to Gloster Meteor jets between April and July 1951 and remained in Korea until October 1954, claiming five MiG-15s and over five thousand buildings and vehicles destroyed during the war for the loss of almost sixty aircraft, mainly to ground fire.|$|E
5|$|No. 81 Wing is {{responsible}} for operating the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet <b>multi-role</b> fighters of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, the wing comprises three combat units, Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons based at Williamtown and No.75 Squadron at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, {{as well as an}} operational conversion unit at Williamtown. No.81 Wing headquarters oversees squadron training in air-to-air and air-to-ground tactics, and support for the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy. Tasked with offensive and defensive counter-air operations, the Hornets have been deployed to Diego Garcia in 2001â€“02, when they provided local air defence, to Iraq in 2003, when they saw action flying fighter escort and close air support missions in concert with Coalition forces, and to the Middle East in 2015â€“16, when they undertook strike operations during the military intervention against ISIL. They have also been employed to patrol high-profile events in Australia, including the Commonwealth Games and visits by foreign dignitaries.|$|E
5|$|Nor {{was this}} the only field in which the Royal Navy was lagging in the 1930s. In the 1920s, Colonel the Master of Sempill led the semi-official Sempill Mission to Japan to help the Imperial Japanese Navy {{establish}} an air arm. At the time the Royal Navy was the world leader in naval aviation. The Sempill mission taught advanced techniques such as carrier deck landing, conducted training with modern aircraft, and provided engines, ordnance and technical equipment. Within a decade, Japan had overtaken Britain. The Royal Navy pioneered the armoured flight deck, which enabled carriers to absorb damage, but resulted in {{limiting the number of}} aircraft that a carrier could operate. The Royal Navy had great faith in the ability of ships' antiaircraft batteries, and so saw little need for high performance fighters. To maximise the benefit of the small numbers of aircraft that could be carried, the Royal Navy developed <b>multi-role</b> aircraft such as the Blackburn Roc, Fairey Fulmar, Fairey Barracuda, Blackburn Skua and Fairey Swordfish. As a result, the Royal Navy's aircraft were no match for their Japanese counterparts.|$|E
5|$|On taking office, Reagan {{was faced}} with the same {{decision}} as Carter before: whether {{to continue with the}} B-1 for the short term, or to wait {{for the development of the}} ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985. It was predicted that 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets. After this, the introduction of the SA-10 missile, the MiG-31 interceptor and the first Soviet Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) systems would make the B-52 increasingly vulnerable. During 1981, funds were allocated to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s time-frame which led to developing the Long-Range Combat Aircraft (LRCA) project. The LRCA evaluated the B-1, F-111, and ATB as possible solutions; an emphasis was placed on <b>multi-role</b> capabilities, as opposed to purely strategic operations.|$|E
5|$|Rowland {{attended}} RAAF Staff College, Point Cook, in 1956. Promoted to wing commander, he {{took charge}} of ARDU from November 1956 until June 1959. In 1957, he raised concerns that the supersonic Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, touted as a <b>multi-role</b> replacement for the Sabre, was ill-suited for any purpose except interception. The Defence Minister, Sir Philip McBride, had reached a similar conclusion and kept the Sabre in frontline service until a more suitable aircraft could be chosen, namely the Dassault MirageIII delta-wing fighter. From 1961 to 1964 Rowland was based in Paris, as Technical Staff Officer on the RAAF team preparing for the Mirage's acceptance into Australian service. In contrast {{to most of the}} team members, he displayed a talent for language and by his second year was chairing meetings in French with Dassault engineers. After returning to Australia, he was posted to the Directorate of Aircraft Engineering at the Department of Air, Canberra, responsible for ongoing technical oversight of the Mirage.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Squadron re-equipped with Canberra Mk.20s after {{returning}} to Australia. The RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra was subsonic but had long range and was highly manoeuvrable. It had been procured partly for its capacity to deliver nuclear weapons, an ordnance option the government seriously contemplated but never acquired. Initially the Canberra's envisaged mission profile was medium-to-high-altitude area bombing but its primitive bombsight and light load made this a dubious proposition, and by mid-1961 crews were training in low-level army cooperation tactics. No.1 Squadron was awarded successive Gloucester Cups for its proficiency in 1959â€“60 and 1960â€“61. As of January 1962, its strength was eight aircraft and 53 personnel, including 18 officers. The unit effectively ceased operations in 1968, to begin converting to the General Dynamics F-111C supersonic bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Already controversial owing to its escalating cost, the F-111 program was heavily delayed by airworthiness concerns related to its swing-wing technology. In September 1970, as an interim measure while awaiting delivery of the F-111, No.1 Squadron relinquished its Canberras for leased McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms, which it operated until June 1973. Although the Phantom had a <b>multi-role</b> capability, the RAAF employed it as a strike aircraft to maintain compatibility with the proposed F-111 mission profile. One of No.1 Squadron's Phantoms was lost with its crew of two in June 1971, the only fatalities and hull loss of the 24 aircraft leased to the RAAF. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and well regarded by its Australian crews.|$|E
