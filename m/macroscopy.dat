50|$|Ultrasound {{detectors}} {{have been}} developed that collect bandwidths of 10-200 MHz or wider, which allows unprecedented mesoscopy at tissue depths of 0.1-1 cm with resolution that can exceed 10 microns even at depths of several millimeters. Illumination light is typically unfocused and selected from the visible and near-IR regions of the spectrum. Images are generated using computed tomography. Such mesoscopy can analyze morphology and biological processes such as inflammation in greater detail than <b>macroscopy,</b> revealing, for example, microvasculature networks in skin and epithelial tissues or the microenvironment within a tumor. Regions of interest are approximately 50 mm3, and resolution of 5-30 microns is typical.|$|E
50|$|Photoechoes show an ultra-wide {{frequency}} profile, {{which is}} determined by the pulse width of the illuminating pulse {{and the size of the}} object. Ultimately, though, the frequencies that can be collected and processed for image reconstruction are determined by the ultrasound detector. Macroscopic MSOT typically uses detectors operating in the frequency range from 0.1 to 10 MHz, allowing imaging depths of approximately 1-5 cm and resolution of 0.1-1 mm. Illumination light wavelengths are typically chosen from the near-IR region of the spectrum and spread over the sample to allow deep penetration. Images are then generated using computed tomography. Such <b>macroscopy</b> is useful for animal and human imaging to analyze tissue anatomy, physiology and response to drugs. Regions of interest are approximately 30-50 cm3, and resolution of 200-300 microns is typical.|$|E

40|$|Interest in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is global. The burgeoning {{international}} trade in its crude and processed plant ingredients (Chinese materia medica - CMM) reflects demand across all sectors of healthcare, yet the identification of source plants and CMM has been overlooked for many years leading to problems in safety, quality, efficacy and sustainable sourcing. The Guide (Chinese medicinal plants, herbal drugs and substitutes: an identification guide, Leon & Lin, Kew Publishing, 2017), which forms {{the core of this}} dissertation by publication, presents a fresh approach to the identification of 226 internationally traded CMM (officially recognised in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, CP 2015) along with their 302 official source plants. Identification criteria are developed using <b>macroscopy,</b> and are based on authentic reference specimens created as a result of extensive fieldwork in China. Inclusion of 99 comparative descriptions of unofficial substitute plants and drugs (including adulterants and counterfeits), with their counterparts for official species, enable key distinguishing characters to be highlighted and thereby strengthen the rigour of identifications made. The approach demonstrates that <b>macroscopy</b> can be used to reliably identify and differentiate over 70 % of official (CP 2015) CMM from common substitutes and that <b>macroscopy</b> is a fast and cost-effective authentication method with many applications. The research highlights the essential role of herbarium-vouchered reference drugs in CMM authentication as opposed to the use of market-obtained drugs whose botanical identity is inherently uncertain. The research’s taxonomic review of all official species in the Guide demonstrates a significant disparity (16 %) between the taxonomy adopted in the CP 2015 and current plant taxonomic opinion, while a review of species conservation rankings and causal effects found that the wild populations of 23 % of official species native to China (63 of 270 official species in the Guide) have become threatened {{as a direct result of}} over-harvesting for medicinal use. In addition, the research reveals the underlying causes of CMM substitution are dominated by clinician preference, followed by supply problems arising from over-harvesting of official species with unregulated markets trading in inferior or inappropriate look-alike items, together with issues of confused identification and nomenclature. Direct consequences of the inadvertent use of CMM substitutes include misleading clinical and research outcomes, serious adverse reactions and, in some cases, fatalities. Reliable identification of CMM therefore remains paramount for high quality research as well as safe and efficacious clinical practice. While for some CMM (ca. 30 % of CMM in the Guide) robust identification requires analytical methods (e. g. chemical- and DNA-based ones), the research concludes that <b>macroscopy</b> continues to be a powerful tool for reliable and cost-effective identification of CMM in {{international trade}}...|$|E

MethodsTwenty-two skeletally mature and adolescent New Zealand white rabbits were housed during the same period at the Institut Claude-Bourgelat, Lyon, France. Surgical ACLT was performed in the left knee of nine adolescent and five adult rabbits. Final US and macroscopic semi-quantitative grading of the meniscal injuries were compared 5 months after ACLT. ResultsA standardised protocol was developed to evaluate the rabbit knee joint. US was performed in both control and ACLT knees. Normal and abnormal meniscal US appearances were described. A semi-quantitative scale to grade US meniscal injuries was created. Macroscopic and US total meniscal scores were significantly positively correlated (P< 0. 001, r= 0. 70).

40|$|Dietary {{choices are}} central to our {{understanding}} of ecology and evolution. Still, many aspects of food choice have been hampered by time consuming procedures and methodological problems. Faster and cheaper methods, such as DNA metabarcoding, have therefore been widely adopted. However, there is still very little empirical support that this new method is better and more accurate compared to the classic methods. Here, we compare DNA metabarcoding to macroscopic identifications of rumen contents in two species of wild free-ranging ungulates: roe deer and fallow deer. We found that the methods were comparable, but they did not completely overlap. Sometimes the DNA method failed to identify food items that were found macroscopically, and the opposite was also true. However, the total number of taxa identified increased using DNA compared to the macroscopic analysis. Moreover, the taxonomic precision of metabarcoding was substantially higher, with on average 90 % of DNA-sequences being identified to genus or species level compared to 75 % of plant fragments using <b>macroscopy.</b> In niche overlap analyses, presence/absence data showed that both methods came to very similar conclusions. When using the sequence count data and macroscopic weight, niche overlap was lower than when using presence-absence data yet tended to increase when using DNA compared to <b>macroscopy.</b> Nevertheless, the significant positive correlation between macroscopic quantity and number of DNA sequences counted from the same plant group give support for the use of metabarcoding to quantify plants in the rumen. This study thus shows that there is much to be gained by using metabarcoding to quantitatively assess diet composition compared to macroscopic analysis, including higher taxonomic precision, sensitivity and cost efficiency...|$|E
