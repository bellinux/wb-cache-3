Draper {{did not want}} her children to be actors; she explained, [...] "Nat kept putting signs on his door: 'I want to be a child actor!' I said, 'No, it's too brutal. However, Nat wrote and directed a sitcom called Don't Eat Off <b>My</b> <b>Plate,</b> which Draper presented in documentary style by interviewing his friends.|$|E
500|$|At age 11, Bell {{became a}} vegetarian. In an {{interview}} with PETA, Bell stated, [...] "I have always been an animal lover. I {{had a hard time}} disassociating the animals I cuddled with—dogs and cats, for example—from the animals on <b>my</b> <b>plate,</b> and I never really cared for the taste of meat. I always loved my Brussels sprouts!" [...] By 2012 Bell became vegan with her husband after watching the documentary Forks Over Knives. During her time in Michigan, Bell fostered animals from Michigan Humane Society and she now supports the San Diego-based Helen Woodward Animal Center. Bell often attends fund raisers for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting animals. She has a Welsh Corgi-Chow Chow mix named Lola, a Welsh Corgi-Chihuahua mix named Shakey, and a black Labrador Retriever named Sadie, who was 11 years old when she was rescued from Hurricane Katrina and adopted by Bell in 2005.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990. The voice of Herb {{was provided by}} guest star Danny DeVito, an American actor who was suggested for the role by Simpsons executive producer Sam Simon. Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, writes in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that DeVito had to record his lines quickly because he had another appointment, so the staff focused on recording his scenes only instead of the whole episode at once. Cartwright was a fan of DeVito's and recalls: [...] "This morning, at the table read, I had just filled <b>my</b> <b>plate</b> with assorted fruits when Bonnie said to my backside, 'Nancy, I want to introduce you to...' and I turned and practically knocked over Danny DeVito, all four feet, eleven inches of him. How embarrassing!" [...] While recording the scenes, Cartwright stood directly across the room from DeVito, which she appreciated since she got {{to see him in}} action. She thought DeVito [...] "threw his body and soul" [...] into his performance. While the recording took part, animation director Archer scribbled down some of DeVito's attitudes, gestures, and facial expressions {{on a piece of paper}} as he performed. In one scene of the episode, Herb tells Homer and the rest of the Simpson family to [...] " [...] yourselves at home. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room..." [...] Cartwright said of it: ...|$|E

2500|$|Hatton is {{sometimes}} referred to by boxing fans as [...] "Ricky Fatton" [...] because {{he was known to}} allow himself to weigh as much as 175 to 180 pounds (35 to 40 pounds over his fight weight) when not in training for a fight. Ever since Hatton turned professional, he always opted to eat a full English breakfast before fights – his favourite place in Hyde is The Butty Box in Mottram Road, where he was interviewed by Gaby Logan for Inside Sport; and is known to drink Guinness on Thursday night when he plays darts for the New Inn. Experts used his ill-balanced diet, akin to Jake LaMotta's ballooning up between fights, to explain his poor performances in later fights and his nature to tire towards the end of fights. Hatton appeared on ITV1's daytime show Loose Women in August 2007, stating that the reason he put on weight between fights was because [...] "I have a lot on <b>my</b> <b>plate</b> at the moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carlisle is a {{supporter}} of several causes. She has been an ardent supporter of LGBT rights, which she made public after her son, James, came out to her at age fourteen. Carlisle is also a vegetarian and {{a supporter}} of animal rights. She and her bandmates were the first stars to pose for PETA's [...] "Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" [...] campaign in 1990. In a 2013 interview, she talked {{about going back to}} vegetarianism after a long break, stating that [...] "I fell off the vegetarian wagon and never felt good about it. I wouldn't let myself think of <b>my</b> <b>plate</b> of meat as an animal, but I knew deep inside it was, and actually it was gross, especially chicken. I was full of shame. Then I started practicing yoga, which is all about nonviolence, and realized eating meat isn't compatible with that. Now I teach yoga, and I'm so full of pride not to support factory farms and to be socially responsible." [...] She contributed her song [...] "Bless the Beasts and the Children" [...] to the album Tame Yourself to benefit PETA.|$|E
2500|$|Patton first {{alluded to}} the fact that Mr. Bungle would {{probably}} not record any more albums in 2003, stating in an interview, [...] "I think it is over. The guys are spread {{all over the world and}} we don't talk to each other. I have not spoken to a couple of the guys since the last tour, years ago." [...] Patton reiterated this sentiment in another 2003 interview with Australian newspaper The Age. While no official break-up announcement ever materialized, a 2004 Rolling Stone interview confirmed Mr. Bungle had disbanded with Patton revealing, “We could have probably squeezed out a couple more records but the collective personality of this group became so dysfunctional, this band was poisoned by one person's petty jealousy and insecurity, and it led us to a slow, unnatural death. And I'm at peace with that, because I know I tried all I could.” When asked about a possible reunion, Mike Patton said, [...] "It could happen, but I won’t be singing. Some bridges have definitely been burned. It was a fun time and sometimes you just have to move on. I’ve got a lot on <b>my</b> <b>plate</b> now." [...] Trevor Dunn added on his website, [...] "Bungle is dead and I'm happy about it" [...] and that [...] "the members of Mr. Bungle will never work together as such again". Spruance, Heifetz, and McKinnon have been more optimistic regarding a possible reunion.|$|E
