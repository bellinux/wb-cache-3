40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the issues of external therapy of atopic dermatitis in children. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic allergic inflammatory skin disease; in most cases, it is the first manifestation of atopic march. Timely and adequate pathogenetic external therapy of this disease using topical glucocorticosteroids (TGCSs) helps to quickly and effectively terminate symptoms of the disease and allergic inflammation of the skin. Steroid phobia, which is prevalent among parents of the patients, reduced adherence to the TGCS therapy. The authors analyzed results of the original studies of effectiveness and safety of TGCSs, present general recommendations on TGCS use in children with due regard to morphofunctional peculiarities of children’s skin and clinical‑pharmacological description of the TGCSs featuring the most favorable therapeutic index of 0. 1 % <b>methylprednisolone</b> <b>aceponate.</b> <b>Methylprednisolone</b> <b>aceponate</b> available in 4  pharmaceutical forms is the optimal drug of choice for atopic dermatitis in children over 4  months of age.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Lichen planus is an inflammatory, immunologically {{mediated}} {{disease with}} manifestation {{on the skin}} and mucosa. In the present study, the topical application of the glucocorticoid <b>methylprednisolone</b> <b>aceponate</b> is described {{for the first time}} in patients with oral lichen planus, and the therapeutic effects are examined by using clinical, immunohistological, and microbiological criteria. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the glucocorticoid <b>methylprednisolone</b> <b>aceponate</b> (verum 1) in comparison with the reference glucocorticoid triamcinolone acetonide (verum 2) and with placebo. The primary target criterion of the study was the change in the »total size of all lesions«, as assessed by using a size score. Additional criteria for the evaluation of the therapy outcome (secondary target criteria) were: number of diseased regions, lesion size differentiated according to clinical form, intensity of erythema, whitish intensity, and intensity of complaints. The results of the follow-up examinations served the critical evaluation of the therapy outcome after 3 and 6 months. When comparing the efficacy of the two glucocorticoids, significantly better results were obtained for <b>methylprednisolone</b> <b>aceponate</b> than for triamcinolone acetonide, both with regard to the primary target criterion »total size of all lesions« and with regard to additional secondary target criteria. The therapy outcomes, differentiated according to clinical forms, revealed form-specific differences, with the therapy using <b>methylprednisolone</b> <b>aceponate</b> being particularly effective for the ulcerative form, i. e. the clinical form with the highest degree of severity. To reduce the risk of candidiasis, an antimycotic prophylaxis and add-on treatment is recommended. The results of the follow-up examinations of the study at 3 and 6 months after the end of therapy showed that the therapeutic efficacy had diminished both from the clinical and the patient’s view. On the one hand, the again increased values of the follow-up examinations suggest to put into perspective the results obtained, on the other hand, the values continued to be significantly lower as compared with the start of therapy, thus indicating the improved condition in the medium-term view of the therapeutic outcome. The most important immunohistological result of the study concerned the antimicrobial protein calprotectin and showed a reduction of the calprotectin expression in basal keratinocytes and a decreasing number of calprotectin-positive macrophages in the inflammatory infiltrate after glucocorticoid therapy. The healing process was associated with a quantitative cellular change in the CD 163 macrophage population: the therapy led to a shift in the composition of the infiltrate cells towards the anti-inflammatory CD 163 macrophage phenotype. The study result regarding the 25 F 9 expression of the epithelium gives a first indication that the 25 F 9 antigen represents a glucocorticoid-inducible epithelial tissue antigen in oral lichen planus...|$|E
40|$|P>Background Long-term {{low-level}} topical anti-inflammatory {{therapy has}} been suggested as a new paradigm {{in the treatment of}} atopic eczema (AE). Objectives To determine the efficacy and tolerability of topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors for flare prevention in AE. Methods Systematic review of randomized controlled trials reporting efficacy of topical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors for flare prevention in AE. Identification of relevant articles by systematic electronic searches (Cochrane Library, Medline) supplemented by hand search. Primary efficacy endpoint: proportion of participants experiencing at least one flare during proactive anti-inflammatory treatment. Relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled by pharmaceutical agent using random-effects meta-analysis. Sensitivity analysis included meta-regression to explore the influence of study-specific covariates. Results Nine articles reporting on eight vehicle-controlled trials were included. Three, four and one trial(s) evaluated proactive therapy with topical tacrolimus, fluticasone propionate and <b>methylprednisolone</b> <b>aceponate,</b> respectively. Each agent under study was more efficacious to prevent flares than vehicle. Meta-analysis suggested that topical fluticasone propionate (RR 0 center dot 46, 95 % CI 0 center dot 38 - 0 center dot 55) may be more efficacious to prevent disease flares than topical tacrolimus (RR 0 center dot 78, 95 % CI 0 center dot 60 - 1 center dot 00). Meta-regression indicated robustness of these findings. Proactive anti-inflammatory therapy was generally well tolerated. The trials identified, however, do not allow firm conclusions about long-term safety. Conclusions Vehicle-controlled trials indicate efficacy of proactive treatment with tacrolimus, fluticasone propionate and <b>methylprednisolone</b> <b>aceponate</b> to prevent AE flares. Indirect evidence from vehicle-controlled trials suggests that twice weekly application of the potent topical corticosteroid fluticasone propionate may be more efficacious to prevent AE flares than tacrolimus ointment. Head to head trials should be conducted to confirm these results. Future studies are also needed to evaluate the long-term safety of proactive treatment of AE...|$|E
40|$|Background  The {{relapsing}} {{nature of}} atopic dermatitis (AD) presents {{a challenge for}} its long-term treatment. Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids have been proven in the acute treatment of active AD, but their long-term efficacy and potential to reduce or prevent relapses have only partially been addressed. Objectives  To investigate long-term management (16 weeks) of AD with <b>methylprednisolone</b> <b>aceponate</b> (MPA) 0 · 1 % cream twice weekly {{in addition to an}} emollient (Advabase®) after stabilization of an acute severe or very severe flare of AD with MPA cream. Methods  Patients ≥ 12 years of age with a ≥ 2 -year history of moderate to severe AD were eligible for this multicentre, randomized, double-blind, controlled study if they presented with an acute flare of severe or very severe AD [Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 4]. After successful treatment of the flare in an acute phase (AP), patients received either MPA twice weekly plus emollient or emollient alone over a 16 -week maintenance phase (MP). The primary study endpoint was time to relapse of AD. Secondary endpoints included relapse rate and disease status, the patient’s assessment of intensity of itch, the Eczema Area and Severity Index, the IGA score, affected body surface area, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and children’s DLQI (CDLQI), patient’s and investigator’s global assessment of response and patient’s assessment of quality of sleep. Results  Two hundred and forty-nine patients entered the AP and 221 continued into the MP. Time to relapse was longer in the MPA group than in the emollient group. The probability of remaining free from relapse after 16 weeks was 87 · 1 % in the MPA group compared with 65 · 8 % for the emollient. Patients treated with MPA twice weekly had a 3 · 5 -fold lower risk of experiencing a relapse than patients treated with emollient alone (hazard ratio 3 · 5, 95 % confidence interval 1 · 9 – 6 · 4; P < 0 · 0001). MPA was also superior to emollient for all other efficacy endpoints. Therapy with both treatments was well tolerated. Conclusions  MPA twice weekly plus an emollient provides an effective maintenance treatment regimen to control AD. Once stabilized, treatment with MPA significantly reduces the risk of relapse and the intensity of itching, and improves the overall patient status...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was the {{stabilization}} of four structurally different drug ester compounds (sagopilone, drospirenone, <b>methylprednisolone</b> <b>aceponate</b> [MPA], and progesterone-receptor-A-selective ligand [PRASL]) in rat and dog serum samples in vitro. To this end, the specific esterases were isolated from rat and canine serum and subsequently identified. Furthermore, potent inhibitors of these enzymes were found. A three-step purification protocol (including ion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, and affinity chromatography [for removal of albumin]) was successfully used for the isolation of the sagopilone-, drospirenone- and MPA-hydrolyzing esterases from rat serum. In accordance with some literature reports, the presence of carboxylesterase (CE) and/or butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) within the active fractions was suggested. The PRASL-cleaving esterases (presumably paraxonase 1 [PON 1]) were isolated from rat serum in high yield by means of an affinity chromatography used for the isolation of PON-containing fractions (PON-AC). The esterases hydrolyzing drospirenone in dog serum were purified by PON-AC, although exhibiting a low activity yield and purification factor. The three-step purification procedure employed on the isolation of MPA-cleaving esterases from canine serum proved to be successful. Besides, MPA-hydrolyzing fractions were obtained by PON-AC. With the help of matrix-assisted laser desorption – time of flight – mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for protein identification, CE 1 was found in the purified, sagopilone-cleaving fractions from rat serum. The involvement of this esterase in the cleavage of sagopilone as well as of drospirenone and MPA was postulated. In the PRASL-degrading fractions of the PON-AC from rat serum, PON 1 was found by Western blot while apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) was identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. The identification of apo A-I indirectly demonstrated the presence of PON 1 in these fractions. By liquid chromatography – electrospray ionization – mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS), alpha- 2 -macroglobulin (alpha- 2 -M) was identified in the MPA-cleaving fractions from dog serum, thereby assuming the formation of an esteratically active complex of alpha- 2 -M with serine proteases or BChE. PON 1 was found by Western blot in certain fractions of PON-AC from canine serum. A procedure of screening inhibitors was accomplished with the help of a set of selected esterase and protease inhibitors. By using isolated fractions from rat serum as well as non-fractionated rat serum, CE was assumed to be mainly responsible for the cleavage of sagopilone. It was suggested that drospirenone was primarily cleaved by BChE and PON 1 whereas MPA was principally hydrolyzed by BChE and (associated or co-eluting) serine proteases. It appeared that PON 1 mainly cleaved PRASL in rat serum. The degradation of drospirenone in dog serum was chiefly ascribed to the activity of PON 1 while the MPA cleavage was probably due to the amidase activity of BChE. Thus, the results of the screening confirmed the first suggestions from the protein isolation and identification. Recommendations regarding the choice and concentration of inhibitors for the stabilization of the four drug compounds in rat and dog serum were given (ref. Tabelle 24, p. 144 in the dissertation). These are useful for further in vitro stability studies using chemically related and unrelated drug esters in animal and human blood. In terms of early nonclinical and clinical drug development, the gained experience enables to deliver potent inhibitors for increasing the stability of newly developed drug ester compounds in blood samples ex vivo...|$|E
