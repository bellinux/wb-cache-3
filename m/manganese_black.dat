Conversely, the ash-rich layer in Juan de Pareja appears to be almost pure, and devoid of silicates and carbon particles.

30|$|Summarizing, {{the study}} of painted Ottoman {{inscriptions}} and reliefs provided the first information about their palette, which was found {{to make use of}} several pigments such as red lead and more scarcely cinnabar or vermilion, chrome yellow, ultramarine, copper based blue or green pigments and a blend of Prussian blue and chrome yellow for light green hues. It was also shown that gold foil decoration was not uncommon. In the case of the limited set of Venetian inscriptions, it was found that two types of black substances were used in the engraved black figures, carbon black or <b>manganese</b> <b>black,</b> the latter possibly mixed with a copper pigment. Further analysis of painted stone carved works dating from the Ottoman and Venetian periods may reveal a more representative palette for each period and may contribute to the general historical knowledge in a number of ways, for example, assisting archaeologists to date artworks with confidence or conclude about the value of sculpture, particularly in cases luxurious decorative materials such as gold foils are found. Even more, it may assist research work concerning commercial activities and the import of goods or different materials and extend our knowledge about the technology of producing and using pigments during the late medieval and modern era in Crete.|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} {{effects of}} pipe materials on drinking water quality have been analyzed {{in the distribution}} system of the water treatment plant of “La Concepción ” in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. “La Concepción ” is a surface water reservoir experiencing biogeochemical cycling of <b>manganese.</b> <b>Black</b> water problems {{have been reported in}} the distribution system since 1998. An evaluation of the potential influence that PVC and iron pipes could have on the concentration of iron and manganese in drinking water, the effects caused by the presence of manganese in PVC and iron pipe surfaces, and residual chlorine and Pb concentrations in the distribution system was performed. The sampled neighborhoods received an intermittent service. Water was suspended for 8 hours every day due to water quantity problems in the city. Water and pipe samples were obtained for PVC and galvanized iron pipes because these constitute the majority of the infrastructure used for distribution systems in Honduras. Thermodynamic and kinetic conditions for possible manganese oxidation by chlorine and dissolved oxygen in the distribution system were also evaluated. As expected, total Fe concentrations were greater for first flush conditions from the iron pipe. Water samples obtained from the PVC pipe showed higher total Mn concentrations and more black color than those obtained from the iron pipe for both first flush and continuous flo...|$|E
40|$|Painted Canosa ceramicswere {{examined}} {{to identify the}} nature of the pigments employed and theirmanufacturing technology. A multi-technique approach was used, comprising Raman microspectroscopy and laser ablation hyphenated to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The analysed samples were mainly produced for burial in tombs and were not intended for everyday use. They belong to the period between the end of themid- 7 th century andthe first half of the 4 th century BC, and were excavated from the Toppicelli archaeological district near the suburbs of Canosa (Puglia, Italy). Forty-eight pottery fragments were available for this study. No handling of the samples was required for the Raman study, and it was possible to excise the pigmented layer {{in such a way that}} the lacunae were not distinguishable to the naked eye due to the micrometric size of the laser spot as far as LA-ICP-MS is concerned. Their combination turned out to be quite useful for the investigation of these archaeological materials: the chemical nature of the white, red, brown and black pigments employed in the pottery manufacture was investigated. Iron and manganese compounds were identified as the red and brown/black main colouring substances, respectively; on the other hand, whites and engobes (whitish slips) were based on kaolinite. This set of colouring substances is of importance, as it enabled the artisan to obtain in one oxidising firing cycle brown, black and red paints. Finally, the finding of <b>manganese</b> <b>black</b> in these Canosa potsherds confirms that Canosa was an important centre connecting the near East to central Italy and Europe since the pre-Roman age...|$|E
30|$|Raman spectra {{recorded}} on brown painted areas were rather weak in intensity {{and failed to}} provide any reliable information concerning pigments. However, strong emissions from both manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) were detected by LIBS in the brown paint (Fig.  10 b), and this {{could be interpreted as}} evidence of a mixture of <b>manganese</b> <b>black</b> or brown pigment with red iron oxide. Likewise the detection of chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) in the yellow painted parts of the door frame was critical in obtaining strong evidence for the use of chromium yellow (PbCrO 4) possibly in mixture with yellow ochre (hydrous ferric oxide, Fe 2 O 3 ·nH 2 O) as it can be suggested based on the detection of Fe at the same spot. Detection of significant amounts of barium (Ba) by LIBS in the red, brown, light blue and yellow paint domains suggests the presence of barium sulphate, and this was further confirmed on the basis of Raman spectra collected in the yellow painted areas. The dominant presence of zinc (Zn) may be translated as an evidence for the presence of zinc oxide (ZnO) possibly used as an extender in the paint. However the simultaneous presence of barium and zinc might indicate the presence of lithopone, ZnS·BaSO 4. The presence of titanium (Ti), in very low concentration, in the blue and brown areas, but in higher concentration in the red and yellow paint, could be ascribed to impurities present in earth pigments and matrix minerals [39] or to titanium white (TiO 2) probably coming from later painting interventions known to have taken place at the church {{in the beginning of the}} twentieth century CE. Unfortunately, no additional documentation concerning these intervention was found. It is noted, that the presence of TiO 2 was not confirmed by Raman analysis. Aluminium (Al) and magnesium (Mg) were also detected all across the door frame, most likely originating from matrix minerals, while the presence of strontium (Sr) relates to the presence of calcium carbonate.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{forms the}} first {{application}} of scientific analysis (thin section petrography, electron microprobe and scanning electron microscopy) to Neolithic ceramics from Fars province, Iran. The research specifically addresses the questions surrounding {{the choice of}} raw materials, production techniques and the use and consumption of ceramic vessels at these village sites. I have sought to attempt {{a deeper understanding of}} the past socio-economic context of ceramic production and consumption, as well as draw comparisons with wider ceramic technologies in the surrounding regions of Iran, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Central Asia. Analysis and interpretation of decorated ceramics from Neolithic Southwest Iran has traditionally focused on decorative designs, where coloured pigments have clearly played an influential role. However, very little was specifically known about the raw materials, manufacture, and production stages of these wares. The samples selected for analysis include newly excavated and previously unpublished ceramics that have been incorporated into an updated typology. This is then used to provide detailed characterisation of the materials and techniques employed by past potters to create the wares. Ceramics from different sites and valley locations were compared, and the development and changes in pigment raw materials and painted motif selection is demonstrated across different village sites and throughout the Neolithic time period. The introduction of <b>manganese</b> <b>black</b> and bichrome designs at Tol-e Nurabad is particularly interesting amidst the widely used iron oxide pigments and monochrome designs recorded from other sites. The choice of these raw materials is considered in respect to potters’ interaction with their surrounding landscape and in the context of other crafts and productive technologies. The transfer of potting knowledge is also considered, with visible evidence of a range of skill levels and marked corrections and adjustments made to painted motifs on the vessels studied. The use and consumption of vessels in Neolithic Fars is based on the remains of kitchen hearths and cooking equipment, namely clay balls and river cobbles, combined with use-wear analysis to show that plain wares were not subjected to direct heat and that painted wares were most likely used in the presentation and consumption of food. The painted motifs and decorative designs created on Neolithic vessels in this study are compared to other excavated sherds and whole or reconstructed vessels and show a broad similarity in apparent manufacture and painted designs. I suggest that this is evidence of the capacity of ceramics to store visual information, and to signify the Neolithic style of design that was actively shared and participated in across village sites in Fars. This was potentially done to demonstrate group membership and contribute to the construction of community, perhaps at feasting events which have been proposed across this region during the Neolithic, which would have provided venues for the consumption of such ceramics alongside the transference of decorative schemes between villages. Wider comparisons with contemporary Neolithic wares in the surrounding Iranian region, as well as Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Central Asia are also drawn, linking the communities of Fars with wider Neolithic technologies and styles...|$|E

50|$|For {{concentrations}} {{of iron and}} manganese in drinking water, the threshold values are 200 µg/l and 50 µg/l respectively. Although they serve as essential trace elements in drinking water, slightly elevated iron and manganese concentrations are undesirable from a technical and hygienic point of view. At low oxygen concentrations, iron and manganese are dissolved as ions. The naturally occurring iron and manganese is mainly present as divalent, soluble ferrous/ manganous compound. At very high concentrations, a yellow water colour is noticeable. When this water is aerated, the oxidization creates ferric iron/ manganese, with iron forming red-brown and <b>manganese</b> forming <b>black</b> precipitates. These precipitates cause staining and turbidity {{of the water and}} lead to laundry stains. The precipitates can also narrow pipes and deposit on mountings. Iron levels above 0.3 mg/l and manganese levels above 0.5 mg/l become noticeable as an unpleasant metallic taste. Providing an aerobic hypolimnic environment, deep-water aeration oxidizes and precipitates dissolved iron and manganese compounds, before the water is treated in a suitable facility for drinking water production. In this way further operating costs for the removal of dissolved iron and manganese compounds can be realized.|$|R

All specimens contain both iron and manganese, but the Mn/Fe ratio varies widely. Many specimens are enriched in Ba but depleted in Sr. The manganese and iron oxides contain the transition metals Co, Cu, Ni, V, and Zn in concentrations greater than 0. 5 wt % in some specimens. Minor Cr and Mo also occur. Given the extremely low concentrations of these elements expected in freshwater streams in carbonate terrains, the manganese oxides exert a dramatic amplifying effect over the expected background.

40|$|Lascaux Cave in France was {{discovered}} in 1940. Since being opened to visitors the cave has suffered three major microbial outbreaks. The current problem is the fast dissemination of black stains which are threatening the Palaeolithic paintings. Previous data pointed to the involvement of new fungal species {{in the formation of}} black stains on the rock walls and ceiling. However, it appears that there could be other reasons for the formation of different and extensive black stains coating the surface of the clayey sediments. Our analyses reveal that black stains on clayey sediments are mainly produced by Acremonium nepalense, a manganese oxide-depositing fungus, widely distributed in the cave.

40|$|The {{surface water}} {{composition}} of Pinal Creek has {{been affected by}} input of a low-oxygen ground water plume with high metal concentrations, particularly manganese and copper, and low pH. The pH of the stream water increases from approximately 6. 0 to 7. 8 downstream of the point of entry, which may affect the rate of manganese oxide precipitation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the role of gas exchange processes on the observed downstream increase in pH at Pinal Creek. A finite-difference model was developed to calculate downstream changes in concentration of volatile solutes in small streams.

Modeled simulations of dissolved oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon transport in a 2. 6 km reach at Pinal Creek, Arizona closely matched field observations. Based on the carbon balance and alkalinity balances, it can be concluded that downstream changes in pH can be sufficiently explained by acid/base chemistry of carbonate and CO 2 degassing.
