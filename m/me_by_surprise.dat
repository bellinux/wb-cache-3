It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a two-month}} courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had {{met on the}} set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a {{relationship}} at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997). As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, [...] "It took <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The timing caught <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> I {{had barely}} {{enough time to}} get my things out of the office and to {{assemble}} as many colleagues of all ranks as possible for a farewell. ... A few days later, I encountered Haldeman. [...] "What happened to our understanding that my exit would be postponed for a few weeks?" [...] I asked. [...] "Oh, I guess we forgot," [...] he said with the faint trace of a smile. [...] And so it was over." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{proposition}} took <b>me</b> completely <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> {{but before}} I {{had time to}} answer, Baskerville seized <b>me</b> <b>by</b> the hand and wrung it heartily.|$|R
60|$|Three o'clock.--I open {{these pages}} again {{to record a}} {{discovery}} which has taken <b>me</b> entirely <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "I was angry. I {{shall never}} subdue {{that kind of}} hastiness altogether. It takes <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> Before the {{messenger}} {{was out of sight}} I had repented....|$|E
6000|$|... "You forget, Lady Janet (if I may {{venture to}} say so), that the {{circumstances}} are changed. She took <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> {{on the last}} occasion; I am prepared for her now." ...|$|E
60|$|This, {{naturally}} enough, took <b>me</b> completely <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> I waited eagerly to hear {{why we were}} to send to America.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{understand}} me, Heigham, when I {{say that you}} take <b>me</b> rather <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> in this business. Your acquaintance with her has been short." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You take <b>me</b> {{somewhat}} <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> Myra. My thoughts {{have not}} been upon this matter. I cannot fairly describe myself at this moment as a marrying man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It took <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> for I had {{forgotten}} the Cowbell in the excitement of succeeding events, and I now saw myself {{on the edge of}} the pit I had digged.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your pardon, Señor Colon," [...] he {{immediately}} and more courteously added; [...] "but your conditions sounded so lofty {{that they have}} quite taken <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> You cannot seriously mean to maintain them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “The {{blizzard}} came unusually early,” said Mr. Merrick apologetically. “It took <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> But I {{imagine there}} will be a few days more of decent weather before winter finally sets in. By that time—” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Everard," [...] {{the doctor}} began, [...] "this return of Lady Dominey's has taken <b>me</b> {{altogether}} <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> I had intended to-morrow morning {{to discuss the}} situation with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So you {{are back}} again, Ned? Your note took <b>me</b> quite <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> for {{you had said}} nothing as to your going away when I met you early in the day.' ...|$|R
60|$|A second perplexing {{circumstance}} {{which happened}} on the same day, and which took <b>me</b> completely <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> added greatly {{to the sense of}} uneasiness that was now weighing on my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was Sophy's doing,' she said. 'Naughty girl; {{she tried}} to take <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> She would not let me look in the glass, but I guessed--and oh! she was {{wounding}} her poor hands so sadly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me, Miss Macnab--for {{of course}} you can be no other," [...] said Lumley, {{advancing}} promptly and grasping the hand, [...] "but your--your-- sudden, and I may almost say magical, appearance has so taken <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> that--that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "I quite understand. I was not playing cribbage, but I was doing nothing very important. However, as you {{certainly}} did take <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> perhaps you will excuse my coat." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{turned to}} the doctor. He took <b>me</b> {{completely}} <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> No incredulous smile appeared on his face; no jesting words passed his lips. He was listening to us attentively. He was waiting gravely to hear more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to think, Master Geoffrey. It takes <b>me</b> all <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> and I don't know how I stand in the matter. You see, your father gave you into my charge, and what could I say to him if I went back empty handed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' she averred, decisively {{shaking her}} head. 'It took <b>me</b> as much <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> as it {{probably}} did you. But why should I have told!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quien sabe? The {{girls do}} not like me! The men do not care," [...] she declared. [...] "José took <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> though, or I would have killed him. But who are you, and where did you come from?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{ought to}} congratulate you," [...] he said. Their eyes met, and his {{expressed}} perplexity and curiosity.

6000|$|... "The Peaviners took <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> and Bill by the bridle {{and began}} a {{conversation}} that wasn't entirely disassociated with the subject of fruit trees.

6000|$|... "I am overpowered, Mr. Linton. It has {{all come}} upon <b>me</b> so much <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> that I {{do not know}} what I ought to say or do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed,' said Mountclere. 'Well, I {{came to see}} you {{in order}} to speak of a matter which I thought you might know more about than I do, for it has taken <b>me</b> quite <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> My brother, Lord Mountclere, is, it seems, to be privately married to Mrs. Petherwin to-morrow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sire," [...] {{replied the}} Indian, [...] "the rapidity of his {{movements}} took <b>me</b> so <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> {{that he was}} out of hearing before I recovered my speech.

6000|$|... "Quite well, dear Julia, and {{so glad to}} see you. It is so good of you to take <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> this way; just at lunch-time, too. Another {{plate and}} knife, Matty. This is a little boy--a friend--not exactly a friend, but a--a thingumy, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, I {{had never}} been under any {{delusion}} on that score, as I have shown you. The demand did not take <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> at all. I was waiting for it, knowing that my answer to it would pronounce my doom. But I delivered it none the less.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is my name," [...] Mannering answered, [...] "but if {{you want}} to speak to me why don't you come up like a man, instead of dogging my footsteps? It looked as though you wanted to take <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> What is that you are hiding up your sleeve?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{write it}} {{with a sense of}} humiliation; Miss Jillgall listened attentively to all I had to say--and then took <b>me</b> {{completely}} <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> This inquisitive, meddlesome, restless, impudent woman suddenly transformed herself into a perfect model of amiability and decorum. She actually said she agreed with me, and was much obliged for my good advice! ...|$|R
60|$|The ineffable {{insolence}} of this waif took <b>me</b> quite <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> He {{spoke with}} extreme volubility, and assumed the commanding {{air of a}} man of six-feet-four, though only a boy of four-feet-six.

60|$|The suddenness of his appearance, in {{the very}} last place under heaven in which I should have {{expected}} to see him, took <b>me</b> completely <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> The messenger wished me good-morning, {{and got into the}} fly again.
