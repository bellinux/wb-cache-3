Sheffield, Bolton and Hull have received the largest numbers, accounting for just under half of all refugees resettled under the programme between 2004 and 2012.

30|$|As for the EU-Turkey relationship, the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> as a conflictual {{parameter}} {{makes the}} institutionalization of it highly unstable. As a conflictual parameter, the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> plays both a catalyst and inhibitor role in {{the institutionalization of}} the EU-Turkey relationship. Therefore, on the one hand, the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> could continue to become a significant factor preventing Turkey’s full membership to the EU in the near future. On the other hand, if the European integration gradually becomes more heterogeneous/multidimensional, Turkey might {{find a place in}} this fragmented structure and the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> might play a catalyst role in this instance. Firstly, the EU needs Turkey’s cooperation to control the future immigration crises as a geopolitical measure, and the maintenance of this cooperation requires further institutionalization with Turkey. Secondly, according to Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs [111], 5.5 million Turkish people already live in the Western European countries, and the migration has already made Turkey the EU’s de facto member because these people constitute a significant Turkish diaspora in the EU and the EU member countries again need the cooperation with Turkey for the governance of them. All in all, Turkey refuses a special partnership instead of the full membership at the movement, but the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> might make a differentiated membership formula a more reasonable option for both Turkey and the EU member states if the EU gains a more multidimensional and non-hierarchical structure in the future.|$|R

In a Government statement, Alarcón was described as the [...] "best qualified" [...] to deal with such delicate issues as emigration, and his knowledge of the [...] "fundamental causes" [...] to mass emigration from Cuba. Alarcón, along with the Cuba's Government, believes that the United States economic embargo against Cuba is the main blame for the mass emigration from the country. The negotiations were suspended for a while when he abruptly travelled to Cuba to discuss the situation with the Cuban Government. After his abrupt visit to Cuba, he returned to the United States and continued the negotiations. When he returned to the United States, he was more positive in tone, and several Cuban officials told the media that an agreement could be reached. Alarcón was able to reach an agreement with the United States Government on 9 September 1994, and the United States promised to issue at least 20,000 immigrant visas a year for Cuban citizens seeking to leave their homeland.|$|E

30|$|An institutionalization {{process is}} under the {{influence}} of the complex interactions between exogenous and endogenous dynamics in the social world. Therefore, endogenous dynamics might play an important role in an institutional change as well as the exogenous shocks [23, 34]. If we conceptualize institutional change as a transformation from one institutional structure to another one, change might be considered as a temporal issue and stability as the permanent nature of this process. However, instability might prevail over stability in an institutionalization process. The above-mentioned complexity might result in particularly conflictual parameters in an institutionalization process which prevent it from a clear transformation from one structure to another one. For example, Streeck and Thelen [35] point out drifts as a reason for change ‘in the way the institution works out in its social enactment by leaving its structure unchanged’ [36]. According to this drift understanding, if the outcomes of an institutional structure are negatively changed, the actors’ attitudes towards this structure also change ‘by leaving its structure unchanged’ (ibid.). Although this approach still perceives drifts as a way for a gradual transformation (from one institutional structure to another one), ‘externally induced policy drift may sometimes be wholly inadvertent’ due to the complex interactions between exogenous and endogenous dynamics [37]. If we analyse the EU-Turkey relationship from this point of view, we can see that external changes historically evolved the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> into a conflictual parameter in the institutionalization of the EU-Turkey relationship, and this caused a drift making instability the main feature of the institutionalization of the EU-Turkey relationship. To illustrate, even though Turkey’s relationship with the EU as a candidate country continues according the EU’s legal framework, Turkey is treated differently compared to other candidates from the Central and Eastern European countries (the current and former candidate countries), and the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> as a conflictual parameter plays a significant role in this difference/drift. Thus, it becomes important to understand how the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> has gradually become a conflictual parameter in the institutionalization of the EU-Turkey relationship.|$|R

30|$|This article {{argues that}} {{migration}} {{has evolved into}} a conflictual parameter in the institutionalization of the EU-Turkey relationship and that it plays {{a significant role in the}} formation of instability as the main feature of this institutionalization process. Moreover, migration in its nature is a dynamic/non-linear social phenomenon which makes an institutionalization process highly open to exogenous effects and quite unstable. Therefore, contrary to the mainstream institutionalist approaches, this case study argues that an institutionalization process does not necessarily bring about continuity in the wake of an exogenous shock, but if an institutionalization process contains conflictual parameters (like the <b>migration</b> <b>issue)</b> with a strong connection with endogenous and exogenous dynamics, instability/change might become the main feature of it. From this point of view, this study anticipates that the migration-like dynamic parameters will keep the European integration as an ongoing process in the future, and its structure will be subject to a continual change. Furthermore, this change-oriented institutionalization might make the EU more heterogeneous and multi-dimensional in time. Related to this anticipation, even though the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> plays an inhibitor role in Turkey’s accession process to the EU at the moment, it might play a catalyst role in this process by making a differentiated membership a more reasonable option for both the EU countries and Turkey in a more differentiated EU structure in the future.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{as noted}} in the third section, {{migration}} in its nature is also a dynamic social phenomenon which not only prevents the EU member states from institutionalizing a stable migration regime but also relatedly makes the institutionalization of the EU-Turkey relationship more fragile against exogenous shocks. The Western European countries initially institutionalized the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> in a human rights framework; however, the securitization of the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> forces them to seek alternatives and they have become highly sensitive to exogenous developments related to this issue. In this regard, the Syrian immigrant influx in 2015 is a good example showing the sensitivity of the EU countries to the migration-related exogenous developments and how the <b>migration</b> <b>issue</b> makes the institutionalization of the EU-Turkey relations open to change. Even though the Turkish immigration issue has historically become a great reason behind the opposition against Turkey’s EU membership, free travel right was promised to all of the Turkish citizens in return for a re-admission agreement which would hopefully prevent the irregular immigration flows to the EU. In addition to Schroeder and Blair’s pro-Turkey policy, Merkel’s pro-Turkey formulation is a significant indicator suggesting that the European integration process is not only related to permissive consensus; dynamic parameters with an intertwined connection with exogenous and endogenous variables might also {{play a significant role in}} its development. However, the effects of dynamic parameters on the integration process might be in a way making it more unstable and open to change. For example, this case study clearly shows that the mentioned pro-Turkey formulation is developed by the European leaders as an immediate measure against the immigration influx despite the public opposition to Turkey’s EU membership, and the lack of public support gradually weakens the implementation of this formulation. Moreover, a change obviating the need for this formulation is also possible in the complex international environment. Therefore, it could be argued that the immediate need to respond to an exogenous shock might contribute to the fluctuation of an institutionalization process, and the post-shock era might be more unstable than what the main institutionalist approaches indicate.|$|R
