40|$|Library use {{is declining}} in the United States because print media {{is no longer}} the {{preferred}} media of a large majority of the population. Of the wide variety of media used for information, instruction, and entertainment, only a saga: variety is available through the public library. Selection of appropriate media formats for library acquisition depends upon local needs. To increase the variety of media available, several models of interinstitutional cooperation, networking, and consolidation may be used. To increase cost effectiveness, more preliminary research on media utilization and costs is imperative. New media in the library will create new personnel needs.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the Canberra Teaching Resources Centre was derived partly from the teachers' centre {{movement}} which originated in England {{and to a lesser}} extent from the American educational materials centre concept. This field study uses historical method to trace the establishment and development of the Centre with an emphasis on the role of its first Director. The planning initiative lay with the Commonwealth Department of Education and Science from 1968 to 1972 although considerable teacher input was invited and received in 1970. Originally seen as a regional centre in the N. S. W. education systemf the Centre, when its Director took up duty in 1972, was influenced by educational reports of A. C. T. and national significance and in 1974 became part of the Interim A. C. T. Schools Authority. It operated in a limited way in 1973 but was ready by 1974 to act not only as a teachers' centre for the A. C. T. but as an agency of the new education system. The Centre's activities, involving integration of five main functions, expanded rapidly in 1974 and 1975. Demand as a meeting place for teachers soon overtaxed accommodation in the City Education Centre and additional space was acquired in Griffith Infants' School late in 1975. Displays of educational material evoked the least response from teachers. Demands on the <b>multi-media</b> <b>Library's</b> loan service grew so quickly that related services could not be developed. The entrepreneurial in-service education activities expanded quickly in volume and range and played an important part in establishing a new system. Audio-visual services developed more slowly and production of curriculum materials was just beginning in 1976. While teacher demand continued to grow, the Centre's development was held back from late 1975 by government economic policy and in mid- 1976 it faced serious staffing and accommodation constraints. Closer integration with the Authority's Curriculum Branch selmed the Centre's most likely future path...|$|R

We present the theory of similarity thesauri, which are information structures derived from corpora, and show how they can be used for cross-language retrieval. In evaluating our similarity thesaurusbased approach to cross-language retrieval over a parallel collection of legal texts, we show that cross-language retrieval can perform equally as well as monolingual retrieval in the certain cases. We also present the results of a first evaluation of cross-language retrieval with spoken news material. We conclude that providing cross-language access to <b>multi-media</b> digital <b>libraries</b> is already a viable possibility. 1 Introduction There are many example scenarios in which users of a digital library may be interested in information which is in a language other than their own native language [...] . ...|$|R

5000|$|Carré {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Los Angeles. Her mother is a graphic {{designer}} and her father, who died when Carré was a teenager, was a designer and forensic animator. She has said that a [...] "major activity throughout my childhood was when my parents would roll out a big sheet of butcher paper on the apartment floor, and my sister and I would amuse ourselves quietly for hours by drawing images and stories all over it". Carré transferred to an arts high school in her senior year and then left Los Angeles, initially to study sound at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) and become a sound artist, but she became interested in creative writing, film, and printmaking. While studying she also worked in the Joan Flasch Artists' Book Collection. As part of her creative writing classes she read various short story writers and cites Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar as having inspired her very much. She received her BFA from SAIC in 2006 and settled in Chicago where she currently lives and works. Carré worked part-time at the Facets <b>Multi-Media</b> film <b>library</b> for several years, an experience she has said influenced her filmmaking.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the scheme reached the United Kingdom, where its nature was radically changed {{to be more}} a {{self-help}} organisation {{under the influence of}} its founders, Peter Laslett, Michael Young and Eric Midwinter. This model is also used in Australia, Cyprus, Dominica, New Zealand and South Africa.In the British model of peer learning, it is acknowledged that retired people have a lifetime of experience and, collectively, a vast amount of knowledge. This is used to arrange a syllabus for each subject where each meeting is normally led {{by a member of the}} group with a strong interest or specialist knowledge.Each U3A group pays a capitation fee to the national coordinating body, and has access to a vast range of resources including a <b>multi-media</b> lending <b>library,</b> special-interest newsletters and contacts with other groups with similar interests. Summer schools are held by special interest groups. Most importantly, each Group is an absolutely autonomous entity, self-financing and self-managing. In 2016 the British U3A reported its 1000th member, at Churchdown, Gloucestershire which has 26 groups, after reporting 950 in 2015, running 36,000 courses for 350,000 people.Most groups are regional in nature, and this has led to the creation in some countries of variations on the U3A. For example, in Cyprus there is a U3A, an organisation called C3A (Cyprus Third Age), which is affiliated to the UK U3A, and P3A (Paphos Third Age).|$|R

40|$|Too often, {{successful}} {{system development}} projects fail {{to leave a}} legacy of design transfer information, beyond providing access to the mere physical descriptions of the system, or the software code itself.
