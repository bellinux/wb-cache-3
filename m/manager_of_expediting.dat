40|$|We {{consider}} a single-item, periodic review inventory control problem where discrete stochastic demand must be satisfied. When shortages occur, the unmet demand must {{be filled by}} some form <b>of</b> <b>expediting.</b> We allow a very general form for the cost structure <b>of</b> <b>expediting,</b> including the special case of lost sales. Examples <b>of</b> <b>expediting</b> are overtime production, where production is allowed above and beyond shortfall, and premium freight shipments, where backlogged products are built early the same period they are needed and then shipped very quickly. For the infinite horizon discounted problem, we characterize the structure <b>of</b> the optimal <b>expediting</b> policy and show that an (s, S) policy is optimal for regular production. In certain cases we demonstrate {{that it may be}} optimal to use overtime production to build up inventory over and above the Traditionally, managers have controlled inventory by setting high enough inventory levels that the likelihood of stockouts is low, and allowing parts to be backordered when shortage...|$|R

6000|$|Now Biedenbach, {{after he}} left Glen Ellen, had invented a most {{powerful}} explosive--"expedite" [...] he called it. This was the weapon the balloons used. They were only hot-air balloons, clumsily and hastily made, but they did the work. I saw it all {{from the top of}} an office building. The first balloon missed the fortresses completely and disappeared into the country; but we learned about it afterward. Burton and O'Sullivan were in it. As they were descending they swept across a railroad directly over a troop-train that was heading at full speed for Chicago. They dropped their whole supply <b>of</b> <b>expedite</b> upon the locomotive. The resulting wreck tied the line up for days. And the best of it was that, released from the weight <b>of</b> <b>expedite,</b> the balloon shot up into the air and did not come down for half a dozen miles, both heroes escaping unharmed.|$|R

No research has previously examined women's experiences <b>of</b> <b>expedited</b> referral. This {{was investigated in}} the present study using questionnaires (6 -item State Anxiety Inventory (6 -STAI)) and focus groups. A total of 55 women completed questionnaires. Results showed high levels of anxiety at first hospital visit (mean 47. 0 (SD 14. 27); 95 % CI 43. 14 – 50. 93). Scores declined by 90 days, but were higher in those not undergoing hysteroscopy. Fifteen women who underwent hysteroscopy attended focus groups. Women recalled fear of cancer from symptom onset until receipt of results. Anxiety was exacerbated by poor knowledge of PMB and lack <b>of</b> awareness <b>of</b> <b>expedited</b> referral. Post-discharge, those with unexplained or recurrent symptoms expressed frustration and upset. Effective strategies to raise awareness of PMB and its causes are needed, including reasons for expedited referral. Women without cancer may also need more support...|$|R
