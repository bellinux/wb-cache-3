If C ≡ 1 (mod 4) we give a very sharp bound for prime values of the exponent n; our main tool here is the result on existence of primitive divisors in Lehmer sequence due Bilu, Hanrot and Voutier. When C ̸ ≡ 1 (mod 4) we explain how the equation can be solved using the multi-Frey variant of the modular approach. We illustrate our approach by solving completely the equations x 2 + 17 a 1 = 2 <b>y</b> <b>n,</b> x 2 + 5 a 113 a 2 = 2 <b>y</b> <b>n,</b> and x 2 + 3 a 111 a 2 = 2 <b>y</b> <b>n.</b> 1. introduction The Diophantine equation x 2 + C = <b>y</b> <b>n,</b> in integer unknowns x, <b>y</b> and <b>n</b> ≥ 3, has a long and distinguished history.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the hyperon-nucleon interactions in the QCD sum rule {{starting from the}} nucleon matrix element of the hyperon correlation function.

The dispersion integral around the hyperon-nucleon (<b>Y</b> <b>N)</b> threshold is identified {{as a measure of}} the interaction strength in the <b>Y</b> <b>N</b> channel. The Wilson coefficients of the OPE for the hyperon correlation function are calculated. The obtained sum rules relate <b>Y</b> <b>N</b> interaction strengths to the nucleon matrix elements of the quark-gluon composite operators, which include strange quark operators as well as up and down quark operators. It is found that the <b>Y</b> <b>N</b> interaction strengths are smaller than the NN interaction strength since the nucleon matrix elements of strange quark operators are smaller than those of up and down quark operators. Among <b>Y</b> <b>N</b> channels ΛN channel has stronger interaction than ΣN and ΞN channels.
