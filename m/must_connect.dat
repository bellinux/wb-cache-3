5|$|The game {{provides}} {{several options}} for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the security systems and turrets. The player can hack {{into any of}} Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar to Pipe Mania where the player <b>must</b> <b>connect</b> two points {{on opposite sides of}} a grid with a limited set of piping within a fixed amount of time, with failure to complete in time costing health and potentially sounding alarms. Early in the game, the player is given a research camera; by taking photographs of enemies, the player will cumulatively gain knowledge about the individual foes which translates into attack boosts and other benefits when facing that enemy type in the future.|$|E

500|$|The {{player can}} upgrade their skills by using [...] "cyber-modules" [...] given as rewards for {{completing}} objectives such as searching {{the ship and}} then spend them at devices called [...] "cyber-upgrade units" [...] to obtain enhanced skills. Operating system (O/S) units allow one-time character upgrades to be made (e.g. permanent health enhancement). An in-game currency called [...] "nanites" [...] may be spent on items at vending machines, including ammunition supplies and health packs. [...] "Quantum Bio-Reconstruction Machines" [...] can be activated and reconstitute the player for 10 nanites if they die inside {{the area in which}} the machine resides. Otherwise, the game ends and progress must be resumed from a save point. The player can hack devices, such as keypads to open alternate areas and vending machines to reduce prices. When a hack is attempted, a minigame begins that features a grid of green nodes; the player <b>must</b> <b>connect</b> three in a straight row to succeed. Optionally, electronic lock picks, called [...] "ICE-picks", can be found that will automatically hack a machine, regardless of its difficulty.|$|E

2500|$|At its 2015 {{triennial}} General Convention, the Church adopted “canonical and liturgical {{changes to}} provide marriage equality for Episcopalians.” The canonical change eliminated “language defining marriage as {{between a man}} and a woman.” The “two new marriage rites” contain language that allows “them to be used by same-sex or opposite-sex couples.” The blessing of same-sex relationships is not uniform throughout the Episcopal Church. Bishops may determine whether churches and priests within their dioceses are permitted to use the new liturgies. Bishops who do not permit their use <b>must</b> <b>connect</b> same-sex couples to a diocese where the liturgies are allowed. [...] Still, no Episcopal priest is required to perform the new liturgies, even in dioceses in which they are permitted. The Church also opposes any state or federal constitutional amendments designed to prohibit the marriages of same-sex couples.|$|E

60|$|Since, however, it is {{apparent}} that here, as in every other state, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defenses on every side. While under this general recommendation provision for defending our seacoast line readily occurs to the mind, I also in the same connection ask the attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots of arms and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements, all at well-selected points upon these, would be of great importance to the national defense and preservation. I ask attention to the views of the Secretary of War, expressed in his report, upon the same general subject. I deem it of importance that the loyal regions of east Tennessee and western North Carolina should be connected with Kentucky and other faithful parts of the Union by railroad.

60|$|Under this philosophic {{instructor}} in the ETHICS OF VANITY, they have attempted in France a regeneration {{of the moral}} constitution of man. Statesmen, like your present rulers, exist by everything which is spurious, fictitious, and false; by everything which takes the man from his house, and sets him on a stage; which makes him up an artificial creature, with painted theatric sentiments, fit {{to be seen by}} the glare of candlelight, and formed to be contemplated at a due distance. Vanity is too apt to prevail in all of us, and in all countries. To the improvement of Frenchmen it seems not absolutely necessary that it should be taught upon system. But it is plain that the present rebellion was its legitimate offspring, and it is piously fed by that rebellion with a daily dole. If the system of institution recommended by the Assembly be false and theatric, it is because their system of government is of the same character. To that, and to that alone, it is strictly conformable. To understand either, we <b>must</b> <b>connect</b> the morals with the politics of the legislators.

6000|$|Why was it {{that the}} 'Origin of Species' possessed this {{extraordinary}} vitalising and kinetic power, this germinal energy, this contagious force, beyond all other forms of evolutionism previously promulgated? Why did the world, that listened so coldly to Lamarck and Chambers, turn so ready an ear to Charles Darwin and natural selection? Partly, no doubt, because in the fulness of time the moment had come and the prophet had arisen. All great movements are long brewing, and burst out at last (like the Reformation and the French Revolution) with explosive energy. But the cause is largely to be found, also, I believe, in the peculiar nature of the Darwinian solution. True, a thoroughly logical mind, a mind of the very highest order, would have said even before Darwin, 'Creation can have no possible place in the physical series of things at all. How organisms came to be I do not yet exactly see; but I am sure they must {{have come to be}} by some merely physical process, if we could only find it out.' And such minds were all actually evolutionary even before Darwin had made the modus operandi of evolution intelligible. But most people are not so clear-sighted. They require to have everything proved to them by the strictest collocation of actual instances. They will not believe unless one rise from the dead. There are men who rejected the raw doctrine of special creation on evidence adduced; and there are men who never even for a moment entertained it as conceivable. The former compose the mass of the scientific world, and it was for their conversion that the Darwinian hypothesis was so highly salutary. As Professor Fiske rightly remarks, 'The truth is that before the publication of the [...] "Origin of Species" [...] there was no opinion whatever current respecting the subject that deserved to be called a scientific hypothesis. That the more complex forms of life must have come into existence through some process of development from simpler forms was no doubt the only sensible and rational view to take of the subject; but in a vague and general opinion of this sort there is nothing that is properly scientific. A scientific hypothesis <b>must</b> <b>connect</b> the phenomena with which it deals by alleging a [...] "true cause;" [...] and before 1859 no one had suggested a [...] "true cause" [...] for the origination of new species, although the problem was one over which every philosophical naturalist had puzzled {{since the beginning of the}} century. This explains why Mr. Darwin's success was so rapid and complete, and it also explains why he came so near being anticipated.' To put it briefly, a priori, creation is from the very first unbelievable; but, as a matter of evidence, Lamarck failed to make evolution comprehensible, or to give a rationale of its mode of action, while Darwin's theory of natural selection succeeded in doing so for those who awaited a posteriori proof. Hence Darwin was able to convert the world, where Lamarck had only been able to stir up enquiry among the picked spirits of the scientific and philosophical coterie. Therein lies the true secret of his rapid, his brilliant, and his triumphant progress. He had found out not only that it was so, but how it was so, too. In Aristotelian phrase, he had discovered the πῶς as well as the ὅτι.|$|E
