2500|$|One {{interpretation}} is that Shakespeare's sonnets are a pastiche or {{parody of the}} 300-year-old tradition of Petrarchan love sonnets; Shakespeare consciously inverts conventional gender roles as delineated in Petrarchan sonnets {{to create a more}} complex depiction of human love. [...] He plays with gender roles (20), comments on political events (124), makes fun of love (128), speaks openly about sexual desire (129), parodies beauty (130) and even references pornography (151). In a dozen of the sonnets to the youth, Shakespeare also refers to his [...] "disgrace": [...] "My name be buried where <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> / And live no more to shame nor me nor you." [...] (72) ...|$|E

I've begun to explore in the {{recording}} studio whenever I have time in Barcelona and here in Miami. I'm working with different producers and DJs, and I try to feed off from that and find new sources of inspiration and new musical motivation. I'm anxious {{to return to the}} studio. <b>My</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> asking for it". In February 2012, Shakira revealed a picture of herself, LMFAO and Akon working in the studio together, it was also revealed she was working with other producers such as Benny Blanco, Tiësto, RedOne, Max Martin, Dr. Luke.

2500|$|In 2013, after a {{long period}} of radio silence, the {{official}} Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale. Among other updates, an amendment to the 'History' section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith's accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band's hiatus: [...] And so for five years, history ceased to be created by Cardiacs. Unless we consider the undignified shenanigans of Tim Smith who ‘fell’ into a pool filled with shit and is still crawling and scratching his way out of it. The ALPHABET BUSINESS CONCERN wishes it to be known that, whilst maintaining complete control of his artistic output, they disassociate themselves ENTIRELY with his recent illness and, in fact, fail to recognise it as an excuse for not fulfilling his duties. [...] A message was also posted from Tim Smith's personal Facebook account: [...] Hello Kidz! (You will notice that I spelled the word kidz with a 'z'). I have been bowled over and knocked back by the outpourings of love, posted on here. Every one of them. You have no idea what this means. Really though. While I would love to respond to each message, you are doubtlessly aware, <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> my enemy and my hands are cunts. Nonetheless it means the world to me, thank you all so much. I am truly blessed. [...] Sporadic status updates continue to be posted on Smith's Facebook page, which readily accepts friend requests of fans.|$|E

2500|$|Most Bond {{girls are}} {{apparently}} (and sometimes expressly) sexually {{experienced by the}} time they meet Bond. Quite often those previous experiences have not been positive, and many Bond girls have had sexual violence inflicted on them in the past which has caused them to feel alienated from all men—until Bond comes along. Tiffany Case was gang-raped as a teenager; Honey Ryder, too, was beaten and raped as a teenager by a drunken acquaintance. Pussy Galore was sexually abused at age 12 by her uncle. While there is no such clear-cut trauma in Solitaire's early life, there are suggestions that she, too, avoids men because of their unwanted sexual advances in her past. Kissy Suzuki reports to Bond that during her brief career in Hollywood, when she was 17, [...] "They thought that because I am Japanese I am some sort of an animal and that <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> for everyone." [...] The implication is often that these violent episodes have turned the Bond girls in question against men, though upon encountering Bond they overcome their earlier antipathy and sleep with him not only willingly but eagerly. The cliché reaches its most extreme (perhaps absurd) level in Goldfinger. In this novel Pussy Galore is portrayed as a practising lesbian when she first meets Bond, {{but at the end of}} the novel she sleeps with him. When, in bed, he says to her, [...] "They told me you only liked women," [...] she replies, [...] "I never met a man before." ...|$|E
