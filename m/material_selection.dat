The objectives of this assessment were to evaluate previously proposed <b>materials</b> <b>selections,</b> evaluate the current state-of-the-art materials, propose potential alternate <b>materials</b> <b>selections</b> and identify research and development efforts needed to provide materials that can meet the stringent system requirements.

40|$|Multi-attribute utility {{analysis}} (MAUA) {{has emerged}} as a powerful tool for <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> and evaluation. An operations research technique, MAUA has been used in a wide range ol engineering areas, of which materials science and engineering {{is one of the more}} recent. Utility analysis affords a rational method of <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> which avoids many of the fundamental logical difficulties of many widely used alternative approaches. However, MAUA has traditionally been used in <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> problems only, in which there is certainty regarding the attribute levels of the alternatives. For many new technologies this is not the case. Another operations research technique, subjective probability assessment (SPA), can be used to address this issue. SPA makes it possible to measure a probabilistic distribution describing the confidence of the decision maker in the levels of attributes for which there is a high degree of uncertainty. These probability distributions can be used in conjunction with MAUA to provide a consistent framework for making <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> decisions. Furthermore, the use of these techniques extends beyond the problem of <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> into the more speculative areas of materials competitiveness and market demand in cases involving new, unproven technologies...|$|R

40|$|The set of {{materials}} available to microsystems designers is rapidly expanding. Techniques now exist to introduce and integrate {{a large number}} of metals, alloys, ceramics, glasses, polymers, and elastomers into microsystems, motivating the need for a rational approach for <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> in microsystems design. As a step toward such an approach, we focus on the initial stages of <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> for micromechanical structures with minimum feature sizes greater than 1 /spl mu/m. The variation of mechanical properties with length scale and processing parameters is discussed. Bounds for initial design values of several properties are suggested and the necessity for the measurement of other properties (especially residual stresses and intrinsic loss coefficients) is discussed. Adapting the methods pioneered by Ashby et al., materials indices are formulated for a number of properties and <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> charts are presented. These concepts are applied to illustrate initial <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> for shock-resistant microbeams, force sensors, micromechanical filters, and micromachined flexures. Issues associated with the integration {{of materials}} into microsystems are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|Concept: The use of <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> in {{professional}} appliances increased in recent times, {{thanks to its}} potential pre-evaluation of materials’ performance and impact on industrial production processes. <b>Materials</b> <b>selection</b> permits cost reduction in preventive tests, introduction of innovative materials and technologies, materials optimization and decreasing of failures. Through a collaboration among Politecnico di Milano (Department of Design and Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering “Giulio Natta”) and Electrolux Professional S. p. A. (Global Research & Development, Innovation & Technologies Area), an evaluation of materials’ tangible and intangible properties has been developed using non-traditional methods. In the first part, this work evidences the major limits and critical points of the materials’ selection tools currently and most commonly proposed in industrial applications. Within these, the main key points highlighted are the translation and connection of quantitative and qualitative properties and the risk associated to the <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> process reliability. In a second step, some ameliorative hypotheses are built to overcome these limits, using a repeatable and suitable method for different <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> cases. Motivations and objectives: From the critical analysis of Ashby and Karana <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> processes emerged a critical issue: the need of a unique language to evaluate the different properties commonly investigated in a <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> conducted both from engineers and designers. The nontraditional <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> methodology would offer a complete evaluation of different properties: material’s technical properties (e. g. mechanical, thermal and process parameters), durability (e. g. food chemicals and detergents), food-material compliance and intangible properties (e. g. customer perception). The need of a unique <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> method, able to convert quantitative to qualitative evaluation of properties and to estimate the risk associated to the <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> reliability, driven the research. A procedure, which evaluates components’ life and possible failure modes (based on DOE), is under development in order to integrate these information into the future products development. Results and discussion: The research presents {{the development of the}} <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> methodology under considerations supported by a case study focused on durability properties of materials. Each professional appliance can be seen as an input-output system constituted by materials and components that interact and have an effect on materials and components, generating different outputs. Failures are possible outputs, due to different factors, and decrease the efficiency of the system, reducing the guaranteed performances. As regards the perception of the same professional appliances by the users, their quality is unconsciously rated on the basis of visual, haptic and auditory feedback generated during the user-product interaction. The “Sensory Metrology” has been selected as appropriate method in investigating both physical properties of the materials, and in evaluating the relation with some descriptors (e. g. adjectives) associated to the perception of quality and robustness of the whole appliance...|$|R

30|$|As future research, the {{extended}} MULTIMOORA {{approach can be}} considered for application in many case studies other than <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> problem. For instance, decision making over the selection of optimal manufacturing process and the evaluation of failure modes risks can be done using the proposed model. In the field of <b>materials</b> <b>selection,</b> only two typical practical examples were presented in this paper. Other real-world <b>materials</b> <b>selection</b> problems with a number of various alternatives and attributes can be considered. The final rankings of the proposed model for the two examples were compared with a few approaches. The comparison of the present paper results with other MADM methods or expert systems seems to be interesting. As different extensions of the MULTIMOORA method, other concepts for assigning relative importance of attributes can be utilized.|$|R

50|$|Of course, {{cost per}} kg {{is not the}} only {{important}} factor in <b>material</b> <b>selection.</b> An important concept is 'cost per unit of function'. For example, if the key design objective was the stiffness of a plate of the material, as described in the introductory paragraph above, then the designer would need a material with the optimal combination of density, Young's modulus, and price. Optimizing complex combinations of technical and price properties is a hard process to achieve manually, so rational <b>material</b> <b>selection</b> software is an important tool.|$|E
