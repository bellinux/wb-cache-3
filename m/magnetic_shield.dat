25|$|Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf {{created the}} Air-King line to honor RAF pilots of the Battle of Britain. By 2007, the 1142XX {{iteration}} of the Air-King featured a COSC-certified movement in a 34mm case, {{considered by some}} a miniaturized variant of the 39mm Rolex Explorer as both watches featured very similar styling cues; the 34mm Air-King lineup was the least expensive series of Oyster Perpetual. In 2014 the Air-King was dropped, making the Oyster Perpetual 26/31/34/36/39 the entry-level Rolex line. In 2016 Rolex reintroduced the Air-King, available as a single model (number 116900), largely similar to its predecessors but with a larger 40mm case, and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>shield</b> found on the Rolex Milgauss; indeed the new 40mm Air-King is slightly cheaper than the 39mm Explorer (the Explorer lacks the <b>magnetic</b> <b>shield</b> but its movement has Paraflex shock absorbers that are {{not found in the}} Air-King's movement).|$|E
25|$|A shield can be {{effective}} against one type of electromagnetic field but not against another. For example, a copper foil or screen RF shield will be minimally effective against power frequency magnetic fields. A power frequency <b>magnetic</b> <b>shield</b> could offer little reduction of radio frequency fields. The {{same is true for}} different RF frequencies. A simple large-mesh screen shield can work well for lower frequencies, but can be ineffective for microwaves.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultrahigh}} sensitivity atomic spin magnetometer as {{the magnetic}} measurement sensor has received much concern. The {{performance of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> cylinder {{is one of the}} key factors constraining the atomic spin magnetometer’s sensitivity. In order to effectively improve the performances of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding,</b> the parameter optimization models of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> cylinder were established in this paper. Under the condition of changing only one parameter while the others keeping constant, the effects of various parameters influencing the axial shielding coefficient were comprehensively analyzed, and the results showed that the smaller the innermost length, the innermost radius, and the radial spacing were, and the greater the axial spacing was, the better the shielding performance could be obtained. According to these results and the actual needs, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> cylinder was optimally designed, and then the shielding effects were simulated via the software Ansoft. The simulation results showed that the optimized <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> cylinder had the advantages of small size, high shielding performance, and lager uniformity than that of the nonoptimized one.

40|$|Abstract: Action of {{electric}} and magnetic fields and their interaction effects {{are the basis}} of operation of every electrical and electronic instrument. But such action fields could also cause serious problems to the functioning of those instruments if they act on them unnecessarily, to the extreme, failure of the system may also occur. To avoid such unpleasant consequences arising out of unwanted electromagnetic interferences, in recent days, many modern magnetic systems employ <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> for their safety and security. For the people of scientific pedagogy associated with magnetic systems, deep understanding {{of the concept of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> not only increases their domain knowledge and also will strongly aid them for the effective implementation of protected new magnetic systems. Literature survey reveals that not many sources available for the demonstration of the concept of <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> coupled with an experiment. Hence, this work is attempted. The objective {{of this paper is to}} illustrate the concept of <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> by way of a simple demonstration and its experimental realization for the benefit of scientific pedagogy in teaching-learning process. In brief, <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> is a process of restraining the entry of magnetic flux lines from reaching a specific point or region. This is normally achieved by re-routing the magnetic flux, suitably establishing an alternate path for it as the stoppage of magnetic flux lines is limited by Maxwell’s equation. This article describes a simple procedure to demonstrate <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> and its experimental realization. Inclusion of photographs of the experimental set-up used in our laboratory for the demonstration of <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> provides a better tool for teaching and learning process. This article is prepared with a view to effectively communicate the concept of <b>magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> in an efficient way for the curious learners of magnetism.

Our general conclusion is that for common experimental geometries and conditions, <b>magnetic</b> <b>shields</b> should not significantly reduce sensitivity to exotic spin-dependent interactions, especially when the technique of comagnetometry is used.
