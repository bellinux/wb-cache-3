5|$|In 1782, the Tây Sơn {{attacked}} Gia Định (later {{known as}} Saigon and now Ho Chi Minh City) again and forced Nguyễn Ánh {{to flee to}} the island of Phú Quốc under Duyệt's escort. It was one of <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> Gia Định changed hands. In 1787, Duyệt began organizing and commanding his own unit, and individually recruited his own enlisted men. In 1788, the tide began to turn in favour of the Nguyễn, after Pigneau de Behaine, a French Catholic priest who befriended Nguyễn Ánh {{in the hope that}} the young prince would gain power and give special privileges to his religion, recruited French military officers to fight for the Nguyễn. In 1788, the Nguyễn recaptured Gia Định and never relinquished it again. From then on, Nguyễn Ánh transformed the city into a fortress and his powerbase and began consolidating his hold on the surrounding area, before attacking the Tây Sơn with a view to eliminating them.|$|E

Being remote places and thinking that guerrillas were hiding there, these two barrios were zonified two times giving up several lives. The Japanese Imperial Army made the schools as their garrison.|$|E

25|$|Cross used in Marthoma Church Chancel {{particularly}} {{at the center of}} the Altar is the Easter Cross. In Marthoma worship practice the visual Sign of the Cross is used <b>many</b> <b>times.</b> <b>When</b> the Priest gives the blessing he performs the sign of the cross; the worshipers, as a sign of accepting the blessing also reciprocates blessing oneself. The same is done at the time of the declaration of the Trinity and also at the time of indication of the Cross. Generally iconostases, pictures or statues of saints are not kept in Marthoma churches. Until the middle of the 20th century, all worshipers were seated on a mat spread on the floor. Children occupy the first rows and behind them on right side females and towards left males are seated. A narrow space between left and right is demarcated with a red carpet starting from the main door signifying that the church is sharing the worship space of heaven and joining the communion. Now many churches provide chairs or benches. During the Passion week services, chairs are removed, to facilitate worshiping according to their ancient custom, which includes prostrating a number of times. Everyone including clergy and the laity, who take part in the worship, faces east for the service.|$|E

500|$|Morrison was {{expected}} to tour to promote the album, but at this time he had developed a phobia about performing that was especially problematic when appearing before large audiences. [...] John Platania was playing in concerts with Morrison and spoke of noticing his confidence ebbing away: [...] "There were <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> he literally had to be coaxed on stage. [...] His motto was 'The show {{does not have to}} go on'. He would create the choice of whether he would go on stage or not." [...] Morrison announced before an impending performance at a larger venue that he was retiring from performing live. After regaining his confidence by making regular and informal performances at a small club near his home, he began to tour coast-to-coast again in 1972.|$|E

[...] English professional cricketers took {{a dim view of}} Armstrong's approach to the game. [...] Jack Hobbs, describing one instance said, The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong, who got very nasty and unsportsmanlike, refusing to accept the umpire's decision. That upset me. I did not know if was standing on my head or my heels with the consequence that two balls later I let one go, never even attempting to play it; and it bowled me. I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong.|$|E

The K-car Gunners had to be careful, for {{there was always a}} shortage of 20mm rounds and there were <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> troops were only yards away from the target. K-cars with four Browning [...]303 machine-guns (instead of the 20mm cannon) were not popular with the troops, as they were less effective. The numbers of the enemy killed by the K-car in a scene varied from zero to all (and are included in the estimate for those killed). On some Fireforce operations Hunter jets were used, and more rarely, Vampires.|$|E

2500|$|In Don Quixote, {{there are}} {{basically}} {{two different types}} of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, {{while the rest of the}} roles speak a modern version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource – he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that made him mad; and <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> <b>when</b> he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get some sense of the effect by having Don Quixote use King James Bible or Shakespearian English, or even Middle English.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1918, Karen Blixen met the English {{big game}} hunter Denys Finch Hatton (1887–1931), an English army officer from an upper-class background. He often {{travelled}} {{back and forth}} between Africa and England, and visited her occasionally. After her separation from her husband she and Finch Hatton developed a close friendship, which eventually became a long-term love affair. In a letter to her brother Thomas in 1924, she wrote: [...] "I believe that for all time and eternity I am bound to Denys, to love the ground he walks upon, to be happy beyond words when he is here, and to suffer worse than death <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> he leaves..." [...] But other letters in her collections show that the relationship was unstable, and that Blixen's increasing dependence upon Finch Hatton, who was intensely independent, was an issue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proof that}} {{diagrams}} of equivalent knots are connected by Reidemeister moves relies on {{an analysis of}} what happens under the planar projection of the movement taking one knot to another.

In Seasons 1–4, Murdock has a different pet, imaginary friend, or persona in each episode. Whenever one of his pets or imaginary friends is killed by an enemy, Murdock snaps and takes revenge (but never kills). <b>Many</b> <b>times,</b> <b>when</b> B.A is mad at Murdock for being crazy, Hannibal will side with Murdock in a sympathetic way.
