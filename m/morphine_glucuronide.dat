40|$|The Acro Rapid Opiates Urine Test is {{a lateral}} flow, rapid {{immunoassay}} for the qualitative detection of opiates in human urine at 2000 ng/mL cut-off concentration. This assay {{is used to}} obtain a visual, qualitative result and is intended for professional use only. This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must be applied to a drug test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. In order to obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis is the preferred. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Opiates, such as heroin, morphine, and codeine, are central nervous system (CNS) depressants. The use of opiates at high doses produces euphoria and release from anxiety. Physical dependence is apparent in users and leads to depressed coordination, disrupted decision making, decreased respiration, hypothermia and coma. Heroin is quickly metabolized to morphine, <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronide</b> and 6 -acetylmorphine. Thus, the presence of morphine (or the metabolite, <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronide)</b> in the urine indicates heroin, morphine, and/or codeine use. The length of time following drug use for which a positive result may occur is dependent upon several factors, including the frequency and amount of drug, metabolic rate, excretion rate, drug half-life, the drug user's age, weight, activity and diet.

Although considerable information is now available concerning the bio-transformation of these drugs in the intact organism, relatively little is known about their metabolism at a cellular level.

40|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) are {{a pervasive}} complication {{in the realm}} of pharmacotherapy. At the root of ADRs lies interindividual variability in drug response, which can range from allergic reactions, to genetic variability, to any factors that influence the pharmacokinetics of a drug. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the late-stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by fat deposition, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Over the last several years, alterations in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters have been broadly characterized through NAFLD progression. Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP 2) is a canalicular efflux transporter that directs the biliary elimination {{of a wide variety of}} xenobiotics and metabolites. In NASH, MRP 2 is mislocalized away from the canalicular membrane in a post-translational event. The mechanism and extent of this mislocalization has yet to be elucidated. While transporter misregulation has been shown to influence the disposition of a variety of substrates, the direct impact of MRP 2 mislocalization on its overall transport capacity, and pharmacologic consequence of this change, is unknown. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism behind, and functional consequence of, MRP 2 /Mrp 2 mislocalization in NASH, predominantly using the rodent methionine-and-choline-deficient (MCD) dietary model. To identify the mechanism of MRP 2 /Mrp 2 mislocalization, a comparison of the activation status of various mediators of MRP 2 /Mrp 2 retrieval was conducted between healthy and NASH livers. Results in rat samples and human NASH samples indicate that activation changes of these mediators, including radixin, PKCα, PKCδ, and PKA, are consistent with a shift toward active retrieval of MRP 2 /Mrp 2 from the membrane, and some evidence of impaired membrane insertion is also present. Measurement of Mrp 2 transport capacity was completed using pemetrexed, a novel Mrp 2 probe substrate. Comparison of biliary excretion of pemetrexed between wild-type and Mrp 2 ^(-/-) rats shows a 100 % decrease, confirming that it relies upon Mrp 2 for biliary excretion. NASH rats exhibited a 60 % decrease in pemetrexed levels in the bile compared to their control counterparts, indicating that Mrp 2 transport capacity is severely impaired in NASH rats. Finally, to ascertain the pharmacologic consequence of impaired Mrp 2 transport, a study was conducted measuring the effects of the active <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronide</b> on control and NASH rats. NASH rats exhibited a decreased biliary excretion, and increased systemic retention, of M 3 G. While they did also exhibit increased antinociception of M 6 G, the definitive impact of altered disposition on pharmacologic response was masked due to the interference of an MCD dietary effect on antinociception. Overall, the data reported herein identify active membrane retrieval as a mechanism of MRP 2 /Mrp 2 mislocalization in NASH, and that mislocalization results in a 60 % decrease in overall Mrp 2 transport capacity. This decrease significantly hinders biliary excretion of Mrp 2 substrates, and may result in ADRs by contributing to interindividual variability in drug response...|$|E

40|$|Morphine {{is mainly}} {{transformed}} to morphine- 3 -glucuronide (M 3 G) and morphine- 6 -glucuronide (M 6 G) in the liver. Glucuronidation is also performed by rat brain homogenates and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) {{are present in}} the brain. Here we investigated the possibility that microglia transforms morphine into its metabolites M 3 G and M 6 G. Primary cultures of neonatal rat microglia were incubated for different intervals of time in basal conditions or with different concentrations of morphine. The following measures were performed on these cultures and/or in the medium: (i) morphine as well as M 3 G and M 6 G concentrations; (ii) levels of mRNA coding for UGT 1 A 1, UGT 1 A 6, UGT 1 A 7, and UGT 2 B 1 as well as their protein levels; (iii) released prostaglandin (PG) E- 2 and nitrite concentrations. Results show that in basal conditions morphine and M 3 G are produced by microglia; accordingly, these cells expressed UGT 1 A 1, UGT 1 A 6 and UGT 1 A 7, but not UGT 2 B 1. When cultures were exposed to different concentrations of exogenous morphine, M 6 G was also synthesized. This shift in the glucuronidation was associated with variations in the expression of UGT isozymes. In particular, UGT 1 A 7 expression was rapidly upregulated and this event was translated into enhanced protein levels of UGT 1 A 7; lesser effects were exerted on UGT 1 A 1 and UGT 1 A 6. Upon prolonged exposure to morphine, microglial cell UGT expression returned to baseline conditions or even to reduced levels of expression. Morphine exposure did not affect the synthesis of both PGE(2) and nitrites, ruling out a generalized priming of microglia by morphine. In conclusion, this study suggests that <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronides</b> found in the cerebrospinal liquor upon peripheral morphine administration may at least in part be brain-born, reconciling the conceptual gap between the high hydrophilic features of <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronides</b> and their presence beyond the blood brain barrier.

40|$|AbstractMorphine- 3 - and morphine- 6 -glucuronide are morphine’s major metabolites. As morphine- 6 -glucuronide {{produces}} stronger analgesia than morphine, {{we investigated}} {{the effects of}} acute and chronic <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronides</b> on adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. Using COS- 7 cells cotransfected {{with representatives of the}} nine cloned AC isozymes, we show that AC-I and V are inhibited by acute morphine and morphine- 6 -glucuronide, and undergo superactivation upon chronic exposure, while AC-II is stimulated by acute and inhibited by chronic treatment. Morphine- 3 -glucuronide had no effect. The weak opiate agonists codeine and dihydrocodeine are also addictive. These opiates, in contrast to their 3 -O-demethylated metabolites morphine and dihydromorphine (formed by cytochrome P 450 2 D 6), demonstrated neither acute inhibition nor chronic-induced superactivation. These results suggest that metabolites of morphine (morphine- 6 -glucuronide) and codeine/dihydrocodeine (morphine/dihydromorphine) may {{contribute to the development of}} opiate addiction...|$|R

Differential RIAs for the quantitation of morphine, M 6 G, and morphine- 3 -glucuronide (M 3 G) in a range of biological fluids have been developed. A specific M 6 G antiserum, suitable for use in an immunoassay, has been successfully raised. Pharmacokinetic parameters for morphine and M 6 G have been established in volunteers treated with morphine. Similar quantities of morphine and M 6 G were. observed after intravenous dosing. Bioavailabilities of enteral morphine preparations ranged between 19 % and 24 %. There was little difference between these routes with respect to the relative quantities of morphine and M 6 G measured, with quantities of M 6 G exceeding those of morphine by up to 7 -fold. Data obtained following intravenous morphine, or M 6 G revealed similar elimination half-lives for both compounds. M 6 G was less widely distributed and not significantly bound by plasma proteins. Significant biliary concentrations of <b>morphine</b> and <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronides</b> suggested the presence of an enterohepatic circulation, but no secondary plasma peaks or prolonged elimination half-lives were apparent. After systemic administration, significantly less M 6 G than morphine entered the central nervous system (CNS). In rats, the mean brain:serum ratios for morphine and M 6 G were 0. 4 : 1 and 0. 2 : 1 respectively. A mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) :plasma morphine ratio of 0. 9 : 1 was found in patients receiving intravenous morphine; no M 6 G was detected in the CSF. After oral morphine, mean CSF:plasma ratios were 0. 6 : 1 and 0. 3 : 1 for morphine and M 6 G respectively. A similar rate of disappearance from the CNS was observed for both morphine and M 6 G. Following intravenous M 6 G, the mean M 6 G CSF:plasma ratio was 0. 1 : 1. Morphine was absent from the CSF and plasma indicating that the clinical effects observed are due to M 6 G alone...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{retention}} and selectivity of a cocktail of 10 substrates of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGTs) and their respective glucuronides using four chro-matographic approaches. For this purpose, seven different stationary phases were employed in reversedphase liquid chromatography (RPLC), two in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), onein aqueous normal phase chromatography (ANPC) and four in subcritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Highly orthogonal separations were achieved with these chromatographic modes. Hydrophobic interac-tions mainly governed the retention of the substrates and their polar glucuronides in RPLC despite theuse of different chemical stationary phase bonding, involving additional possible interactions. In ANPC,atypical separations and poor peak shapes were observed with the selected compounds. In HILIC andSFC conditions, the metabolites were more retained than the substrates because of the polarity increaserelated to the glucuronic acid moiety. For the latter, a very high proportion of organic solvent (up to 80 %) was required to elute the glucuronides that often displayed poor peak shapes. Finally, the selectivity ofnine chromatographic systems was compared for the separation of isomeric and diastereoisomeric com-pounds. The stationary phases used in RPLC mode were more selective towards the two positional isomersof <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronides</b> since they possess distinct lipophilicity.

Forty-five opium-dependent Thai subjects were allocated to three dosing groups (6. 66, 13. 3 and 20 mg morphine equivalents, twice daily) depending on their self-reported prior opium use. On day 5 of dosing subjects underwent an interdosing interval study where blood, withdrawal scores, heart rate and blood pressure (BP) were collected at 0, 1, 3 and 8 h. Plasma morphine concentrations were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and plasma morphine- 3 -glucuronide (M 3 G) and morphine- 6 -glucuronide (M 6 G) concentrations by LCMS. Thirty-two subjects completed the study. Withdrawal scores were low for all subjects (range 9 - 23 % of maximum response). There were dose-dependent changes in both systolic and diastolic BP (P = 0. 021 and P = 0. 01, respectively), but these were not considered clinically significant. There were no effects of dose on respiratory rate. Plasma morphine concentrations changed significantly across the interdosing interval (P = 0. 0001), rising to a maximum at 1 h after dosing. Plasma morphine concentrations also differed according to dose (P < 0. 05). The mean ratios of the <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronides</b> were found to be: M 3 G/M 6 G = 7. 7, M 3 G/morphine = 35. 6 and M 6 G/morphine = 4. 9, values comparable to those previously reported.

40|$|RATIONALE: In the body, heroin {{is rapidly}} {{transformed}} to 6 -acetylmorphine (6 -AM) {{and then to}} morphine, that in turn is mainly metabolized to morphine- 3 -glucuronide (M 3 G) and, at lesser extent, to morphine- 6 -glucuronide (M 6 G). Unlike M 3 G, M 6 G is a potent opioid agonist. Intravenous heroin abusers (IHU) are exposed to {{a wide array of}} drugs and contaminants that might affect glucuronidation. OBJECTIVES: We assessed plasma and urine concentrations of M 3 G and M 6 G in four groups of subjects: the first two included long-term IHU either exposed to street heroin (n= 8) or receiving a single IV injection of morphine (n= 4), while the other two groups included non-IHU patients receiving acute IV (n= 8) or chronic oral (n= 6) administrations of morphine. METHODS: After solid phase extraction plasma and urine concentrations of morphine metabolites were determined by HPLC analyses. RESULTS: M 3 G accounted for the greater part of <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronides</b> detected in body fluids of non-IHU patients treated with morphine. This pattern of metabolism remained stable across 15 days of oral administration of incremental doses of morphine. In contrast, the two groups of IHU (street heroin taking or morphine-treated subjects) showed a reduction of blood and urine M 3 G concentrations in favor of M 6 G. Consequently, M 6 G/M 3 G ratio was significantly higher in the two IHU groups in comparison with the non-IHU groups. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic exposure to street heroin causes a relative increase in concentrations of the active metabolite, M 6 G. Since the pattern of M 6 G action seems closer to heroin than to morphine, the increased synthesis of M 6 G observed in IHU may prolong the narrow window of heroin effects...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{studies on}} opiate overdose death, {{and focuses on}} evaluation of toxicological characteristics including the possible influence of abstinence and polydrug use for the fatal outcome. In order to identify and classify drug abusers, a screening method for several drugs of abuse was developed and applied on randomly selected autopsy cases. Out of 75 cases, 26 positive results were found in 16 subjects. In two cases, drug abuse was not previously known by relatives or the police. The method developed includes the detection {{of the most common}} illicit drug groups in Sweden, and proved feasible for application in the medicolegal routine casework to confirm or exclude previous drug abuse in deceased subjects. In addition, the method may be applied on hair samples collected from living subjects for the same purpose. Although the designation heroin overdose gives the impression that these subjects have taken a high dose, or a dose of high purity, blood morphine concentrations vary widely and many victims actually present with fairly low blood morphine levels. To investigate the importance of abstinence in unexpected death at low opiate concentrations, all screening results were confirmed with segmental hair analysis, allowing for a detailed temporal mapping of the previous drug use. Hair samples were collected from 60 deceased addicts of whom 28 were classified as heroin overdose deaths. Segmental hair analysis revealed that 18 of these subjects had recently discontinued opioid use, suggesting a reduced tolerance to opioids. However, their blood morphine levels were similar to those found in the 10 subjects with a continuous opioid use. Further, hair and blood analysis disclosed an extensive use of additional drugs that directly or indirectly may influence the opioid system and contribute to the overdose. In a larger sample of deceased drug addicts, the possible importance of abstinence and polydrug use in opioid overdose deaths was explored. In 160 of 210 deceased suspected drug addicts, drug abuse was confirmed by hair screening. Of these, 91 were opiate overdose deaths. Hair and blood analysis revealed extensive polydrug use, which was more pronounced among opiate overdose victims than in drug addicts dying of other causes. Blood analysis showed that pure heroin intoxication was very rare; about 60 % of the overdose cases had three or more drugs in blood at the time for death. Segmental hair analysis revealed that more than 80 % of the opiate overdose cases had not been exposed to opiates during the most recent weeks before their demise. In most cases, the hair opiate concentrations displayed a gradual decrease before the last dose. The toxicological results also showed that opiate overdose death was more likely to occur if opiates were combined with benzodiazepines, but less likely when opiates were combined with stimulants such as amphetamines. An experimental model was developed {{to address the issue of}} tolerance and abstinence in opiate overdose death. Rats given a high dose of morphine or heroin showed a reduced mortality if pre-treated for two weeks with morphine. This protection was reduced if the pre-treatment was followed by one week of opiate abstinence. Delayed deaths, similar to those observed in a proportion of human heroin overdose victims, were also seen in the rats. Toxicological results showed that delayed deaths were not due to accumulation of <b>morphine</b> or <b>morphine</b> <b>glucuronides</b> in either blood or other tissues examined. In conclusion, these studies provide support for the notion that polydrug use and recent opiate abstinence are important risk factors for opiate overdose death...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} role {{of phase}} I and II of xenobiotic biotransformations is their detoxification and better excretion outside the organism. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) being the enzymes of phase II metabolism catalyse the conjugation of glucuronic acid to the lipophilic substrate by its specific nucleophilic group. UGT isoenzymes of various substrate specificities and different expression profiles in selected tissues {{belong to the}} large UGT superfamily. Usually, glucuronidation is the detoxification process, but sometimes (<b>morphine,</b> tamoxifen) <b>glucuronides</b> express biological activity higher than or comparable to the native compound. The level of UGT gene expression is individual for patients, because of their genetic status as well as epigenetic conditions. Also, xenobiotics are able to modulate UGT level and gene expression by the interaction with nuclear receptors. Moreover, one can find {{a lower level of}} UGT in the tumour compared to normal tissue, which results in the protection against deactivation of the drug and in the promotion of its selective activity in tumor tissue. On the other hand, UGT activity is considered as the possible cause of resistance to chemotherapy. Metabolism by hepatic and intestinal UGT isoenzymes is responsible for the “first-pass effect”, whereas acquired resistance consists in the induction of UGT gene expression by the chemotherapeutic or its metabolite. Moreover, UGT induction can be associated with the induction of membrane transporters, particularly proteins of the ABC family, responsible for drug excretion outside the cell. The above resistance effects can be fortified by the overexpression of selected UGT isoenzymes sometimes observed in specific types of tumours. It is also considered that many advanced tumours are characterized by a higher level of β-glucuronidase. This enzyme has a chance to be the molecular target of directed antitumour therapy, as it catalyses β-glucuronide hydrolysis, leading to active aglycones...|$|R

Similarly, mephedrone and methylone were unstable in sewer conditions with considerable deviation. Significant loss of buprenorphine, methadone, oxycodone and codeine was observed in the rising main sewer. <b>Morphine</b> and codeine <b>glucuronide</b> were found to be deconjugated from their glucuronides quickly in the presence of biofilms. This study indicates that it is important to evaluate the stability of biomarkers in the sewer system before using them in WBE for estimating consumption/exposure to reduce uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{determine}} the pharmacokinetics of morphine, morphine- 6 -glucuronide (M 6 G), and morphine- 3 -glucuronide (M 3 G) {{in children with}} cancer receiving morphine as immediate-release morphine liquid or sustained-release tablets. (2) To determine differences with age within the group and from adults. (3) To explore relationships between plasma concentration and pain measurements. Study design: Blood samples were collected and plasma analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical and fluorescence detection. Population pharmacokinetic parameters were derived with the program P-PHARM. Results: Forty children with a median age of 11. 4 years (range 1. 7 to 18. 7 years) received a median dose of 1. 4 mg/kg/d (range 0. 4 to 24. 6 mg/kg/d). A median of 4 blood samples per child was collected. Plasma clearance of morphine was 23. 1 mL/min per kg body weight. The volume of distribution was 5. 2 L/kg. Molar ratios of M 3 G/morphine, M 6 G/morphine, and M 3 G/M 6 G were 21. 1, 4. 7, and 4. 2, respectively. Children < 11 years had significantly higher clearance and larger volume of distribution for <b>morphine</b> and its <b>glucuronides</b> than older children and adults. Regression analysis indicated average plasma morphine concentration equal to dose (mg/kg/d) × 8. 6 (95...|$|R
40|$|Morphine is an {{analgesic}} drug {{used for the}} treatment of acute and chronic pain syndromes for cancer patients. Glucuronidation is a major pathway of the elimination of morphine in humans. Morphine is metabolized to 3 -glucuronide (no analgesic effect) and 6 -glucuronide (more potently analgesic than morphine) mainly by UGT 2 B 7. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of a variety of drugs on the morphine glucuronosyltransferase activities in human liver microsomes. Twenty-one drugs including anticancer drugs, immunosuppressants, analgesics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs were selected in this study, because they are frequently co-administered with morphine. We found that 10 out of 21 drugs, tamoxifen, tacrolimus, diclofenac, carbamazepine, imipramine, clomipramine, amitriptyline, diazepam, lorazepam and oxazepam extensively inhibited the morphine 3 - and 6 -glucuronosyltransferase activities. Although some of the drugs are not substrates of UGT 2 B 7, they would be potent inhibitors of UGT 2 B 7. If patients receive morphine and these drugs simultaneously, the drug-drug interaction may change the levels of <b>morphine</b> and these <b>glucuronides,</b> resulting in altered analgesic efficacy and the risk of side effects. The results presented here will assist clinicians in choosing the proper drugs and/or dosages, and enable them to anticipate potential drug-drug interactions...|$|R
40|$|Valerian {{preparations}} {{alone or}} in combination with hops are popular over-the-counter products used for sleep disturbances or anxiety. Therefore, {{it is important to}} characterize the effect of these products on the activity of human drug-metabolizing enzymes. The inhibitory effects of valerian and valerian/hops extracts as well as valerenic acid (a major constituent of valerian) on glucuronidation were evaluated in human liver microsomes and with expressed uridine 5 '-diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferases (UGT). Methanolic extracts of two herbal preparations caused significant reductions in the rate of formation of acetaminophen, oestradiol, <b>morphine,</b> and testosterone <b>glucuronides.</b> Oestradiol glucuronidation at the 3 -hydroxy position was inhibited by nearly 87 % in microsomal incubations. In addition, marked reductions in UGT 1 A 1 and UGT 2 B 7 activities were observed {{in the presence of the}} herbal extracts using oestradiol and morphine as probe substrates, respectively. Valerenic acid also demonstrated significant inhibitory effects on the glucuronidation of acetaminophen, oestradiol, and morphine with both microsomes and expressed UGTs. The relatively low IC 50 values obtained for valerenic acid in microsomal incubations may indicate that this essential oil contributes to the effects observed with herbal extracts in inhibiting glucuronidation in vitro. Overall, these findings suggest that valerian-containing products may interfere with the glucuronidation of endo- and xenobiotics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEndogenous morphine, morphine- 6 -glucuronide, and codeine, {{which are}} {{structurally}} identical to vegetal alkaloids, can be synthesized by mammalian cells from dopamine. However, {{the role of}} brain endogenous morphine and its derivative compounds {{is a matter of}} debate, and knowledge about its distribution is lacking. In this study, by using a validated antibody, we describe a precise mapping of endogenous morphine-like compounds (<b>morphine</b> and/or its <b>glucuronides</b> and/or codeine) in the mouse brain. First, a mass spectrometry approach confirmed the presence of morphine and codeine in mouse brain, but also, of morphine- 6 -glucuronide and morphine- 3 -glucuronide representing two metabolites of morphine. Second, light microscopy allowed us to observe immunopositive cell somas and cytoplasmic processes throughout the mouse brain. Morphine-like immunoreactivity was present in various structures including the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, band of Broca, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Third, by using confocal microscopy and immunofluroscence co-localization, we characterized cell types containing endogenous opiates. Interestingly, we observed that morphine-like immunoreactivity throughout the encephalon is mainly present in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic neurons. Astrocytes were also labeled throughout the entire brain, in the cell body, in the cytoplasmic processes, and in astrocytic feet surrounding blood vessels. Finally, ultrastructural localization of morphine-like immunoreactivity was determined by electron microscopy and showed the presence of morphine-like label in presynaptic terminals in the cerebellum and postsynaptic terminals {{in the rest of the}} mouse brain. In conclusion, the presence of endogenous morphine-like compounds in brain regions not usually involved in pain modulation opens the exciting opportunity to extend the role and function of endogenous alkaloids far beyond their analgesic functions...|$|R
40|$|An original, sensitive, and {{specific}} high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay {{was developed for}} the quantitation of morphine and its two major metabolites, morphine- 3 -glucuronide (M 3 G) and morphine- 6 -glucuronide (M 6 G), in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in rat plasma, using hydromorphone as the internal standard. Solid-phase extraction was used to separate <b>morphine</b> and its <b>glucuronide</b> metabolites from plasma constituents. Extraction efficiencies of morphine, M 3 G, and M 6 G from human plasma samples (0. 5 ml) were 84, 87, and 88 %, respectively. Extraction efficiencies of morphine, M 3 G, and M 6 G {{did not differ significantly}} (p > 0. 05) between human plasma and CSF or rat plasma. Morphine, M 3 G, M 6 G, and hydromorphone were separated on a 10 mu C- 8 Resolve radially compressed cartridge using a mobile phase comprising methanol:acetonitrile:phosphate buffer, (0. 0125 M pH 7. 5; 10 : 10 : 80), in which 11 mg/L of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (cetrimide) was dissolved. Quantitation was achieved using a single electrochemical detector at ambient temperature (23 -degrees-C). Standard curves were linear over the ranges 0. 020 - 2. 190, 0. 027 - 2. 709, and 0. 027 - 0. 542 muM for morphine, M 3 G, and M 6 G, respectively. Lower limits of detection for morphine, M 3 G, and M 6 G in human plasma and CSF samples (0. 5 ml) were 0. 020, 0. 027, and 0. 027 muM, respectively. Corresponding lower limits of detection in rat plasma (0. 1 ml) were 0. 102, 0. 135, and 0. 135 muM, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} novel {{approaches for}} structural investigation of glucuronides using chemical derivatization {{in combination with}} liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MSn). Today, LC-ESI-MSn is the dominant technique for quantitative as well as qualitative analyses of metabolites, due to its high sensitivity and selectivity. However, for compounds without an easily ionizable group, e. g., steroids, the sensitivity is limited. In the work presented in this thesis, a derivatization procedure forming a basic oxime significantly increased the detection sensitivity for the altrenogest glucuronide. Furthermore, in structural evaluations of glucuronides, the limitation of LC-MSn becomes evident due to the initial neutral loss of 176 u, i. e. monodehydrated glucuronic acid, which often {{makes it impossible to}} elucidate the structures of the conjugates. To solve this problem, {{the main part of the}} work described in this thesis was devoted to chemical derivatization as a means of facilitating the determination of the site of conjugation. For the first time, the isomeric estriol glucuronides were evaluated using a combination of three reagents 2 -chloro- 1 -methylpyridinium iodide (CMPI), 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethyl- aminopropyl) -carbodiimide (EDC), and 2 -picolylamine (PA). Interestingly, the derivatization gave a selective fragmentation pattern leading to differentiation of the isomers. Another derivatization reagent, 1, 2 -dimethylimidazole- 4 -sulfonyl chloride (DMISC), was also tested for the first time in structural investigations. The isomeric <b>glucuronides</b> of <b>morphine,</b> formoterol, and hydroxypropranolol were evaluated. They can all be conjugated in aliphatic as well as aromatic positions. DMISC was proven to be useful in two ways. Firstly, the <b>morphine</b> and formoterol <b>glucuronides</b> that contained a free phenol could be differentiated from those that were conjugated in the aromatic position based on different reactivity. Secondly, for the aromatic O-glucuronide of 4 ’-hydroxypropranolol, DMISC was proven to react with the amine. This product gave a different fragmentation pattern compared to the corresponding derivative of the aliphatic glucuronide...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} an alternative generic approach to LC–MS {{for the analysis}} of drugs of abuse as well as their metabolites in post-mortem tissue samples. The platform integrates liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) for analytes tissue extraction followed by differential ion mobility spectrometry (DMS) mass spectrometry for analytes gas phase separation. Detection is performed on a triple quadrupole linear ion trap using the selected reaction monitoring mode for quantification as well as product ion scan mode for structural confirmatory analyses. The major advantages of the platform are that neither chromatographic separation nor extensive sample preparation are required. In DMS the combination of a high separation voltage (i. e., up to 4 kV) together with organic modifiers (e. g., alcohols, acetonitrile, acetone) added in the drift gas is required to achieve the separation of isomeric metabolites, such as the ones of cocaine and tramadol. DMS also separates <b>morphine</b> from its <b>glucuronide</b> metabolites, which allows for preventing the overestimation of morphine in case of fragmentation of the glucuronides in the atmospheric-to-vacuum interface of the mass spectrometer. Cocaine, opiates, opioids, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and several of their metabolites could be identified in post-mortem human kidney and muscle tissue based on simultaneous screening and confirmatory analysis in data-dependent acquisition mode using an analyte-dependent compensation voltage to selectively transmit ions through the DMS cell to the mass analyzer. Quantitative performance of the LESA-DMS-MS platform was evaluated for cocaine and two of its metabolites spotted onto a tissue section using deuterated internal standard. Analyte’s responses were linear from 2 to 1000 pg on tissue corresponding to a limit of detection in the order of nanograms of analyte per gram of tissue. Accuracy and precision based on QC sample was found to be less than 10 %. Replicate analyses of cocaine and its metabolites in forensic samples showed an intra- and inter-sections variability of less than 25 %...|$|R
