5|$|An {{extensive}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>program</b> {{intended to}} extend the service lives of M249s {{has been carried out}} to refurbish rifles, especially units that suffered from wear due to heavy use. In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models and is no longer present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than spot welding. Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance of the Australian Globemasters is {{undertaken}} {{by both the}} RAAF and Boeing. As part of Australia's membership of the Globemaster III Sustainment Partnership, Air Force technicians are responsible for routine servicing, and Boeing handles major maintenance tasks. Boeing also provides technical support for RAAF Globemasters during deployments outside of Australia, {{and the company is}} paid in return for achieving contractually mandated aircraft availability targets. Due to the economies of scale arising from a large international <b>maintenance</b> <b>program,</b> the contract with Boeing is considered to be cheaper than attempting to support the aircraft through unique Australian contracts. It is expected that the RAAF's Globemasters will remain in service for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Much of Livingstone's {{first two}} years were devoted to setting up the Mayoral system and administration. He also devoted much time to battling New Labour's plans to upgrade the London Underground system through a public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) program, believing it to be too expensive and tantamount to the privatisation of a state-owned service. He furthermore had strong concerns about safety; PPP would divide {{different parts of the}} Underground among various companies, something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and <b>maintenance</b> <b>program.</b> These concerns were shared by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union, who went on strike over the issue, being joined on the picket line by Livingstone. Appointing Bob Kiley as transport commissioner, the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state hands through a public bond issue, as had been done {{in the case of the}} New York City Subway. They launched court cases against the government over PPP in 2001–02, but were ultimately unsuccessful, and the project went ahead, with the Underground being privatised in January 2003.|$|E
30|$|Chareonsuk et. al (1997) {{considered}} {{a situation where}} preventive maintenance cost is not high, {{so in order to}} keep the system at a high level of reliability, the maintenance department decides to run <b>maintenance</b> <b>programs</b> very frequently. This can lead to very frequent shutdowns where the production department will be reluctant to attend to the preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>programs.</b> Therefore, they will either cause forced postponed preventive maintenance or schedule when there is no production (for example, at night when it would be inconvenient for maintenance people). This problem can postpone <b>maintenance</b> <b>programs.</b> Therefore, in practice, <b>maintenance</b> <b>programs</b> cannot be fully maintained (Chareonsuk et al. 1997).|$|R

25|$|To reduce losses due to {{mechanical}} failure, in February 1945 Tunner {{introduced a}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>program</b> termed Production Line Maintenance. PLM consisted of having each aircraft due for 50- or 200-hour maintenance towed through {{five to seven}} maintenance stations, depending {{on whether or not}} an engine change was required. Each station had a fresh maintenance crew trained for a specific service task, including engine run up, inspections, cleaning, technical repair, and servicing, a process that took nearly a full 24-hour day per aircraft to complete. Each base specialized in only one type of aircraft to simplify the process. Despite initial resistance, PLM was successfully implemented throughout the division.|$|E

Early operations on the section between Erfurt and Ilmenau and further modifications of the project were proposed. Deutsche Bahn rejected early operations on the line. On the one hand, such regional services had not been ordered by the State of Thuringia; on the other hand, the safety and control technology that would have had to be installed would have become obsolete when the entire line was opened and would have had to be replaced. The costs would have exceeded the benefits.|$|E

40|$|Many Countries {{and plants}} radically {{modified}} their maintenance rules towards a condition based approach as {{a precondition for}} the implementation of life extension (LTO/PLEX) programs. In 2004 a network of European Organisations operating Nuclear Power Plants, SENUF (Safety of European Nuclear Facilities), under the coordination of the JRC-IE, carried out an extensive questionnaire on maintenance practice in their facilities aiming at capturing the aspects of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>programs</b> where research is mostly needed. This paper uses some results of the questionnaire, which was not oriented to LTO/PLEX, to draw some conclusions on how the current <b>maintenance</b> <b>programs</b> could support a potential LTO/PLEX, among the other programs running at nuclear power plants (NPPs). In this sense, it is spin-off of the SENUF working group on maintenance. The paper aims at identifying the technical attributes of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>programs</b> more directly affecting the decision for a long-term safe operation of a nuclear facility, the issues related to their implementation and safety review. The paper includes a discussion on the implications of optimised <b>maintenance</b> <b>programs</b> in existing plants.

500|$|No.86 Wing was disbanded {{following}} the {{entry into service}} of the RAAF's first de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou tactical transports in April 1964. Because the Caribous were primarily for support of the Australian Army, an overarching wing headquarters for the Caribous and Hercules was considered inappropriate. On 3August 1964, No.486 Squadron was also disbanded and its equipment, staff and records divided between Nos.36 and 38 Squadrons. No.37 Squadron was re-established at Richmond in February 1966, flying C-130E Hercules. Consequently, on 28March, No.486 Squadron was re-formed {{under the auspices of}} RAAF Base Richmond to service both C-130 models. Four technicians from No.486 Squadron were {{killed in a car accident}} near Windsor on 26June 1968. The unit's <b>maintenance</b> <b>program</b> was reorganised in September 1973. It played a significant role supporting relief efforts in the wake of Cyclone Tracy, which struck Darwin, Northern Territory, on Christmas Day 1974. No.486 Squadron had thirteen Hercules available by the night of 25December, and a further six by New Years Day. These nineteen aircraft flew over 1,250hours, carrying more than 7,000passengers and over [...] of cargo.
