Results showed that fenugreek allelopathic potential was significantly enhanced by polyploidization. <b>Mixoploid</b> plant extracts have more significant effects (P inf 0. 05) on all target species than that of diploid plants at all tested concentration levels. At the high concentration of 40 g/l, <b>mixoploid</b> plant extract induced 9 % more inhibition on lettuce root growth, 21 % more on peganum, and 36 % more on alfalfa than that from diploid plant. Based on the whole-range inhibition index for growth, the allelopathic potential of <b>mixoploid</b> plants was enhanced by 24. 4 % on lettuce, 79. 7 % on peganum, and 37 % on alfalfa. There was a significant difference in sensitivity towards fenugreek allelopathy among the target species with lettuce being the most sensitive and alfalfa the least affected. Such differences were consistent for both <b>mixoploid</b> and diploid plants. Fenugreek may be favorably used in sustainable weed management.

40|$|Using 2 n/ 3 n <b>mixoploid</b> mouse embryos {{produced}} by fusion of individual second polar bodies (PB 2 s) with individual blastomeres of 2 -cell embryos, {{the dynamics of}} PB 2 nuclei in the host blastomeres during mitosis were examined {{and the fate of}} the 3 n cell line in the <b>mixoploid</b> embryos was followed. Most of the PB 2 nuclei were synchronised with the cell cycle of the host blastomeres and all chromosomes were incorporated into a single mitotic spindle. The majority of the <b>mixoploid</b> embryos developed to blastocysts with 3 n cells.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of shoot aqueous extracts of diploid and <b>mixoploid</b> fenugreek at vegetative, flowering and fruiting stages on some physiological and biochemical processes in lettuce. The allelochemicals stress was registered as the result of aqueous extract application, which was added to the Hoagland nutrient solution at concentration corresponding to IC 50 (50 % inhibition of germination or root growth). The germination inhibition seems to be correlated with membrane deterioration as proved by a strong electrolyte leakage, increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and mitochondrial respiration disruption due to a decrease in dehydrogenases activity. These disruptions were recorded with all test extracts, especially fruiting stage extract of diploid and <b>mixoploid</b> plants. For seedling growth inhibition, the roots showed the same interference, especially in the presence of aqueous extract of plant material harvested at the vegetative stage for diploid and at flowering of <b>mixoploid</b> plants. Chlorophyll content was slightly reduced while carotenoid content was significantly reduced. The lettuce seedlings have circumvented the allelochemicals stress, by i) increasing the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) activity, ii) accumulation of proline and iii) the production of secondary metabolites with antioxidant potent, such as polyphenols, flavonoids and alkaloids. The importance of these phenomenons varied with the extract origin and target organ, which is in favor of speculating on the allelochemicals specificity and on the change in the chemical composition of different extracts. Also, understanding of the different mechanisms of allelochemicals may provide a basis for the development of growth regulators and natural pesticides to boost up production in sustainable agriculture...|$|E

The organic extracts of diploid plants {{were found to}} be less toxic than <b>mixoploid</b> ones and this toxicity varied with the plant developmental stages. The diploids were most toxic, for the two strains, at the fruiting stage; however, mixoploids were more toxic at the vegetative stage for FOL and at flowering one for FORL. FOL was found to be more sensitive to fenugreek extracts when compared to FORL. LC–MS/MS analysis of methanolic extract of fenugreek aerial parts showed eleven different flavonol glycosides (quercetin, kaempferol and vitexin). Five novel components were identified, {{for the first time in}} fenugreek aerial parts, as kaempferol 3 -O-β-d-glucopyranoside, kaempferol 7 -O-glucoside, kaempferol 3 -O-α-l-rhamnosyl (1 → 2) β-d-xyloside, kaempferol 7 -O-β-d-glucopyranosyl (1 – 4) β-d-glucopyranoside and kaempferol 3 -O-β-glucosyl (1 → 2) (6 ′-O-acetyl) -β-d-galactoside, along with other known compounds of this species.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. A large {{sector of}} the {{forestry}} industry of South Africa comprises Eucalyptus species, covering approximately 49 % of the forestry plantation area. Polyploidy induction has become an attractive tool to increase yield and reduce invasiveness in forestry species. Polyploidy induction in Eucalyptus using colchicine treatments on seed and axillary buds was undertaken to produce tetraploids {{that could be used}} in breeding programmes; specifically to increase yield and decrease species invasiveness through the production of triploids after crossing with diploid parents. Eight seedlots of E. urophylla and seven of E. grandis were treated with four colchicine concentrations (0. 00, 0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 05 %) at two exposure times (18 h and 24 h), treating two seeds per treatment, repeated eight times. For axillary bud induction, 20 buds of two E. grandis clones and three E. grandis × E. urophylla hybrids and one E. grandis × E. nitens hybrid were treated with four colchicine concentrations (0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 %) for three consecutive days. A known tetraploid hybrid E. grandis E. camaldulensis and its corresponding diploid were included as reference material. Seedlings and bud sports were pre-screened by determining stomatal guard cell lengths. Seedlings and bud sports displaying cell lengths significantly (p< 0. 0001) larger than the diploid were selected as putative polyploids. Polyploidy was then confirmed by quantifying the DNA content using flow cytometry. Stomatal frequencies and guard cell chloroplast frequencies were also determined in the induced tetraploid seedlings to evaluate their suitability to discern between ploids. All putative polyploidy seedlings, identified in the pre-screening process, were confirmed, using flow cytometry, as either tetraploids or mixoploids. Of the 17 E. urophylla putative polyploids, from various seedlots, six were tetraploid and 11 <b>mixoploid.</b> In E. grandis one of the five putative polyploids, from various seedlots, was tetraploid and four <b>mixoploid.</b> Pre-screening of bud sports was less accurate; only four of the 12 E. grandis hybrid putative polyploids were <b>mixoploid</b> and only three of the six E. grandis putative polyploids were <b>mixoploid.</b> E. urophylla seedlings were more sensitive to colchicine than E. grandis seedlings displaying a lower survival rate (52 %) than E. grandis (63 %). Extreme treatments that caused the lowest survival rates were also responsible for most of the polyploidy successful inductions; 0. 05 %/ 18 h and 0. 05 %/ 24 h for E. urophylla and 0. 03 %/ 24 h and 0. 05 %/ 24 h for E. grandis. Phenotypic effects of colchicine included shorter, thicker roots and hypocotyls; darker leaves; longer and narrower leaves in some tetraploids; and asymmetrical leaf margins in many mixoploids and tetraploids compared with the controls. In the tetraploids, stomata were significantly larger (p< 0. 0001) and less frequent (p< 0. 001). A significant (p< 0. 001) increase in the number stomatal chloroplasts was also ascertained. Confirmed <b>mixoploid</b> seedlings all displayed tetraploid leaves based on stomatal size and thus classified as periclinal chimeras. In bud sports, only leaves with islands of diploid and tetraploid stomata in the confirmed mixoploids were encountered. <b>Mixoploid</b> bud sports were thus either sectional or mericlinal chimeras. Stomatal size proved to be a suitable pre-screening method, especially in polyploidy induction in seedlings. Additionally confirmed tetraploids exhibited significantly different stomatal frequencies and stomatal chloroplast frequencies compared with the diploids, thus proving to be suitable detection methods for polyploidy screenings.

Karst.) {{growing in the}} territory of State Forest Service «Garmen», «Eleshnitsa», «Yakoruda», «Dobrinishte» in Rila-Rhodope mountain region (Bulgaria). Populations are located at the southern border of species range, and protected according to Bern Convention and EC Habitat Directive 92 / 43. It was found that diploid set of seed progeny of P. abies from the 4 populations studied includes 24 chromosomes (2 n = 2 x = 24). Mixoploidy (2 n = 24, 36; 2 n = 24, 48; 2 n = 24, 36, 48) was detected in some germinating seeds of all studied populations of P. abies. Metaphase cells of germinating seeds of P. abies from State Forest Service «Garmen» and «Eleshnitsa» contain supernumerary, or B-chromosomes, while the variability of their number and occurrence was observed. In cells of germinating seeds of P. abies from State Forest Service «Yakoruda», «Dobrinishte», B-chromosomes are not revealed. Some chromosome rearrangements such as fragments and ring chromosomes were revealed in metaphase cells of P. abies from populations of «Garmen», «Eleshnitsa» and «Dobrinishte». Probably occurrence of <b>mixoploids,</b> B chromosomes and chromosome rearrangements in P. abies populations growing in Rila-Rhodope mountain region is connected with adaptation of trees to the extreme environmental conditions and such a serious factor that presently forests in the studied region located in the zone of natural radioactivity and in the past, the region of study was subjected to substantial anthropogenic pressure due to uranium extraction industry...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn vitro {{induction}} of polyploids using colchicine causes {{an increase}} in DNA content in plants. This is of high importance especially for plants that have medicinal and commercial values. Seeds of two medicinal plants, licorice Glycyrrhiza glabra L. var. glandulifera and safflower Carthamus tinctorius were treated with different concentrations of colchicine, 0 %, 0. 03 %, 0. 05 %, 0. 08 %, 0. 1 % (W/V) in vitro for 24 and 48 h. Treated seeds then were cultured on solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) media under controlled conditions. After a month, {{the length of the}} stomata was measured to study the effect of colchicine on stomata size. Cellular DNA content of the regenerated plants was measured by spectrophotometry. Flow cytometry was used for confirming the results obtained from stomata size measurement and spectrophotometry. Results suggested that treated plants have a fair amount of larger stomata, significantly in licorice plantlets that were treated with 0. 1 % colchicine for 24 h and safflower plantlets that were treated with 0. 03 %, 0. 05 % and 0. 1 % colchicine. Safflower DNA content in all treatments enhanced significantly, but in licorice only DNA content of plantlets that were treated with 0. 05 % colchicine for 24 h and 0. 1 %, 0. 03 % colchicine for 48 h found to be increased significantly. The morphological features of treated plantlets such as shoot and leaf thickness were found to be increased. Flow cytometry confirmed the previously mentioned results and suggested tetraploids in all treated safflower plantlets and licorice plantlets obtained from treatment with 0. 08 % of colchicine and <b>mixoploids</b> in licorice plantlets obtained from treatment with 0. 1 % of colchicine...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScChromosome {{doubling}} {{has become}} an important tool in breeding programmes as it offers the ability of introducing novel traits into existing plants. Doubled haploid plants are highly valued by both consumers and breeders as these plants usually show larger flower, leaves and fruit, thus making them more marketable. Marianna open pollinated plum rootstocks’ adaptability to different soil types and moisture conditions has been favoured in polyploidy studies as parental material in breeding programmes. The potential of the microtubule depolymerizing herbicide (oryzalin) for in vitro chromosome doubling were investigated by optimizing the concentration and incubation time of plant shoots to the antimitotic agent. Meristem tissues were treated for two time intervals (24 and 48 h) with five different concentrations of oryzalin (50, 75, 100, 150 or 200 μM) in liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. After treatment, plants were allowed to grow under a 16 / 8 h light/dark photoperiod at 24 ± 2 ˚C for 4 weeks. One and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) was used to separate, visualise and identify differently expressed proteins. Furthermore, changes in ROS accumulation, photosynthetic pigmentation, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD, APX and GR) were investigated. Flow cytometry results revealed that treatment of plants with oryzalin concentrations ranging from 75 to 150 μM induced ploidy after 24 h exposure whereas, 200 μM produced <b>mixoploids</b> containing both tetraploid and octoploids plants after 24 h exposure. Longer incubations of 48 h were detrimental to plant tissues as complete mortality was observed in the higher concentration (100 to 200 μM) treatments. Mass spectrometry analysis identified 14 differentially expressed protein spots that were characterized into different functional categories. ROS accumulation, the extent of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity were differentially regulated in response to oryzalin treatment whereas photosynthetic pigments were significantly enhanced. The results suggests that oryzalin-induced proteins may act as potential biomarkers to improve fruit characteristics in future breeding programs whereas antioxidant enzymes {{play an important role}} in scavenging ROS in plants to enhance their adaptability to different environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out on a {{yearling}} Holstein with external genitalia resembling those of a freemartin whose birth and developmental history was unknown. Dissection following slaughter showed testes close to the external inguinal rings, an underdeveloped penis coiled up subcutaneously in the perineum and terminating in a deep fossa {{at the level of}} the ischial arch and no evidence of a female genital tract.

40|$|Abstract Background Squalius alburnoides is an Iberian cyprinid fish {{resulting}} from an interspecific hybridisation between Squalius pyrenaicus females (P genome) and males {{of an unknown}} Anaecypris hispanica- like species (A genome). S. alburnoides is an allopolyploid hybridogenetic complex, {{which makes it a}} likely candidate for ploidy mosaicism occurrence, and is also an interesting model to address questions about gene expression regulation and genomic interactions. Indeed, it was previously suggested that in S. alburnoides triploids (PAA composition) silencing of one of the three alleles (mainly of the P allele) occurs. However, not a whole haplome is inactivated but a more or less random inactivation of alleles varying between individuals and even between organs of the same fish was seen. In this work we intended to correlate expression differences between individuals and/or between organs to the occurrence of mosaicism, evaluating if mosaics could explain previous observations {{and its impact on the}} assessment of gene expression patterns. Results To achieve our goal, we developed flow cytometry and cell sorting protocols for this system generating more homogenous cellular and transcriptional samples. With this set-up we detected 10 % ploidy mosaicism within the S. alburnoides complex, and determined the allelic expression profiles of ubiquitously expressed genes (rpl 8; gapdh and β-actin) in cells from liver and kidney of mosaic and non-mosaic individuals coming from different rivers over a wide geographic range. Conclusions Ploidy mosaicism occurs sporadically within the S. alburnoides complex, but in a frequency significantly higher than reported for other organisms. Moreover, we could exclude the influence of this phenomenon on the detection of variable allelic expression profiles of ubiquitously expressed genes (rpl 8; gapdh and β-actin) in cells from liver and kidney of triploid individuals. Finally, we determined that the expression patterns previously detected only in a narrow geographic range is not a local restricted phenomenon but is pervasive in rivers where S. pyrenaicus is sympatric with S. alburnoides. We discuss mechanisms that could lead to the formation of mosaic S. alburnoides and hypothesise about a relaxation of the mechanisms that impose a tight control over mitosis and ploidy control in <b>mixoploids.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the role of alien pollen and PGRs in obtaining apomictic seed in cotton. Emasculated pistils of cotton F 1 interspecific, Gossypium barbadense x G. hirsutum, hybrids were treated with alien pollen from Hibiscus cannabinus (kenaf) and/or plant growth regulators (gibberrellic acid+a-naphthylacetic acid) to investigate their reaction. <b>Mixoploid</b> progeny recovered after numerous alien pollinations were studied cytogenetically to establish their origin, documenting their reproductive basis. Root-tip chromosome counts among somatic cells ranged from 27 to 44. The aneuploid nature of the plants was also verified by flow cytometric analysis. The use of gibberrellic acid+ a-naphthylacetic acid (GA 3 +NAA) after the alien pollination increased the percentage of apomictic plant induction by 55 %. Apomictic frequencies were compared to those from emasculated and self-pollinated cotton pistils. These observations suggest that alien pollinations and plant growth regulators may have resulted in unusual reproductive events...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to find an effective method of polyploidy induction using chemomutagens, colchicine and oryzalin, in diploid cultivar of Phlox paniculata ‘Fujiyama’ (syn. Mt.
