5|$|Upon {{his return}} to competition, the 200 m {{remained}} Bolt's primary event, beating Justin Gatlin's meet record in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best but, {{despite the fact that}} bad weather had impaired his run, he was happy to end the meeting with just the victory. However, a sub-20-second finish was soon his, as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne, Switzerland, finishing behind Xavier Carter and Tyson Gay to earn a bronze medal. Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience. Also, he was <b>more</b> <b>keen</b> on competing over longer distances, setting his sights on running regularly in both 200 m and 400 m events within the next two years.|$|E
25|$|By 1917 Robertson was <b>more</b> <b>keen</b> on {{the idea}} of the Germans {{standing}} and fighting where they would suffer at the hands of strong British artillery. He wrote to Haig (20 April) cautioning against “determination to push on regardless of loss” and repeating Nivelle’s error of trying too much to “break the enemy’s front” and urged him instead to concentrate on “inflicting heavier losses on (the enemy) than one suffers oneself”. It is unclear that the letter had much effect as Haig appointed Gough, an aggressive cavalryman, to command the Ypres Offensive shortly after receiving it.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{described}} {{the size of}} Haldane’s planned Expeditionary Force (six divisions of three brigades each and a cavalry division of four brigades) as simply a “reshuffle” of the troops available in Britain, and often declared that “there was no military problem to which the answer was six divisions”. Foch {{is supposed to have}} told Wilson that he would be happy for Britain to send just a corporal and four men, provided it was right {{from the start of the}} war, and that he promised to get them killed, so that Britain would come into the war with all her strength. Foch, recently returned from a visit to Russia, was concerned that France might not be able to count on Russian support in the event of war, and was <b>more</b> <b>keen</b> than ever to enlist British military aid. He invited Wilson and Colonel Fairholme, British military attaché in Paris, to his daughter’s wedding in October 1910. On a visit to London (6 December 1910) Wilson took him for a meeting with Sir Arthur Nicolson, Permanent-Under Secretary at the Foreign Office.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1939, the Soviet Union {{announced}} the new directives of the Third Five Year Plan, named [...] "Five Year Plan of Special Steels and Chemicals." [...] The defense sector received {{the highest priority}} under the plan. [...] The pressure to fulfill Soviet Second and Third Five Year Plan goals was <b>more</b> <b>keen</b> where managers faced the risk that every failure might be interpreted {{as an act of}} economic sabotage. [...] In 1936, the head of the Soviet Gosbank was shot after he suggested a relaxation of economic controls. [...] To cope with state controls of supply systems, blat (informal black market) agreements were often made, which could not easily be tracked by Gosplan.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} reform {{brought in}} by the board was to dump the old guard. As described by Cricinfo journalist Martin Williamson, the old guard was not committed to performance and was <b>more</b> <b>keen</b> to selfish gains. The new contracts had completely cut ties with the past, with Collins Obuya, the new captain, being the oldest player at 29. Experienced players like the former captain Jimmy Kamande, a veteran of five World Cups, Thomas Odoyo, and others were not even considered. As was expected, the left-out players were quick to retort as Kamande said that [...] "the board was selecting players who would be their puppets", while Odoyo opined that [...] "it was malicious and not done in good faith". According to them, it was fast-tracking the death of Kenyan cricket. They were also supported by the Kenyan media.|$|E
2500|$|The {{field was}} reduced to seven when Gleneagles was {{withdrawn}} owing to the rain-softened ground and Golden Horn started the 4/9 favourite ahead of Time Test and The Grey Gatsby with the other runners being Criterion from Australia (Australian Derby), Cougar Mountain from Ireland (Desmond Stakes), the British filly Arabian Queen and the seven-year-old gelding Dick Doughtywylie, who was acting as a pacemaker for the favourite. Golden Horn pulled hard against Dettori's attempts to restrain him {{in the early stages}} and raced in third behind Dick Doughtywylie and Arabian Queen. He made a forward move in the straight, moving up outside the leader Arabian Queen a furlong out and sustained his first defeat, finishing a neck behind the filly. After the race Dettori commented [...] "The horse was <b>more</b> <b>keen</b> than usual today and the ground being the way it was, he couldn’t use his turn of foot. It’s a great shame, but this is racing".|$|E
60|$|Now I surely cannot {{refer to}} any general {{representation}} of British society more acceptable to, and acknowledged by, that society, than the finished and admirably composed drawings of Du Maurier in Punch {{which have become}} every week more and <b>more</b> consistent, <b>keen,</b> and comprehensive, during {{the issues of the}} last two years.|$|R

2500|$|Therefore, {{through the}} growing {{power of the}} patriarchal system, a gender bias is created in the work force, leading to a {{situation}} in which [...] "men {{are more likely to be}} cabinet ministers or parliamentarians, business executives or tycoons, Nobel Prize-winning scientists or fellows of academies, doctors or airline pilots. [...] omen [...] are more likely to be secretaries, laboratory technicians, office cleaners, nurses, airline stewardesses, primary school teachers, or social workers". Within the structure of a patriarchal society, patriarchal biases and values are more likely to be promoted in the educational system. Particularly in mathematical and scientific fields, boys are presumed to have <b>more</b> <b>keen</b> spatial abilities than girls, whereas girls are supposed to assume better linguistic skills. These stereotypical manifestations within educational institutions contract with the notions of differently gendered brains and a [...] "relationship between intelligence and brain size". However, there is [...] "no correlation between skull capacity and hence brain weight and 'intellectual power'", yet there is still a constant struggle of gender bias in science.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Rekha {{appeared}} in the comedy Khubsoorat, directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, {{with whom she had}} developed a strong father-daughter bond during their previous collaborations. In a role written specially for her, she played Manju Dayal, a young vivacious woman who visits her recently married sister at her in-law's house and tries to bring joy to the wide family, much to the displeasure of the matriarch of the household. Rekha said she easily identified with the bubbly nature of her character, calling it [...] "quite a bit me". Khubsoorat was a success and Rekha was appreciated for her comic timing. It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film and Rekha won her first Best Actress award. The Tribune described the film as [...] "a lively comedy," [...] noting that [...] "Rekha's spunky performance gives the film its natural zing." [...] Film World magazine reported in that same year, [...] "Rekha's done it. Smoothly, successfully. From a plump, pelvis-jerking, cleavage-flashing temptress, she has metamorphosed into a sleek, accomplished actress. Gone are most of the inane mannerisms, pouts, wiggles and giggles." [...] It further noted that her career prospects had begun to improve significantly, as leading filmmakers had started taking more notice of her and become <b>more</b> <b>keen</b> to cast her in their films.|$|E

60|$|Distance is no {{barrier to}} gossip. It amazed young Norcross to observe how {{minutely}} the ranchers {{of the valley}} followed one another's most intimate domestic affairs. Not merely was each man in full possession of the color and number of every calf in his neighbor's herd, it seemed that nothing could happen in the most remote cabin and remain concealed. Any event which broke the monotony of their life loomed large, and in all matters of courtship curiosity was something <b>more</b> than <b>keen,</b> it was remorseless.|$|R

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} {{from the literature}} that probabilistic forecasting has a wide time scope from short-term to long term. Some of the works focused on short term probabilistic load forecasting [1, 17], whereas even <b>more</b> works were <b>keen</b> on medium and long term probabilistic load forecasting [4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15], because there is great significance in energy trading and system planning [3].|$|R
60|$|As regards what I {{interpret}} as fastidiousness, this is {{not very}} easy to express. Perhaps a definition will help.

The result is that in after years, whenever he thinks of that beautiful city, he remembers, not its historic buildings or its wide boulevards, or whatever it has to boast, but rather its ancient, fish-like smell. At least he remembers that first owing to this defect in his temperament.|$|R

60|$|To myself {{it seems}} not {{improbable}} that the King and Louvois were but stupidly and cruelly nervous about what Dauger MIGHT know. Saint- Mars, when {{he proposed to}} utilise Dauger as a prison valet, manifestly did not share the trembling anxieties of Louis XIV. and his Minister; anxieties which grew <b>more</b> <b>keen</b> as time went on. However, 'a soldier only has his orders,' and Saint-Mars executed his orders with minute precision, taking such unheard-of precautions that, in legend, the valet blossomed into the rightful king of France.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due to {{more and}} <b>more</b> {{customers}} <b>keen</b> on mobile services, we may face the mobile network congestion problem. Therefore, {{it is necessary}} to develop new data retrieval method to provide users with re-liable and timely access to the data scourers. In this paper, we study the scheduling problem for retrieving data from multi-channel data broad-cast environments. In general conditions, the most important two issues for queries in mobile computing systems are the energy cost and the query response time. In order to improve the query efficiency, we de-velop a randomized algebraic algorithm that takes both energy cost and access time into consideration to schedule the data retrieval process in multi-channel environments. It can be used in almost any broadcast en-vironment, in which the data access frequencies, data sizes, and channel bandwidths can all be non-uniform...|$|R
