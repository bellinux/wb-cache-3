5|$|Architecturally, {{the castle}} is unusual for this period. Its design appears {{somewhat}} backward, particularly {{in comparison to}} the nearby fortification of Harry's Walls, built {{at the same time as}} the castle, but which adopted a <b>more</b> <b>contemporary</b> design that employed bastions. Its closest equivalents are the blockhouses built by Henry VIII on the River Thames.|$|E

5|$|Ptolemy, {{possibly}} {{drawing on}} earlier {{sources of information}} as well as <b>more</b> <b>contemporary</b> accounts from the Agricolan invasion, identified 18 tribes in Scotland in his Geography, {{but many of the}} names are obscure. His information becomes much less reliable in the north and west, suggesting early Roman knowledge of these area was confined to observations from the sea. Famously, his coördinates place most of Scotland north of Hadrian's Wall bent at a right angle, stretching due eastward from the rest of Britain.|$|E

Kassav' drew in {{influences}} from balakadri and bal granmoun dances, biguine's and mazurka's, along with <b>more</b> <b>contemporary</b> Caribbean influences like compas, reggae and salsa music. Zouk live shows soon began to draw on American and European rock and heavy metal traditions, and the genre spread across the world, primarily in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} historian Simon Wessley {{describes the}} novel, alongside Barker's Regeneration, as an exemplar of contemporary fiction which uses {{the experience of}} the World War I trenches to examine <b>more</b> <b>contemporary</b> understandings of PTSD.

5|$|The gesture {{dates back}} to Ancient Greece {{and it was also}} used in Ancient Rome. Historically, it {{represented}} the phallus. In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists (notably more common among hardcore punk bands and rappers), actors, celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Most still view the gesture as obscene. The index finger and ring finger besides the middle finger in <b>more</b> <b>contemporary</b> periods has been likened to represent the testicles.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{popularity}} of the novel, Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the story than he did when adapting the lesser-known stories. The script was intended to follow elements of the horror genre and make the episode scary. As opposed to traditional ghost stories, Gatiss's plot focused on <b>more</b> <b>contemporary</b> horrors, conspiracy theories and genetic modification. Filming was done throughout May 2011, with additional shots taking place as late as August. Location shooting took place mostly across South Wales, though parts were shot in Dartmoor. The hound was created using visual effects.|$|E
5|$|Being the South's {{first line}} of defense against foreign threats, the NSS houses {{technology}} unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies. The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung (Juni) and Hwang Tae-sung (Na Yoon), are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung does not meet the expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence. Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are <b>more</b> <b>contemporary</b> than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her status as the top hacker in Korea has made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E
5|$|Emotions {{contains}} influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, {{as well as}} her continued work of R and soul. The album, while {{praised by}} some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market. Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a <b>more</b> <b>contemporary</b> pop/R record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box.|$|E
