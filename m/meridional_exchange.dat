40|$|Abstract Nearly {{three decades}} of stable isotope ratios and surface mass balance (SMB) data from eight shallow firn cores {{retrieved}} at Fimbul Ice Shelf, East Antarctica, in the Austral summers 2009 – 2011 have been investigated. An additional longer core drilled in 2000 / 2001 extends the series {{back to the early}} eighteenth century. Isotope ratios and SMB from the stacked record of all cores were also related to instrumental temperature data from Neumayer Station on Ekström Ice Shelf. Since {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, the SMB shows a statistically significant negative trend, whereas the δ 18 O of the cores shows a significant positive trend. No trend is found in air temperature at the nearest suitable weather station, Neumayer (available since 1981). This does not correspond to the statistically significant positive trend in Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index, which is usually associated with a cooling of East Antarctica. SAM index and SMB are negatively correlated, which might be explained by a decrease in <b>meridional</b> <b>exchange</b> of energy and moisture leading to lower precipitation amounts. Future monitoring of climate change on the sensitive Antarctic ice shelves is necessary to assess its consequences for sea level change. 1...|$|E
40|$|Future {{changes in}} {{atmospheric}} circulation and associated modes of variability {{are a major}} source of uncertainty in climate projections. Nowhere is this issue more acute than across the mid-latitudes to high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (SH), which over the last few decades have experienced extreme and regionally variable trends in precipitation, ocean circulation and temperature, with major implications for Antarctic ice melt and surface mass balance. Unfortunately there is a relative dearth of observational data, limiting our understanding of the driving mechanism(s). Here we report a new 130 -year annually resolved record of δD – a proxy for temperature – from the geographic South Pole where we find a significant influence from extratropical pressure anomalies which act as "gatekeepers" to the <b>meridional</b> <b>exchange</b> of air masses. Reanalysis of global atmospheric circulation suggests these pressure anomalies play a significant influence on mid- to high-latitude SH climate, modulated by the tropical Pacific Ocean. This work adds to a growing body of literature confirming the important roles of tropical and mid-latitude atmospheric circulation variability on Antarctic temperatures. Our findings suggest that future increasing tropical warmth will strengthen meridional circulation, exaggerating current trends, with potentially significant impacts on Antarctic surface mass balance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA mean {{state of}} the {{full-depth}} summer circulation in the Atlantic Ocean in the region in between Cape Farewell (Greenland), Scotland and the Greenland-Scotland Ridge (GSR) is assessed by combining 2002 - 2008 yearly hydrographic measurements at 59. 5 °N, mean dynamic topography, satellite altimetry data and available estimates of the Atlantic-Nordic Seas exchange. The mean absolute transports by the upper-ocean, mid-depth and deep currents and the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOCσ = 16. 5 ± 2. 2 Sv, at σ 0 = 27. 55) at 59. 5 °N are quantified in the density space. Inter-basin and diapycnal volume fluxes in between the 59. 5 °N section and the GSR are then estimated from a box model. The dominant components of the <b>meridional</b> <b>exchange</b> across 59. 5 °N are the North Atlantic Current (NAC, 15. 5 ± 0. 8 Sv, σ 0 27. 80). About 60 % (12. 7 ± 1. 4 Sv) of waters carried in the MOCσ upper limb (σ 0 27. 55 and contributes to the MOCσ lower limb. Accordingly, the contribution of light-to-dense water conversion south of the GSR (∼ 10 Sv) to the MOCσ lower limb at 59. 5 °N is {{one and a half}} times larger than the contribution of dense water production in the Nordic Seas (∼ 6 Sv) ...|$|E
40|$|The Overturning Circulation of the Southern Ocean {{has been}} {{investigated}} using {{a state of the}} art, eddy resolving ocean-sea ice model. The overturning circulation at constant depth and latitude reveals a 'Deacon Cell', a wind-driven meridional cell which acts to flux light surface waters Northward and downward and dense deep waters Southward and upward. The overturning has been further analysed in density-latitude space. Northward transport of light water and Southward transport of dense water by the Deacon Cell are compensated by the standing meanders of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and other stationary features. The overturning has been finally analysed in depth-density space. Here, the Deacon Cell is compensated by transient eddy fluxes. We thus propose a new paradigm to conceptualize the Southern Ocean Overturning Circulation: the ACC's standing meanders transport light water Southward and dense water Northward with little vertical excursion; transient eddies then act on the resulting zonal gradients of isopycnals, transporting light water upward and dense water downward. Although transient eddies have previously been shown to play a minor role in <b>meridional</b> <b>exchanges</b> in the Southern Ocean, here they are found to {{play a crucial role in}} vertical exchanges...|$|R
40|$|A {{region of}} {{transition}} of surface water characteristics from subantarctic to antarctic and an associated eastward flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) {{have long been}} recognized to exist as a band around Antarctica. In this review we summarize the most important observational and theoretical findings {{of the past decade}} regarding the ACC, identify gaps in our knowledge, and recommend studies to address these. The nature of the meridional zonation of the ACC is only now being revealed. The ACC seems to exist as multiple narrow jets imbedded in, or associated with, density fronts (the Subantarctic and Polar fronts) which appear to be circumpolar in extent. These fronts meander, and current rings form from them; lateral frontal shifts of as much as 100 km in 10 days have been observed. The volume transport of the ACC has been estimated many times with disparate results. Recently, yearlong direct measurements in Drake Passage have shown the mean transport o be approximately 134 x 10 6 m 3 /s, with an uncertainty of not more than 10 %. The instantaneous transport can vary from the mean by as much as 20 %, with most of the variation associated with changes in the reference flow at 2500 m rather than in the vertical shear. <b>Meridional</b> <b>exchanges</b> of heat across the ACC are known to be important to the heat balance of the abyssal ocean and consequently to global climate. The most likely candidate process for the required poleward heat exchange seems to be mesoscale eddies, though narrow abyssa...|$|R
40|$|The {{waters of}} the Weddell-Scotia Confluence (WSC) lie above the rugged {{topography}} of the South Scotia Ridge in the Southern Ocean. <b>Meridional</b> <b>exchanges</b> across the WSC transfer water and tracers between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) {{to the north and}} the subpolar Weddell Gyre to the south. Here, we examine the role of topographic interactions in mediating these exchanges, and in modifying the waters transferred. A case study is presented using data from a free-drifting, intermediate-depth float, which circulated anticyclonically over Discovery Bank on the South Scotia Ridge for close to 4 years. Dimensional analysis indicates that the local conditions are conducive to the formation of Taylor columns. Contemporaneous ship-derived transient tracer data enable estimation of the rate of isopycnal mixing associated with this column, with values of O(1000 m 2 /s) obtained. Although necessarily coarse, this is of the same order as the rate of isopycnal mixing induced by transient mesoscale eddies within the ACC. A picture emerges of the Taylor column acting as a slow, steady blender, retaining the waters {{in the vicinity of the}} WSC for lengthy periods during which they can be subject to significant modification. A full regional float data set, bathymetric data, and a Southern Ocean state estimate are used to identify other potential sites for Taylor column formation. We find that they are likely to be sufficiently widespread to exert a significant influence on water mass modification and meridional fluxes across the southern edge of the ACC in this sector of the Southern Ocean...|$|R
40|$|The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is {{a crucial}} {{component}} of the global ocean conveyor belt, acting as a zonal link among the major ocean basins but, to some extent, limiting <b>meridional</b> <b>exchange</b> and tending to isolate the ocean south of it from momentum and heat income. In this work we investigate {{one of the most}} important mechanisms contributing to the poleward transfer of properties in the Southern Ocean, that is the eddy component of the dynamics. For this particular purpose, observations obtained from near-surface drifters have been used: they represent a very useful data set to analyse the eddy field because of their ability to catch a large number of scales of motion while providing a quasi-synoptic coverage of the investigated area. Estimates of the eddy heat and momentum fluxes are carried out using data taken from the Global Drifter Program databank; they refer to Surface Velocity Program drifter trajectories collected in the area south of 35 &#x 00 B 0;S between 1995 and 2006. Eddy kinetic energies, variance ellipses, momentum and heat fluxes have been calculated using the pseudo-Eulerian method, showing patterns in good agreement with those present in the literature based on observational and model data, although there are some quantitative differences. The eddy fluxes have been separated into their rotational and divergent portions, the latter being responsible for the meridional transports. The associated zonal and depth-exponentially integrated meridional heat transport exhibits values spanning over a range between - 0. 4 PW and &#x 2013; 1. 1 PW in the ACC region, consistent with previous estimates...|$|E
40|$|The present-day {{availability}} of an 18 year record of merged Mediterranean Sea sea level anomaly (SLA) data enables a contemporary description of long-term mesoscale {{activity in the}} Balearic Sea. SLA data from satellite altimetry are used to study the variability of sea level and surface geostrophic circulation at different spatial and temporal scales within this complex and relatively understudied region in the western Mediterranean (WMED). We find that the mean Northern Current along the Iberian slope is strongest in autumn, although higher variability in winter leads to stronger peaks in kinetic energy. The Balearic Current, which flows along the northern slopes of the Balearic islands, also has its maximum expression in autumn. Across the two Balearic channels (Ibiza and Mallorca), key locations that partly regulate <b>meridional</b> <b>exchange</b> in the WMED, observed seasonal variability in geostrophic velocity anomalies conforms rather well to prior descriptions, suggesting cautious confidence {{in the use of}} the Mediterranean merged altimeter product in nearshore regions. Circulation through the channels is maximum in winter. The channel data support the hypothesis that the channel circulation may be hindered by the intermittent presence of the Western Intermediate Water mass, which sometimes forms in winter in the Gulf of Lions. This is the first time that an analysis of variability in the Balearic channels has been performed using altimetric data.

40|$|The climate {{response}} to peak interglacial forcing during Marine Isotopic Stages (MIS) 1, 5, 9, 11 and 19 is examined using the Community Climate System Model 3. We determine which interglacial provides the closest analogue to peak MIS 1 climate {{as well as}} how the variations in forcing between these interglacials translate into different surface climate responses. Simulated surface temperature, precipitation and sea-ice cover confirm that MIS 5 and 9 are ineffective analogues of peak MIS 1 climate given their relatively large astronomical and greenhouse forcing. Conversely, MIS 11 and 19 are in much closer agreement with MIS 1, although MIS 11 exhibits the closest resemblance particularly during boreal summer. This is attributed to a greater similarity in the latitudinal distribution of insolation over the middle latitude northern hemisphere continents. This region is the most sensitive to insolation change given the absence of ice-sheet dynamics in our model. First-order surface temperature differences between the interglacials are explained by the sensitivity of the direct radiative responses to astronomical and greenhouse forcing. These include higher temperature sensitivity over land versus ocean, at high versus low latitudes and during JuneeJulye August versus DecembereJanuaryeFebruary. Sensitivity of indirect dynamical responses to insolation and greenhouse forcing also contribute to surface temperature differences between the interglacials. These include negative sea-level pressure anomalies in the North Pacific and Southern Oceans, which invigorate the <b>meridional</b> <b>exchange</b> of subpolar and subtropical air. Additionally, intense cooling and seaice expansion in the Nordic Seas, observed only in MIS 1, 5 and 19, results in the largest variability exhibited between the interglacials. The manifestation of this cooling only after 800 years of simulation emphasises the importance of long model integrations. The examination of these features provides a framework for understanding the primary climatic differences between the warm interglacials and emphasises regions where proxies may provide effective validation of climate models...|$|E

40|$|The annual {{march of}} the {{strength}} of the southern circumpolar. vortex is shown to be composed of a simple annual variation (with the maximum occurring in late winter) which dominates in the stratosphere, and a semiannual variation with the maximum at the equinoxes, which is the dominating part in the troposphere. This behavior of the circumpolar vortex is considered to be the consequence of the seasonal variation of radiation conditions and of the different efficiency of <b>meridional</b> turbulent <b>exchange</b> in the troposphere and stratosphere. It is suggested that the semiannual variation of the tropospheric vortex is an essential feature of a planetary circulation.

40|$|Regional ocean {{circulation}} along the Oregon coast is studied numerically for forcing fields derived from year 2005 and climatological-mean conditions. The primary {{object is to}} study directly the Lagrangian pathways by which fluid arrives in the Oregon upwelling zone. Roughly half of the upwelling fluid is found to arrive in the regional domain from alongshelf source points, primarily north but also south of the Oregon upwelling zone, while the other half ultimately arrives from points offshore and west of the zone. For both the year 2005 and the climatological simulations, different regimes of dominant alongshelf source waters are found, with Cape Blanco being a dividing point for northern versus southern sources, and with the water parcels coming primarily from depths below 100 m. For the offshore sources, most upwelling fluid originates from depths between 150 and 250 m during 2005, but from within the upper 150 m for the climatological simulations. In both cases there are specific regions along the shelf of enhanced vertical motion, which appear {{to be associated with}} topographic features such as submarine banks and canyons. A perhaps surprising result is the apparently small role played by the poleward undercurrent as a direct, immediate source of upwelling fluid; on the seasonal time scale considered here, most trajectories are found to move southward over the slope and shelf, with weaker northward motion only farther offshore, in the deep interior. In 2005 the water parcels cover distances longer than in the climatology, and the <b>meridional</b> <b>exchange</b> along their paths is more vigorous. These differences are likely associated in part with the presence of mesoscale vortical structures seaward of the shelf, which are largely absent in the climatological simulation, perhaps because their formation may depend on the large-amplitude, short-time-scale wind variations and reversals that occur in the year 2005 wind field but not in the multiyear mean climatological wind field...|$|E
40|$|Polar air {{outbreaks}} in South America are {{a remarkable}} example of extreme meridional air exchange driven by large scale anomalies and teleconnections. The international literature has documented several case studies and climatologies (Garreaud, 2000; Vera and Vigliarolo, 2000; Marengo et al, 2002) and, more recently, {{some elements of}} the long term synoptic climatology associated with the surface cyclone and anticyclone tracks have also been explored (Pezza and Ambrizzi 2005). This paper presents a 1973 2000 synoptic climatology (every 12 hours) of the surface cyclone and anticyclone tracks associated with extreme cold surges in South America leading to the friagem in the Amazon river Basin, when the cold front crosses the equator line. This has been complemented by the corresponding atmospheric circulation composed {{for the period of}} 1950 2000. The aim is to provide a new insight for the synoptic paths and the dynamics associated with distinct cold wave categorization in the tropics. Extreme minimum temperatures and frost occurrence from the University of São Paulo (USP) meteorological station in São Paulo city (Brazil) are used to select cold events with different intensities: extreme (T 2. 50 C plus frost). Atmospheric variables at low and upper levels derived from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP NCAR) reanalysis are composed from day minus nine to day zero with regard to the coldest day in São Paulo. In addition, an automatic tracking scheme is applied to diagnosing and tracking the cyclones and anticyclones at the surface associated with cold surges. Through a superposition technique, climatological clouds showing all tracks on the same map are produced, adding some new insights to the synoptic patterns of propagation and improving the Southern Hemisphere climatology. The lagged composites indicate that most of the cold events may be tracked up to nine days before their occurrence, with a persistent upper level signal in the eastern Pacific. The analyses also indicate the importance of the extratropical cyclone to produce frost events in Southeastern Brazil. A historical background of extreme cold cases in Sao Paulo during the 1888 - 2005 period and some examples of extreme cold outbreaks in high latitudes without <b>meridional</b> <b>exchange</b> at lower latitudes (inverse pattern due to subtropical blocking conditions) are also going to be discussed.

40|$|The {{tropical}} {{region is}} the main entry point of the chemical species in the troposphere lifted and transported by convection in the stratosphere through the tropopause and redistributed to higher latitudes via the Brewer Dobson circulation. Thus {{any change in the}} distribution of stratospheric constituents in the tropics {{will have an impact on}} their concentration at mid-latitudes. Long time series of O 3 and NO 2 columns in the tropics are available from 2 SAOZ UV-visible spectrometers stations: in Bauru (Brazil, 22 °S, 49 °W) since 1995 and in La Réunion (21 °S, 55 °E) in the Indian Ocean since 1993. The most significant modulation for both components at both stations is the seasonal cycle (~ 40 %). A multiple regression analysis of ozone and NO 2 columns at Bauru and la Reunion has quantified the impact of solar and geophysical parameters of their variability. Following this analysis, the cycles of the most influential parameters in the tropics are (in decreasing order) : the Quasi-Biennal Oscillation (QBO) with 40 % for both species, the El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) with 25 % for O 3 and 20 % for the NO 2, the solar flux with 15 % and 18 %, and finally the stratospheric aerosols with 20 % and 12 %. After subtracting these influences, the long-term residual variations of ozone are not significant. In contrast, NO 2 shows a significant increase at both stations between 2001 - 2006, followed by a decrease after 2007. Same analysis has been applied to a merged satellite data set above the stations with GOME (1995 - 2002) - SCIAMACHY (2003 - 2011) for NO 2 columns and EPTOMS (1995 - 2004) - OMI TOMS (2005 - 2011) for O 3 columns. The long-term residual variations of those data present similar behaviour as SAOZ. From variations of the Eddy heat flux, variations in average intensity of <b>meridional</b> <b>exchange</b> through the southern subtropical barrier related to the amplitude of planetary waves over the entire Southern Hemisphere have been identified since 2001. These distortions of amplitude of planetary waves, affecting all longitudes, have been detected through the modulation of the two tropical stations's equivalent latitude. After taking into account this influence, the NO 2 residual trend in the tropics is shown to be of 3 %/decade only, that is consistent with the known increase by 2. 5 %/decade, of N 2 O the source of nitrogen oxides in the stratosphere...|$|E
40|$|Determining {{the rate}} of {{atmospheric}} warming in Antarctica is hampered by the brevity of the temperature records (50 years), which still contain signals of decadal circulation variability in the Southern Hemisphere. In this note it is demonstrated that Antarctic warming trends have been regionally modified by slow circulation changes and associated changes in sea-ice cover: decadal weakening of the semiannual oscillation since the mid- 1970 s has limited the <b>meridional</b> heat <b>exchange</b> between Antarctica and its surroundings, so that warming trends have leveled out since then. In contrast, northerly circulation anomalies in combination with decreased sea-ice cover have regionally enhanced low-level warming, for instance {{in the region of}} the Antarctic Peninsula.

40|$|The {{regional}} Eta/CPTEC {{model has}} been producing operationally forecasts over South America since 1996. The objective of this work is to evaluate the model predictions during strong <b>meridional</b> mass <b>exchange</b> over South America based on different model domain and grid-size configurations. Six cases of cold air intrusion and eight examples of warm air intrusion associated to convective activity over middle latitudes were chosen for the study. The model was evaluated against the NCEP global analyses, based on statistical verification parameters. Global analyses were interpolated bilinearly to the 40 -km Eta model output grid. Larger forecasts errors were found close to the southern boundary of the domain in both cold and warm air cases. These errors suggest the presence of strong forcing near the southern boundary generating errors which propagate toward {{the interior of the}} domain. The substitution of the boundary conditions to analyses reduced substantially the errors in the interior. The unavailability of regional analyses limited the study. However the conclusion of large forecast errors being generated at the southern boundaries is apparent, and an increase in model domain is recommended for the 40 -km version...|$|R
40|$|Both in situ {{measurements}} and satellite observations indicate evidence of mixing {{in the upper}} troposphere (UT) and the lower-stratosphere (LS). In this study, the measurements performed during the Pre-AVE and Costa-Rica AVE campaigns are analysed with diffusive back-trajectories to assess mixing properties in the tropical and the subtropical UT/LS. A description of cross-tropopause pathways and mixing time scales is provided. In the subtropics, Troposphere-Stratosphere mixing processes are found to differ {{in the vicinity of}} the tropopause and at higher altitudes. Below 350 K, a mixing line observed during Pre-AVE is shown to result from fast and local cross-tropopause irreversible exchange, involving two initially distant air masses with distinct chemical compositions. For measurements located above 350 K, mixing of the tropospheric air in the subtropical stratosphere occurs over a period of a month, the origins of the tropospheric source being localised in the tropical UT and the tropical boundary layer. In the tropics, quantitative reconstructions of CO and O 3 profiles above 360 K are obtained for one month back-trajectories calculations, pointing out that long term mixing is essential to determine the chemical composition in the tropical ascent. In particular, the existence of two-way <b>meridional</b> irreversible <b>exchanges</b> between 360 and 450 K is found to export tropical air in the subtropical stratosphere and to entrain old stratospheric air in the tropical ascent. Mean age of air calculated with a Lagrangian model is shown to be in agreement with the CO 2 observations...|$|R
40|$|Interior {{circulation}} pathways {{from the}} subtropics to the equator are markedly {{different in the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres of the Pacific Ocean. In the North Pacific the pycnocline shoals and strengthens dra-matically under the intertropical convergence zone, separating the North Equatorial Current from the North Equatorial Countercurrent. While the high potential vorticity between these currents would intuitively seem to inhibit <b>meridional</b> water-property <b>exchange</b> between the subtopics and the equator, transient tracer analyses and some modeling studies have suggested an interior pathway from the subtropics to the equator in the pycnocline of the central North Pacific. This study delineates this pathway and estimates an upper bound for its magnitude at 5 (61) 3 109 kg s 21. In contrast, the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current clearly brings pycnocline water estimated at 15 (61) 3 109 kg s 21 from the southern subtropics directly to the equator in the South Pacific through an interior region of low and relatively uniform potential vorticity. In both hemispheres, these interior pathways extend downward {{as far as the}} lightest waters of the equatorial pycnostad. The subsurface counter-currents flanking the pycnostad form the equatorward limbs of tropical subsurface cyclonic gyres. These deep gyres are consistent with the absence of interior ventilation of the equator from the subtropics below the pycnocline. Measured and derived fields from a hydrographic climatology are presented on neutral surfaces and in meridional–vertical sections to show that salinity, potential vorticity, and acceleration potential are all con-sonant with these arguments. The vertical extent of interior communication is also in agreement with the transient tracer results. 1...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the ozone hole [Farman et al., 1985], the dynamics of the stratosphere and the transport of anthropogenic trace gases from the surface to the higher atmosphere has come into the focus of interest. In the tropics, air rises high into the stratosphere and is transported poleward. Trace gases like the CFCs 1, photochemically stable in the troposphere, are thus transported into regions where they are photolyzed. The products of the photolysis reactions (eg. Cl, Br) interact in the catalytic ozone cycles and lead to enhanced ozone depletion. Regarding the transport of trace gases, the so-called lowermost stratosphere (LMS) is a very interesting region, where the troposphere and the stratosphere directly interact and air masses out of both regions are mixed. It is the lowest part of the stratosphere between the tropopause and the 380 K isentrope. Tropospheric air can enter this region directly via isentropic transport across the extra-tropical tropopause whereas stratospheric air descends across the 380 K isentrope via the mean <b>meridional</b> circulation. Stratosphere-troposphere <b>exchange</b> (STE) controls the chemical composition of the LMS {{as well as of the}} tropopause region and thus has an important effect on the radiative and chemical balance of these regions and the climate system. STE exhibits a strong seasonality [Holton et al., 1995]. While downwelling of stratospheric air across the 380 K isentrope is the dominant process in winter, troposphere-to-stratosphere transport (TST) gains importance in summer, when the downwelling from the stratosphere is only weak. Isentropic transport across the extra-tropical tropopause occurs in regions where the tropopause is strongly disturbed and is connected to tropopause folds, streamer events, frontal zones, polar and subtropical jets, warm conveyor belts and cut-off low systems. A short introduction into STE, the LMS region, and methods to study atmospheric transport is given in Chapter 1. One useful tool to analyse the motions of air and transport processes are longlived trace gases. Since the lifetimes of these tracers are longer than the time scale of the transport processes they are involved in, the distribution of tracers in the atmosphere is mostly determined by dynamics. In the context of this thesis, measurements of such long-lived tracers were performed and used to study transport into the LMS region in the northern hemisphere. During the Vintersol/EuPLEx and ENVISAT validation campaigns in winter 2003, long-lived tracers such as N 2 O, CH 4, CFC- 12, CFC- 11, H- 1211, H 2, SF 6 and CO 2 were measured with the High Altitude Gas Analyser (HAGAR), a two channel in-situ gas chromatograph combined with a CO 2 instrument, based on nondispersive infrared absorption. Combined with measurements taken during campaigns in Forli/Italy (ENVISAT validation) in July and October 2002, tracer data were gathered from the tropopause up to altitudes around 20 km during 25 flights on board the Russian high-altitude aircraft M 55 Geophysica. Thus, a substantial set of high quality tracer data has been obtained covering the polar vortex region as well as the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Chapter 2 gives an overview of the HAGAR instrument and necessary improvements of the instrumental set up (implementing a CH 4 channel) that were performed in the context of this thesis, and review data processing, the measurement campaigns. In order to study transport into the LMS it is assumed that air basically enters the LMS via three different pathways: a) quasi-isentropic transport from the troposphere, b) downward advection from the middle stratosphere through the 380 K surface and c) in the polar vortex region subsidence of air from of the polar vortex. Fractions of air originating in each of these source regions are determined with a simple mass balance calculation by using observations of a subset of the above species with distinct lifetimes (N 2 O, CH 4, CFC- 11, H- 1211, H 2 and O 3) yielding complementary constraints on transport from each region. Details of the mass balance calculation and the results are presented in Chapter 3. During the mid-latitude measurement campaigns in Forlí the passing of a cut-off low system associated with an elongated streamer over Europe was observed. The impacts of this event on the trace gas mixing ratios in the LMS are examined in Chapter 4. Finally, a summary is given in Chapter 5. Die unterste Stratosphäre ("lowermost stratosphere", kurz LMS) ist der Teil der Stratosphäre zwischen der Tropopause und der 380 K Isentrope, der in direktem Austausch mit der Troposphäre steht [Holton et al., 1995]. Der Eintrag von Luftmassen in die unterste Stratosphäre erfolgt in den mittleren Breiten im wesentlichen auf zwei Wegen: Zum einen durch Absinken stratosphärischer Luft von oberhalb der 380 K Isentrope im Rahmen der Brewer-Dobson Zirkulation [Brewer, 1949] und zum anderen durch quasi-isentropen Transport von troposphärischer Luft durch die Tropopause. Austauschprozesse zwischen der Troposphäre und der LMS (stratospheretroposphere-exchange, kurz STE) bestimmen in signifikantem Ausmaß die chemische Zusammensetzung [Pan et al., 1997] und die Strahlungsbilanz der LMS und der Tropopausenregion [Holton et al., 1995]. Änderungen der Strahlungsbilanz der Tropopausenregion durch Änderungen der Treibhausgaskonzentrationen sind in höchstem Maÿe relevant für das Klima der Atmosphäre [Haynes & Shepard, 2001]. So führt der Anstieg der Treibhausgaskonzentrationen zur Abkühlung der Stratosphäre und Erwärmung der Troposphäre [Pawson et al., 1998]. Im Zusammenhang mit tieferen Temperaturen in der mittleren und oberen Stratosphäre wird die Abnahme der Stabilität in der Stratosphäre [Stohl et al., 2003 a] und damit Änderungen der globalen Zirkulation diskutiert. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass das Wissen über Transportprozesse in der Tropopausenregion und der LMS elementar ist für das Verständnis von Spurengasbudgets (z. B. Ozon) und dem Klimawandel in der Atmosphäre. Diese Studie liefert einen Beitrag zur Untersuchung der Dynamik im Bereich der LMS. Anhand von flugzeuggetragenen in-situ Messungen der langlebigen Spurengase N 2 O, CFC- 12, CFC- 11, H- 1211, CH 4, SF 6, H 2 und CO 2 wurde der Transport in der und in die LMS untersucht.
