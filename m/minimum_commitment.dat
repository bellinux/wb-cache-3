40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} trade liberalization in a non-integrated industry where a marketing agency controls the supply of a necessary input {{in the production of}} a processed commodity. Trade of the processed good is restricted through a Tariff-Rate Quota (TRQ) and domestic processors operate in an imperfectly competitive industry. Under a fixed proportions technology, an increase in the <b>minimum</b> access <b>commitment</b> of the TRQ will generally lower the domestic retail price to consumers if the marketing agency is a profit-maximizing monopolist. Conversely, if the marketing agency pursues some specific non-economic objectives, it is shown that increases in the <b>minimum</b> access <b>commitment</b> holding the tariff rates constant can lead to higher retail prices and thus negate the benefits of trade liberalization for consumers. ...|$|R

40|$|A supply {{management}} system governs Canada’s poultry sector. Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs), with prohibitive above-quota tariffs and low in-quota tariff, mimic import-quotas limit international competition in Canada’s poultry market.

50|$|Army Reservists have a <b>minimum</b> <b>commitment</b> {{to serve}} 27 {{training}} days per annum, or 19 days for some national units.

Soldiers of the Army Reserve are often serving alongside their regular counterparts, including operations in Afghanistan where 1,000 out of the total 10,100 deployed have been Reservists, around 10% of the total. The annual budget of the Army Reserve is approximately £350 million - around 1.3% of the total defence budget.|$|E
50|$|Programs {{that aim}} to reintegrate child soldiers, {{such as those}} {{sponsored}} by UNICEF, often emphasize three components: family reunification/community network, psychological support, and education/economic opportunity. These efforts take a <b>minimum</b> <b>commitment</b> of 3 to 5 years in order for programs to be successfully implemented. Generally, reintegration efforts seek to create a normal environment (similar to the environment prior to the child being engaged in combat), a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child's family and community through religious/cultural ceremonies/rituals, and the reunification of the child {{with his or her}} family. Reintegration efforts can become challenging when the child in question has committed war crimes.

5000|$|The {{summer months}} of 1915 saw a decisive clash between the {{diplomacy}} of the Entente and the Central Powers. Marcel Dunan, a young French historian, {{reporter for the}} French press and witness of the critical events, summarized {{the importance of this}} period for the entire course of the war by simply naming it the [...] "Bulgarian Summer" [...] of 1915. Bulgaria's strategic geographic position and strong army now more than ever could provide a decisive advantage to the side that managed to win its support. For the Allies, Bulgaria could provide needed support to Serbia, shore up Russia’s defenses, and effectively neutralize the Ottoman Empire, while it could ensure the defeat of Serbia for the Central Powers, cut off Russia from its allies and open the way to Constantinople, thus securing the continuous Ottoman war effort. Both sides had promised more or less the fulfillment of Bulgaria's national aspirations, and the only problem facing the Bulgarian prime minister was how to secure maximum gains in exchange for <b>minimum</b> <b>commitments.</b>|$|R
