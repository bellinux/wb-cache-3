5|$|Additional optical {{effects were}} {{provided}} by Visual Concept Engineering (VCE), a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back. VCE provided effects including phaser beams, the Enterprise reactor, additional sand on Ceti Alpha V, and an updated transporter effect. <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> the production staff were adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter, as had {{been done in the}} original television series. Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid-transport, although much of the matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports.|$|E

5|$|Howard went to Chicago Vocational Career Academy, {{where he}} went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball. Vocational had an {{unheated}} gym and no locker rooms, which required that the team dress for games in a history classroom. Nonetheless, Howard went on to be named a 1991 All-American basketball player by Parade magazine and won McDonald's All American honors. He was also chosen for the National Honor Society and served as Vocational's homecoming king. During recruiting visits by college coaches such as Illinois' Lou Henson, DePaul's Joey <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> Michigan's Steve Fisher, Jannie Mae Howard did most of the questioning.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley {{opened a}} probe into the {{finances}} of six televangelism ministries that promoted prosperity theology: Kenneth Copeland Ministries, Creflo Dollar Ministries, Benny Hinn Ministries, Bishop Eddie Long Ministries, Joyce Meyer Ministries, and Paula White Ministries. In January 2011, Grassley concluded his investigation stating {{that he believed}} self-regulation by religious organizations was preferable to government action. Only the ministries led by <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> Hinn cooperated with Grassley's investigation.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 American film {{directors}} Luke <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> Andrew Neel released New World Order, {{a critically}} acclaimed documentary film which explores {{the world of}} conspiracy theorists - such as American radio host Alex Jones - who consistently expose and vigorously oppose {{what they perceive as}} an emerging New World Order. The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) and hip hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E

5|$|In August 1970, Les Solomon, {{his wife}} and {{daughter}} were on vacation in the southwest and arranged to visit Mims, Roberts and their families. At that time, Dan <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> Don Lancaster were among the most prolific authors in Popular Electronics. Meyer had built a million dollar a year business that sold kits of parts to build the project that he and Lancaster wrote about. Mims and Roberts wanted to do the same and quizzed Solomon on the kit business. Solomon gave them some statistics but said there was no way of knowing how many kits an article would sell, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1989, off Vieques Island, Iowas Turret One fired {{six of the}} {{experimental}} shells using the supercharged powder bags. Skelley claimed {{that one of the}} 16inch shells traveled , setting a record for the longest conventional 16inch (406.4mm) shell ever fired. Although the shells had been fired without serious incident, <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> Petty Officer First Class Dale Eugene Mortensen, gun chief for Turret One, told Skelley that they would no longer participate in his experiments. Skelley asked Turret Two's gun chief, Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler, if he could use Turret Two for his experiments; Ziegler refused. Skelley then asked Lieutenant Phil Buch, Turret Two's officer in charge, and Buch acquiesced.|$|E
5|$|The British 3rd Division {{brushed aside}} 16th Luftwaffe and {{approached}} the outskirts of Caen from the north-east. At 19:15, <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> Eberbach authorised {{the withdrawal of the}} 12th SS Panzer Division heavy weapons and the remnants of the Luftwaffe division across the Orne to the southern side of Caen. In the early evening, the 12th SS fought a rearguard action against elements of the 59th and 3rd Canadian divisions, as it pulled back from positions no longer considered tenable. Reports of this withdrawal came into the Anglo-Canadian command but patrols probing German positions, created a false perception that no withdrawal was taking place.|$|E

Quesada, and included Chase Manhattan Bank president David Rockefeller, D.C. businessman David A. Garrett, investment banker André <b>Meyer,</b> <b>and</b> the real estate investment firm Gerry Brothers & Co. Quesada {{said that if the}} Redevelopment Land Agency approved the sale, it would begin immediate construction of the promenade, the 1,400-car parking garage beneath it, and the plaza. The agency gave its approval on January 21, 1965. The sale was final on August 30.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> {{directed}} by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion and the writers thought it would be funny if Mr. Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. The episode includes the debut of the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl, which would become a common background prop in the Simpson home.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> {{directed}} by David Silverman. Voice actor Greg Berg guest starred as Rory, one of the homeless people at the soup kitchen. The episode features cultural references to Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the three poets Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and Edgar Allan Poe. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.9, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
50|$|The {{private places}} created by <b>Meier</b> <b>and</b> Comfort {{would become the}} model for the neighborhoods in Ladue to follow and the design choices they made would become {{characteristic}} of Ladue's architecture.

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> {{directed}} by Wes Archer, {{and it was the}} first episode for which Al Jean and Mike Reiss served as show runners. It features multiple references to the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, including the scene in which Lisa appeals to Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial for advice. Other Washington landmarks referenced in the episode include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Washington Monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{under the supervision of}} Scott Farrar (who served as visual effects cameraman on the first three Star Trek films) and animator Wes Takahashi. After receiving the script, ILM created storyboards for the effects sequences before meeting <b>Meyer</b> <b>and</b> producers Winter and Steven-Charles Jaffe to discuss the planned scenes. These discussions began before the film was greenlit. ILM's initial cost estimates were over Paramount's budget, so to save money the filmmakers redesigned some shots and outsourced some to other companies.|$|E
5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard <b>Meyer,</b> <b>and</b> Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} {{to re-create the}} Little Boy. They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert on Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect {{was on its way}} to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|E
