25|$|To create lasting {{climate change}} mitigation, the {{replacement}} of high carbon emission intensity power sources, such as conventional fossil fuels—oil, coal and natural gas—with low-carbon power sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> energy demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources.

25|$|The Energy {{transition}} is the shift by several countries to sustainable economies {{by means of}} renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable development. This trend has been augmented by the decentralization process of energy generation which is starting to allow average homeowners and small companies to generate their own electricity, allowing everyone to install solar panels on their rooftops and, in many markets, sell their excess electricity back on to the grid. This trend continues to grow and could in the future lead to a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> energy coming from decentralized solar panels and wind turbines scattered across the country rather {{than a handful of}} coal and nuclear power plants. The final goal of German proponents of a nuclear power phase-out is the abolishment of coal and other non-renewable energy sources.|$|E

Information forjudging attractiveness {{can be derived from}} any sensory input however the greater part of the research concerning the subject has primarily focused on visual information, specifically the face and its physical characteristics. On a basic evolutionary level the physical characteristics of an attractive face, such as averageness or symmetry, can indicate the ability of that individual to tolerate environmental or genetic stressors making them a potentially desirable partner. However the evaluation of multiple sensory inputs as well as evaluation of non-physical information allows for a greater understanding of how attractiveness judgements are formed in reality...|$|R

2500|$|Our {{relationship}} with the natural environment can be understood through the concept of biophilia and the biophilia hypothesis. This term is defined as humans' innate need to affiliate with other life such as plants and animals. This essentially means that humans have {{a desire to be}} near nature. This built in desire {{may be the result of}} spending the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> evolutionary history (over 99%) closely connected to nature. Biophilia is genetic meaning those humans who were closely connected to nature throughout history would, presumably, have had better access to food and fresh water. For example, someone who lived close to water, near vegetation, or with a pet as a protector (e.g. dog) would have had survival advantages. Although evolutionary theory is difficult to test, the popularity of camping, hiking, and visiting the zoo, provide support for this theory. In his 1997 book, Kellert proposed that biophilia (or being close to nature) also provides us benefits such as an increase in well-being. Thus, being disconnected from the natural environment should have negative effects on humans' well-being.|$|E

However, the Braves executives complained that its downtown location restricted game attendance because of traffic into the city and a shortage of on-site parking. [...] The stadium was ¾ mile (1200 m) from the nearest Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) stop, and many fans were unwilling to brave Atlanta's infamous congestion to attend games; plus, the team could not secure more parking spaces. In addition, team VP for business operations Mike Plant said the site [...] "doesn't match up with where the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> fans come from", as the stadium is near some of Atlanta's poorest neighborhoods.

Sustainable farming practices are negatively correlated with the probability of testing and conducting field inspections, and they are associated with increased costs for testing and sampling, harvest container sanitation, and written records relative to conventional growers.
