60|$|That a thing {{may have}} any value in exchange, two {{conditions}} are necessary. 1.

25|$|Much of Hitchcock's {{supposed}} {{dislike of}} actors has been exaggerated. Hitchcock {{simply did not}} tolerate the method approach, as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. In a Sight & Sound interview, he stated that, 'the method actor is OK in the theatre {{because he has a}} free space to move about. But when it comes to cutting the face and what he sees and so forth, there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> discipline'. He often used the same actors in many of his films.|$|E
25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core}} of how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
25|$|When Watson and Crick {{produced}} their {{double helix}} model of DNA, {{it was known}} {{that most of the}} specialized features of the many different life forms on Earth are made possible by proteins. Structurally, proteins are long chains of amino acid subunits. In some way, the genetic molecule, DNA, had to contain instructions for how to make the thousands of proteins found in cells. From the DNA double helix model, it was clear that there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> correspondence between the linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA molecules to the linear sequences of amino acids in proteins. The details of how sequences of DNA instruct cells to make specific proteins was worked out by molecular biologists during the period from 1953 to 1965. Francis Crick played an integral role in both the theory and analysis of the experiments that led to an improved understanding of the genetic code.|$|E

25|$|When {{they started}} their return trip, the cavalrymen {{came under fire}} from the woods about three miles from Fairfax Court House. Major Remington sent two squads of four {{dismounted}} men into the woods to investigate. One of the men's horses bolted and started to run toward Fairfax Court House. Lt. Dagwell pursued the runaway horse and met the advanced guard of four men of the detachment just outside their old camp where they found citizens loading wagons with everything of value {{that had not been}} removed or burned by the Union Army in their move north. As Lt. Dagwell found the horse entering the courtyard of the courthouse, he saw that the yard was filled with what he estimated to be about 65 Confederate troops. Believing the Confederates <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> of Major John S. Mosby's partisans, Dagwell turned his horse and fled as the Confederates fired at him.|$|E
25|$|The Hartig net {{initially}} forms {{from the}} fully differentiated inner {{layer of the}} mantle, and penetration occurs in a broad front oriented transversally to the root axis, rather than from a single hyphae. As the hyphae contact the root cells and digest through the apoplastic space, some spruce (Picea abies) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) cells {{have been shown to}} produce chitinases and peroxidases that could inhibit Hartig net formation. Some plant cells exhibit transcripts for stress- and defense-related proteins such as pathogenesis-related and hypersensitive response-induced proteins. However, extensive root colonization still occurs in these plants, and the association {{does not seem to be}} met with massive cell death associated with pathogen limitation or defense gene activation. In fact, as the relationship develops in a compatible manner, these hallmarks of resistance seem to diminish by about day 21 after colonization. Thus, there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> sort of defense response suppression by the EcM fungi, though details concerning its nature and mechanisms have yet to be determined.|$|E
25|$|One of the theorems proved by Ramsey in his 1928 paper On {{a problem}} of formal logic now bears his name (Ramsey's theorem). While this theorem is the work Ramsey is {{probably}} best remembered for, he only proved it in passing, as a minor lemma {{along the way to}} his true goal in the paper, solving a special case of the decision problem for first-order logic, namely the decidability of what is now called the Bernays–Schönfinkel–Ramsey class of first-order logic, as well as a characterisation of the spectrum of sentences in this fragment of logic. Alonzo Church would go on to show that the general case of the decision problem for first-order logic is unsolvable (see Church's theorem). A great amount of later work in mathematics was fruitfully developed out of the ostensibly minor lemma, {{which turned out to be}} an important early result in combinatorics, supporting the idea that within some sufficiently large systems, however disordered, there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> order. So fruitful, in fact, was Ramsey's theorem that today there is an entire branch of mathematics, known as Ramsey theory, which is dedicated to studying similar results.|$|E

25|$|For {{the second}} part, {{consider}} a shortest path P (there {{may be more}} than one) from source to u with at most i edges. Let v be the last vertex before u on this path. Then, the part of the path from source to v is a shortest path from source to v with at most i-1 edges, since if it were not, then there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> strictly shorter path from source to v with at most i-1 edges, and we could then append the edge uv to this path to obtain a path with at most i edges that is strictly shorter than P -- a contradiction. By inductive assumption, v.distance after i−1 iterations is at most the length of this path from source to v. Therefore, uv.weight + v.distance is at most the length of P. In the ith iteration, u.distance gets compared with uv.weight + v.distance, and is set equal to it if uv.weight + v.distance was smaller. Therefore, after i iterations, u.distance is at most the length of P, i.e., the length of the shortest path from source to u that uses at most i edges.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} for the EGC is focused on freshwater fluxes. Because the EGC runs through the Greenland Sea and eventually through the Labrador Sea (as the West Greenland Current) it can have strong implications for the strengthening and or weakening of deep water formations in the Greenland and Labrador Seas. The Meridional Overturning Circulation is a density driven circulation in which a small perturbation in the density field could easily slow down or speed up the deep water formation in the Nordic Seas. Jones et al. note {{that there are three}} different freshwater sources for the EGC: Pacific water, river runoff, and sea-ice meltwater. They find that the biggest contributor to the freshening of the EGC is due to river runoff, followed by Pacific water, and a distant last is sea-ice meltwater (nearly negligible). They find that even though these sources freshen the EGC, these specific sources do not penetrate very well into the central Greenland Sea where the deep convection takes place. They then decide that there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> other freshwater influence in the central Greenland Sea. They believe it may be from solid sea ice being transported to the central Greenland Sea and then melting. Solid sea ice is very mobile, and winds can easily direct its flow along with ocean currents. Previous thoughts were that the recirculation of the EGC in the Greenland Sea via the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone helps lead to a freshening of the central Greenland Sea, however, Rudels et al. disproved this theory and said it must be due to solid sea ice melt and precipitation in the central Greenland Sea.|$|E
500|$|Bede's {{concept of}} the power of these overlords also must be {{regarded}} as the product of his eighth-century viewpoint. [...] When the Ecclesiastical History was written, Æthelbald of Mercia dominated the English south of the Humber, and Bede's view of the earlier kings was doubtless strongly coloured by the state of England at that time. [...] For the earlier bretwaldas, such as Ælle and Ceawlin, there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> element of anachronism in Bede's description.

500|$|A {{precondition}} {{for the formation}} of steam devils is the presence of a layer of moist air on the water with the misty air (called arctic steam fog) being drawn upwards into fog streamers (non-rotating columns of steam fog).

[...] The cold air is warmed by the water and is humidified by evaporation.
