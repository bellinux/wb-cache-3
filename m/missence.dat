40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} the pathogenic gene mutation in a Chinese family with autosomal dominant inherited nuclear cataract. Methods: After obtained informed consent, detailed ophthalmic examinations were performed, genomic DNAs {{were obtained from}} eighteen family members in a four-generation Chinese family with five affected. All exons of candidate genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were sequenced performed by bidirectional sequencing. The stability of mutation was predicted with Prediction of Protein Mutant Stability changes (PoPMuSiC). The structure homology modeling of the mutant protein was based on Swiss-Model Serve, and its structure was displayed and compared with human connexin 26 using the RasMol software. Results: By sequencing the encoding regions of the candidate genes, a <b>missence</b> mutation (c. 139 G>A) was detected in gap junction protein alpha 8 (GJA 8) gene, {{which resulted in the}} substitution of highly conserved aspartic acid by asparagine at codon 47 (p. D 47 N). The mutation co-segregated with all patients and was absent in 100 normal Chinese controls. PoPMuSiC analysis showed the change in folding free energy upon mutation (ΔΔG) is 0. 31 kcal/mol and the mutation p. D 47 N is destabilizing. The homology modeling showed that the structure of the mutant protein was different with that of human connexin 26. Conclusions: The study identified a <b>missence</b> mutation (c. 139 G>A) in GJA 8 gene associated with autosomal dominan...|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} Chinese hamster somatic cells was {{inhibited}} by 0. 2 mg/cc of 2 -deoxygalactose. Mutants partially or fully resistant to 2 -deoxygalactose were isolated in a single-step or two-step selection. Some {{of them did}} not grow {{as well as the}} wild type; one of them which lacked galactokinase (EC. 2. 7. 1. 6) activity did not grow at all in galactose medium. The galactokinase kinetic properties (Vmax & Kmax) of the other mutants and of the wild type were different. Therefore resistance resulted either from the possible absence of galactokinase synthesis or from a structural mutation, possibly a <b>missence</b> mutation, in the galactokinase gene. —A simple diagnostic test for juvenile cataract is proposed...|$|E

Mutations in two genes, SLC 3 A 1 and SLC 7 A 9, {{have been identified}} in cystinuric patients. This report presents a 13 -yr-old boy with cystinuria who manifested difficulty in walking, ataxia, and mental retardation. Somatosensory evoked potential of posterior tibial nerve stimulation showed the central conduction dysfunction through the posterior column of spinal cord. He was diagnosed non-type I cystinuria by urinary amino acid analysis and oral cystine loading test.

40|$|Single point {{mutations}} {{corresponding to}} the positions G 2505 and G 2583 have been constructed in the gene encoding E. coli 23 S rRNA. These mutations were linked to the second mutation A 1067 to T, known to confer resistance to thiostrepton (1). Mutant ribosomes were analyzed in vitro {{for their ability to}} direct poly(U) dependent translation, their <b>missence</b> error frequency and in addition their sensitivity to peptidyltransferase inhibitors. It was evident that the mutated ribosomes had an altered dependence on [Mg 2 +] and an increased sensitivity to chloramphenicol during poly(U) directed poly(Phe) synthesis. In a transpeptidation assay mutated ribosomes were as sensitive to chloramphenicol as wild-type ribosomes. However, the mutant ribosomes exhibited an increased sensitivity to lincomycin.

We report the clinical manifestations and mutational analysis of the CD 40 L gene observed in a male patient from a XHIM family. Having hypogammaglobulinemia and elevated IgM, the 3 -yr-old boy exhibited the characteristic clinical features of XHIM. The patient suffered from frequent respiratory infections, and chronic enteritis caused by Cryptosporidium parvum. In addition, a lymph node biopsy and a culture from this sample revealed C. neoformans infection. Activated lymphocytes from the patient failed to express CD 40 L on their surface as assessed by flow cytometry and a <b>missence</b> mutation (W 140 R) was found at the XHIM hotspot in his CD 40 L cDNA to confirm the diagnosis.

This exploratory analysis was performed to determine the incidence of EGFR mutations in male smokers with squamous cell carcinoma, who were treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib. Sixty-nine Korean NSCLC patients were treated with gefitinib in a prospective study. For a subset of 20 male patients with squamous cell carcinoma and a history of smoking, pretreatment tumor tissue samples were obtained and analyzed for EGFR mutations (exons 18 to 21). EGFR mutations were found in 3 (15 %) patients, including in-frame deletions within exon 19 (n= 2) and L 858 R <b>missence</b> mutation in exon 21 (n= 1). These 3 patients with EGFR mutations responded to gefitinib, whereas only one of remaining 17 patients with wild-type EGFR achieved clinical response.

40|$|Familial adenomatous {{polyposis}} (FAP) and Hereditary Non Polyposis Syndrome (HNPCC) {{are the two}} commonest familial syndromes that predispose to colorectal cancer. FAP {{is caused}} by mutations in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) tumour suppressor gene that has a high penetrance. The disease {{is characterized by the}} occurrence of hundreds to thousands of colorectal polyps, which if left untreated give rise to colorectal cancer. On the other hand HNPCC is characterized by development of colorectal cancer at an early age, in the absence of polyps. This syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the mismatch repair genes (hMLH 1, hMSH 2, hMSH 6, hPMS 1 and hMSH 2). In Cyprus there are no molecular data available as yet, on families with FAP or HNPCC. This work presents the results of APC analysis in our population for the first time. The APC gene was analysed in 33 DNA samples from 20 individuals belonging to 4 FAP families and 13 patients with sporadic polyposis. We identified 3 truncating mutations, 4 <b>missence</b> mutations and 11 polymorphisms. It is of interest that 2 of the 3 truncating mutations, 2307 delA and Q 1242 X are novel which confirms the existence of a unique genetic pool in the Cypriot population. In th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{endocrine}} neoplasias type 2 A (MEN 2 A) is a dominantly {{inherited cancer}} syndrome. <b>Missence</b> mutations in the codon encoding cysteine 634 of the ret proto-oncogene {{have been found}} in 85 % of the MEN 2 A families. The main tumour type always present in MEN 2 A is medullar thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Only 25 % of all MTC are hereditary, and generally they are identified by a careful family history. However, some familial MTCs are not easily detected by this means and underdiagnosis of MEN 2 A is suspected. Methods DNA samples from MEN 2 A patients were amplified by PCR. The products were incubated with the restriction enzyme Bst ApI or Bgl I. The samples were loaded in non-denaturing 10 % Polyacrilamyde Gel and run at 120 volts for 40 min. The gels were stained with 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and the bands were visualized under a UV lamp. Results We developed a PCR-mutagenic method to check the integrity of the three bases of the cysteine 634 codon. Conclusion The method can be used to detect inherited mutations in MTC patients without a clear family history. The method is relatively simple to use as a routine test in these patients to decrease the underdiagnosis of MEN 2 A. In addition, the assay can be used to screen affected families with any mutation in cysteine 634. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Natriuretic {{peptides}} (NPs) are peptide {{hormones that}} exert their biological actions by binding to {{three types of}} cell surface natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs). The receptor NPR-B binding C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) acts locally as a paracrine and/or autocrine regulator {{in a wide variety}} of tissues. Mutations in the gene NPR 2 have been shown to cause acromesomelic dysplasia-type Maroteaux (AMDM), an autosomal recessive skeletal disproportionate dwarfism disorder in humans. Methods In the study, presented here, genotyping of six consanguineous families of Pakistani origin with AMDM was carried out using polymorphic microsatellite markers, which are closely linked to the gene NPR 2 on chromosome 9 p 21 -p 12. To screen for mutations in the gene NPR 2, all of its coding exons and splice junction sites were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of affected and unaffected individuals of the families and sequenced. Results Sequence analysis of the gene NPR 2 identified a novel <b>missence</b> mutation (p. T 907 M) in five families, and a splice donor site mutation c. 2986 [*]+[*] 2 [*]T[*]>[*]G in the other family. Conclusion We have described two novel mutations in the gene NPR 2. The presence of the same mutation (p. T 907 M) and haplotype in five families (A, B, C, D, E) is suggestive of a founder effect. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is caused by <b>missence</b> mutations in myosin heavy chain or other sarcomeric proteins. To investigate the functional impact of FHC mutations in myosin heavy chain, mutants of Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II equivalent to human FHC mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, and their motor function was characterized at the molecular level. These mutants, i. e., R 397 Q, F 506 C, G 575 R, A 699 R, K 703 Q, and K 703 W are respectively equivalent to R 403 Q, F 513 C, G 584 R, G 716 R, R 719 Q, and R 719 W FHC mutants. We measured the force generated by these myosin mutants {{as well as the}} sliding velocity and the actin-activated ATPase activity. These measurements showed that the A 699 R, K 703 Q, and K 703 W myosins exhibited unexpectedly weak affinity with actin and the lowest level of force, though their ATPase activity remained rather high. F 506 C mutant which has been reported to have benign prognosis exhibited the least impairment of the motile and enzymatic activities. The motor functions of R 397 Q and G 575 R myosins were classified as intermediate. These results suggest that the force level of mutant myosin molecule {{may be one of the}} key factors for pathogenesis which affect the prognosis of human FHC...|$|E

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} dense deposit disease (DDD) is the prototypical membranoproliferative glomeru-lonephritis (MPGN), in which fluid-phase dysregulation {{of the alternative}} pathway (AP) of complement results in the accumulation of complement debris in the glomeruli, often producing an MPGN pattern of injury {{in the absence of}} immune complexes. A recently described entity referred to as GN with C 3 deposi-tion (GN-C 3) bears many similarities to DDD. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate AP function in cases of GN-C 3. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Five recent cases of MPGN with extensive C 3 deposition were studied. Renal biopsy in one case exhibited the classic findings of DDD. Three cases showed GN-C 3 in the absence of significant Ig deposition; however, the classic hallmark of DDD—dense deposits along the glo-merular basement membranes and mesangium—was absent. The remaining case exhibited features of both DDD and GN-C 3. Results Evidence of AP activation was demonstrable in all cases and included increased levels of soluble membrane attack complex (all cases), positive AP functional assays (four cases), and a positive hemolytic assay (one case). Autoantibodies were found to C 3 convertase (two cases) and to factor H (one case). Factor H mutation screening identified the H 402 allele (all cases) and a c. C 2867 T p.

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CC) is the {{secondary}} {{cause of death}} in the Western countries of which approximately 15 % are considered to be hereditary. The hereditary forms are Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and Hereditary Non Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) which is the commonest form. The detection of mutations in the MMR and apc related genes, allows the development of health prevention strategies. Different molecular diagnostic strategies are available for the detection of mutations in these genes, i. e. DGGE, SSCP and direct sequencing. However, deletions and duplications of one or more consecutive exons, which account for around 50 % of the total alterations in MMR genes, cannot be detected by PCR based methodologies due to the non quantitative nature of these techniques. The aim of our work has been the standardization of a methodology, called Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification, which allows the detection of genomic deletions and duplications as primary analysis in HNPCC and FAP patients in Argentina. In this case, we inform that the application of MLPA allowed the detection of a <b>missence</b> mutation, without the need for direct sequencing of the complete genes involved. A PCR/RFLP strategy was afterwards designed to detect the C <T change on codon 718 of mlh 1 gene in members of the family. For a developing country like Argentina, which has limited resources for genetic diagnosis, this MLPA application has avoided an unaffordable cost as the complete sequencing of all the involved genes. The application of MLPA in our country contributes to improvement in the diagnosis of hereditary CC and allows the development of preventive health interventions...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s {{disease is}} a {{degenerative}} neurological illness affecting 1 - 2 % of the population over 65 years old. The neuropathological hallmarks are characterized by progressive and profound loss of neuromelanin containing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) with presence of eosinophillic, intracytoplasmic, proteinaceous inclusions termed as Lewy bodies. Clinical features of Parkinson’s disease include motor impairments involving resting tremor, bradykinesia, postural instability and rigidity along with non motoric symptoms like autonomic, cognitive and psychiatric problems. The molecular pathways leading to this pathological picture and concomitant clinical syndromes are obscure, but {{it is believed that}} it may result from an environmental factor, a genetic causation or a combination of the two. Epidemiological studies reveal that < 10 % of Parkinson’s disease has a strict familial etiology while majority of cases are sporadic. Several genetic loci are identified for Parkinson’s disease. However, there are five clearly defined genetic causes of Parkinson’s disease (PARK 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8) Mutations in SNCA and LRRK 2 genes, encoding alpha synuclein and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, respectively, cause autosomal dominant Parkinson’s disease (AdPD). We studied 55 patients with AdPD and 55 age and gender matched controls all of Greek origin. Patients were screened for SNCA and LRRK 2 mutations by direct sequencing. SNCA gene dossage analysis was also performed for AdPD using quantitative duplex polymerase chain reaction of genomic DNA. We found no <b>missence</b> mutations or multiplications in the SNCA gene.

40|$|Background: Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) {{deficiency}} is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder of the purine synthesis {{which results in}} accumulation of succinylpurines (succinyladenosine (S-Ado) and succinylamino-imidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr)) in body fluids. Patients present developmental delay, often accompanied by epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorders. Objectives: To describe atypical neurological features {{in the evolution of}} three novel unrelated cases of ADSL deficiency. Patients: A 9 -year-old boy with severe cognitive impairment and autistic behaviour received d-ribose therapy for one year. Drug withdrawal was associated with acute neurological deterioration, severe brain atrophy and demyelination on MRI. The second patient is a 5. 5 -year-old girl with mild developmental delay who presented a benign course with moderate cognitive impairment as the only feature in her evolution. The final patient is a 14 -year-old boy with severe cognitive impairment who developed drug-resistant epilepsy and bathing reflex seizures, progressive spasticity in the lower limbs and thoracic deformity. Methods: SAICAr and S-Ado in urine were analysed by HPLC with diode array detection. Diagnosis was confirmed by molecular analysis of the ADSL gene. Results: An elevation of S-Ado and SAICAr excretion in urine was detected in all three patients. The patients were homozygous for the <b>missence</b> change p. I 369 L and for the novel change p. M 389 V. Conclusion: Drug-resistant epilepsy and specific therapeutic interventions may modify the neurological outcome in ADSL deficiency. d-ribose must be considered with caution as, in our experience, it returns no clinical benefit and drug withdrawal can precipitate status epilepticus and acute neurological deterioration. © 2011 European Paediatric Neurology Society.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} {{prevalent}} across {{the western world}} and is {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately a third of all fatalities. Investigating the heart by simulating its electrophysiology via the aid of mathematical models has advanced significantly over the past 60 years and is now a well established field. While much of the research focus is placed on the ventricles, the study of the atria is in comparison neglected. Therefore this Thesis is focused on the genesis and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). A series of case studies are performed whereby established biophysically detailed mathematical models are implemented and modified to incorporate electrophysical alterations of atrial cells resulting from a variety of external conditions. The opening section of this Thesis is dedicated to developing a background to the field, including a discussion into the clinical aspect of the diagnosis and management of AF. The suitability of two atrial cell models is discussed and the development of single cell, 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D multi-scale simulation protocols are described in detail. In addition measurements taken to quantify the arrhythmogenic properties of the cells susceptibility to AF are outlined. The second section is focused on the incorporation of conditions thought to enhance atrial tissues ability to initiate and maintain the genesis of AF. Included is a case study into the <b>missence</b> S 140 G gene mutation, and elevated physiological levels of the hormone Homocystein. The third section investigates the effectiveness of well established and widely used pharmacological treatments such as Beta-Blockers. In addition possible avenues of investigations for the development of atrial specific drugs are explored. These include blocking of the ultra rapid potassium channel and a more novel target for therapy via the targeting of 5 HT 4 receptors; which is transcribed solely in the atria and alters the electrophysical properties of the L-type Calcium current. The final part of this Thesis is dedicated {{to the development of a}} 2 D atrial sheet model which includes electrical and spatial heterogeneities via the inclusion of multiple cell types and basic fiber orientation respectively. This allows for an investigation into the role that heterogeneities play in role genesis and maintenance of AF. The main finding of this Thesis is that alterations to the electrophysiology of atrial cells, due to external factors, can be successfully simulated via the implementation of mathematically detailed atrial cell models. It is concluded that simulations of the KENQ 1 mutation and elevated levels of Homocystein successfully reproduce conditions which increase the onset of AF. Established treatments such as Beta-Blockers are found to have limited effectiveness. Possible theoretical treatments, such as the blocking of IKur, are found to provide a small amount of therapeutic benefit. In contrast, investigations into the effects of Serotonin were inconclusive. The study into the 2 D atria indicated the importance that heterogeneities play in atria. The conclusions show that models provide a powerful tool when investigating how changes to electrophysiology of cells are manifested at a multi-scale level. The models also have their limitations and require further advancement to improve their accuracy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceEPSRCGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Hamartomatous {{polyposis}} syndromes are a rare {{group of}} hereditary autosomal dominant disorders that comprise less than 1 % of all hereditary colorectal cancers. However, these hamartomatous polyposis syndromes have a malignant {{potential for the}} development of colorectal cancer as well as extracolonic cancers. The hamartomatous polyposis syndromes include juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS); PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, which includes Cowden syndrome (CS) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). Due to the rarity of these conditions, a thorough understanding of their clinical presentation, including extraintestinal manifestations, and genetics is important. For pediatric gastroenterologists, understanding how to recognize and establish the appropriate diagnosis and cancer risk and following appropriate screening and surveillance guidelines is crucial for early detection to minimize the risk of carcinoma as children reach adulthood. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited syndrome characterized by mucocutanoeus pigmentation, multiple hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of cancer at a young age. Inactivating germ-line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene STK 11 /LKB 1 have been detected in approximately 80 % of patients. The aim of this work is to clarify the molecular basis of the disease in Italian PJS patients. We investigate the STK 11 /LKB 1 gene mutations in a well-characterized series of 9 unrelated Italian PJS patients, by using a combination of PCR, RT-PCR, DNA sequencing, Southern blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques. We have characterized the specific STK 11 mutation in 6 probands, and identified 2 truncating mutations (1 novel and 1 known mutation), one missense known mutation in the exon four, and two novel small in-frame deletions in the exon six. Finally, we have found an intra-exonic in-frame deletion encompassing exons 2 and 4 : the possible mechanism leading to this genomic rearrangement is most likely an Alu-Alu homologous recombination. In our study point mutations, small scale deletions/insertions and exonic STK 11 deletions account for about 67 % of PJS; mutations in other STK 11 related genes examined have not be found. Other gene inactivating methods, such as chromosomal rearrangements mediated by Alu-Alu homologous recombination, which cannot be detected by routinely molecular biology screening methods, might be responsible for PJS in mutations negative population subset. However, the existence of genetic heterogeneity cannot be excluded. The “PTEN hamartomatous tumor sindrome” (PHTS), include a group af syndromes that are caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten). They belong to hamartomatous polyposis syndromes family, a rare and heterogeneous group of hereditary autosomal dominant disorders characterized by multiple polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and greatly increased risk of developing malignant tumours in multiple tissues. The PTEN tumor suppressor gene affects multiple cellular processes including cell growth, proliferation, and cell migration by antagonizing phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt phatway. we have first screened the PTEN coding region in three italian patients with clinical diagnosis of PHTS by using a combination of RT-PCR, direct sequencing of the amplified fragments and real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques. Afterwards, in periferal blood cells of these patients, we have defined the expression profile of other genes directly related to PI 3 K/Akt phatway, as cMYC, COX 2, CCND 1 and TNFa, or involved in colorectal cancer onset, as APC, DKC 1 and hTERT. We have characterized the specific PTEN mutation in 1 subject, the c 406 C->T (C 136 R) mutation, a <b>missence</b> mutation of the catalytic domain just described in literature before. The others two patients showed a low level of PTEN mRNA expression, respectively of 0, 3 and 0, 4 fold change, related to a healthy controls. All three patients were characterized by an high level of COX 2, TNFa and CCND 1 genes expression and decrease expression of APC gene. Our data represent the first evidence of a PI 3 K/Akt phatway dysregulation in periferal blood cells of PHTS patients that probably determine a pro inflammation attivation. Knowledge of specific molecular phatways costitutively dysregulated in this syndrome could be helpful in optimizing molecular targeted therapy and preventative care...|$|E
