5|$|With their {{powerful}} stings and conspicuous warning coloration, social wasps are {{the models}} for <b>many</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> mimic. Two common cases are Batesian mimicry, where the mimic is harmless and is essentially bluffing, and Müllerian mimicry, where the mimic is also distasteful, and the mimicry {{can be considered}} mutual. Batesian mimics of wasps include <b>many</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> hoverfly and the wasp beetle. <b>Many</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> wasp are involved in Müllerian mimicry, as are <b>many</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> bee.|$|E

5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as members of the same species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in <b>many</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Caricaceae.|$|E

5|$|Communication in {{the form}} of quorum sensing plays a role in the {{regulation}} of luminescence in <b>many</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> bacteria.
