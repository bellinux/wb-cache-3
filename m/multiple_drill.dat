50|$|The {{purpose of}} the drill program was to test a small area of known shallow mineralized zones by {{drilling}} fences of holes on a spacing of no greater than 25 metres between sections. The proposed pattern of drilling and number of holes was designed to allow two (2) separate shallow areas to be similarly tested. Four (4) holes were twinned to previous holes for comparative analysis. Recognized mineralized zones were assayed using conventional fire assay with an atomic absorption or gravimetric finish, {{and at the end}} of the program, sample composites (made by combining reject samples from <b>multiple</b> <b>drill</b> holes previously analyzed by conventional fire assay) were made and sent to Lakefield Research for metallurgical testing. A resource estimate in compliance with CIM Definitions and Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves was undertaken at the end of the program by P & E Mining Consultants Inc. using the metallurgical sample results (Armstrong, Puritch and Horvath, 2006).|$|E

The brigade color guard is separate from the varsity color guard team and the drill team, which are considered quasi-sports teams that compete in <b>multiple</b> <b>drill</b> competitions in the spring, with the first competition always taking place at Benedictine (others are held throughout south Georgia). The brigade color guard takes part in numerous civic, military, and other public functions throughout the Savannah area during the school year, averaging several dozen. When the brigade is completely formed up in marching order (such as during the St. Patrick's Day Parade) the color guard marches just behind the brigade commander and his staff in the front, with two riflemen (carrying real rifles that have been de-militarized) on the ends [...] "protecting" [...] the flag bearers in the middle, flying the U.S., Georgia, and Irish flags (the Irish flag is only carried during the parade). During the parade battalion color guards are also temporarily formed, consisting of the two riflemen and a cadet carrying a JROTC flag. Each company also has a guidon bearer (a freshman or sophomore), who marches in front with the company commander.|$|E

40|$|Background: Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) {{primarily}} affects subchondral bone. <b>Multiple</b> <b>drilling,</b> fixation implant or autogenous osteochondral grafts are reported as treatment options. We present the midterm results {{of cases in}} which an OCD lesion was treated by osteochondral autograft transfer and drilling. Materials and Methods: Between 2002 and 2006, 14 knees with International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS-OCD) type II and III lesions were treated in our clinic using osteochondral autograft transfer and drilling by arthroscopic or open surgery. The average age of our patients was 22. 14 years (range 17 - 29 years) and average followup was of 24. 3 months (range 11 - 40 months). Lesion type was ICRS type II in five patients (35. 7 %) and ICRS type III in nine patients (64. 3 %). In cases with ICRS-OCD type II lesions, in situ fixation was applied following circumferential <b>multiple</b> <b>drilling,</b> while mosaicplasty was done following debridement and <b>multiple</b> <b>drilling</b> in cases with ICRS-OCD type III lesion. Mosaicplasty was performed in the lesion area {{by an average of}} 2. 5 (range 1 - 3) cylindrical osteochondral autografts. Patients were not allowed to perform loading activities for 3 weeks in the postoperative period; movement was initiated by using CPM device in the early phase; full range of motion was achieved in third week, and full weight bearing was permitted in 6 to 8 weeks. Results: While 6 and 8 patients were classified preoperatively as fair and poor, respectively, according to Hughston scale, excellent and good results were obtained postoperatively in 10 and 4 patients, respectively. During the followup, no problems were detected in any of the patients in the regions where osteochondral graft was harvested. Conclusion: Biologic fixation or mosaicplasty and drilling as a technique to treatment of the lesion in OCD by osteochondral autograft transfer has resulted in good and excellent clinical outcomes in our patients and it is considered that providing blood flow to subchondral bone by circumferencial drilling leads to an increase in the robustness of biological internal fixation and shortens the duration of recovery...|$|R

30|$|An {{experimental}} {{model in}} sheep looked at five different osteotomy techniques ranging from subcutaneous corticotomy to open osteotomy and {{their effect on}} new bone formation. It found that osteoclasia using multiple subcutaneous drilling to allow subsequent fracture gave the most advanced remodelling and mineralisation of bone tissue [53]. Each of these techniques pose varying degrees of damage to the periosteum and bone marrow. Interestingly, the techniques both preserving and damaging the bone marrow resulted in comparable regenerates; total damage to the periosteum and preservation of the medullary supply inhibited bone regeneration during distraction. The classical subcutaneous osteotomy described by Ilizarov has been shown by numerous studies [51, 53] to be most traumatic and poses a real challenge to preserving the periosteum and soft tissues around the bone. The preservation of the periosteal sleeve in the <b>multiple</b> <b>drill</b> hole technique provides strong induction properties of osteogenic cells. Shavings, within the gap {{as a result of}} the <b>multiple</b> <b>drill</b> holes, contain polypeptide growth factors (Bone Morphogenic Proteins and Transforming Growth Factor Beta) which are signals inducing proliferation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells of periosteum and endosteum towards osteogenic cells. This method, in spite of damage to the bone marrow, yielded a quicker formation of bone regenerate.|$|E

30|$|A {{significant}} difference in energy absorbed to failure was observed between the ORIF and control groups, data which correlate to that of Edgerton et al. [27], who report a 20  % reduction in strength for a single drill hole using sheep femora. Our data, which describe <b>multiple</b> <b>drill</b> holes, found a greater, 47  %, reduction in absorption; however, compared to the data of Brooks et al. [28], our reduction in strength with <b>multiple</b> <b>drill</b> holes {{is less than the}} 55  % reduction they noted for a single hole in canine bone. It should be noted, however, that our specimens had a cortical defect ratio of 012 – 0.16, whereas Brooks et al. report a ratio of 0.14 – 0.18 [28]. This correlates with finite element simulations, as comparing the cortical defect ratio reported here with other studies, simulations have predicted little decline in torsional strength up to a defect ratio equal to 0.1, then a rapid decline in torsional strength between ratios of 0.1 – 0.2, before declining less steeply above 0.2 [27, 29]. Furthermore, the qualitative data acquired during this investigation clearly indicates that drill holes do localise stress, with all ORIF bones failing through at least one such cortical defect.|$|E
30|$|These {{animal studies}} have {{established}} several important aspects in distraction osteogenesis.

The importance of the endosteal and medullary supply, however, has undergone debate, and these {{studies have shown that the}} <b>multiple</b> <b>drill</b> hole osteotomy helps prevent comminution and fracture line propagation.

Special curved saws and osteotomes are available for small bones; larger bones may require <b>multiple</b> <b>drill</b> holes in a circular pattern and completed with an osteotome. It is important to use the CORA as the point of rotation. The more complex dome’s are technically challenging and may not realistically be practical in all soft tissue envelopes.|$|E

50|$|IODP uses <b>multiple</b> <b>drilling</b> {{platforms}} (JOIDES Resolution, Chikyu, and mission-specific platforms) {{to access}} different subseafloor environments during research expeditions. These facilities are {{funded by the}} U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD), alongside the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (MOST), Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM), Australian-New Zealand IODP Consortium (ANZIC), India Ministry of Earth Science (MoES), and Brazil’s Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES). Together, these entities represent a coalition of over two dozen countries. The IODP funding model differs from the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program in that NSF, MEXT, and ECORD each manage their own drilling platform. International partners directly contribute to the operating costs of the drilling platforms in exchange for scientific participation on the expeditions and seats on the advisory panels.|$|R
50|$|The IODP {{scientific}} objectives can be only {{achieved by}} combining <b>multiple</b> <b>drilling</b> platforms. The USA and Japan operate the multipurpose drillship JOIDES Resolution and the riser drilling vessel Chikyū, respectively, to drill {{in the deep}} sea. ECORD is an independent platform provider funding and implementing mission-specific platform (MSP) operations for IODP. The advantage of the MSP concept resides with its flexible use of diverse drilling vessels and systems, depending on the scientific objectives and the environment. The MSPs are able to drill in challenging environments like shallow-water reefs and ice-covered areas, thus extending the scientific and operational capability of the programme. A wider geographical distribution can be reached and more diverse science topics can be addressed. ECORD’s aim is to implement one MSP expedition per year on average for IODP over the next decade. To date, seven IODP MSP expeditions {{have been carried out}} since 2004 for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and since 2013 for the International Ocean Discovery Program.

30|$|During the 1980 ’s, <b>multiple</b> <b>drill</b> {{osteotomy}} {{technique was}} then introduced which only required a small incision {{and was found}} to be more precise than the corticotomy technique. It was popularised by the Verona group, namely De Bastiani et al., later recognised as the De Bastiani technique, which can be applied to any long bone. The corticotomy was performed in the proximal area of the diaphysis utilising an anterior approach in all cases. Careful blunt dissection of the periosteum was performed and achieved using a 4.8  mm diameter drill piece in a short screw guide.

30|$|Frierson et al. {{conducted}} a study comparing three different osteotomy techniques in assessment of regeneration properties in distraction osteogenesis. Their findings showed that vessels bridging the regenerate gap were diminished in the group in which the oscillating saw was used to perform the osteotomy. However, there was an abundance of vessels bridging {{the gap in the}} remaining two groups, corticotomy and <b>multiple</b> <b>drill</b> hole groups. This then led them to conclude that the oscillating saw may lead to delayed consolidation [51]. The challenge of keeping the medullary endosteal supply in continuity during the corticotomy has surfaced repeatedly [22, 29]. Dividing the anteromedial and anterolateral cortices through an anterior approach is relatively simple. To complete the corticotomy, a rotational force is applied. This frequently results in an oblique fracture through the posterior cortex as it is the central axis of rotation. The medullary contents are said to undergo shearing that disrupt the vascular supply. Frierson, Kojimoto, Kawamura and Aronson all confirmed neovascularisation of arterioles following transection of the medullary blood supply. Frierson’s work also confirmed osseous regeneration in distraction can be achieved following complete transection of the medullary vascular supply. In addition, there were no histological or radiological differences between the corticotomy and transverse osteotomy groups.|$|E
