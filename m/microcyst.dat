40|$|SUMMARY: Spirillum lunatum {{has been}} shown to possess a life cycle in which there is an {{alternation}} between a vegetative and a <b>microcyst</b> stage. <b>Microcyst</b> formation may occur from the spiral vegetative cell by: (1) fusion of two entwined organisms to form one or more microcysts; (2) the production of a protuberance at some point along the organism into which the entire organism is gradually absorbed; (3) the gradual shortening and rounding of the organism to form an oval to spherical body. <b>Microcyst</b> formation begins, in a typical broth culture, at c. 24 hr. after inoculation and the majority of the organisms are in the <b>microcyst</b> stage after a 4 -day incubation period. When microcysts from an old culture are inoculated into fresh media, they germinate to form the spiral vegetative organism. Germination occurs by either unipolar or bipolar emergence of the germ tube.

40|$|We have {{examined}} germination, protein synthesis and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis by microcysts of the fruiting myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus. The morphological aspects of <b>microcyst</b> formation were completed at about 2 hr after induction had begun. In such microcysts, germination, RNA synthesis, and protein synthesis were inhibited by actinomycin D (Act D). At 6 hr after induction, germination and protein synthesis had become relatively resistant to Act D, whereas RNA synthesis was inhibited by about 95 %. Experiments with 3 H-Act D {{indicated that the}} deoxyribonucleic acids of both young and old microcysts bind Act D equally. Resistance of germination to Act D was acquired 4 to 5 hr after induction of <b>microcyst</b> formation, and was due to an Act D-sensitive synthesis at that time.

Both microcysts and vegetative cells were found to contain grossly {{the same types of}} RNA in the same proportions. RNA pulse-labeled in microcysts was more stable than that in vegetative cells. No particular portions of the <b>microcyst</b> pulse-labeled RNA were selectively stabilized.

40|$|The {{induction}} of mycrocyst formation by methionine starvation {{was demonstrated}} in Myxococcus xanthus by several methods. Growing in a defined medium (M 1), M. xanthus had a doubling time of 6. 5 hr. Four amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, valine, and glycine—were required for growth under these conditions. When {{the concentration of}} several amino acids in the medium was reduced (M 2), the doubling time increased to 10 to 12 hr, and a requirement for methionine was observed. Methionine starvation led to a slow conversion of the population to microcysts. Under conditions of methionine prototrophy (M 1), <b>microcyst</b> formation could still be triggered in exponentially growing cells {{by the addition of}} either 5 mm ethionine or 0. 1 m isoleucine plus 0. 1 m threonine, feedback inhibitors of methionine biosynthesis. Vegetative growth in the absence of methionine was obtained in medium M 2 if the leucine concentration was raised to its level in medium M 1. Thus, methionine biosynthesis is controlled by the exogenous concentration of the required amino acid, leucine. During an examination of the effects of methionine metabolites on <b>microcyst</b> formation, the involvement of polyamines in morphogenesis was uncovered. Putrescine (0. 05 m) induced the formation of microcysts; spermidine (2 to 5 mm) inhibited induction by methionine starvation, ethionine, or high isoleucine-threonine. Spermidine was the only polyamine detected in M. xanthus (16. 0 μg/ 109 cells). Its concentration decreased by more than 50 % shortly after <b>microcyst</b> induction by high isoleucine-threonine. It is postulated that spermidine is an inhibitor of <b>microcyst</b> induction; when spermidine formation is blocked by methionine starvation, morphogenesis is induced...|$|E

40|$|Background: During {{biological}} development, {{the retina}} originates from {{central nervous system}} tissue and therefore offers an interesting opportunity to monitor inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes {{in the context of}} multiple sclerosis (MS). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a fast and non-invasive technique to investigate the retinal architecture. While previous studies could show axonal and neuronal damage in the retina of patients with and without a history of optic neuritis (ON), only scarce and in part conflicting data exist on different MS subtypes and the temporal course of retinal alterations. Macular <b>microcysts</b> located in the inner nuclear layer (INL) were described in a subset of MS patients and an association between INL thickening and disease progression was found. Various theories exist explaining the appearance of macular <b>microcysts</b> and the correlation between INL thickening and disease progression (i. e. vitreous traction), but only insufficient tests for validity of these theories were performed. Objective: To better characterize retinal alterations in patients with MS using high-resolution spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT). Methods: In the four studies presented here, patients with MS, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION) were investigated with SD-OCT. Mean retinal layer thicknesses and spatial thickness maps were applied to compare the different cohorts with each other and to healthy controls. Results: In a large multicentre study, we could show that patients with progressive MS subtypes exhibit more severe retinal neurodegeneration than relapsing-remitting MS patients. In contrast to previous works, intra-retinal layer segmentation was able to detect ganglion cell layer reduction in CIS patients {{even in the absence of}} previous ON events. A retrospective analysis showed that macular <b>microcysts</b> could be identified with high sensitivity and good specificity using fundus images. However, <b>microcysts</b> are not specific for MS but were strongly associated with a previous ON and also occurred in other diseases like NMO and CRION. Even without visible <b>microcysts,</b> the INL thickness increased after an ON. One case presented with dynamic changes of <b>microcysts,</b> which could not be explained by vitreous traction. Discussion: OCT is gradually being established as a marker for neurodegeneration in MS. New high-resolution SD-OCT technique and retinal layer segmentation further increase the sensitivity, and clinical studies using OCT derived primary and secondary outcome parameters are on-going or about to commence. Furthermore, OCT continues to be an interesting tool in MS research and is providing new insights in the pathomechanisms of MS...|$|R

The mic~~~ysts of Shigella spp. resemble those of Salmonella typhi. Bacterium aerogms produces large, spherical or oblong microcysts with a small, central nucleus. It has for long been bacteriological dogma that the members of the large group of Gram-negative, non-sporing bacteria are morphologically almost indis-tinguishable, apart from {{the presence or absence of}} flagella or capsules, and in some cases, the arrangement of flagella. While this is approximately true of the vegetative cell, the morphology of the resting cell, which in this family closely resembles the <b>microcyst</b> of myxobacteria (Bisset, 1949, 1950), appears to provide a criterion of considerable systematic value. It has already been observed that a striking difference exists between the <b>microcyst</b> of Bacterium coli and Bact. aerogenes, the latter being much larger. The present paper is intended to extend these observations and to indicate the degree to which they may be correlated with other criteria used in classification. three groups. METHODS AND MATERIALS In almost every case the bacteria examined were newly isolated. I consider that such delicate, morphological comparisons should not be made upon material which has been cultivated artificially for longer than is absolutely necessary. Where this ideal was difficult to achieve, as in the case of Salmonella typhi, observations made originally upon newly isolated strains were confirmed, as far as possible, upon stock cultures of the same species.

A tail about 100 mμ in length is {{encased in a}} contractile sheath and terminates in a tail plate. The head is polyhedral with a width of about 75 mμ. The nucleic acid of the bacteriophage is deoxyribonucleic acid and has a guanine plus cytosine content of 55. 5 %. The bacteriophage requires 10 − 3 m Ca++ and 10 − 2 m monovalent cation for optimal adsorption. Grown on vegetative cells of M. xanthus FBt at 30 C in 2 % Casitone medium, the bacteriophage has a latent period of 120 min and a burst size of approximately 100. Host range studies indicate that three strains of M. xanthus including a morphogenetic mutant {{are sensitive to the}} bacteriophage, whereas M. fulvus, Cytophaga, Sporocytophaga myxococcoides, and a fourth strain of M. xanthus are not. Of the two cellular forms characteristic of the Myxococcus life cycle, the bacteriophage infect only the vegetative cells; they do not adsorb to <b>microcysts.</b> Ability to adsorb bacteriophage is lost between 65 and 75 min after initiation of the relatively synchronous conversion of vegetative cells to <b>microcysts.</b> The bacteriophage does not adsorb to spheroplasts. After the appearance of visible morphogenesis and before the loss of bacteriophage receptor sites, addition of bacteriophage results in the formation of <b>microcysts</b> which give rise to infective centers only upon germination. The possibility that the infected <b>microcysts</b> are harboring intact bacteriophages has been eliminated...|$|R
5000|$|Epithelial {{oxygen uptake}} {{has been found}} to return to normal levels one month after {{cessation}} of contact lens wear. Epithelial thickness {{has been found to}} return to a normal level as soon as one week following the cessation of contact lens wear. However, endothelial polymegethism does not seem to return to normal levels even long after the cessation of contact lens wear. Even after a six-month period in which contact lenses are not worn, polymegethism seems to remain. Stromal thickness does not return to a normal level even after an entire month in which contact lens wear is halted. [...] The density of <b>microcysts</b> also remains as long as one month after contact lenses are removed, and <b>microcysts</b> do not disappear completely until two to three months after contact lens wear is completely halted.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in making a differential diagnosis of small (< or = 20 mm) polypoid lesions of the gallbladder. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Differential diagnosis of these lesions is often difficult using conventional imaging modalities. METHODS: The findings of EUS and transabdominal ultrasonography were retrospectively analyzed in 65 surgical cases of small polypoid lesions (cholesterol polyp in 40, adenomyomatosis in 9, adenoma in 4, and adenocarcinoma in 12). RESULTS: Polypoid lesions exceeding 10 mm suggested malignancy. EUS showed a tiny echogenic spot or an aggregation of echogenic spots with or without echopenic areas in 95 % of patients with cholesterol polyps. EUS showed multiple <b>microcysts</b> or comet tail artifact in all adenomyomatosis cases. Adenomas and adenocarcinomas were not associated with the echogenic spots, <b>microcysts,</b> or artifacts. Among adenomas and adenocarcinomas, all sessile lesions were adenocarcinomas. EUS differentiated among polypoid lesions more precisely than ultrasonography (97 % vs. 71 %). CONCLUSIONS: A tiny echogenic spot or an aggregation of echogenic spots and multiple <b>microcysts</b> or comet tail artifact is pathognomonic for cholesterol polyp and adenomyomatosis, respectively. Polypoid lesions without these findings indicate adenoma or adenocarcinoma on EUS. Routine use of EUS is recommended for differential diagnosis of polypoid gallbladder lesions when ultrasonography shows no signs indicative of either cholesterol polyp or adenomyomatosis...|$|R
