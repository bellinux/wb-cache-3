40|$|The De la Cruz-Badiano Codex is a herbal {{medicine}} treatise, {{written in the}} year 1552 in the School for Indians of Santiago Tlatelolco, in the early Colonial period. The conception of the book combines both the European and Mexica cosmovision: it contains the descriptions and diagnosis of different illnesses, with the cures, recipes based {{in the use of}} Mexican flora, fauna and minerals. The study of the Badiano Codex by means of Infrared reflectography, Ultraviolet imaging as well as non destructive in situ analytical techniques such as X-ray Fluorescence spectroscopy has given important information regarding the book´s materials and construction: the manuscript was written on Italian paper, different inks were used; the inscriptions are <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> gall ink for the general body of the text, a combination <b>of</b> <b>minium,</b> <b>iron</b> gall ink and a red colorant for the red titles. The margins of the book were done with <b>minium,</b> the depictions <b>of</b> plants, fauna and minerals were made with dyes and some inorganic pigments. This book is an example of early Mexican society; it was done only thirty three years after the Spaniards landed to American soil. The mixture of the local and foreign traditions, material and technological knowledge contained in this small object condense the richness and complexity of the conquest. Further comparative analyses of material standards using native colorants created for this purpose enables us to present a methodological protocol for the study and interpretation of these cultural objects.

50|$|There was (and is) {{considerable}} confusion {{among the}} names of ancient and medieval pigments. As noted above, the term minium was used for cinnabar, vermilion, and for red lead. <b>Minium</b> <b>of</b> red lead was sometimes called stupium in classical Latin, adding to the confusion.|$|R

50|$|During the Roman Empire, {{the term}} minium could refer {{either to the}} pigment made from ground {{cinnabar}} or to the less expensive red lead. The name came from the river Minius in Iberia (now forming part of the Spanish-Portuguese border and known as Miño or Minho), located near the main Roman cinnabar mines. Pliny the Elder {{referred to it as}} flammeus, or flame color. The <b>minium</b> <b>of</b> red lead was easy to make and less expensive than the pigment made from the mineral cinnabar, and it was bright and cheerful, so it became the most commonly used bright red in Medieval painting until the introduction of vermilion.|$|R

40|$|Most {{diagrams}} communicate effectively {{despite the}} fact that diagrams as a group have a <b>minium</b> <b>of</b> conventions and a high tolerance for novelty. This paper proposes that the diversity and felicity of diagrammatic representation is based on three kinds of similarity between semantic propositions and spatial representations that allow people to interpret diagrams consistently with a minimum of effort and training. Iconicity is similarity of physical appearance, polarity is similarity in the positive and negative structure of dimensions, and relational similarity aligns structures so that elements correspond to elements, relations correspond to relations, and so on. In diagrammatic reasoning detected similarities are used to create correspondences between the visual characteristics of a diagram and its semantic meaning, and those correspondences are in turn used to make inferences about unknown or underspecified meanings...|$|R

40|$|Background: Iron {{poisoning}} is a {{major cause}} of unin-tentional poisoning death in young children. TheUSFood andDrugAdministration proclaimed a regulation for unit-dose packaging <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> supplements in 1997. Objective: To determine whether the requirement for unit-dose packaging <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> supplements decreases the incidence <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> ingestion and the incidence of deaths due to iron poisoning in children younger than 6 years. Methods: This is a preintervention-postintervention study of the US federally mandated requirement for unit-dose packaging <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> supplements. The 10 years prior to the intervention were compared with the 5 years after its promulgation.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} platelet sonicates and mediators secreted by unstimulated and thrombin-stimulated platelets to facilitate the release <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> from transferrin. Platelet sonicates and platelet conditioned media potentiated the release <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> from transferrin. The rate <b>of</b> release <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> was dependent on the pH of the reaction and amount of platelet sample added. Conditioned media from thrombin-stimulated platelets was more effective in mediating the release <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> from transferrin than was conditioned media from unstimulated cells. The rate <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> released from transferrin following addition of ATP and ADP in amounts equivalent to that present in platelet conditioned media was significantly less than the rate <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> released following the addition of conditioned media from platelets. Depletion of ATP and ADP in platelet conditioned media by incubation with apyrase only partially inhibited their ability to enhance the rate <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> release from transferrin. These observations indicate that platelets enhance the release <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> from transferrin by adenine nucleotide-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These observations {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that platelets promote oxidant-induced tissue injury at sights of inflammation secondary to their ability to enhance the local release <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> from transferrin...|$|R

40|$|Excessive {{deposition}} <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> in tissues {{depends on}} either excessive absorption <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> or redistribution <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> within the body, {{since there is}} but little excretion <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> in animals or man. In dogs Hahn et al. (1) have demonstrated that only small amounts of injected radioiron are found in urine and stools. In man, {{a fraction of a}} milligram <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> is excreted daily and this amount cannot be increased by injections <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> (2) or by multiple transfusions (3). Attention in this study has been directed toward excesseive absorption <b>of</b> <b>iron.</b> The histological pattern <b>of</b> absorbed <b>iron</b> is described and its similarity to conditions <b>of</b> excessive <b>iron</b> absorption in human beings is discussed.
