50|$|In many cases, {{particularly}} {{countries in}} which voluntary euthanasia is illegal, physicians must exercise <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> by not respecting patients' wishes to die. There are contrasting views on whether this constitutes weak or strong paternalism. One argument is that weak paternalism allows the physician to stay completely hands-off. If the patient is in a sound state of mind and the doctor can reasonably guess what they desire, {{so there is no}} need for further action. They do not need to keep the patient alive, nor do they need to allow the patient to die. In this sense, one could argue that weak <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> has no contradictions with allowing a patient to undergo voluntary euthanasia.|$|E

This debate captures the tension between medicine's emphasis on protecting the autonomy of the patient and an approach that favors intervention in order to correct biases.|$|E

Paternalism is opposed by the liberal tradition, at least when it targets sufficiently voluntary behavior.

40|$|Over {{the past}} {{third of a}} century, {{there has been a}} {{revolution}} in the way that health-care providers and patients make most <b>medical</b> decisions. <b>Paternalism</b> has slowly gone the way of the long-play record, and in its place has emerged a consent process in which the patient is a more fully informed and active participant. This process takes time however, and for the busy health-care provider there is often the temptation to hand the patient a consent form to sign. It is important to realize that signing a consent form does not constitute informed consent. True informed consent is a process, and, as such, it requires that the health-care provider enter into a discussion that ultimately leads to the patient understanding of their options, and the risks and benefits of the alternative courses of action. The purpose of this article was to describe, in some detail, the consent process in practical clinical terms, and to note when and how it should be obtained.

50|$|Robert S.

He portrayed doctors as powerful priests of a primitive religion, with dishonesty as its central ethic. His mild manner appealed to the public, while his message infuriated his medical colleagues.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> {{is a set}} {{of attitudes}} and {{practices}} in medicine in which a physician determines that a patient's wishes or choices should not be honored. These practices which were current up to the early to mid 20th century, and were characterised by a paternalistic attitude, surrogate decision-making and a lack of respect for patient autonomy. It is almost exclusively undertaken with the intention of benefiting the patient, although this is not always the case. In the past, paternalism was considered an absolute medical necessecity, as there was little to no public understanding of medical procedures and practices. However, in recent years, paternalism has become limited and blind faith in doctors' decisions has come to be frowned upon.|$|E
5000|$|Non-voluntary {{euthanasia}} {{has been}} heavily debated. For example, Len Doyal, a professor of medical ethics and {{former member of the}} ethics committee of the British Medical Association, argued for legalization, saying in 2006 that [...] "proponents of voluntary euthanasia should support non-voluntary euthanasia under appropriate circumstances and with proper regulation". Arguing against legalization, Peter Saunders, campaign director for Care Not Killing, an alliance of Christian and disability groups, called Doyal's proposals [...] "the very worst form of <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> whereby doctors can end the lives of patients after making a judgment that their lives are of no value and claim that they are simply acting in their patients' best interests".|$|E
50|$|In the 18th century, <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> was {{considered}} necessary. It {{was believed that}} only a doctor could properly understand symptoms and draw useful conclusions. During this period, the prevailing consensus was that disease {{was nothing more than}} symptoms. This meant that the individual history of the patient didn't matter in providing care, so the patient him or herself was irrelevant in the medical encounter. Thus it was deemed necessary that physicians make decisions for patients. This view of paternalism was only encouraged by the rise of hospitals in the later 18th century. Because patients in hospitals were often sick and disabled, the view of them as passive recipients of medical care only became more prevalent.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between strong <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> and euthanasia is slightly more complicated. There are questions of a philosophical nature {{that must be}} addressed. For example, a strong paternalist would have {{to determine whether it}} is always objectively bad for a human to die, even if that human could prove that it was their desire to do so. In these cases, a physician may defer to morality or religion {{in order to make a}} decision. They would perhaps present the argument that even if a person wished to die, it would be an irrational desire and they should not indulge it. However, in the absence of these factors, it is possible for strong paternalism to be compatible with voluntary euthanasia. This would require the patient to make it clear that he or she would not be losing anything of value to them by dying, i.e. fundamentally disconnecting life from goodness. For example, if a patient learns that he or she would be in constant pain for the rest of his or her life, it is not irrational to honor their wishes to die. In these cases, some argue, even a strong paternalism does not justify prolonging the patient's life, because the physicians actions would not truly be for the patient's own good.|$|E
5000|$|Much of the {{potential}} for change from Health 2.0 is facilitated by combining technology driven trends such as Personal Health Records with social networking —"which may lead to a powerful new generation of health applications, where people share parts of their electronic health records with other consumers and 'crowdsource' the collective wisdom of other patients and professionals." [...] Traditional models of medicine had patient records (held on paper or a proprietary computer system) that could only be accessed by a physician or other medical professional. Physicians acted as gatekeepers to this information, telling patients test results when and if they deemed it necessary. Such a model operates relatively well in situations such as acute care, where information about specific blood results would be of little use to a lay person, or in general practice where results were generally benign. However, in the case of complex chronic diseases, psychiatric disorders, or diseases of unknown etiology patients were at risk of being left without well-coordinated care because data about them was stored in a variety of disparate places and in some cases might contain the opinions of healthcare professionals which were not to be shared with the patient. Increasingly, medical ethics deems such actions to be <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism,</b> and they are discouraged in modern medicine.|$|E

40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> {{has been}} criticised for its denial of {{patients}} ' rights. Though defended {{on grounds of}} patient welfare, {{it can also be}} detrimental to that interest. English law has predominantly endorsed <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism,</b> and the criticism of this stance has centered on patients ' rights. But within established legal categories there is very little scope for analysis based on the rights of patients, the assertion of which may, in any event, not be conducive to the maximisation of their welfare. This article is primarily concerned with cases arising from the hospital setting, the source of most medical liti-gation. Its purpose is to argue that an approach grounded in the doctor's responsibility for the patient's welfare, but which affords due respect for pa-tients ' rights, accords with legal principle.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the moral justification of <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism.</b> It is shown {{that while there}} are sufficient grounds to justify the practice of <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> in some instances, there are many instances of the practice which cannot be justified. The application of the utilitarian principle of paternalism is considered in detail. It is argued that the physician can justifiably apply the principle in a particular case only after he has determined both {{that there are no}} alternate non-paternalistic courses of action which will have the same results and that he is in the same privileged positions with respect to any relevant non-medical considerations as he is in with respect to medical considerations. The moral constraints on paternalistic action flowing from the concept of personal autonomy are also examined. It is concluded that <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> is justified only when utilitarian considerations apply and when they do not violate personal rights. This occurs only when the subject of paternalism is not fully competent, when he has explicitly or by implication given consent, or when it can be reasonably concluded, from the knowledge of his emotional and cognitive make up, that he would approve of such treatment. For the most part, only the physician with a more intimate knowledge of his patient than is possible in most modern medical practice is in the position to undertake <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> with moral propriety. ...|$|E
40|$|All illness {{represents}} {{a state of}} diminished autonomy and therefore the doctor-patient relationship necessarily and justifiably involves a degree of <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> argues the author, an American medical student. In a broad-ranging paper he discusses the concepts of autonomy and paternalism {{in the context of}} the doctor-patient relationship. Given the necessary diminution of autonomy which illness inflicts, a limited form of <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism,</b> aimed at restoring or maximising the patient's autonomy is entirely acceptable, and indeed fundamental to the relationship he argues. However, the exercise of this paternalism should be flexible and related to the current 'level of autonomy' of the patient himself. An editorial in this issue comments briefly on this paper...|$|E
40|$|Respect for {{autonomy}} {{has become the}} guiding principle {{at the forefront of}} health-care decision-making. In an attempt to preserve this principle, patients can be neglected to make decisions for themselves during times when they cannot make fully capable decisions. Under certain circumstances, it is necessary to have others assist a patient in making decisions that may {{have a significant impact on}} the patient’s life and, will ultimately, respect the patient's prior expressed capable wishes and values.

It provides traditional, contemporary and psychological arguments in support of respect for autonomy. Several key arguments in favor of <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> are also presented on the grounds of the loss of personal identity, a social insurance policy and the abandonment of vulnerable patients. Furthermore, the difficulties involved in both accounts are also discussed with respect to the idealization of autonomy and the potential abuses involved in <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism.</b> This thesis concludes through drawing upon the notion of an authentic self as applied to this discussion, allowing for a compatible defense of these two traditionally competing theories...|$|E

40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> is {{a common}} {{practice}} in Pakistan, it can be justified {{on the principles of}} beneficence and non-maleficence in certain clinical situations but in the research medicine it can pose many ethical implications. Islam is a communitarian religion but it provides full autonomy to the competent individuals. Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PM&DC) codes of ethics have been formulated in line with the World Medical Association and it also states in its preamble that it follows Islamic bioethical laws. The PM&DC guidelines do not provide substantial system for obtaining consent from patients and the research participants. Neither does it comply with the Islamic bioethical laws nor with the International Declarations.

40|$|In this paper, by {{applying}} a feminist bioethical perspective, we identify {{a new form}} of <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> that still shapes contemporary legal policies on human egg cryopreservation performed without medical reasons. The fear of negligent, careless women who opt to delay their pregnancy for mere convenience is a widely known gender biased stereotype. Nevertheless, the opinions and judgments of medical professionals on this issue have not yet been sufficiently explored by in-depth research. In this essay, therefore, first we look at the broader bioethical, legal, and social aspects of human egg cryopreservation. In {{the second part of the}} paper we discuss a unique qualitative study conducted with professionals working at Hungarian IVF clinics. We argue, based on a bioethical analysis of the collected data, that when new reproduction technologies provide opportunities for women to widen their range of reproductive choices, the traditional forms of <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> can be reinforced by gendered paternalism, as well. We identify several elements of gendered paternalism that characterized the attitudes of the IVF staff and discuss the professionals’ resistance to elective egg freezing and vitrification of eggs for the future (EVF). We conclude by suggesting directions for future policy. Although we focus on the Hungarian case in this paper, we are aware that similar attitudes can be observed in some other countries where this technology has become available and requested by women, but where they also face difficulties in their access to it...|$|E

30|$|Introduction Far from <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism,</b> the doctor-patient {{relationship}} has now evolved to respect “the autonomy and patients’ rights”. Changing behavior has been gradual, while the law offered the patient {{the freedom to}} consent to care and then of expressing their wishes regarding the therapeutic intensity they would benefit, in critical situations where consent would not be possible, through advance directives (AD) [1]. Their use is of paramount interest for intensivist in many critical situations. Unfortunately, the use of AD remains marginal because of the unfamiliarity of patients with their use and an appropriation default by clinicians [2]. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the perspective of the coming family physician generation on advances directives.|$|E
40|$|The {{contention}} thatpaternalism can be modernised {{in such a}} way as {{to avoid}} the usual criticisms is examined and dismissed. The alleged 'modernisation ' consists simply in going through the motions ofachieving the patients free consent, while leaving the ultimate decision to the physician. Paternalism in thisform is no better than the more old-fashioned variety, since it still takes away from patients the fundamental human right to make decisions about their own fate. In his article, Paternalism modernised, in the December 1985 issue of this journal (1), Professor Gary B Weiss argues that critics of <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> base their objections on an outmoded conception of what the practice of paternalism involves.

30|$|In 1957, <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> was commonplace and {{generally}} accepted {{as exemplified by}} Bolam [21]. In 1984, the Sidaway judgment argued by Lord Scarman held the belief {{that it was a}} doctor’s duty to inform a patient fully about a specific procedure [22]. Indeed this judgment was strengthened by the subsequent cases of Bolitho (1997) and Pearce (1999). The courts concluded that a doctor should tell a patient about any significant risk which would affect the judgment of a reasonable patient. Indeed even in very rare complications that may be particular to a specific patient, it is expected that the doctor should inform the patient of any complication that he feels may be appropriate to that patient, however small it may be [23].|$|E
40|$|Medical {{practitioners}} {{are beginning to}} realise that conflict between <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> and patient autonomy would arise {{if they continue to}} uphold this dualism as distinct in all circumstances of medical practice.

The rationale behind the doctrine of informed consent is primarily to uphold patient autonomy and self determination without coercion.

40|$|Background. A {{shift away}} from the <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> of the past has occurred, and today, the law and ethics {{advocate}} that physicians share decision-making responsibility with their patients. It is unclear, however, what the appropriate role of physicians ’ recommendations {{ought to be in}} this new shared decision-making paradigm. One way to approach this question is to assess the influence of physicians ’ recommen-dations. Objective. In this study, the authors examine the in-fluence of physicians ’ recommendations on hypothetical treatment decisions.

Do recommendations pull subjects away from the treatment choice that they otherwise prefer (based on their decision when unaware of the physicians ’ recommendation) ? Design...|$|E
40|$|Background: Libertarian {{paternalism}} is {{a concept}} derived from cognitive psychology and behavioural science. It is behind policies that frame information {{in such a way}} as to encourage individuals to make choices which are in their best interests, while maintaining their freedom of choice. Clinicians may view their clinical consultations as far removed from the realms of cognitive psychology but on closer examination there are a number of striking similarities. Discussion. Evidence has shown that decision making is prone to bias and not necessarily rational or logical, particularly during ill health. Clinicians will usually have an opinion about what course of action represents the patient's best interests and thus may "frame" information in a way which "nudges" patients into making choices which are considered likely to maximise their welfare. This may be viewed as interfering with patient autonomy and constitute <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> and appear in direct opposition to the tenets of modern practice. However, we argue that clinicians have a responsibility to try and correct "reasoning failure" in patients. Some compromise between patient autonomy and <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> is justified on these grounds and transparency of how these techniques may be used should be promoted. Summary. Overall the extremes of autonomy and paternalism are not compatible in a responsive, responsible and moral health care environment, and thus some compromise of these values is unavoidable. Nudge techniques are widely used in policy making and we demonstrate how they can be applied in shared medical decision making. Whether or not this is ethically sound is a matter of continued debate but health care professionals cannot avoid the fact they are likely to be using nudge within clinical consultations. Acknowledgment of this will lead to greater self-awareness, reflection and provide further avenues for debate on the art and science of clinical communication...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – That {{people should}} only be {{enrolled}} in medical research if they have given free and informed consent is now an unquestioned principle of research ethics. It is however a recent innovation. Prior to the prominence given to consent to participation in research in the condemnation of German doctors arraigned at Nuremberg in 1945, informed consent had appeared in American litigation, but only as an issue in clinical malpractice suits. Informed consent as an ethical requirement in medical research had arisen in some earlier European contexts. Despite the Nuremberg judgement, informed consent by participants in research was not widely recognised as ethically mandatory until the early 1970 s. This delay {{seems to have been}} due in part to scepticism about the practi-cability of truly informed consent, but <b>medical</b> <b>paternalism</b> and the circumstances surrounding military research during the Cold War period may have contributed...|$|E
