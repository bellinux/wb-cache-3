High temperature waste heat, from slagging entrained flow coal gasifier, can be recovered effectively {{in a series}} of radiant and convection waste heat boilers. <b>Medium</b> <b>level</b> <b>waste</b> heat leaving fixed bed type gasifiers can be recovered more economically by convection type boilers or shell and tube heat exchangers. An economic analysis for the steam generation and process heat exchanger is presented. Steam generated from the waste heat boiler is used to drive steam turbines for power generation or air compressors for the oxygen plant. Low level heat recovered by process heat exchangers is used to heat product gas or support the energy requirement of the gasification plant. The mechanical design for pressure vessel shell and boiler tubes is discussed.

40|$|In the Netherlands {{the policy}} to manage {{radioactive}} waste is somewhat {{different from that}} in other countries, although the practical outcome is not much different. Long-term, i. e. at least 100 years, storage in above ground engineered structures of all waste types is the first element in the Dutch policy. Second element, but equally important, is that deep geologic disposal is foreseen after the storage period. This policy was brought out {{in the early eighties}} and was communicated to the public as a practical, logical and feasible management system for the Dutch situation. Strong opposition existed at that time to deep disposal in salt domes in the Netherlands. Above ground storage at principle was not rejected because the need to do something was obvious. Volunteers for a long term storage site did not automatically emerge. A site selection procedure was followed and resulted in the present site at Vlissingen-Oost. The waste management organization, COVRA, was not really welcomed here, but was tolerated. In the nineties facilities for low and <b>medium</b> <b>level</b> <b>waste</b> were erected and commissioned. In the design of the facilities much attention was given to emotional factors. The first ten operational years were needed to gain trust from the local population. Impeccable conduct and behavior was necessary as well as honesty and full openness to the public Now, after some ten years, the COVRA facilities are accepted. And a new phase is entered with the commissioning of the storage facility for high level waste, the HABOG facility. A visit to that facility will not be very spectacular, activities take place only during loading and unloading. Furthermore it is a facility for waste, so unwanted material will be brought into the community. In order to give the public something more interesting the building itself is transformed into a piece of art and in the inside a special work of art will be displayed. Together with that the attitude of the company will change. We are proud on our work and we like to show that. Our work is necessary and useful for society.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of facilities and structures for the processing and safe long-term storage of low- and high-level radioactive wastes will likely employ structural concrete.

The direct disposal costs of these alternatives are considered and it is shown that burial in an existing, but presently disused, burial ground at Little Forest, near Lucas Heights, {{is by far the}} cheapest. The environmental impact of re-using this burial ground is assessed in Part 2.

40|$|The surtax in Sweden, which {{exclusively}} applies {{for nuclear}} power plants, {{in conjunction with}} low electricity prices, has forced Swedish nuclear power plants to minimize their expenses. At Oskarshamn power plant, estimation of cost, associated with low-level nuclear waste management has been conducted several years ago, but with lacking knowledge about how the calculations were performed. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} project was to establish an independent cost estimation for compactible and non-compactible, low <b>level</b> and <b>medium</b> <b>level</b> nuclear <b>waste.</b> Cost estimates for free released low-level nuclear waste was also performed. By analyzing average economic figures from year 2014 - 2015 and visits on-site, an excel-based calculation template was accomplished. During the on-site studies, several visits to the low-level nuclear waste management facilities at Oskarshamn power plant were made, in order to get an overview of how the handling process works. By following the staff around, it was possible to estimate some of the time durations for the different parts in the handling process for compactible lowlevel nuclear waste, that were used in the calculations. The price for compactible low-level nuclear waste was calculated to 6, 72 - 6, 97 kr/kg, depending on the activity level. The non-compactible low-level nuclear waste price was found to vary between 4 – 48 kr/kg. The large fluctuations are due to different activity levels and associated additional costs in handling, measuring, final deposition etc. For both compactible and non-compactible nuclear waste, the storage cost is a factor that dominates the total cost and that could be minimized. Based on the analysis presented in this work, the cost can be decreased by reducing the storage time and/or store the nuclear waste in a more space efficient way. The cost estimate for free released material is low (5, 94 – 8, 74 kr/kg), which concludes that Oskarshamn power plant may profit from free releasing as much material as possible, {{due to the fact that}} it is highly profitable to recycle metals...|$|R

40|$|After the {{completion}} of detailed studies of the suitability the twin-mine Bartensleben-Marie, situated in the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt (Germany), was chosen in 1970 for the disposal of low and <b>medium</b> <b>level</b> radioactive <b>waste.</b> The waste emplacement started in 1978 in rock cavities at the mine's fourth level, some 500 m below the surface. Until {{the end of the}} operational phase in 1998 in total about 36, 800 m{sup 3 } of radioactive waste was disposed of. The Morsleben LLW/ILW repository (ERAM) is now under licensing for closure. After completing the licensing procedure the repository will be sealed and backfilled to exclude any undue future impact onto man or the environment. The main safety objective is to protect the biosphere from the harmful effects of the disposed radionuclides. Furthermore, classical or conventional requirements call for ruling out or minimizing other unfavorable environmental effects. The ERAM is an abandoned rock salt and potash mine. As a consequence it has a big void volume, however small parts of the cavities are backfilled with crushed salt rocks. Other goals of the closure concept are therefore a long-term stabilization of the cavities to prevent a dipping or buckling of the ground surface. In addition, groundwater protection shall be assured. For the sealing of the repository a closure concept was developed to ensure compliance with the safety protection objectives. The concept anticipates the backfilling of the cavities with hydraulically setting backfill materials (salt concretes). The reduction of the remaining void volume in the mine causes in the case of brine intrusions a limitation of the leaching processes of the exposed potash seams. However, during the setting process the hydration heat of the concrete will lead to an increase of the temperature and hence to thermally induced stresses of the concrete and the surrounding rocks. Therefore, the influence of these stresses and deformations on the stability of the salt body and the integrity of the geological barrier was examined by 2 D and 3 D thermo-mechanical computations. The compliance of the safety objectives are proved on the basis of safety evidence criteria. It can be concluded that the closure concept is able to serve all conventional and radiological safety objectives...|$|R

Data was compiled for these four generators from 1988 to the present for analyses. Prior waste minimization efforts have focused on identifying waste stream processes and performing source materials substitutions or reductions where applicable. In this historical survey, the generators surveyed included an accelerator facility, the plutonium facility, a chemistry and metallurgy research facility, and a radiochemistry research facility. Of particular interest in waste minimization efforts was the composition of suspect low <b>level</b> <b>waste</b> in which no radioactivity is detected through initial survey. Ultimately, this waste is disposed of in the LANL low <b>level</b> permitted <b>waste</b> disposal pits (thus filling a scarce and expensive resource with sanitary waste). Detailed analyses of the waste streams from these 4 facilities, have revealed that suspect low <b>level</b> <b>waste</b> comprises approximately 50 % of the low <b>level</b> <b>waste</b> by volume and 47 % by weight.
