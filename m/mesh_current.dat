(Civil Engineering) This study {{presents}} work on {{the design}} and construction of three dual-chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) using a sandwich separator electrode assembly (SSEA) and membrane cathode assembly (MCA) for the dual purposes of energy generation from domestic wastewater and wastewater treatment. MFC 1 was designed using an improvised SSEA technique (i. e. a separator electrode membrane electrode configuration, SEMEC) by gluing a sandwich of anode, membrane and a <b>mesh</b> <b>current</b> collector cathode to an anode chamber made from a polyethylene wide-mouth bottle. The reactor was filled with 1500 mL of domestic wastewater and operated on a long fed-batch mode with a residence time of 3 weeks.

This cathode construction avoided the need for carbon cloth or a metal catalyst, and produced a cathode with high activity for oxygen reduction at typical MFC current densities. Tests with the AC cathode produced a maximum power density of 1220 mW/m 2 (normalized to cathode projected surface area; 36 W/m 3 based on liquid volume) compared to 1060 mW/m 2 obtained by Pt catalyzed carbon cloth cathode. The Coulombic efficiency ranged from 15 % to 55 %. These findings show that AC is a cost-effective material for achieving useful rates of oxygen reduction in air cathode MFCs. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.
