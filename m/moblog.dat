A blog written by a mobile device like a mobile phone or PDA could be called a <b>moblog.</b> One early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's {{personal}} life combining text, video, and pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site.

2500|$|Blogging {{has brought}} about new ways of writing diaries and from a {{linguistic}} perspective, the language used in blogs is [...] "in its most 'naked' form", published {{for the world to}} see without undergoing the formal editing process. This is what makes blogs stand out because almost all other forms of printed language have gone through some form of editing and standardization. David Crystal stated that blogs were [...] "the beginning of a new stage {{in the evolution of the}} written language". Blogs have become so popular that they have expanded beyond written blogs, with the emergence of photoblog, videoblog, audioblog and <b>moblog.</b> These developments in interactive blogging have created new linguistic conventions and styles, with more expected to arise in the future.|$|E

40|$|Mobile blog or “moblog ” {{provides}} a coherent purpose for strategic educational change through lifelong {{education and the}} creation of a knowledge society. Many studies have been conducted on using conventional blogs in teaching and learning yet only few have focused on <b>moblogs.</b> <b>Moblogs</b> allow trainers to empower themselves through the acquisition of both explicit and tacit knowledge. Thus, this study aims at designing, developing and implementing <b>moblogs</b> as a platform for a new hybrid e-training approach, which was tested to generate a two-stage model for meaningful hybrid e-training. The data were collected from 213 Information Communication Technology (ICT) trainees which were subsequently tested using confirmatory factor analysis with AMOS 7. 0 to obtain the best-fit measurement model for an integrated meaningful hybrid e-training model using <b>moblogs.</b> The results revealed that: (i) hybrid e-training influenced the achievement of meaningful e-training; (ii) learning styles influenced the acceptance of hybrid e-training; and (iii) learning styles preferences influenced the achievement of meaningful e-training...|$|R

We then document some features of how technology affords “reflexive encounters” through the description of a blogging study involving smokers trying to quit, describing important connections between mobilities – physical, object, and communicative mobility. Finally, we present some challenges for new blogging technologies, their relevance to social encounters, and possible future directions through considering the mobile self; the new digital life document; and digital content sharing practices...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{precursors}} to a [...] "moblog" [...] was {{the development of}} a wearable photographic device by Steve Mann of the University of Toronto. Termed [...] "domewear," [...] the intention was for human rights workers to wear the devices to take photographic and video evidence of dangerous situations while avoiding being targeted for using traditional cameras. The first recorded example of <b>moblogging</b> was on 1995 February 22, when Steve Mann posted text from his wearable mobile computer to his weblog server, together with video (image sequence). The term <b>moblogging,</b> however, wasn't coined until 2002, by Adam Greenfield. Mobile devices have expanded beyond basic communication and now these devices can support multimedia creation tools.|$|R

40|$|What {{does the}} {{everyday}} look like? Some {{answers to this}} question can be found when looking at <b>moblogs</b> on the Internet, where anyone with a mobile phone camera can post their freshly taken pictures. Here we find photographs of meals, road repairs, toddlers, visits to the laundry room, holiday outings and new hairstyles in a proper mishmash. It would even be {{hard to imagine a}} motif that would fall outside the boundaries of the everyday. Questions that come to mind when watching these image databases are: Is the everyday necessarily something harmless? Are recurring events more everyday than unique ones? Does the everyday have to be presented in an everyday manner, or are extravagant photographs of the everyday conceivable? These questions are addressed with examples taken from various <b>moblogs.</b> The Everyday Seen Through a Camera Phone In 2006, the Göteborg Opera launched a campaign to sell season tickets.

40|$|The {{availability}} of smart portable telephones, equipped with cameras and microphones, enables portable phone users to capture fragments of audio and video, taken directly from their daily lives. Thus, {{a new generation}} of mobile blogs, termed “moBlogs”, is emerging. Conceptually similar to textual Web logs, <b>moBlogs</b> collect text, images, audio and video, captured by mobile devices, and make them available on-line. In addition, the {{availability of}} different connectivity options on board the same portable phone (from Bluetooth, through 2. 5 / 3 G to WLAN) can improve the ability of the phone users to browse and update the <b>moBlogs</b> of interest to them. Within this scenario, in order to simplify the development of mobile applications for smart portable phones, and to enhance their reusability, it is necessary to provide those applications with appropriate communication support that shields them from the heterogeneities of the multiple connectivity options mentioned above.

50|$|Mobile {{blogging}} is {{a method}} of publishing to a website or blog from a mobile phone or other handheld device. A <b>moblog</b> helps habitual bloggers to post write-ups directly from their phones even when on the move.Mobile blogging has been made possible by technological convergence, as bloggers {{have been able to}} write, record and upload different media all from a single, mobile device. At the height of its growth in 2006, mobile blogging experienced 70,000 blog creations a day and 29,100 blog posts an hour. Between 2006 and 2010, blogging among teens declined from 28% to 14%, while blogging among adults over 30 increased from 7% to 11%.

40|$|Mobile {{technology}} is affecting {{the way we}} learn and teach in higher education. An interesting mobile tool for supporting learning and instruction is by using mobile blogs or “moblogs”. This review focuses on existing studies implementing moblogs for learning purposes in higher educational settings. A total of 16 studies were selected for the review. The constant-comparative method was {{used to analyze the}} studies. Results from the data analysis indicate that the findings fall into two overarching groups, which are: (i) usage of moblogs; and (ii) perceived effects of moblogs. Seven categories for <b>moblog</b> usage were identified, namely: (i) moblogs were used for context-sensitive learning; (ii) for collaboration in groups; (iii) as a tool for interaction and communication for learning; (iv) as personal learning diaries; (v) to facilitate learning at students ’ own time and pace; (vi) as a tool for feedback on instruction; and (vii) for reflections in learning. Meanwhile, three categories were discovered for perceived effects of moblogs, which are: (i) perceived affective effects in terms of satisfaction and attitude; (ii) perceived social effects on students; and (iii) negative perception of <b>moblog</b> in terms of personal and technical factors. These categories are discussed as factors that could promote the use of moblogs for learning in higher education.
