50|$|An {{alternative}} to Hall effect sensors with gears are sensors or encoders which use magnetoresistance. Because the target wheel is an active, multipole magnet, air gaps {{can be even}} larger, up to 4.0 mm. Because <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>sensors</b> are angle-sensitive and amplitude-insensitive, signal quality is increased over Hall sensors in fluctuating gap applications. Also the signal quality is much higher, enabling interpolation within the sensor/encoder or by an external circuit.|$|E
50|$|Customers often want {{a higher}} number of pulses per {{revolution}} than can be achieved in the space available and with the smallest module m = 1. To achieve this goal, sensors are available which offer interpolation. These offer output of 2-64X the original number of gear teeth or magnetic poles on the target wheel. Accuracy {{is dependent on the}} quality of sensor input: Hall sensors are lower cost, but lower accuracy, <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>sensors</b> are higher cost, but higher accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Such Hall effect sensor {{applications}} {{may benefit from}} built-in bearings, which can tolerate an air gap many orders of magnitude smaller because of the greatly reduced play on the actual sensor as opposed {{to that of the}} motor bearing. This makes it possible to choose a much smaller pitch for the measuring scale, right down to module m = 0.22. Likewise, the <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>sensors</b> offer even higher resolution and accuracy than Hall sensors when implemented in motor encoders with integrated bearings.|$|E

In order to improve the efficiency of <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>sensor,</b> we synthesized La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 polycrystalline bulks at different sintering temperatures and investigated their DC and AC transport properties in this work. As a result, all samples showed insulator–metal (I–M) phase transition, and the transition temperature (TI–M) shifted to higher temperature {{with the increase of}} sintering temperature. The TI–M measured at different AC frequencies was smaller than that measured at DC condition, which implied that the I–M phase transition was suppressed at AC frequencies. The resistivity measured at high AC frequencies was larger than that measured at low AC frequencies, which could be attributed to the change of the magnetic penetration depth (δ). However, the room-temperature AC-magnetoresistance (MR) at low frequencies was much larger than that at high frequencies and room-temperature DC-MR. These findings demonstrate that reducing the AC frequency is an effective way for enhancing the room-temperature MR, which can be used to promote the efficiency of <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|R

The introduction section contains a brief review of some of the current methods of bioassay readout. The theoretical underpinnings of the giant magnetoresistive effect are also discussed. Finally, the more prominent types of giant <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>sensors</b> are described, as well as their complicated fabrication. Four data chapters follow the introduction; each chapter is presented as a separate manuscript, either already published or soon to be submitted.

The testing of this methodology involved the capture of goat a-mouse-coated magnetic nanoparticles on the mouse IgG-modified gold surface. The second, third and fourth chapters describe the utilization of a self-referenced sample stick for scanning across the GMR sensor. The sample stick consisted of alternating magnetic reference and bioactive gold addresses. Chapter 2 is concerned with the characterization of both the scanning readout method and the binding and detection of streptavidin-coated magnetic particles to a biotinylated surface.
