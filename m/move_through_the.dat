5|$|July 8, 2005- The extratropical {{remnants}} of Hurricane Cindy <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> state, producing heavy rainfall {{of up to}} 4.55inches (116mm) in Delmar. The combination of rain and 20 to 30mph (32 to 48km/h) wind gusts down a few weak trees, leaving around 100 without power in New Castle County.|$|E

5|$|The Holliday {{junctions}} in {{homologous recombination}} are between identical or nearly identical sequences, {{leading to a}} symmetric arrangement of sequences around the central junction. This allows a branch migration process to occur where the strands <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> junction point. Cleavage, or resolution, of the Holliday junction can occur in two ways. Cleavage of the original set of strands leads to two molecules that may show gene conversion but not chromosomal crossover, while cleavage of the other set of two strands causes the resulting recombinant molecules to show crossover. All products, regardless of cleavage, are heteroduplexes {{in the region of}} Holliday junction migration.|$|E

50|$|The rate {{at which}} a sample passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> column is {{directly}} proportional to {{the temperature of the}} column. The higher the column temperature, the faster <b>the</b> sample <b>moves</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> column. However, the faster a sample <b>moves</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> column, the less it interacts with the stationary phase, and the less the analytes are separated.|$|R
5|$|The {{time period}} in the Plains where {{thunderstorm}} areas are most prevalent ranges between May and September. Mesoscale convective systems develop over the region during this time frame, with a bulk of the activity occurring between 6 and 9 p.m. local time. Mesoscale convective systems bring 30 to 70 percent of the annual warm season rainfall to the Plains. A subset of these systems known as mesoscale convective complexes lead to up to 10% of the annual rainfall across the Plains and Midwest. Squall lines account for 30% of the large thunderstorm complexes which <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Danielle was {{the only}} {{tropical}} storm to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean Sea in 1986. A short-lived cyclone, Danielle developed on September7 {{to the east of}} the southern Lesser Antilles. Strengthening to peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), the storm moved through Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, where a rainband moved across the main island with hurricane-force gusts. Continuing westward, Danielle absorbed dry air from northern South America and dissipated on September10.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{began the}} race, started under the safety car, ahead of Kovalainen in second. Red Bull's Mark Webber started from third. Rain {{early in the}} race allowed Vettel to {{establish}} a solid lead over Kovalainen, which he extended as the track dried. Kubica and Fernando Alonso {{finished in the top}} four after starting from 11th and eighth, respectively. McLaren driver and Drivers' Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was able to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> field after qualifying in 15th, finishing in seventh, one place behind rival Felipe Massa, of Ferrari.|$|E

5|$|Although Bagramyan {{found it}} {{acceptable}} to sustain heavy casualties (as {{did all the}} commanders of the Red Army), he was disturbed with the immense loss of life his forces were sustaining. He, however, attempted to reduce those levels primarily by maintaining {{the element of surprise}} in operations. In his preparations for Bagration, he planned for the 43rd Army to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> more geographically difficult swamps and marshlands to Army Group North's right flank. This maneuver would thus take North by surprise since it expected the Soviet offensive to move through more suitable terrain. He proved correct, as in early June 1944, the 43rd achieved success in its attack. Commander of the 43rd Army, General Afanasy Beloborodov, wrote that during the offensive they apprehended a German general who stated that German forces had been blindsided by the attacking forces.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|E
5|$|Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by MercurySteam and Kojima Productions, published by Konami and released on October 5, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The PC version {{was released on}} August 27, 2013. The game is a reboot of the Castlevania series. Set in Southern Europe during the Middle Ages, the story focuses on Gabriel Belmont and his quest to defeat a malevolent order known as the Lords of Shadow and resurrect his wife. The player controls Gabriel in 3D environments as he uses melee skills to defeat enemies and solves puzzles to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E

5|$|Early in the advance, Maxwell's company {{commander}} was severely wounded, resulting in Maxwell assuming control. Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including {{all of the}} officers except Maxwell. Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in the wire, Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wire and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was noticed that the company on their left flank was held up and failing to advance. Gathering a party of men, Maxwell led the group {{in an attempt to}} attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the transmitters. The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Tanya was not {{considered}} a threat to land, as it did not <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Azores while a tropical cyclone. The Azores were hit very hard by the storm, which had just been declared extratropical when it hit the region. Damage was particularly severe on the islands of Faial, Pico, Terceira and São Jorge. Extensive property damage was reported, including many sunk boats, many houses were damaged and some destroyed and significant agricultural damage. Many trees and power lines were also knocked down, cutting electricity and hampering communications in the area. The highest wind gusts reported in the Azores were around 105mph (170km/h). After the storm, a resolution was submitted to the European Parliament by the Government of Portugal and a disaster area was declared in the islands. One Spanish fisherman drowned and several people were injured.|$|E

5|$|Living in colonies {{results in}} {{a high level of}} social {{interaction}} between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual, as well as vocal, displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea. Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in 'bill-jousting'; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent's nape. Submissive displays include the 'slender walk', where birds <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved {{to the front of the}} body, and head and neck hunched, and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1942, the Perth and Houston {{attempted}} to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Sunda Strait to Tjilatjap however they found their path {{blocked by the}} main Japanese invasion fleet from western Java. The Allied ships were engaged by at least three cruisers and several destroyers and in a ferocious night action, known as the Battle of Sunda Strait, both Perth and Houston were torpedoed and sunk. Casualties aboard Perth included 350 crew and 3 civilians killed, while 324 survived the sinking and were taken prisoner by the Japanese (106 of whom later died in captivity). The loss of Perth so soon after the sinking of her sister Sydney, had a major psychological effect on the Australian people. Japanese losses included a minesweeper and a troop transport sunk by friendly fire, whilst three other transports were damaged {{and had to be}} beached.|$|E
5|$|Open water {{fish are}} usually {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimize turbulence as they <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> water. Reef fish {{live in a}} complex, relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} speed, and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins. Some fish have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots to startle or deceive, while others such as lionfish have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} four years all three of the regiment's {{operational}} squadrons eventually served in Vietnam, providing invaluable close support to the infantry, particularly during the clearance of Viet Cong bunker systems. Although their value in Vietnam was originally questioned by some, they proved a powerful weapon in both offence and defence, and were responsible for limiting infantry casualties. The Centurions were able to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> countryside more easily than expected and although they were vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and mines, their firepower and shock action had a decisive effect on the battlefield. The tanks {{played a significant role in}} the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968.|$|E
5|$|Robert Cook wrote Gumball for {{publication}} by Broderbund in 1983. Broderbund {{had a reputation}} as a successful publisher. Its games and productivity software each composed about half of the company's output, and their software in both categories reached the top of sales charts. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived the core concept of a machine that sorts based on color, and Robert Cook expanded the concept with the gumball conceit. He spent a week designing the main processing machine, with its pipes and valves. Though he later returned to add more background detail, his original pipe design did not change. Most of Cook's time was spent programming the game's functions, such as the how individual gumballs <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> pipes.|$|E
5|$|The {{engravings}} are mirror {{images of}} the paintings (since the engraved plates are copied from the paintings the image is reversed when printed), which leads to problems ascertaining the times shown on the clocks {{in some of the}} scenes. The images are sometimes seen as parodies of middle class life in London at the time, but the moral judgements are not as harsh as in some of Hogarth's other works and the lower classes do not escape ridicule either. Often the theme is one of over-orderliness versus chaos. The four plates depict four times of day, but they also <b>move</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> seasons: Morning is set in winter, Noon in spring, and Evening in summer. However, Night—sometimes misidentified as being in September—takes place on Oak Apple Day in May rather than in the autumn.|$|E
