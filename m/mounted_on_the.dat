5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forecastle deck abreast 'B' turret. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a tetrapodal mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ships were equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center turret. Around that same time, {{one or both of the}} ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E

5|$|Defence {{received}} a QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 12 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF 3-pounder (47mm) AA gun in 1915–16. The 12-pounder gun was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aft superstructure and the 3-pounder on the quarterdeck {{at the extreme}} rear.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one gun at the bow and {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel.

5|$|Gardiner and Gray quote an {{additional}} seven Maxim guns, but this cannot be confirmed. Five 18-inch (450mm) submerged torpedo tubes were <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Invincibles, two {{on each side}} {{and one in the}} stern and fourteen torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|Once in orbit, Big G {{would have}} docked with space {{stations}} using an Apollo docking probe <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{rear of the}} cargo module, which was in turn <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear of the re-entry module. The re-entry module itself would have been enlarged to accommodate the larger crew, and the modifications made to the spacecraft for the MOL program would have been incorporated, including the hatch in the heat shield, {{which would have been}} used to provide access to the cargo module. In the event of a launch failure, the launch escape system developed for the Apollo spacecraft would have been used to propel the re-entry module clear of the rocket.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga {{received}} a RCA CXAM-1 {{early warning radar}} in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The antenna was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. A small SC-1 early warning radar was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear lip of the funnel during 1942. A SG surface-search radar was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foremast at the same time.|$|E

5|$|The command {{variant of}} the Tiger II was {{designated}} Panzerbefehlswagen Tiger Ausf. B. It had two versions, Sd.Kfz. 267 and Sd.Kfz. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8cm ammunition to provide room to accommodate the extra radios and equipment, and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The Sd.Kfz. 267 was to have used FuG 8 and FuG 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a two metre long rod antenna <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turret roof and a Sternantenne D ("Star antenna D"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105mm Antennenfuß Nr. 1), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment. The Sd.Kfz. 268 used FuG 7 and FuG 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear deck.|$|E

5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} is <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates {{the amount of}} gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} commandos came up against {{part of the}} Siegfried Line defences around Roermond. A short halt {{followed}} and during this time No. 6 Commando sent {{out a number of}} patrols <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tanks of the 8th Hussars. In February, the snow thawed and the ground turned to mud which rendered the tanks useless and as a result the commandos carried out their patrols on foot.|$|E

50|$|Westcotts main gun {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four 4-inch Mk V QF guns in four single <b>mounts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship's centerline. These were disposed as two forward and two aft in superimposed firing positions. A single QF 3-inch (76 mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun was mounted aft {{of the second}} funnel. Aft of the 3-inch gun, she carried six 21-inch torpedo tubes mounted in two triple <b>mounts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center-line.|$|R
5|$|As {{in other}} ISSF pistol events, special {{supportive}} clothing and shoes are not permitted. Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pistol, which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their usefulness in shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E
5|$|Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were {{equipped}} with {{two sets of}} Seetakt radar. One was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forward gun director, which was located {{on top of the}} bridge. The second radar set was emplaced on the rear main battery gun director. The Seetakt sets operated at 368megacycles, initially at 14kW, though the sets were upgraded to operate at 100kW, on the 80cm wavelength.|$|E
5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy built in the late 19th century. She was laid down in January 1889, launched in October 1891, and completed in 1896. Her design was unique and departed from earlier ironclad battleship designs by introducing a number of innovations. These included a main battery of heavy guns <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> centerline and the first use of Belleville boilers. She {{formed the basis for}} several subsequent designs, beginning with Charles Martel.|$|E
