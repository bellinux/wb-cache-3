30|$|José Holquin-Veras {{presents}} an approximation model {{to estimate the}} joint carrier-receiver response to off-hour delivery policies. The model’s main intent is to bypass the need to use more complex approaches that require expensive data for model calibration. Having access to such approximation models {{would make it easier}} for transportation agencies and <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> <b>organisations</b> to analyse and design off-hour delivery programs and policies. The proposed model estimates the joint market share in off-hour deliveries by computing the joint probability that all receivers in a typical tour agree to off-hour deliveries, the probability that the carrier operation is profitable and finally the joint market share. The model’s inputs are the probability that a typical receiver would participate in off-hour deliveries, the statistical distribution of tour lengths, and the probability that the carrier operation is profitable for a given number of receivers. The results indicate that the model provides the same results than other more complex methodologies for the practical range of values of receiver participation.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Chinese <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> {{management system}} taking lessons from its past {{as well as}} current development and involving recommendations for its future improvement. It investigates the historical and current developments in the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management systems and also makes recommendations about how to improve the future systems. It aims to find potential ways which can make the Chinese <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management system work well and move the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management to good governance. This thesis also constructs a theoretical framework {{from the perspective of}} decentralization, focusing upon the change of relationships between the Chinese government, market and society, to gain an in-depth insight of changes in the development of Chinese planning management system since 1978. It considers a case study approach to analyze the current situation of the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management system. It employs a qualitative research methodology that comprises of questionnaire and interviews with governmental officials, planners and experts, to study the behaviors of different actors involved in the core operations of planning management system, and investigate relationships between the government, market and society in order to examine the fundamental institutional factors producing the problems. In the end, on basis of the global public management paradigm transformation and in view of the overall trend of the governance transition, it makes recommendations regarding an improved <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management system in China. It identifies factors influencing the Chinese <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management system. It argues that the planning management system changes with the administrative system. The administrative management system reform has become the most direct and fundamental motive for promoting the transition of planning management system. It scrutinizes the problems in <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management system. It argues that inadequate modern bureaucracy is the primary characteristic of current planning management systems, which is inducing problems in the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management system. It argues that the focus of Chinese <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management system reform is the allocation of power and responsibility among different interest groups. It argues that reform of the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management system needs continuous improvement and has to surpass the bureaucracy moderately. The essence of <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management system reform is rationalizing relationships between different levels of governments as well as relationships between the government, market and society. It insists that improved <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> management system in China needs support from other governance tools...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the dynamic {{relations}} between the state, society, and <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> are explored. The changing role and function {{of the state in}} the context of rapid restructuring of economic and social relations in Australia during the past decade are discussed, along with the impact of processes such as globalisation, cyclic recessions, and the growing assertion of local communities on the state. The influence of these processes on <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning,</b> as an arm of the state which mediates between development interests and local communities, is then assessed from a theoretical perspective. Given the identified processes and changes, it is argued that <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> has become increasingly constrained in its ability to influence the nature and location of urban development in 1990 s Australia. The validity of this argument is examined against the case of <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> in Perth during the past decade. Three key aspects of the changing nature of planning in Perth are studied in detail: a 1987 proposal for a new metropolitan strategy; a 1990 adopted metropohtan plan which derived from the 1987 proposal; and several redevelopment initiatives currently under consideration. It is concluded that the Western Australian state [...] and subsequently <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> [...] have experienced significant challenges to their ability to influence urban change. The constraints imposed on <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> are simultaneously due to economic pressures 'from above' and community pressures 'from below'. Finally, it is observed that this process possesses a regresive potential, and that <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> should restructure in order to respond effectively and equitably to recent economic and social changes. ...|$|R

40|$|Since their post-war inception, Sydney's <b>metropolitan</b> <b>plans</b> {{have tended}} to be {{overtaken}} by the social, economic and environmental conditions they have had to confront. The depth and scope of Sydney's recent urban transformation threatens again to overtake <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> capacity creating, in the context of competitive globalisation, a potentially significant market disadvantage for the city, not to mention poor urban development outcomes. This paper reviews Sydney's post-war <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> strategies, examining the social and economic contexts and the policy paradigms in which they have been framed, in order to draw out the lessons to be learned from their successes and failures. We argue that future success in planning urban development will rely on richly informed and fine-grained understanding of the complex spatial outcomes of Sydney's ever-deeper global integration. Only such fine-grained understanding can empower <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> to be responsive to the evolving challenges of managing development in the contemporary urban context...|$|R

40|$|Summary. <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>plans</b> are {{commonly}} {{based on a}} system of suburban office clusters. The large variation among recent plans suggests a poor understanding of their nature and impacts. A taxonomy of office clusters could provide a necessary framework. Six hypotheses on the type, frequency, location, employment base and travel characteristics of suburban clusters were tested in a case-study of the Toronto region. Six physical types were identified and {{found to be associated}} with certain locations, employment activities and travel mode characteristics. The Toronto <b>metropolitan</b> <b>plan</b> was found to be successful when it conformed with these findings and unsuccessful when it did not. The results lead to provisional guidelines for future <b>metropolitan</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R
