5000|$|Electric park brakes (EPB) {{are used}} on {{passenger}} vehicles {{to hold the}} vehicle stationary on grades and flat roads. This was accomplished traditionally using a <b>manual</b> <b>parking</b> <b>brake.</b> With electric park brakes, the driver activates the holding mechanism with a button and the brake pads are then electrically applied onto the rear brakes. This is accomplished by an electronic control unit (ECU) and an actuator mechanism. There are two mechanisms that are currently in production: 1. Cable puller systems and 2. Caliper integrated systems. [...] EPB systems {{can be considered a}} subset of Brake-by-wire technology.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>manual</b> <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> handle {{located between}} the front {{passenger}} seats has been replaced with an electric parking brake switch installed on the dashboard next to the driver's door. The term [...] "Hill Holder" [...] has returned but is now integrated with the electric parking brake. VDC is now standard on all models currently offered internationally. The vehicle has also added safety technologies such as Electronic Stability Control, Brake Assist, and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution {{to the list of}} standard features. The external [...] "Limited" [...] badge, introduced in 1998, has been retired on North American vehicles, and if the vehicle has the 3.6 L six cylinder engine, the rear of the vehicle has a [...] "3.6R" [...] badge applied on the bottom right side. If the vehicle has the diesel engine, a badge that says [...] "Boxer Diesel" [...] is installed on the middle right rear side of the vehicle. Gasoline turbocharged vehicles can be visually identified with a front hood (bonnet) installed air scoop and symmetrical dual exhaust pipes below the rear bumper.|$|E

50|$|Starting on a {{hill with}} the aid of the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> is not always {{possible}} since in recent cars that feature an electric <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> can only be released when the brake pedal is engaged.|$|R
25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted <b>parking</b> <b>brakes.</b> Power assisted <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional <b>parking</b> <b>brakes,</b> but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> easier. When releasing the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} important safety subsystems in a vehicle. Its main function is to hold a vehicle in position when parks on a flat or slope road. A typical problem of the mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is that it requires a driver to apply sufficient or sometimes high pulling force to keep the vehicle stationary at any road slopes. Insufficient pulling force may cause the vehicle to move away or known as rollaway phenomenon. In order to overcome such an issue, an electro-mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> (EMPB) is proposed and developed. The EMPB system is then tested using in-house <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> test bench. It is found that the EMPB takes within 0. 6 s to fully engage and within 0. 5 s to disengage the system, respectively at 11. 3 degrees of the road slope. Thus, current design of an EMPB system can prevent rollaway problem and also can be used as alternative replacement for the existing fully mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system...|$|R

25|$|Power {{operated}} <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> cylinders to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure that a vehicle remains {{stationary}} when it is parked at a certain road slope, the driver has to apply sufficient pulling force on the handbrake lever. Otherwise, the vehicle will start to rollaway where the torque generated by the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is lower that the torque required by the vehicle to remain stationary. This poses a danger situation not only to the vehicle's occupants but also to the people surrounding it. Thus, this paper aims to investigate performance of a typical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system used in passenger cars. A theoretical model of drum-type <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is derived and later being validated by test data that measured from the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> test bench. A good agreement is achieved between calculated and test results. Results from the model show that the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system used in this work can hold the vehicle stationary at 11 degree slope less than 200 N of the applied force and thus it meets the regulation requirement, and also the vehicle will not rollaway even though there are four adult passengers inside it...|$|R

2500|$|In road vehicles, the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> {{also called}} hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, [...] or e-brake, {{is used to}} keep the vehicle stationary {{and in many cases}} also perform an emergency stop. <b>Parking</b> <b>brakes</b> on older vehicles often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes at one end and the other end to a pulling mechanism which is operated with the driver's hand or foot. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, at floor level beside the driver, or a straight pull handle located near the steering column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located beside the drivers leg. In most automobiles the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking. Some automobiles have the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|R

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{use for a}} <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> is to keep a vehicle {{motionless}} when it is <b>parked.</b> The <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> has a ratchet or other locking mechanism that will keep it engaged until manually released.

50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service <b>brake</b> {{circuits}}, the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> air tank via a <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> hand control.|$|R
