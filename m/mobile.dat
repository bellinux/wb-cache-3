40|$|We {{consider}} a packet switched wireless network {{in which a}} base station serves the <b>mobiles.</b> The packets for the <b>mobiles</b> arrive at the base station {{and have to be}} scheduled for transmission to the <b>mobiles.</b> The capacity of the channel from the base station to the <b>mobiles</b> is varying with time due to fading. We assume the <b>mobiles</b> can obtain different types of service based on the prices they are willing to pay. The objective of the base station is to schedule packets for transmission to <b>mobiles</b> to maximize the revenue earned. Our main result is that a simple greedy algorithm does at least # as good as the optimal offline algorithm that knows the complete future request pattern and channel conditions. We also show that no other online algorithm can do better...|$|R

5|$|Two major interstate {{highways}} and a spur converge in <b>Mobile.</b> Interstate 10 runs northeast to southwest {{across the city}} while Interstate 65 starts in <b>Mobile</b> at Interstate 10 and runs north.

50|$|Power control {{refers to}} the process through which <b>mobiles</b> in CDMA {{cellular}} settings adjust their transmission powers {{so that they do}} not create unnecessary interference to other <b>mobiles,</b> trying, nevertheless, to achieve the required Quality of Service. Power control can be centralized in nature, where the base station dictates and assigns transmitter power levels to <b>mobiles</b> based on their link qualities, or they can be distributed, in which <b>mobiles</b> update their powers autonomously, independent of the base station, based on perceived service quality. In such distributed settings, the <b>mobiles</b> can be considered to be selfish agents (players) who try to maximize their utilities (often modeled as corresponding throughputs). Game theory {{is considered to be a}} powerful tool to study such scenarios.|$|R
30|$|Four {{simulation}} scenarii {{were used}} in the performance evaluation. In the first scenario, we analyzed the behavior of the schedulers when <b>mobiles</b> occupy different geographical positions. The second scenario examines the performance of the schedulers when <b>mobiles</b> have heterogeneous bit rate requirements. QoS differentiation is evaluated in the third scenario. The fourth simulation scenario considers <b>mobiles</b> with both heterogeneous geographical positions, bit rate, and QoS requirements.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} have a good {{estimate}} of a <b>mobile’s</b> position, the location engine adopts a hybrid cooperative tracking algorithm, namely hybrid cooperative extended Kalman filter (hcEKF), which takes into account all the available observations, that is, RSSI measurements performed between WSN nodes (i.e., WSN <b>mobiles</b> to WSN anchors or WSN <b>mobiles</b> to WSN <b>mobiles)</b> and UHF-RFID tag detection events. More details of the adopted hcEKF is presented in Section 4. At the end of the estimation process, all the estimated positions are displayed on the map and are uploaded to the DB with a time stamp.|$|R

30|$|PF brings more {{fairness}} and allocates more priority to far <b>mobiles.</b> Compared to MaxSNR, PF offers a QoS support improvement with only 12.8 % of dissatisfied <b>mobiles</b> (cf. Figures 9 (b) and 10 (a)). Fairness {{is still not}} total since the farther <b>mobiles</b> have a lower spectral efficiency than the closer ones due to path loss. All <b>mobiles</b> do not all benefit of an equal average throughput despite they all obtain an equal share of bandwidth. This induces heterogeneous delays and unequal QoS. This fairness improvement compared to MaxSNR indicates however that some flows can be slightly delayed {{to the benefit of}} others without significantly affecting their QoS.|$|R
