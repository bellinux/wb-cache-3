5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on {{decaying}} vegetation {{and the soft}} bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults <b>may</b> <b>therefore</b> be active and visible only for short periods of the year.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors.

5|$|In {{addition}} to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings for communication. The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly how this sound was created. The sound could be heard 200 yards (182 m) away, and this <b>may</b> <b>therefore</b> be {{the size of the}} territory of an individual. Other species of birds are also known to use their wings to create sounds that attract mates or mark their territory.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid {{has been}} studied as an {{alternative}} to vancomycin in the treatment of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients when Gram-positive infection is suspected. It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and <b>may</b> <b>therefore</b> be effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye.|$|E
5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors <b>may</b> <b>therefore</b> be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E

5|$|Rowland (2009) {{identified}} {{an additional}} mechanism of countershading not previously analysed, namely that a round {{body like a}} cylinder illuminated and seen from above appears to have dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading <b>may</b> <b>therefore,</b> she argues, make prey harder to detect when seen from above.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are unsure}} {{of the purpose of}} whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing <b>may,</b> <b>therefore,</b> be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} importance and interactions between these different antioxidants {{is a very}} complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having synergistic and interdependent effects on one another. The action of one antioxidant <b>may</b> <b>therefore</b> depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system. The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.|$|E

5|$|Thirteen {{species of}} fleas in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus {{have been found}} on this bunting, and {{internal}} parasites include Ascaridia galli. The yellowhammer may carry haematozoan blood parasites such as Haemoproteus coatneyi. Males with high parasite levels produced fewer offspring (there is no such effect for females), and {{tend to be less}} brightly coloured. The striking plumage of the male <b>may</b> <b>therefore</b> have arisen as a signal of fitness to breed. Yellowhammers infected with Haemoproteus may have lower winter survival rates due to a tendency to having shorter wings.|$|E
5|$|According to Ammianus, a deserter {{informed}} Chnodomar that Julian had 13,000 {{men with}} him at Saverne. But this leaves {{open the possibility that}} he may have summoned more to join him for the battle. It is possible that Severus' division was additional, as it is stated that while Julian was at Saverne, Severus' men occupied a separate camp near Barbatio's army. Libanius implies that Julian had 15,000 men under his command. If this was true, the additional 2,000 may have been Severus' division. Also, Julian may have been able to call on some limitanei units to join his comitatus for the campaign. Zosimus states that on arrival in Gaul, Julian set about a major recruitment drive. This would mainly have aimed at reconstituting limitanei regiments that had largely dissolved during the years of anarchy. Julian's force <b>may</b> <b>therefore</b> have numbered somewhat more than 15,000.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{the fifth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 7 in the periodic table, below manganese, technetium and rhenium. All {{the members of the}} group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium <b>may</b> <b>therefore</b> show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter permanganate, pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).|$|E

5|$|Drug {{resistance}} poses {{a growing}} problem in 21st-century malaria treatment. Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the CambodiaâThailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and <b>may,</b> <b>therefore,</b> be untreatable. Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years {{and the availability of}} substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype. Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.|$|E
5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features â such as the gatehouses â are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details <b>may,</b> <b>therefore,</b> be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. The {{study found that the}} parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature <b>may</b> <b>therefore</b> have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E
