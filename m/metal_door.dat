5|$|Clemmons {{was accused}} {{multiple}} times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a <b>metal</b> <b>door</b> stop and hid {{it in his}} sock {{to use as a}} weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E
500|$|In {{the rear}} of the main school {{building}} is the two-story shop, a concrete and brick addition built in 1935. [...] It features an interior chimney on the northwest corner. [...] There are two modern doors {{on the west side of}} the building and a <b>metal</b> <b>door</b> on the southeast corner.

500|$|That evening, Hari reappears in his quarters. This time Kelvin calmly accepts her {{and they}} fall asleep {{together}} in an embrace. Kelvin later causes her to panic by suddenly leaving the room and shutting the door behind him. [...] She hysterically tears {{her way through the}} room's <b>metal</b> <b>door,</b> severely cutting herself. [...] Before he can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. [...] Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) calls for a meeting, and Kelvin introduces Hari as his wife. [...] In their symposium, the scientists explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. [...] The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. [...] Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of [...] "neutrino systems" [...] but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of an offscreen device known as [...] "the annihilator".|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} game, Chunsoft {{released}} an original video animation in December 2011. Created by the Japanese animation studio Gonzo, the animation {{serves as an}} introduction to the game, showcasing the characters and the basic Ambidex Game rules. As well as the video animation, a Flash game was produced and made available on the Japanese Virtue's Last Reward website. The gameplay of the Flash game has the player attempt to open a <b>metal</b> <b>door</b> by quickly clicking on it. As the door begins to open, Clover is revealed on the other side, and the player begins clicking on her breasts. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku was perplexed by the Flash game, stating that: [...] "as it is pretty much the antithesis of everything presented in Virtue's Last Reward, I truly wonder how this Flash game is supposed to convince anyone to play the full title. Perhaps it's just due to a [...] department following the old adage: 'sex sells'." ...|$|E
500|$|The International Raëlian Movement envisions {{having an}} {{entrance}} with an aseptic chamber {{leading to a}} conference room for twenty-one {{people as well as}} a dining room of the same capacity. [...] In the plan are seven rooms for the purpose of receiving human guests into the embassy. [...] The embassy building, along with the swimming pool, would be {{in the center of a}} large park and protected from trespassing by a wall—a maximum of two stories—to surround the entire complex's circumference. [...] Trees and bushes are to be planted in the outskirts of the wall's area. [...] The walls are to have a northern and southern entrance. [...] The landing pad for the embassy should be able fit a spaceship of twelve meters of diameter or 39'4" [...] on its terrace. [...] The terrace is to be above the rooms in the torus, which are for extraterrestrials only. [...] The seven rooms directly underneath the landing pad would be protected from occupants of other rooms with a thick <b>metal</b> <b>door.</b> [...] Finally, the International Raëlian Movement wants to avoid military and radar surveillance of the airspace above the embassy. [...] Buildings for administration, food and water provisions, and state-of-the-art sanitation and communication systems are part of this vision. A nearby replica of the Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials open to the public is expected to show visitors what it is like inside the real one.|$|E

50|$|Hollow metal vision {{systems are}} used in wall openings, such as hollow <b>metal</b> <b>doors</b> of the type {{commonly}} used in correctional and detention facilities. These vision systems allow the doors to function effectively as barriers while enabling correctional officers, etc. to observe activity {{on the other side}} of the door. Vision systems in hollow <b>metal</b> <b>doors</b> can be permanently sealed with security glass, or can be designed to allow limited passing of items through the door (such as meal trays, reading materials, etc.).|$|R

2500|$|The cell had two access points: a {{hinged door}} that weighed 500kg (1,100lb) which {{is thought to}} have become {{unusable}} over the years because of its weight, and a <b>metal</b> <b>door,</b> reinforced with concrete and on steel rails that weighed 300kg (650lb) and measured [...] high and [...] wide. It was located behind a shelf in Fritzl's basement workshop, protected by an electronic code entered using a remote control unit. In order to reach this door, five locking basement rooms had to be crossed. To get to the area where Elisabeth and her children were held, eight doors in total needed to be unlocked, of which two doors were additionally secured by electronic locking devices.|$|E
2500|$|The 1973 {{model was}} {{marginally}} shorter than previous models, {{but had a}} heavier, bulker appearance. Three towing packages were optional, each with increasing towing capacity. For law men, there were multiple Police package versions available with engines ranging from the 351 2v to the powerful 460 Police Interceptor. Taxi packages continued to be offered as well. All 1973 full-sized Fords now came with a 351 2v V8-engine and SelectShift automatic transmission as their base driveline.

2500|$|Into the 1970s, many British made Dinky {{vehicles}} {{lost the}} precision quality of detailing and proportions seen {{during the two}} previous decades. Models like no. 186 Jensen FF or no. 213 European Ford Capri were rather chunky and unrefined with thick <b>metal</b> <b>door</b> frames, imprecise grilles, and ungainly doors and bonnets painted in separate colours {{from the rest of}} the body. Many just did not look quite right. Others, like the no. 1453 Citroën DS Présidentielle saloon were still impressive – flying French flags, with driver, and battery operated lights (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p.23). Some of the truck and construction models remained very clever as well, with many moving features, like the Bedford refuse truck or the Taylor Excavator. At this time, Dinky also introduced [...] "Action Kits" [...] which were regular models that came disassembled with build instructions and consisted of about 40 pieces (Smeed 1980, p.44-45). [...] On the other hand, French Dinky Toys, which had to compete with Solido since 1957, were much more accurate with better paint and sharper details than their English counterparts. The no. 825 DUKW military truck is a good example of the quality of French Dinky Toys (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E
