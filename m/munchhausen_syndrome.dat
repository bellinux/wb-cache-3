5000|$|Feminist {{scholars}} have split {{views on the}} subject. Christine Overall, professor of philosophy at Queens University, has written that personal racial transformation, or {{as she puts it}} “transracialism”, belongs to a larger class of personal surgical interventions. This larger class includes transsexual identity change, body art, cosmetic surgery, <b>Munchhausen</b> <b>syndrome</b> and voluntary female genital cutting. Her basic thesis is that the arguments against the ethical nature of racial transformation (e.g. “it's not possible”, “betrayal of group identity”, “reinforces oppression”, etc.) stand or fall with the ethical arguments related to transsexual change. Basically, if it's OK for persons to change their gender, it's OK for persons to change their race. [...] Cressida Heyes, professor of Philosophy of Gender and Sexuality at the University of Alberta, disagrees with Overall's schema. Heyes feels that racial transformation is fundamentally different than gender transformation since race is also determined by ancestry, personal cultural history and societal definitions. Hence ethical considerations of transracial surgery are different than ethical considerations in transsexual surgery.|$|E

Foram encontrados na {{literatura}} 23 casos de hemoptise fictícia associada à síndrome de Munchhausen, dois com o mesmo mecanismo aqui descrito. Relata-se o caso de um paciente com diversas admissões hospitalares recentes por escarros sangüíneos, que resultavam em exaustivas investigações diagnósticas inconclusivas. Insistentemente questionado, confessou que aspirava o próprio sangue com uma seringa, armazenando-o na cavidade oral, e eliminando-o para forjar a hemoptise. A síndrome de Munchhausen deve ser considerada em pacientes com hemoptise de etiologia obscura. <b>Munchhausen</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{results from}} a psychiatric disorder in which patients attempt to demonstrate {{signs and symptoms of}} serious organic diseases. In a review of the literature, we found 23 cases of <b>Munchhausen</b> <b>syndrome</b> accompanied by factitious hemoptysis, 2 presenting the same mechanism described herein. We report the case of a 23 -year-old male with a recent history of multiple hospital admissions for investigation of bloody sputum, although no conclusive diagnosis had been made. Upon insistent questioning the patient admitted to aspirating his own blood with a syringe, holding it in his mouth and eliminating it in order to simulate hemoptysis. <b>Munchhausen</b> <b>syndrome</b> should be considered in patients presenting hemoptysis of obscure etiology...|$|E
40|$|Shamelessly, I purloined {{the title}} of this piece. I lifted it from Wright 1 (inserting a good American “s ” in place of the British “c”). Wright might have nicked it from someone else. So far as I know, you can’t {{copyright}} a title—unless they’ve changed the rules behind my back. Does eponymy require a defense? Yes, if only because it’s a dwindling and endan-gered species. Does eponymy deserve a defense? I think so, and I’ll try to mount one. In biomedicine since ancient times, proper names have been applied to ana-tomic structures, syndromes, diseases, medications, operations or procedures, and equipment or instruments. Such eponyms generally are of two types: those which memorialize a discoverer, an innovator, or a principal promoter; and those used in lieu of prosaic identifiers or descriptors that otherwise might be unduly cumbersome or not yet clearly elucidated. The first cat-egory {{is more likely to be}} on shaky ground and more difficult to defend; eponyms of this sort tend to fade as memory falters or we no longer look through a dark glass. Eponyms of the second category often are more lasting because they serve a more useful purpose, sustained by convenience and currency. Scientists who disparage eponyms and discourage their use point to the observa-tion that attribution can be faulty in fact or priority. That is, in some cases, unfortu-nately true. Mark Ravitch, 2 not one to dis-miss eponyms out of hand, concedes that “given an eponym, one can be sure that (1) the man so honored was not the first to describe the disease, the operation, or the instrument; or (2) he misunderstood the situation; or (3) he is generally misquoted; or (4) that (1), (2), and (3) are all simul-taneously true. ” Nevertheless, in a later piece 3 Ravitch relents: “My own belief is that whatever their fallibility, eponyms illuminate the lineage of surgery [as well as other scientific endeavors] and bring to it the color of old time, distinguished fea-tures, ancient sieges and pestilences, and continually remind us of the international nature of science. ” Eponyms usually commemorate actual persons, but some derive from literature or mythology. Take, for example, Achilles tendon, Lazarus complex, <b>Münchhausen</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Oedipus complex, and Ulysse...|$|E

Wyróżnia się cztery główne rodzaje znęcania się nad dziećmi: fizyczne, psychiczne, seksualne oraz zaniedbanie, rozumiane jako zaniechanie obowiązku dbania o dziecko. Odpowiedzialne sformułowanie rozpoznania Zespołu Dziecka Maltretowanego wymaga znajomości objawów klinicznych i czynników ryzyka. Stwierdzenie czy też podejrzenie tego zespołu wymaga zgłoszenia do właściwych organów, zgodnie z obowiązującymi procedurami postępowania. Słowa kluczowe: Zespół Dziecka Maltretowanego, Zespół Dziecka Potrząsanego, Zastępczy Zespół Münchhausena Abstract: According to WHO, child abuse is defined as "any intentional or unintended action towards a person under the age of 18 that negatively affects the present or future health, experience, physical and psychosocial development of a child". There are four main types of child abuse: physical, mental, sexual, and negligence, understood as the failure of taking care of a child. The accountable diagnosis of a battered child syndrome requires the knowledge of clinical symptoms and risk factors. The ascertainment or suspicion of this syndrome requires reporting to the competent authorities in accordance with the applicable procedures.
