25|$|When clonally aged P. tetraurelia are stimulated {{to undergo}} meiosis in {{association}} with either autogamy or conjugation, the progeny are rejuvenated, {{and are able to}} have many more mitotic binary fission divisions. During either of these processes the micronuclei of the cell(s) undergo meiosis, the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear DNA that had recently undergone meiosis. There is apparently little, if any, DNA damage in the new macronucleus, suggesting that rejuvenation is associated with the repair of these damages in the <b>micronucleus</b> during meiosis.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} checkpoint adaptation and <b>micronuclei</b> in human cancer cells with damaged DNA. When cancer cells are exposed to genotoxic agents they can form <b>micronuclei,</b> although the precise process {{has yet to be}} described. I examined glioma cells (M 059 K) and found that 48 % of the cells contain <b>micronuclei</b> after treatment with cisplatin. Treated cells also underwent checkpoint adaptation: they signalled damaged DNA, had active Chk 1, arrested in G 2 -phase, and then entered mitosis. The relationship between checkpoint adaptation and <b>micronuclei</b> was confirmed by use of chemical inhibitors against Chk 1 or Cdk 1, which have key roles in checkpoint adaptation. When Chk 1 was inhibited in treated cells, additional <b>micronuclei</b> formed, whereas if Cdk 1 was inhibited, no additional <b>micronuclei</b> formed. I treated normal cells (WI- 38) with cisplatin and found that they did not undergo checkpoint adaptation or form <b>micronuclei.</b> These data demonstrate that <b>micronuclei</b> are an outcome of checkpoint adaptation.

In order to understand how <b>micronuclei</b> emerge, behave in cells, and affect cell fate, we performed extensive time-lapse microscopy of HeLa H 2 B-GFP cells in the {{presence of}} hydroxyurea at low concentration. <b>Micronuclei</b> formed after mitosis from lagging chromatids or chromatin bridges between anaphase chromosomes and were stably maintained in the cells for up to one cell cycle.

50|$|The ciliated {{protozoan}} Tetrahymena is {{a useful}} research model for studying nuclear dimorphism; it maintains two distinct nuclear genomes, the <b>micronucleus</b> and the macronucleus. The <b>micronucleus</b> genome contains five chromosomes that undergo mitosis during micronuclear division and meiosis during conjugation, which is the sexual division of the <b>micronucleus.</b> The macronuclear genome is broken down and catabolized once per life cycle during conjugation, allowing it to be site-specific, and a new macronucleus differentiates from a mitotic descendant of the conjugated <b>micronucleus.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Micronucleus</b> assay {{systems are}} very economical, require much less skill in scoring that {{conventional}} metaphase tests, and are {{much faster than}} these conventional tests. Since <b>micronucleus</b> assays reflect chromosomal aberrations reliably and rapidly, they are extremely useful for a quick assessment of chromosomal damage. In particular, the CBMNcyt (cytokinesis-block <b>micronucleus</b> cytome) assay is extremely versatile {{and is one of}} the preferred methods to measure the level of chromosomal damage and chromosomal instability in cells. The cytokinesis-block <b>micronucleus</b> (CBMN) assay was first developed to score micronuclei in cells that completed nuclear division by blocking them at the binucleate stage before cytokinesis. It later evolved into the CBMN 'cytome' assay to further explore cell death, cytostasis, and biomarkers of DNA damage. The major drawback of using <b>micronucleus</b> tests is that they cannot determine different types of chromosomal aberrations and can be influenced by the mitotic rate and proportion of cell death, skewing the results.|$|E

30|$|<b>Micronuclei</b> are {{the small}} part of {{chromosomes}} left during anaphase stage of cell division due to some abnormality during their migration to opposite poles. In the study undertaken high percentage (1133.3  %) of <b>micronuclei</b> induction was observed in erythrocytes over the reference fish. Other investigators also reported <b>micronuclei</b> induction in fish Oreochromis niloticus, Anguilla anguilla {{as a result of}} exposure to refinery effluent and urban wastewater containing heavy metals (Da Silva Souza and Fontanetti 2006; Yildiz et al. 2010). Presence of <b>micronuclei</b> is an irreversible change and reflects mutagenesis. In addition to <b>micronuclei</b> some other abnormalities in erythrocytes observed were lobed nucleus, multiple <b>micronuclei</b> and distorted erythrocytes. This could be due to the reason of impaired DNA synthesis which consequentially leads to macrocytic hypochromic anemia. When toxicant impact is observed during cell division, it can produce a mutation which can be transmitted to future generations leading to aneuploidy, impaired reproduction, low survival and may threaten the species (Valavanidis et al. 2006; Almeida et al. 2007; Hwang and Kim 2007; Monserrat et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|Production of DNA {{damage is}} the basis of cancer {{treatments}} such as chemo- and radiotherapy.

However, little or no apoptosis was detected after systemic (ip) injection of cisplatin (1 mg/kg).

40|$|BACKGROUND The health {{complexities}} caused due {{to tobacco}} smoking {{has not been}} restricted to any geographic region and has spread worldwide. As the oral mucosal cells, which line the oral cavity are the first barrier, they represent the preferred target site for the early genotoxic events. Tobacco use {{is one of the}} most important aetiological factors in initiation of oral cancer as it increases the risk of cancer by exposing the buccal mucosal to the carcinogenic chemicals either through inhalation or by ingestion. <b>Micronuclei</b> are round to oval cytoplasmic chromatin mass, which occurs as a result of segregation defects due to chromosomal instability causing chromatin to be excluded from the reformed nucleus. <b>Micronuclei</b> assay in exfoliated buccal cells is a useful and less invasive method for monitoring genetic damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 100 male subjects (50 smokers, 50 non-smokers) were examined. Buccal smears were wet fixed and stained with pap stain. 100 cells per slide were counted and assessed for <b>micronuclei</b> count. T-test and Pearson correlation was used as a statistical tool for analysis. RESULTS Significantly, smokers had higher percentage of micronucleated cells (T- 5. 865); P (0. 000), total number of <b>micronuclei</b> (T- 6. 713); P (0. 000) and mean <b>micronuclei</b> count (T- 5. 865); P (0. 000) than non-smokers.

However, pack year did not have significant relation with percentage of micronucleated cells and total number of <b>micronuclei.</b> CONCLUSION The genotoxic effects of tobacco smoke cause chromosomal damage in the epithelial cells of buccal mucosa and are reflected in the increased <b>micronuclei</b> in smokers. <b>Micronuclei</b> assay can be used as a simple and reliable marker for genotoxic evaluation...|$|R
40|$|In this report, we have {{demonstrated}} {{for the first}} time that an abundant high-mobility-group (HMG) -like protein, HMG B, previously thought to be specific to macronuclei in Tetrahymena thermophila, is also present in <b>micronuclei.</b> Biochemical data document the fact that HMG B is extremely labile in <b>micronuclei.</b> Unless extreme precautions are taken during the isolation of nuclei (addition of 1 % formaldehyde to the nucleus isolation buffer), HMG B is not detected in <b>micronuclei.</b> Using polyclonal antibodies highly selective for HMG B, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses show that the presence of HMG B in <b>micronuclei</b> is dynamic, correlating well with known periods of micronuclear DNA replication. This is the case not only during the vegetative cell cycle but also during early stages of the sexual cycle, conjugation, when the presence of HMG B in <b>micronuclei</b> is also closely correlated with meiotic DNA recombination and repair. Since <b>micronuclei</b> are transcriptionally inactive during vegetative growth, our data lend support to the idea that HMG B does not function exclusively in the establishment of transcriptionally competent chromatin. However, <b>micronuclei</b> are transcriptionally active during early stages of conjugation. Evidence that HMG B is strongly synthesized and deposited into <b>micronuclei</b> during this stage is presented. Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that HMG B may play an important role in remodeling micronuclear chromatin into an "active," more open configuration.
