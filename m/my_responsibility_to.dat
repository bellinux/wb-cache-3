As far as transfer of power was concerned, Mubarak said [...] "I have seen that it is required to delegate the powers and authorities of the president to the vice president as dictated in the constitution,". The constitutional article was used to transfer powers if the president was [...] "temporarily" [...] unable to carry out his duties and did not require his resignation.

With that said, the singer felt [...] "stifled" [...] and unable to express every feeling she wanted to show. However, she noted that with [...] "Rocket", one of the most liberating songs on the record, she managed to express many of those feelings and show different sides of her personality. Revealing that she would not have been confident enough to record the song earlier in her career, Beyoncé noted, [...] "I kinda dropped that fourth wall and I did it". The singer also discussed the meaning of the song by saying, [...] "What I love about this song is, it takes you through this journey. You're flirting and you're talking all of your arrogant [...] Then you climax, and then you have your cigarette... This song actually is about singing from the heart, and harmonies and adlibs and arrangement". During the same video, she praised Timberlake and Miguel's work; the clip also showed footage of Beyoncé recording the song in the studio.|$|E
500|$|After {{losing his}} first five games in charge, {{including}} a 7–0 thumping from Grimsby Town at Blundell Park, Gannon {{admitted that the}} club's finances limited his ability to change personnel.

It has always been my club, so it's <b>my</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> make things better, and over time we will." [...] He released striker Antonio German, defender Chris Blackburn, and seven goal top-scorer Nick Chadwick in the January transfer window. He then signed defender Joe Connor on non-contract terms, and teenagers Aaron Cole and Danny Rowe on loan. His first win in his second spell at the club came on New Year's Day, in a 3–2 victory over Barrow at Edgeley Park. He then re-signed former players Paul Turnbull and Matty Mainwaring on loan. Worried by the situation at crisis clubs Darlington and Kettering Town, Gannon cancelled the contracts of veterans Matt Glennon, John Miles, Mark Lynch, and Ryan McCann. He brought in 23-year-old Telford defender Sean Newton and 18-year-old Sunderland keeper Lewis King on loan, whilst signing 19-year-old Lancaster City midfielder Danny Hattersley on a permanent transfer. The [...] "Hatters" [...] secured their Conference status with two games to spare, after a 1–1 home draw with Braintree Town on 14 April, having lost just twice in the league at Edgeley Park since Gannon's return.

500|$|Early {{before the}} release of B'Day in 2006, Knowles held a {{nationwide}} audition for female musicians which ended in Sony Music Studios {{where she and her}} father and collaborator Mathew Knowles were among the judges. The auditions searched for keyboard players, bassists, guitarists, horn players, percussionists and drummers with stops in New Jersey, Atlanta, Burbank, Chicago and Houston. The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of [...] "Work It Out" [...] from the live album Live at Wembley (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo. Knowles stated that her goal was to get together a group of [...] "fierce, talented, hungry, beautiful" [...] women and form an all-female band. Speaking about her tour and the decision to form a band, Knowles said, [...] "I'm all about female empowerment. I'm all about pushing the envelope. I know it's <b>my</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> do something different. I said, 'I want a band, I want something different.'" [...] She further described the process of choosing the contestants during an interview, saying: [...] "I had worldwide auditions; people flew in from Atlanta, Houston, Israel, all over the world. It was extremely difficult [...] [...] so many talented women. I wanted only a nine-piece band, but the girls were so amazing, I couldn't decide. I think I'm going to wind up having 12 people so I have two [...] certain instruments, because [...] were just brilliant. It's a thing called star quality, it's a thing you can't put your finger on, can't describe. When they were playing, I said, 'I want to see y'all battle.' I brought in two of every instrument and that's how I chose. You see the one that really wants it. It was so entertaining, the energy, seeing the girls battle ... God, it was the best. It was magical." [...] Between segments of the show, Suga Mama performed periodic instrumental interludes, with every member giving a solo so Knowles could change her costumes seven times. Describing them as [...] "fantastic", Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent noted that [...] "the interval music works perfectly... but two excruciating drum solos are absolutely unnecessary".|$|E
