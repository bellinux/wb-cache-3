This led through Béal na Bláth, an isolated crossroads. There they stopped at a local pub named 'Long's Pub', now known as The Diamond Bar, {{to ask a question}} of a man standing at the crossroad. The <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> out to be an anti-Treaty sentry. He and an associate recognised Collins {{in the back of the}} open-top car.|$|E

In 2017, Brosnan starred in The Foreigner, opposite Jackie Chan, as a former IRA <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> government official, Liam Hennessy. The Foreigner was filmed in London, and was directed by Martin Campbell, who previously worked with Brosnan on his debut James Bond film, GoldenEye. It was noted that Brosnan's character bore a strong resemblance to Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams.|$|E
500|$|George Criticos {{served as}} head porter of the Ritz for 45 years, {{retiring}} in 1960 for health reasons; {{he had been}} recommended for {{a job at the}} Ritz by Sir Basil Zaharoff. In his 1959 book, George of the Ritz, Criticos remembered some of the notable people and events during his years of service. [...] Criticos once acted as an agent to the Aga Kahn at the racetrack, having been given US$45,000 by the monarch to place bets in his name. [...] He was also asked to take the 18-year-old Prince Aly Khan on a monthlong tour of the United States to help the young man forget a failed romance. [...] When Criticos saw an unshaven man in coveralls entering the hotel, he called out to the man to stop him. [...] When the <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> to face Criticos, he recognised him as King Boris of Bulgaria, who was a railroad buff and was returning from driving a special train.|$|E
500|$|Paine's Age of Reason sparked enough {{anger in}} Britain to {{initiate}} {{not only a}} series of government prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of these responded specifically to Paine's attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I). Although critics responded to Paine's analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a literal reading of the Bible, citing the Bible's long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued ad hominem attacks against Paine, describing him [...] "as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent, enlightened people". Dissenters such as Joseph Priestley who had endorsed the arguments of the Rights of <b>Man</b> <b>turned</b> away from those presented in The Age of Reason. Even the liberal Analytical Review was skeptical of Paine's claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine's deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the brush of extremism.|$|E

500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The Boston Globe on 14 October 2007, Scott Allen {{reported}} {{the issue of}} patient abuse and problems with human resources management at Mount Sinai by Dr. Jack M. Gorman who was Department Chairman of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai. Allen stated that; [...] "... officials at McLean learned that Gorman had, like so many patients at the renowned psychiatric hospital, attempted suicide. But their initial sympathy for a sick <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> to horror when they learned, from a legal document delivered in mid-May, why he had taken such a desperate measure. The married father of two had brought a shameful secret with him to Massachusetts: He had engaged in a long-term sexual relationship with a New York patient... Gorman, 55, inspired great hope when McLean and Partners announced that they had lured him away from New York City's Mount Sinai School of Medicine in October 2005... It was Gorman's decision to contact the New York Board of Professional Medical Conduct that finally brought the episode to public attention. Earlier this month, the board finally acted on what Gorman told them, posting on its website that his medical license had been indefinitely suspended for 'inappropriate sexual contact' with a patient." ...|$|E

Mohar Basu of Koimoi wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal has evolved for the better as an actor.
