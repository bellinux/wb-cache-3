2500|$|As of 2010, the {{literacy}} rate of females in Pakistan was at 39.6 percent {{compared to that}} of males at 67.7 percent. [...] More recent statistics provided by the UNICEF - shows that female education amongst 15-24 year olds has increased substantially to 61.5% - an increase of 45%. Male education is at a steady rate of 71.2%. The objectives of education policies in Pakistan aim to achieve equality in education between girls and boys and to reduce the gender gap in the educational system. [...] However, the policy also encourages girls, mainly in rural areas of Pakistan, to acquire basic home management skills, which are preferred over full-scale primary education. [...] The attitudes towards women in Pakistani culture make the fight for educational equality more difficult. [...] The lack of democracy and feudal practices of Pakistan also contribute to the gender gap in the educational system. [...] This feudal system leaves the underpowered, women in particular, in a very vulnerable position. [...] The long-lived socio-cultural belief that women play a reproductive role {{within the confines of the}} home leads to the belief that educating women holds no value. Although the government declared that all children of the ages 5–16 can go to school, there are 7.261 million children out of school at the primary level in Pakistan, and 58% are female (UNESCO, Education for All Global <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Report</b> 2011). Although girls have the right to get an education legally, in many rural regions of Pakistan girls are strongly discouraged from going to school and discriminated against, as there are violent acts such as acid throwing which many girls fall victim to for attending school.|$|E
