40|$|We {{implement}} a three-step procedure {{to assess the}} extent of exposure to real estate in commercial banks. First, we demonstrate interest rates and income to be the major determinants of delinquency. Then, we adopt a stress testing approach to calculate the impact of any adverse changes in these determinants. This suggests that a 1. 3 percentage point increase in mortgage interest rate leads to a 20 percent decrease in a typical bank''s distance to default. Finally, {{we look at the}} cross-sectional differences and indentify the banks with rapid loan growth along with high cost-income ratio as the most vulnerable.

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 11 July 1804, Burr arose from Richmond Hill and had himself ferried across the Hudson to his fateful duel with Alexander Hamilton. In 1807, Burr filed plans for driving three new streets of houses through the property; his plan was {{approved}} by the City Council, but he was too strapped for cash to carry the plan to fruition, though he mortgaged the equivalent of 240 building lots to the Bank of the Manhattan Company, for $38,000. Following Burr's occupancy his creditors sold the <b>mortgaged</b> <b>estate</b> to the real-estate magnate John Jacob Astor, for $32,000, who resold the building lots, with leases to run out in 1864, allowing him the reversion for the final three years, with all the structures and other improvements, until the leases reverted to Trinity Church, when he had the right of renewal. In the meantime, in December 1820 Astor had the house set upon logs and rolled down the hill to the southeast corner of Varick and Charlton Streets. He opened the house and its gardens as a public resort in 1822 It was remembered as a genteel roadhouse by a surveyor working when the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 was being laid out. After serving as a resort in its new location it opened in November 1831 as a theater, and [...] "the following year it became the Italian Opera House but finished the year with equestrian shows," [...] the historians of theatre in New York report, [...] and eventually was a common saloon before it was razed in 1849. During the time that the mansion was in existence, the surrounding neighborhood, built up from the 1820s by Astor as modest brick rowhouses, was also called Richmond Hill, connected to the city through the former water meadow, now drained and filled, as a continuation of Canal Street.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} the {{socio-economic}} characteristics of indebted Italian households and their {{changes in the}} recession period (2001 - 2004) with respect to that of expansion (1997 – 2000). The analysis of data from the Bank of Italy’s Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) for the years 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004 and {{with reference to the}} two different phases of the business cycle, has helped to answer the aforesaid questions. More specifically, Multiple Correspondence Analysis applied to the Bank of Italy’s Survey data, has highlighted that, on the whole, the indebted household economic features have undergone, in the recession period with respect to that of expansion, noteworthy changes, partly due to the gradual transformation of instruments used in the payment of instalments on more favourable terms, and partly due to the high uncertainty with regard to the general economic perspectives which characterize the recession period. As a matter of fact, access to the credit market to purchase or to restructure buildings and to purchase real goods, proves to be easier even for poorer households, as long as the head is employed. This trend arises, in the recession period {{and as far as the}} purchase or restructuring of buildings is concerned, from a noteworthy reduction in the interest rates put on loans (especially for those characterized by a variable rate of interest) and from the opportunity offered by credit and financial institutions to raise a loan for higher amounts or percentage of the <b>mortgaged</b> <b>estate</b> value than in the past. As far as the purchase of real goods is concerned, the above mentioned trend arises, to a large extent, from the greater attention shown by households, during periods of high uncertainty with regard to general economic perspectives, towards safe investments. Moreover, the results show a significant relationship between household propensity to incur debt and the job status of the head, which strengthened during the recent recession period; as a matter of fact, the propensity to incur debt to purchase more expensive goods is higher with reference to households with an employed head, as they can easily guarantee an adequate income in order to meet loan obligations. On the other hand, the propensity of households with an unemployed head to incur debt to purchase non durable goods is, out of necessity, greater than for other household classes, and it has been made easier by the widening of the forms of payments offered by banks and financial institutions and desired by the same traders throughout the recession period in order to maintain business...|$|E
40|$|A third person, {{who pays}} off a creditor, acquires the paid-off claim {{up to the}} amount of the given payment (art. 518 § 1 of the civil code). It is the case of a {{statutory}} subrogation which covers a wide range of various situations. It is aimed to strengthen a position of the person paying off a creditor. At the outset the author analyses a question of separating the statutory subrogation from allied institutions. He is advocating for a position according to which we are dealing here with a recourse claim (in a wide sense). The statutory subrogation is therefore a specific type of claim. Next, particular instances of the statutory subrogation are analyzed by the author. His remarks are started with a discussion of a guarantors claim who satisfied a creditor. He represents the opinion that in this case the guarantor fulfils his own obligation {{and at the same time}} he pays another's debt for which he is liable personally. This position implies a solution of secondary questions related to the guarantor's recourse. If the guarantors are few, the provisions of joint and several debt are to be applied to their mutual relations in case of paying off a credit by one of them. In turn the author presents those instances where a third person is liable for a paid-off debt with certain material objects. A pledge and a real estate mortgage come into consideration. The author represents the opinion that a construction of the so called real obligation has to be adopted in this type of real securities. It implies that a pledger or an owner of <b>mortgaged</b> <b>estate</b> are real debtors bearing a limited liability to the creditor. The author also dwells on complex problems related to paying off a secured debt (in the light of the new act of 1982). A conclusion is reached that a mortgage expires when a creditor is redeemed by the owner of the estate. Next questions deal with paying off a claim which has a priority in settlement. Its practical effect is presently unimportant. A case of paying off a creditor by a third person with the consent of a debtor is eased in the present laws. It is the instance of the so called conversion. The payment is in a way imposed upon a creditor who cannot refuse acceptance of a performance which is already enforceable. In the final remarks the author dwells on premises of a recourse claim of an insurance institution vs. an injurer. It is the instance of property and not of personal insurance. In the result of subrogation the legal position of a debtor cannot be deteriorated and is entitled to all defences he had against the creditorDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E
