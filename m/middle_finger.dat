5|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> {{has been}} {{involved}} in judicial hearings. An appellate court in Hartford, Connecticut ruled in 1976 that gesturing with the <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> was offensive, but not obscene, after a police officer charged a 16-year-old with making an obscene gesture when the student gave the officer the <b>middle</b> <b>finger.</b> The case was appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court, which upheld the decision. In March 2006, a federal lawsuit was filed regarding the free speech issue.|$|E
5|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> gesture {{was used}} in Ancient times {{as a symbol of}} sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate and {{threaten}} the individual receiving the gesture. It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> representing testicles; from its close association, the gesture may have assumed apotropaic potency. In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the finger was one of many methods used to divert the ever-present threat of the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|While a {{high school}} student working {{part-time}} at an Arby's restaurant, Emanuel severely cut his right <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> on a meat slicer, which was later infected from swimming in Lake Michigan. His finger was partially amputated due to the severity of the infection.|$|E

5|$|After {{a loss to}} the New Orleans Saints on November 26, 2006 in the Georgia Dome, Vick made {{an obscene}} gesture at fans in an {{apparent}} reaction to booing, holding up both hands with the <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> extended. He was fined $10,000 by the NFL and agreed to donate another $10,000 to charity.|$|E
5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated <b>middle</b> <b>finger,</b> which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Thordendal, who {{was working}} as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left <b>middle</b> <b>finger,</b> while Haake injured his hand in a router accident. As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's {{fingertip}} was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery. The Selfcaged EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} animal cruelty case {{surfaced}} in 2007, however, Vick's corporate status had deteriorated. Among the negative incidents was his <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> gesture to Atlanta football fans in 2006. Vick's first endorsement after {{being released from}} prison was a two-year deal on January 27, 2011 with Unequal Technologies, a company that produces football pads. Nike officially signed Vick again as an athlete on July 1, 2011. The company had been supplying him with complimentary gear since October 2009; his re-signing {{marked the first time}} a sponsor had brought back an athlete after dropping him.|$|E
5|$|The gesture {{dates back}} to Ancient Greece {{and it was also}} used in Ancient Rome. Historically, it {{represented}} the phallus. In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists (notably more common among hardcore punk bands and rappers), actors, celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Most still view the gesture as obscene. The index finger and ring finger besides the <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testicles.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt's final {{start of}} the year came on July 23, in a game he won against Minnesota. After the start, the Royals moved him to the bullpen to try to fix his blister problems. The move was {{originally}} thought to be temporary. While in the bullpen, on August 3, he got his career first save in a 20 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On August 21, the Royals announced that Affeldt would {{spend the rest of the}} year in the bullpen. Two days later, he got another save against Minnesota. He picked up two more saves before the end of the year and finished with a 76 record and a 3.93 ERA. After the season, to try to help with his blister problems, he had part of a fingernail on the <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> of his left hand removed. Also, the Royals announced that if he developed blister problems again, he would be sent to the bullpen for good.|$|E

5|$|Athletes, {{including}} Stefan Effenberg, Ron Artest, Luis Suárez, Juan Pablo Montoya, Iván Rodríguez, Danny Graves, Jack McDowell, Natasha Zvereva, Josh Smith, Bryan Cox, and Johnny Manziel {{have been}} suspended or fined for making the gesture. José Paniagua was released by the Chicago White Sox after giving the <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> to an umpire; he hasn't played in the majors since. Baseball executive Chub Feeney once resigned after giving the finger to fans on Fan Appreciation Night. Bud Adams, owner of the National Football League's Tennessee Titans, was fined US$250,000 for giving both middle fingers to the fans of the Buffalo Bills during a game. Professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin is also famous for flashing one or both middle fingers {{as part of his}} gimmick.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{the basic}} button {{configuration}} established with Nintendo's Super NES Controller, the PlayStation Controller added a second pair of shoulder buttons for the <b>middle</b> <b>fingers.</b> Intended to update the gamepad for navigating 3D environments {{such as the ones}} PlayStation was designed to generate, the concept behind featuring shoulder buttons for both the index and <b>middle</b> <b>fingers</b> was to implement two-way directional depth controls using the two sets of buttons. To compensate for the less stable grip from shifting the middle fingers' placement to the shoulders, grip handles were added to the controller.|$|R
5000|$|The shocker, {{also known}} colloquially as [...] "two in the pink, {{one in the}} stink," [...] is a hand gesture with a sexual connotation. The ring finger and thumb are curled or bent down while the other fingers are extended. The index and <b>middle</b> <b>fingers</b> are kept {{together}} (touching) {{and the back of}} the hand faces outwards (away from the gesturer). The gesture refers to the act of inserting the index and <b>middle</b> <b>fingers</b> into a vagina and the little finger into the receiver's anus, hence the [...] "shock".|$|R
5|$|Lemurs are {{a diverse}} group of {{primates}} in terms of morphology and physiology. Some lemurs, such as the sportive lemurs and indriids, have longer hind limbs than forelimbs, making them excellent leapers. Indriids also have a specialized digestive system for folivory, exhibiting enlarged salivary glands, a spacious stomach, and an elongated caecum (lower gut) that facilitates fermentation. The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) reportedly has a very long tongue, allowing it to feed on nectar. Likewise, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) has a feathery brush-shaped tongue, also uniquely adapted to feed on nectar and pollen. The aye-aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates, making it stand out among the lemurs. Such traits include continuously growing, rodent-like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds; a highly mobile, filiform (filament-shaped) <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> for extracting food from tiny holes; large, bat-like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees; and use of self-generated acoustical cues to forage.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|Whereas many {{pitchers}} throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with {{a pronounced}} over-the-top arm action. This may have increased his velocity, but reduced the lateral movement on his pitches, especially {{movement away from}} left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking wind-up and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches. His four-seam fastball gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to underspin. It not only appeared to move very late but also might move two or three distinct times. His overhand curveball, spun with the <b>middle</b> <b>finger,</b> dropped vertically 12 to 24inches due to his arm action. Rob Neyer called it the best curve of all time. He also occasionally threw a changeup and a forkball.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} dromaeosaurid {{body plan}} helped to rekindle theories {{that at least}} some dinosaurs may have been active, fast, and closely related to birds. Robert Bakker's illustration for John Ostrom's 1969 monograph, showing the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus in a fast run, is among the most influential paleontological reconstructions in history. The dromaeosaurid body plan includes a relatively large skull, serrated teeth, narrow snout, and forward-facing eyes which indicate some degree of binocular vision. Dromaeosaurids, like most other theropods, had a moderately long S-curved neck, and their trunk was relatively short and deep. Like other maniraptorans, they had long arms that could be folded against the body in some species, and relatively large hands with three long fingers (the <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> being the longest and the first finger being the shortest) ending in large claws. The dromaeosaurid hip structure featured a characteristically large pubic boot projecting beneath the base of the tail. Dromaeosaurid feet bore a large, recurved claw on the second toe. Their tails were slender, with long, low, vertebrae lacking transverse process and neural spines after the 14th caudal vertebra.|$|E
5|$|Through {{a mutual}} {{reflection}} on their past, it is revealed that Sarah and Andrew were on holiday {{at the time}} of their meeting with Little Bee. The trip was an attempt to salvage their marriage after Andrew discovered Sarah had been unfaithful to him, embarking on an affair with Home Office employee Lawrence Osborn. While walking on the beach one morning, they were approached by a then 14-year-old Little Bee, and her older sister Nkiruka. The girls were being pursued by soldiers who had burned down their village and intended for there to be no witnesses left alive. The soldiers arrived and murdered a guard from the O'Rourkes' hotel, but offered to spare the lives of the girls if Andrew would amputate his own <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> with a machete. Afraid, and believing the soldiers would murder the girls anyway, Andrew refused, but Sarah complied in his place. The soldiers took both girls away, leaving the couple in doubt as to whether the soldiers would leave one girl alive in response, as they promised.|$|E
40|$|Background: Sellick's {{maneuver}} (cricoid pressure) {{may make}} laryngoscopic view and tracheal intubation more difficult. This study compared the different techniques of cricoid pressure (CP) {{regarding to the}} laryngoscopic view and time to intubation. &# 13; Methods: In 142 anesthetized patients, 4 types of CP was randomly applied; A) one-handed CP using thumb, index and <b>middle</b> <b>fingers,</b> B) one-handed CP using index and <b>middle</b> <b>fingers,</b> and the heel on the sternum, C) technique A with another hand below the neck, D) technique C with a pillow below the neck. &# 13; Results: There was {{significant difference in the}} laryngoscopic view changes. The view was better in group A, C, D and B, respectively. Mean intubation time did not show significant difference. &# 13; Conclusion: One-handed CP using thumb, index and <b>middle</b> <b>fingers</b> can provide the best views at laryngoscopy without significant effect on time to intubation. &# 13; Key Words: Sellick's maneuver, Laryngoscopic view, Intubation time, Trachea...|$|R
