40|$|An {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} {{used to assess the}} quantitative importance of monetary policy for the post- 1984 decline in U. S. inflation and output volatility. The principal finding is that monetary policy played a substantial role in reducing inflation volatility, but a small role in reducing real output volatility. The model attributes much of the decline in real output volatility to smaller TFP shocks. We also investigate the pattern of output and inflation volatility under an optimal monetary policy counterfactual. We find that real output volatility would have been somewhat lower, and inflation volatility substantially lower, had monetary policy been set optimally.

Variable factor utilization enriches the propagation mechanism of monetary shocks by reducing the sensitivity of marginal costs to changes in aggregate output.

40|$|A {{consensus}} is emerging that {{returns to the}} currency carry trade are driven by two factors. One of these is probably consumption risk but there is widespread disagreement about {{the identity of the}} remaining factor. This paper bolsters the case for volatility being the unknown factor. A structural model that specifies that <b>monetary</b> <b>volatility</b> is the second factor is tested for 56 monetary regimes using the artificial economy methodology. The negative slope in the Fama regression arises when <b>monetary</b> <b>volatility</b> is low and the precautionary savings motive dominates the intertemporal substitution motive. When <b>monetary</b> <b>volatility</b> is high, the Fama slope is positive in line with uncovered interest parity.

40|$|Purpose – To {{investigate}} whether <b>monetary</b> <b>volatility</b> in the US exerts any asymmetric impact on output volatility {{over the period}} 1974 - 2002. Design/methodology/approach – For the empirical purposes, the analysis makes use of the multi-variable GARCH (MVGARCH), which allows not only the presence of volatility clustering but also the presence of asymmetries in that volatility clustering. Findings – The empirical findings suggest that money supply volatility exerts a significant asymmetric influence on output volatility, i. e. the variance of output changes more due to positive changes than negative changes of money supply volatility. Originality/value – The paper investigates, for the first time, the presence of any asymmetric impact of the volatility of money on the volatility of output {{in the case of}} the US.

40|$|Many {{emerging}} market economies (EMs) {{have adopted a}} floating exchange rate regime after currency crises. Since 1999 Brazil has experienced a floating regime combined with inflation targeting. The Central Bank varies the interest rates {{in order to reach}} the targeted inflation rates and consequently the variability of the interest rates has been higher than the variability of the exchange rates. According to some economists, this is a clear symptom of the fear of floating and Brazil can not be an exception among the EMs. After assessing the behavior of the exchange rates and interest rates associated with other macroeconomic variables, this paper concludes that Brazil has not suffered from the fear of floating and that the Brazilian Central Bank does not care about exchange rate dynamics as much as it does about inflation.

Despite the increased interest, monetarism is still often misunderstood, as Thomas M.

Humphrey exposes their fallacy with selections from monetarist literature from the 19 th century to the present.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a closer view on the {{interaction}} of exchange rate volatility and interest rate volatility in the Mercosur countries. We discuss several models that explain systematic correlations between the movements of both variables and their second statistical moments, i. e. their volatilities. In contrast to the “fear of floating” argument that could lead to a volatility trade-off, we argue that both variables are largely driven either by the credibility of a country or by politics in general and thus should move in the same direction. Subsequently, we test this hypothesis of a positive correlation between both variables empirically. As a final step, we control for the impact of third variables such as exchange rate misalignment, financial stress, and <b>monetary</b> <b>volatility.</b> Our results show that – independent from third variables –there is a notable co-movement of exchange rates and interest rates in Mercosur countries. ...|$|E

Using UK-relevant data to set key parameter values in the model, we carry out three policy experiments. We find that (i) eliminating monetary growth shocks and (ii) reducing the inflation rate can each generate positive growth and welfare effects, while (iii) reducing the interest rate depresses growth and is welfare deteriorating.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the key characteristics of Singapore's exchange rate-centered monetary policy; in particular, its managed float regime which incorporates key {{features of the}} basket, band and crawl system popularized by Williamson (1998, 1999).

A characterization of the countercyclical nature of Singapore's exchange rate policy is also offered, with reference to recent work on the monetary policy reaction function and estimates of Singapore's behavioral equilibrium exchange rate. We also review previous econometric analysis which provides evidence that Singapore's managed float system may have helped to mitigate the spillover effects of such increased volatility into the real economy. The track record of Singapore's managed float regime {{over the past two}} decades suggests that intermediate regimes are a viable alternative to the so-called "corner solutions", especially when supported by consistent macroeconomic and microeconomic policies as well as strong institutions.

Empirical results for the period 1979 - 2010 underline the statistical significance of inflation-dependent UK macroeconomic volatility.
