500|$|Cliff White of NME {{called the}} album [...] "almost a voyeur's delight", {{and was not}} {{favorable}} of Gaye's sensual themes, stating [...] "Although getting down, getting mellow, and getting it on are paramount considerations {{in the privacy of}} <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> I don't particularly want to be party to someone else's night life. Not on record anyway... Like peeking through the windows of the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I find it a mite frustrating." [...] White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as [...] "all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out", and calling I Want You [...] "simply the explorative aftermath of Let's Get It On. The sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating [...] "was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice? I mean, if you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>home.</b> It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an {{excellent}} review, {{giving it a}} B. In her recap, she points out: [...] "With “Souls Of The Departed” Once Upon a Time, believe it or not, has just crossed a key threshold: 100 episodes. For all this show's inanities and love of catchphrases and gaping plot holes where logic should exist, there's clearly something very compelling about Storybrooke and its residents that resonates with viewers. In <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> it's a decent family watch, that the kids find intriguing and even occasionally scary enough not to be lame, and the adults in the house can still take an interest. And the show still finds surprising mileage out of turning fairy tale tropes on their ear, or offering different sides of characters {{we think we know}} well." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{might choose}} to change her home, Charles; I had a happy, happy home, but I {{should not have been}} {{contented}} to remain there till now. I found that something more than <b>my</b> <b>own</b> old <b>home</b> was necessary to my happiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, dear Charlie, indeed I am. You are all so {{very kind}} to me, {{and it is a}} blessing, indeed, that <b>my</b> <b>own</b> dear <b>home</b> can open to take in me and baby. You know he liked giving me back to you.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Dear Kitty, I {{will come}} and stay all night on purpose," [...] said Dorothea; [...] "but I {{want to be alone}} now, and in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>home.</b> I wish to know the Farebrothers better, and to talk to Mr. Farebrother about what there is to be done in Middlemarch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First I {{would go}} to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> {{and it would be}} safe to do so because no one save Master Lord has any idea that I am in town. My mother must know {{somewhat}} of the doings hereabouts since we left, and may be able to give valuable information." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus the {{arrangement}} would be mutually beneficial to us, {{and when it}} was settled, I looked with increased pleasure at my beautifully neat little bedroom, where before I had only been as a guest, but which I could now look upon as <b>my</b> <b>own</b> sanctuary--my <b>home.</b>|$|R

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> {{became a}} hunting ground. My {{wife is a}} {{singularly}} feminine creature, candid, sympathetic, and impulsive.

6000|$|Moving {{cautiously}} and not venturing to speak, {{he led me}} {{a certain}} portion of {{the way across the}} village toward the west, as if I was counting on going to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> and when we were come to where a line of entrenchments was but just begun, he whispered softly in my ear: ...|$|E
60|$|Now I {{knew exactly}} why I {{was staying at}} the house of the miller. I was doing so in order that I might go early in the mornings to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> in which the girl I loved lay dreaming, and that {{for the rest of the}} day and much of the night I might think of her.|$|E
60|$|I also {{walked away}} to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> desolate <b>home,</b> and, sitting {{down in the}} empty consulting-room, {{contemplated}} the utter ruin that had overtaken me.
