40|$|This thesis investigates passive {{damping system}} {{performance}} in heavy vehicles through analytical expressions, simulations with different vehicle models {{as well as}} through experimental evaluation in a tractor semi trailer combination. The objective is to study what levels of chassis suspension damping that are desirable for different vehicle modes and how this may be achieved with passive damping systems. To investigate the influence on performance from damper positioning, analytical expressions for a 2 D - suspension model are derived. Geometric key parameters controlling roll and bounce damping are found to be damper vertical aligning and perpendicular distance between damper and suspension roll centre respectively. These parameters are often not easily altered within an already existing vehicle. To investigate performance possibilities from damping not restricted by packaging requirements, the concept with distributed damping is furthermore studied. Theoretical expressions for modally distributed damping are first derived from an analytical tractor model with 7 DOF. Considered motions for which damping is prescribed are bounce, pitch and roll of sprung mass, and axle crossing. These equations are evaluated through various simulations with a 4 x 2 -tractor semi trailer model. Results from simulations show that the conflict in damping demands with passive independent dampers for a single lane change and a one-sided pot hole may be significantly reduced with amplitude dependent modal damping. Vehicle damping performance is not only affected by the dampers positioning and their individual setting, but also by the damper attachment structure. The influence from compliance in e. g. brackets and <b>mounting</b> <b>bushings</b> at damper attachment points is therefore studied. Linear analysis with a simple spring mass damper model shows that damper attachment compliance reduces the damper efficiency. Finite element analyses of both the chassis frame and the tractor are furthermore performed to obtain numerical values of front-axle damper-attachment stiffness. The effect from damper-attachment stiffness is quantified though simulations with a tractor semi trailer model. Simulation results show {{that it is important to}} consider the attachment stiffness during vehicle manoeuvres containing high frequency inputs such as the passage over a plank. A methodology and equations for prescribing chassis suspension damping as function of general vehicle modes by using electronically controlled variable dampers is presented. A critical input for such implemented modal damping systems are the real time estimation of modal motions necessary for force calculation. From performed simulations it is shown that geometric calculations of modal velocities based solely on relative damper displacements contain significant discrepancies to actual motion for transient road inputs. To overcome this, a time-domain system identification approach is presented, where models that estimate modal coordinate velocities with considerably higher accuracy are identified. The proposed modal damping approach is implemented on a 4 x 2 tractor and experimentally evaluated through various road tests. It is shown that the system has the desired ability to control sprung mass bounce and pitch modes separately and that it improves vehicle performance on all tested load cases. QC 2010083...|$|E

Multi-body simulation (MBS) software {{is used to}} calculate loads and vibrations; where simple mount models lead to trade-offs in the overall vehicle simulation accuracy. A model for many sorts of hydro mounts is presented. Accurate results are reached by correctly implementing the amplitude dependence of the mount’s underlying rubber parts. The model is evaluated with experiments from a component test rig; with transient test signals from on-road durability events.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formulation for incorporating nonlinear viscoelastic bushing elements into multibody systems. The formulation {{is based on}} the assumption that the relaxation function can be expressed as a sum of functions which are nonlinear in deformation and exponentially decreasing in time. These forces can represent elastomeric <b>mounts</b> or <b>bushings</b> in automotive suspension systems. The numerical implementation of the nonlinear viscoelastic bushing model into a general purpose rigid multibody dynamics code is described, and an extension of the formulation is also presented wherein component flexibility is included. Model validation was performed by comparing experimental data to simulation results obtained using the nonlinear viscoelastic model and a nonlinear elastic model. The experimental data were obtained at the Center's facilities by testing an automotive lower control arm/bushing system, subjected to a simulated road load event. The comparison demonstrates the better load prediction capability of the viscoelastic bushing model compared to the conventional model...|$|R
40|$|The Variable Displacement Engine (VDE) {{is a new}} {{generation}} of engines that are designed to decrease the fuel consumption at the cruise speed of a vehicle. The isolation of the VDE's new vibration pattern is beyond the capabilities of conventional <b>mounts</b> and <b>bushings.</b> Consequently, in this thesis, novel active and semi-active solutions are proposed to develop various semi-active and active hydraulic bushing proof-of-concept systems that may solve the isolation problem in a VDE system. The dynamic stiffness response, which is the transfer function that relates the engine displacement to the transmitted force, is normally used as the key design criterion for engine <b>mounts</b> and <b>bushings.</b> In this thesis, a linear mathematical model of a conventional hydraulic bushing is purposed. The validity of the mathematical model is confirmed by an experimental analysis, and the various parameters in the dynamic stiffness equation are evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the dynamic stiffness frequency response of the conventional hydraulic bushing has both soft and stiff regions. The soft region is limited to low frequencies. For the VDE isolation, the goal is to provide a soft bushing for a wider range of frequencies than a conventional bushing can accommodate. Addition of a short inertia track, similar to a decoupler used in conventional hydraulic engine mounts, may be used to extend the soft region of a conventional hydraulic bushing, and the experimental results validate it. Since the short inertia track provides no additional damping, a supplementary Magnetorheological (MR) valve is also devised. The MR valve has the advantage to minimize the amount of MR fluid used, which significantly reduces the cost of the overall system. The novel valve allows the damping coefficient of the bushing assembly to be controlled by varying the electrical current input to a solenoid coil. A mathematical model is derived for the MR bushing, and is validated experimentally. In addition, an active bushing to solve the VDE isolation problem is purposed in this thesis. In this bushing, a magnetic actuator, composed of a permanent magnet and a solenoid coil, is included in the active bushing. This active chamber affects the dynamic stiffness response of the bushing by altering the bushing's internal pressure. The nonlinear equation of motion of the permanent magnet is linearized and is incorporated into the new mathematical model of the system. The new purposed model for the active bushing is in good agreement with the experimental results. This active chamber is also proved capable of producing complex dynamic stiffness frequency response. The conclusion is that the proposals in this thesis can contribute to the isolation of the vibration pattern, imposed by the application of a VDE system...|$|R
40|$|In the Automotive Industry {{it becomes}} more and more {{important}} to reduce costs and cut down development time. It {{is one of the main}} challenges in order to stay competitive, also for the Volvo Car Cooperation, where this thesis work was carried out in cooperation with Chalmers University of Technology. With regard to Vehicle Dynamics, a large amount of the cost is generated while prototype cars need to be set-up and changed to meet requirements during the testing phase. With the increase in computational power and the availability of advanced software for vehicle dynamics simulations in recent years, it is now possible to do some of this work earlier in the design phase. The future goal is to use prototype testing mainly for validation of having met the requirements, rather than changing the car to achieve them. For this to be possible, it needs to be assured that the CAE methods are stable and show good correlation to physical testing. This thesis focuses on correlation of vertical vibration insulation simulations. The starting point was that shaker rig tests showed different results from shaker rig simulations in Adams Car. A thorough pre-study was performed to understand the theory of key areas for vertical vehicle dynamics, such as damper, bushing, tire and friction modeling. The technical background section of this work should therefore provide all the needed information to understand the carried out work, also for a reader new to this field. As a next step, simulation models are developed ranging from linear quarter car state-space models in MATLAB to more advanced non-linear quarter car models in Dymola. The most advanced Dymola model features a self-developed low-pass filter damper model, hydro engine mount and top <b>mount</b> <b>bushings</b> as well as different friction implementations. Friction modeling was also investigated with a full car model in Adams Car. Shaker rig, damper and suspension parameter measurement machine tests where conducted, to parametrize models and gain more insight into the physical phenomenas that are tried to be replicated. Friction was identified as the largest factor why simulations and tests do not correlate. The implementation of friction improved results significantly, especially at low frequencies. More accurate damper modeling that tries to capture the hysteresis loop in the Force-Velocity Diagram due to compressibility, cavitation and backlash, seems to have a smaller influence on shaker rig simulation correlation, especially in the low frequency range (0 3 Hz). It could be verified that accurate bushing and tire modeling is needed to obtain good correlation at higher frequencies (3 20 Hz). Convergence of simulations was found as a main issue for models that included friction. Validation of bushing and tire modeling, as well as accurate parametrization of friction and improved solve-ability of models with friction remain as future tasks...|$|R

Significant amount of loads are transmitted through the control arm while it serves to maintain the contact between the wheel and the road and thus providing precise control of the vehicle. The finite element analysis of the control arm using NEiNASTRAN is presented. Inertia relief analysis was carried out as the measured road loads were in self equilibrium. The zone of maximum stress {{in most of the}} load cases studied is close to the left strut bush and around the lower ball joint bush. Since the stresses exceed the material yield strength, a nonlinear static analysis of the control arm was also carried out using NEiNASTRAN and the results are compared well with MSC.

The BVS 10 is a twin-cab vehicle with articulated steering. Each cab has two tracks {{and in each}} track there are twelve wheels. The two rearmost wheels keep the right track tension while the other wheels are mounted to the spring elements via swing axles. The spring elements are rubber torsion <b>bushings</b> <b>mounted</b> in the skid beam attached to the chassis. The weight of the BVS 10 has increased from 11 to 16 tons because of increased levels of protection. The increased weight affects the lifespan of the spring elements negatively. The aim of this master thesis {{is to develop a}} help spring system for the BVS 10 that is mountable on an existing skid beam. After preparation, formulation of a product specification and generation of ideas a couple of concept proposals was presented. The concepts were compared among themselves and against the product specification. After evaluation the leaf spring concept was chosen. The function of the leaf spring is verified by calculations and simulations, also ideas about materials and mounting is presented. The help spring system will increase the stiffness of the spring system of the all terrain vehicle, give a higher ground clearance and relive the rubber torsion bushings.
