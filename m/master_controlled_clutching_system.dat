This paper {{put forward}} an {{automobile}} intelligent electronic <b>control</b> automatic <b>clutch</b> <b>systems,</b> use the electromagnet controlled by circuit {{to replace the}} clutch pedal of manual car. Through the switch, we can automatically control the detachment and combination of the initiative part and the driven part of clutch, which makes the operation of automatic car more convenience. Research Background In {{the light of the}} rapid development of the modern era automobile, the paper analysis the problem that the advantages of car manual and automatic transmission are not compatible. Then, in order to reduce technical difficulty of the shift operation and labor intensity, and makes the driving comfortable, we carry out the study of intelligent electronic <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of automatic <b>clutch.</b> The automatic <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> will not change the dry friction clutch and manual shift transmission of vehicle configuration, it realizes the automatic <b>control</b> by the <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> constituted of mechanical, electronic and sensor. Because the coexistence of two sets of pedal and automatic control system are at the same time, and the operation of the two systems will not influence each other, the driver can choose to use at any time. Manual car installed electric vehicle intelligent automatic <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> will give the left foot of the driver complete liberation, which makes th...|$|R
40|$|The {{modelling}} of {{a clutch}} {{in a power}} train transmission is a delicate process because of its non-linear behaviour. Two different states {{have to be taken}} into account: when the clutch is locked and when the clutch is slipping. Moreover the clutch has often to be controlled automatically in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). An Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) of a <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> has been developed for insertion in a complete model of HEV. Both clutch states are genuinely taken into account in a physical way. In this paper, an inversion-based <b>control</b> of the <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> is defined from its EMR. This control is used in the control of a conventional vehicle before being implemented on HEVs. Experimental results are provided to validate the clutch model and the inversion-based control...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{electronically}} <b>controlled</b> slipping <b>clutch</b> {{is gradually}} increasing for a marine propulsion system. This system can provide a continuous change of propeller revolution even in a lower revolution zone of prime mover. However, it hardy make the decelerating condition, because the slipping clutch itself can not make the negative torque. In this paper, the authors have designed a push-pull control system using two slipping clutches {{in order to improve}} the above disadvantage of the conventional slipping clutch. For the evaluation of this system, the whole propulsion system including prime mover, clutches, propeller and ship are numerically simulated using the precise mathematical model described here. From several accelerating and decelerating simulations, the following results are pointed out. 1) FPP’s revolution can be easily changed in the slipping zone by using this system, although the main engine is governed constant revolution. 2) Astern and ahead maneuvering is also performed by this system. 3) The mathematical model for this simulation including engine, clutch, propeller and ship is useful for the design and evaluation of the whole propulsion system. As the result, this push-pull <b>controlled</b> slipping <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> will be very useful for a marine propulsion system. 第 6 回舶用機関国際シンポジウム ISME (International Symposium on Marine Engineering) Tokyo 2000, 場所：日本都市センター会館, 会期： 10 月 23 日- 27...|$|R
50|$|The {{design team}} gained {{confidence}} in their concept in 1989, when they made a breakthrough in the multi-disc <b>clutch's</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Development of closed-loop control smoothed its operation. Using it, the multi-disc clutch made smaller adjustments, but did it more frequently. The microprocessor would review input from sensors every 20 milliseconds and decide if the front axle needed more torque. Using this technique, the unit's computer watched for drive wheel slip. If it sensed as little as half an rpm difference between {{the front and rear}} axles, it sent a power signal to the multi-disc clutch. The clutch engaged, diverting torque to the front axle in 10 percent increments, until it alleviated the drive wheel slip. As a result, the system could control runaway drive wheel speed in as little as a third of a wheel revolution.|$|R
40|$|Insects {{represent}} {{more than}} 60 % of all multicellular life forms, and are easily {{among the most}} diverse and abundant organisms on earth. They evolved functional wings {{and the ability to}} fly, which enabled them to occupy diverse niches. Insects of the hyper-diverse orders show extreme miniaturization of their body size. The reduced body size, however, imposes steep constraints on flight ability, as their wings must flap faster to generate sufficient forces to stay aloft. Here, we discuss the various physiological and biomechanical adaptations of the thorax in flies which enabled them to overcome the myriad constraints of small body size, while ensuring very precise control of their wing motion. One such adaptation is the evolution of specialized myogenic or asynchronous muscles that power the high-frequency wing motion, in combination with neurogenic or synchronous steering muscles that control higher-order wing kinematic patterns. Additionally, passive cuticular linkages within the thorax coordinate fast and yet precise bilateral wing movement, in combination with an actively <b>controlled</b> <b>clutch</b> and gear <b>system</b> that enables flexible flight patterns. Thus, the study of thoracic biomechanics, along with the underlying sensory-motor processing, is central in understanding how the insect body form is adapted for flight...|$|R

30|$|High {{temperatures}} {{appear in}} the contacting surfaces of a single-disc <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> (friction <b>clutch</b> disc, flywheel and pressure plate) due to the relative motion between these parts during the sliding period. These high temperatures are responsible for several disadvantages such as increasing wear rate, surface cracks and permanent distortions. In some cases, these disadvantages may lead the contacting surfaces to failure before the expected lifetime. In this work, mathematical models of the friction <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> (single-disc <b>clutch)</b> were built to find the temperature field during the sliding period (single engagement). Analysis has been completed using developed axisymmetric models to simulate the friction <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> during the engagement.

40|$|Abstract: A typical <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> for {{automotive}} manual transmissions transfers {{hydraulic pressure}} generated by driver's pedal manipulation to the clutch diaphragm spring. The foot effort history {{during the period}} of push is different than the period of the clutch pedal’s return. The effort or load difference is called clutch foot effort hysteresis. It is known that the hysteresis is caused by friction. The frictional force and moment are produced between various component contact points such as between the rubber seal and the inner wall inside the hydraulic cylinder and between the diaphragm spring and the pressure plate, etc. Understanding the clutch pedal foot effort hysteresis is essential for a <b>clutch</b> release <b>system</b> design and analysis. The dynamic model for a <b>clutch</b> release <b>system</b> is developed for the foot effort hysteresis prediction and a simulation analysis is performed to propose a tool for analysing a <b>clutch</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} clutch design is strongly {{dependent upon the}} frictional heat generated between contact surfaces during the slipping at beginning of engagement. Because of that the frictional heat generated firstly will reduce the performance of <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> and then will lead to premature failure in some cases. Finite element method was used to investigate aneffect of thermal load type on the temperature field of the <b>clutch</b> <b>system.</b> Two-dimensional axisymmetric model was used to study the temperature distribution for the <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> (pressure plate, <b>clutch</b> disc and flywheel) during heating phase (slipping period) and in the cooling phase (full engagement period). Depending on basic {{friction clutch}} design two types of thermal loads were applied; load type A (uniform pressure) and load type B (uniform wear).
