5|$|According to David White, Yoga Yajnavalkya was <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> in {{practice}} than the Patanjali's Yogasutras before the 12th century. Among the texts on asanas and meditation, it dominated the Indian yoga scene. Along with texts such as Yoga Vasistha, chapters embedded inside the Hindu epic the Mahabharata and literature related to traditions such as Hatha Yoga, Pashupata Yoga and Tantric Yoga, the Yoga Yajnavalkya was historically influential in Indian spiritual traditions.|$|E
5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women. Bisexual women {{appeared to}} be more influenced by involvement in homosexual genital activities in childhood than exclusively homosexual women, but unlike exclusively homosexual women, their homosexual preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> for exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> for women who had been in psychotherapy than for women who had not.|$|E

No significant association between age, diagnosis at ICU admission, length of stay ICU, severity of illness, delirium and use of sedatives, and HAD was seen.|$|R
5|$|Besides Litvinenko, {{only two}} people left {{polonium}} trails: Lugovoy and Kovtun, who were school friends and worked previously for Russian intelligence in the KGB and the GRU, respectively. They left <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> traces of polonium than Litvinenko, indicating that they handled the radioactive material directly, and did not ingest it.|$|E

5|$|In {{countries}} like Canada {{it is possible}} that small precursor earthquake swarms might go undetected, particularly if no events were observed; <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> events in larger swarms would be detected but only a minor subdivision of the swarm events would be complex to clarify them with confidence as volcanic in nature, or even associate them with an individual volcanic edifice.|$|E
5|$|In the {{fortified}} suburb are {{the minimal}} remains of two <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> structures. One was a sacral complex, Blagoveštenjska crkva (Annunciation Church), where the Saint's relics were stored. Though its construction {{began in the}} 15thcentury, it was built over several historical phases. The second structure was a Turkish bath from the 17thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Reenlisted {{prisoners of}} war formed a large section of the {{approximately}} 30,800 former Austria-Hungarian citizens who were registered as active on the Romanian side by late 1917. By the time it stopped recruiting (January 1918), the Corps had enlisted some 8,500 to 10,000 men. However, the Kornilov order came {{too late in the}} war for there to have been a <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> Transylvanian-Bukovinan contribution to the Romanian effort.|$|E
5|$|Section 25 {{was not a}} <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> {{source of}} {{criminal}} appeals in large part becauseas Barron v.

5|$|The {{first day}} at Gettysburg, <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> than simply a prelude to the bloody second and third days, ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged.

50|$|This {{is another}} {{advantage}} of using , because it incorporates {{the idea that}} complete antireciprocal is <b>more</b> statistical <b>significant</b> in the networks with larger density, while {{it has to be}} regarded as a less pronounced effect in sparser networks.|$|R
5000|$|One {{disadvantage}} of PCR {{is that it}} consumes time uncoiling the double-stranded DNA with heat into single strands (a process called denaturation) [...] This leads to amplification times typically thirty minutes or <b>more</b> for <b>significant</b> production of amplified products.|$|R

5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} 2010 by Nekaris etal. {{reported}} that Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand {{were the primary}} exporters of slow lorises, with Singapore and Malaysia also involved. China and Indonesia were also known for international trade, although their local trade was <b>more</b> <b>significant.</b> Slow loris parts were typically exported from Thailand and Cambodia, but Malaysia and Singapore primarily exported live animals. The most noteworthy importer was Japan, followed by the United States and then the European Union. More than half of 400illegal imports were live animals (238), while the rest were either body parts (122) or unspecified (40).|$|E
30|$|Sample division: In {{order to}} make the {{classification}} result <b>more</b> statistically <b>significant,</b> the sample should be divided into training samples and test samples.
