25|$|From 1926 to 1941, {{scores on}} the SAT were scaled to make 500 the <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> on each section. In 1941 and 1942, SAT scores were {{standardized}} via test equating, and as a consequence, average verbal and math scores could vary from that time forward. In 1952, mean verbal and math scores were 476 and 494, respectively, and scores were generally stable in the 1950s and early 1960s. However, starting in the mid-1960s and continuing until the early 1980s, SAT scores declined: the average verbal score dropped by about 50 points, and the average math score fell by about 30 points. By the late 1970s, only the upper third of test takers were {{doing as well as}} the upper half of those taking the SAT in 1963. From 1961 to 1977, the number of SATs taken per year doubled, suggesting that the decline could be explained by demographic changes in the group of students taking the SAT. Commissioned by the College Board, an independent study of the decline found that most (up to about 75%) of the test decline in the 1960s could be explained by compositional changes in the group of students taking the test; however, only about 25 percent of the 1970s decrease in test scores could similarly be explained.

Procedures: This research is restricted to 168 students enrolled in Education, Family Life, and Psychology classes at Oregon State University. The control variables used in making the sample selection were sibling's sex, age spacing of the subject and subject's sibling, cultural background, socio-economic status, and subject's age. These subjects were administered the TSCS during the Fall quarter of 1973 and were than divided into the following three main groups: 1) The Inflated Score Group - 37 subjects with false positive TSCS scores. 2) The Honest Group - 131 subjects with valid TSCS scores. 3) The Total Group - 168 subjects from the Inflated Score Group plus the Total Group. Identification of subjects within these three groups allowed for separate evaluations of the subject's TSCS scores that were seriously inflated by defensiveness. Statistical Design: The following null hypotheses were tested for significance at the. 05 level on the Inflated Score Group, the Honest Group, and the Total Group: 1) There is no difference between <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> for first borns and later borns for any of the 29 TSCS scores. 2) There is no difference between <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> of males and females for any of the 29 TSCS scores. 3) There is no interaction effect between birth order and sex as measured by any of the 29 TSCS <b>mean</b> <b>scores.</b> The level to be reached for significance for all statistical procedures was set at the. 05 level. The statistical procedure used as a basis for retention or rejection of the null hypothesis was the 2;: 2 fixed model analysis of variance design which used the "F" statistic. Findings: (A) Inflated Score Group: The null hypotheses were accepted. (B) Honest Group: Null hypothesis one and three were accepted with null hypothesis two being rejected. The TSCS scores that resulted in having a significant sex effect for this group were the Positive - Identity Score, the Distribution Sub-Score 2, the Distribution Sub-Score 1, the Psychosis Score, and the Personality Disorder Score. The males had significantly higher Distribution Sub-Score 2 <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> and Psychosis <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> as compared to females. The females had significantly higher Positive - Identity <b>mean</b> <b>scores,</b> Distribution Sub-Score 1 <b>mean</b> <b>scores,</b> and Personality Disorder <b>Mean</b> <b>Scores.</b> (C) Total Group: Null hypothesis one and three were accepted with null hypothesis two being rejected. The TSCS scores that resulted in having a significant sex effect for this group were the Positive - Identity Score, the Psychosis Score, and the Personality Disorder Score. The males had significantly higher Psychosis <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> as compared to females. The females had significantly higher Positive - Identity <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> and Personality Disorder <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> as compared to males. Conclusions: Although there was no significant birth order or interaction effect between birth order and sex, there was a significant sex effect. This indicated that males had lower self-concepts than females as measured by the following TSCS scores: the Personality Disorder Score, the Psychosis Score, the Positive - Identity Score, and the Distribution Sub-Score 1.
