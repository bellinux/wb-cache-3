40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground In intact knee joints, tibial cartilage is divided into 2 re-gions: the cartilage covered by the <b>menisci</b> and that un-covered by <b>menisci.</b> Cartilage uncovered by <b>menisci</b> bears the body weight directly, whereas cartilage covered by <b>menisci</b> does so indirectly through the <b>menisci.</b> The pattern of loading during locomotion has a substantial influence on the general characteristic of the regional variation of cartilage [1]. Therefore, cartilage covered by <b>menisci</b> is thinner than cartilage uncovered by <b>menisci</b> [2]. However, it has been suggested that post-meniscectomy structural changes in the knee lead to al-terations in the tibial contact area and cartilage thickness [3]. Kinematic changes have been implicated as a cause of osteoarthritis (OA) [4], and broaden areas of cartilage degeneration [5]. Recently, tibial cartilage covered b...|$|R
50|$|In 1978, Shrive et al. {{reported}} that the collagen fibers of the <b>menisci</b> are oriented in a circumferential pattern. When a compressive force is applied in the knee joint, a tensile force is transmitted to the <b>menisci.</b> The femur attempts to spread the <b>menisci</b> anteroposteriorly in extension and mediolaterally in flexion. Shrive et al. further studied {{the effects of a}} radial cut in the peripheral rim of the <b>menisci</b> during loading. In joints with intact <b>menisci,</b> the force was applied through the <b>menisci</b> and articular cartilage; however, a lesion in the peripheral rim disrupted the normal mechanics of the <b>menisci</b> and allowed it to spread when a load was applied. The load now was distributed directly to the articular cartilage. In light of these findings, it is essential to preserve the peripheral rim during partial meniscectomy to avoid irreversible disruption of the structure's hoop tension capability.|$|R

5|$|During {{the end of}} {{his final}} season at Vicenza, Baggio {{shattered}} both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the <b>meniscus</b> of his right knee while playing against Rimini on 5 May 1985, while attempting a slide tackle. The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and it seriously threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not play again, Fiorentina retained their faith in him, agreeing to commit to the transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of many reasons for Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E
50|$|These <b>menisci</b> act to {{distribute}} body weight across the knee joint. Without the <b>menisci,</b> {{the weight of}} the body would be unevenly applied to the bones in the legs (the femur and tibia).

The <b>menisci</b> also contribute to the stability of the joint.|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the early biomechanical {{alterations}} of <b>menisci</b> during the early stage of osteoarthritis (OA) development and to correlate them with the chemical composition and matrix alteration. A particular focus was paid to pathological changes in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and collagen fiber architecture. DesignMenisci (n =  24) were removed from rabbits' knee joints 6  weeks following surgical anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). Both the anterior and posterior regions of medial and lateral <b>menisci</b> were characterized using indentation tests, Raman microspectroscopy (RM), biphotonic confocal microscopy (BCM) and histology. ResultsMechanical and matrix alterations occurred in both regions of medial and lateral <b>menisci.</b> A significant decrease in the mechanical properties was observed in OA <b>menisci,</b> with a mean reduced modulus from 2. 3 to 1. 1  MPa. Microstructural observations revealed less organized and less compact collagen bundles in operated <b>menisci</b> than in contralateral <b>menisci,</b> as well as a loss of fiber tension. GAG content was increased in OA <b>menisci,</b> especially in the damaged areas. Neither changes in the secondary structure of collagen nor mineralization were detected through RM at this stage of OA. ConclusionACLT led to a disorganization of the collagen framework at the early stage of OA development, which decreases the mechanical resistance of the <b>menisci.</b> GAG content increases in response to this degradation. All of these results demonstrate the strong correlation between matrix and mechanical alterations...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the changes of knee <b>menisci</b> in osteoarthritis (OA) in human. MethodsOA and control <b>menisci</b> {{were obtained from}} 42 end-stage OA knees with medial involvement and 28 non-arthritic knees of age-matched donors, respectively. The change of <b>menisci</b> in OA was evaluated by histology, and gene expression of major matrix components and anabolic factors was analyzed in the anterior horn segments by quantitative PCR (qPCR). In those regions of <b>menisci,</b> the rate of collagen neo-synthesis was evaluated by [3 H]proline incorporation, and the change of matrix was investigated by ultrastructural observation and biomechanical measurement. ResultsIn OA <b>menisci,</b> the change in histology was rather moderate in the anterior horn segments. However, despite the modest change in histology, the expression of type I, II, III procollagens was dramatically increased in those regions. The expression of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) was markedly enhanced in OA <b>menisci,</b> which was considered to be responsible, at least partly, for the increase in procollagen gene expression. Interestingly, in spite of marked increase in procollagen gene expression, incorporation of [3 H]proline increased only modestly in OA <b>menisci,</b> and impaired collagen synthesis was suggested. This finding was consistent with the results of ultrastructural observation and biomechanical measurement, which indicated that the change of meniscal matrix was modest in the macroscopically preserved areas of OA <b>menisci.</b> ConclusionAlthough the expression of major matrix components was markedly enhanced, matrix synthesis was enhanced only modestly, and the changes of matrix in human OA <b>menisci</b> were rather modest in the non-degenerated areas...|$|R
