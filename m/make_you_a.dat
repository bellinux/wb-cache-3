You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{had first}} previewed the video in an American Idol {{exclusive}} on February 2, 2012, {{and the full}} video premiered the next day on her YouTube channel. The video starts as the words [...] "Fans can make you famous, a contract can make you rich, the press can <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> superstar, but only luv [...] can <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> player" [...] appear on a brick wall. Cheerleaders M.I.A. and Minaj then sing the opening lyrics in a suburban neighborhood alongside other cheerleaders wearing animegao masks. Madonna sings the first verse as she exits {{a house with a}} baby stroller and wears a trench coat and sunglasses, all of which are soon discarded. Emerging football players protect her from obstacles, golden raindrops and destroy a car that gets in her way. They hold her perpendicular to a wall and she walks horizontally. Throughout the video, Madonna can be seen dancing and singing in front of a brick wall, and in one scene she holds a baby doll.|$|E

500|$|On 22 June 1941, the {{day when}} Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Pechersky was conscripted into the Soviet Red Army with a rank of junior Lieutenant. By September 1941, he was {{promoted}} to the rank of lieutenant quartermaster (class II). In the early autumn of 1941, he rescued his wounded commander from being captured by the Germans. He didn't receive any medals for this deed. One of his fellow soldiers reportedly said: [...] "Sasha, if what you've done doesn't <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hero, I don't know who is!" [...] In October 1941, during the Battle of Moscow, their unit was surrounded and captured by the Germans in the pocket at the city of Vyazma, Smolensk Oblast.|$|E
500|$|Henry was bankrupted by his {{military}} expenditure and general extravagance. The pope offered Henry's brother Richard the Kingdom of Sicily, {{but the military}} cost of displacing the incumbent Emperor Frederick was prohibitive. Matthew Paris wrote that Richard stated: [...] "You might as well say, 'I <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> present of the moon—step {{up to the sky}} and take it down'." [...] Instead, Henry purchased the kingdom for his son Edmund, which angered many powerful barons. The barons led by Henry's brother-in-law Simon de Montfort forced him to agree to the Provisions of Oxford, under which his debts were paid in exchange for substantial reforms. In France, with the Treaty of Paris, Henry formally surrendered the territory of his Angevin ancestors to Louis IX of France, receiving in return the title duke of Aquitaine and the territory of Gascony as a vassal of the French king.|$|E

After Australian Crawl disbanded, Reyne {{went on to}} a solo career. His first few singles failed to chart but 1987's [...] "Fall of Rome" [...] and the self-titled album that followed were the beginning of a string of hits that lasted until the early 1990s. In 1992 he and James Blundell had a hit with a cover of The Dingoes' [...] "Way Out West" [...] (#2, May 1992). Reyne also formed Company of Strangers that year with former Sherbet lead singer Daryl Braithwaite, Simon Hussey and Jef Scott. Company of Strangers only released one self-titled album, Company of Strangers in 1992, which produced the hits [...] "Motor City (I Get Lost)" [...] (#26, September 1992), [...] "Sweet Love" [...] (#21, January 1993) and [...] "Daddy's Gonna <b>Make</b> <b>You</b> <b>a</b> Star" [...] (#35, March 1993).|$|E
500|$|When {{some days}} passed without any further {{word on the}} matter, {{follow-up}} messages were sent on 6 and 9 March. By 10 March, MacArthur had decided that the Bataan front was not in danger of imminent collapse, and replied {{that he planned to}} depart on 15 March, when the submarine [...] was scheduled to arrive at Corregidor. Radio broadcasts in the United States calling for MacArthur to be placed in charge in Australia had been picked up by MacArthur's headquarters in Corregidor, and it had to be assumed that the Japanese had heard them too. There were ominous signs: Japanese surface patrols had been stepped up in the Subic Bay area, and there were reports of Japanese destroyers heading north from the southern Philippines. MacArthur therefore elected not to wait for the Permit, but to leave as soon as possible, by PT boat on the night of 11 March. Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright was left in command on Bataan and Corregidor. [...] "When I get back", MacArthur told him, [...] "if you're still on Bataan, I'll <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lieutenant general." [...] Wainwright replied: [...] "I'll be on Bataan if I'm still alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{emphasize}} winning, Tunis {{believed that}} values like {{hard work and}} perseverance could be taught through sports. The 1951football brochure for the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology Athletic Scholarship committee cites Tunis, saying [...] "The athletic department would like {{to feel that the}} existing program can do for the engineer what John Tunis had in mind when he said, 'The deep objective of games really is to train one’s reflex of purpose to develop a habit of keeping steadily at something you want until it is done. Many of Tunis' biggest heroes find themselves eventually brought low, like Roy Tucker in The Kid Comes Back, whose wartime service injury may have destroyed his career, or Iron Duke Jim Wellington at Harvard, ostracized and lonely, who perseveres by running track. The real victory is in the character's refusal to give up against long odds. [...] "My heroes are the losers" [...] he once said. [...] "All my books have been in that vein. Every book I've ever written." [...] In the Introduction to The Kid from Tomkinsville, Bruce Brooks writes [...] "for Tunis a win was what happened at the ballpark some of the time, usually just before a loss. It didn't <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> good person, [...] than a loss made you a jerk." ...|$|E

500|$|Smith {{worked on}} the Zuninos' farm and began {{studying}} the Italian language, which he realised he had to learn if he was to travel through enemy territory to the Allied lines. After a month, the local partisan commander, Antonio Bozzano (nicknamed [...] "Barbetta" [...] because of his beard), came to meet Smith, {{and asked him to}} join his ranks. Smith accompanied Barbetta to his headquarters, about [...] away in a village called Piancastagna. When Barbetta asked his rank, Smith said he was a captain. [...] "Oh well," [...] Barbetta replied, tapping him on the shoulder; [...] "you are now a major. I <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> major." [...] Smith realised that Barbetta had given him this [...] "promotion" [...] in the hope of elevating his own reputation in the resistance movement—"none of the other regiments in the area could boast an Inglesi pilote and a majore to boot", he explained in his memoirs. Smith got on well with Barbetta, and took part in sabotage operations for about three months during late 1944. Meanwhile, he became proficient in Italian. After the Germans pulled out of their local garrison at Sassello in October 1944, Smith told Barbetta {{that he was going to}} attempt to return to the Allied lines. The partisans tried to talk him out of it, telling him it was too risky, but when Smith insisted, they gave him letters to take with him, endorsing him to other Italian partisan groups he might encounter on his way. A British Army corporal known to Smith as [...] "Bill", who had been hiding in a nearby village, asked if he could come as well, and Smith agreed.|$|E
500|$|Florey owned no {{camera at}} the time, and {{his efforts to}} obtain one were {{unsuccessful}} until he met Vorkapić. Florey said of their discussion: [...] "I say to Slav, 'Slav, I have an idea but not much money. You have a camera and are a clever painter. Let's make the picture in collaboration and we split the benefit.'" [...] Vorkapić himself claimed to have said: [...] "Florey, you get me 100 dollars and I'll <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> picture in my own kitchen." [...] Vorkapić allowed Florey to borrow a small box camera that he had purchased with the proceeds {{from the sale of}} one of his oil paintings. It was a DeVry camera with one lens, a type that Florey said was sold as a [...] "toy". Florey also had trouble obtaining film, as he found it cost-prohibitive to purchase negative and positive film from film laboratories. However, Florey knew that [...] "film ends", scraps of leftover unexposed film stock, were often discarded after shooting on big budget Hollywood films, so he attempted to persuade filmmakers to give them to him. Camera work had just been completed on The Gaucho, a film starring Douglas Fairbanks, {{and he was able to}} obtain more than 1,000 feet of film from the production in 10- and 20-foot strips. Florey then spliced the film ends together by hand, a process he found time-consuming and frustrating, but one that resulted in the equivalent of a full reel of negative film. Fairbanks, who had previously hired Florey to handle his European public relations, provided financial assistance for the production of A Hollywood Extra. He also gave Florey access to his editing rooms and helped provide him with film ends.|$|E

2500|$|Hussey {{worked on}} further solo {{material}} by both Braithwaite and James Reyne. In 1991 Hussey formed Company of Strangers with Braithwaite, Reyne and Jef Scott (backing and session musician for both artists). The group issued a self-titled debut album (November 1992) which peaked at No.9, and provided three top40 singles [...] "Sweet Love" [...] (June), [...] "Motor City (I Get Lost)" [...] (September), and [...] "Daddy's Gonna <b>Make</b> <b>You</b> <b>a</b> Star" [...] (January 1993).
