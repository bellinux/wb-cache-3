40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{conflict}} of trawl has been occurring for {{long time in}} Aceh.  Using trawl is not only illegal but also resulted in a decrease of catcher number got by fishermen in the place. This article aims to explain the conflict in Lhok Meureubo {{in relation to the}} legal ban of the usage of trawl, the conflict settlement process, as well as the steps taken by the Government of West Aceh district in anticipating its usage in the future. The methods applied include normative and empirical research. The normative research is done through legal materials. While the empirical one is conducted by interviewing a sample of purposively selected sample. The conflict in Lhok Meureubo is due to the use of trawling gear, it has been happening since 2003. The conflicts come up by the use of trawl types that are not environmentally friendly. The use of such fishery catcher has been taking time for a long time, but after the tsunami, the use of mini-trawling increasingly from a variety of aid for tsunami victims. The steps taken by the Government of West Aceh district to overcome the problem in the future, is especially by replacing the trawl gear with the one that is more environmentally friendly. The fishermen who use the trawl which the boat already registered is then reported to the Department of Marine and Fisheries of West Aceh district to get the trawl replaced by environmentally friendly trawl.   A Settlement <b>Model</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trawl</b> Conflict in West Ace...|$|E

40|$|An {{ecological}} economic <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> {{is presented}} to demonstrate the effect <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> location choice strategy on net input (rate of economic gain of fish caught per time spent less costs). Fishing location choice {{is considered to be}} a dynamic process whereby trawlers chose from among a repertoire of plastic strategies that they modify if their gains fall below a fixed proportion of the mean gains of the fleet as a whole. The distribution of fishing across different areas of a fishery follows an approximate ideal free distribution (IFD) with varying noise due to uncertainty. The least-productive areas are not utilised because initial net input never reaches the mean yield of better areas subject to competitive exploitation. In cases, where there is a weak temporal autocorrelation between fish stocks in a specific location, a plastic strategy of local translocation between trawls mixed with longer-range translocation increases realised input. The trawler can change its translocation strategy in the light of information about recent trawling success compared to its long-term average but, in contrast to predictions of the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) model, does not know for certain what it will find by moving, so may need to sample new patches. The combination of the two types of translocation mirrored beam-trawling strategies used by the Dutch fleet and the resultant distribution <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> effort is confirmed by analysis of historical effort distribution <b>of</b> British otter <b>trawling</b> fleets in the North Sea. Fisheries exploitation represents an area where dynamic agent-based adaptive models may be a better representation of the economic dynamics of a fleet than classically inspired optimisation models.

40|$|Fishermen and {{scientists}} {{have noted that}} fish species distributions are changing along the Northeast Continental Shelf in response to local climate variability and large scale warming trends. NEFSC semiannual trawl survey data have been modeled to demonstrate these distributional and poleward shifts in species assemblages, but New England groundfishermen argue that management structures are slow to reflect these changes and that species distribution <b>modeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>trawl</b> survey data has failed to accurately characterize them. Fishermen have requested an outlet to submit information to scientists regarding where they are encountering shifting species while fishing. Data collected by fishermen themselves may be suitable for gaining {{a deeper understanding of}} moving fish populations. In response, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and Island Institute have proposed to create a phone application that would allow fishermen to take photographs of species they encounter and log the location {{at the time of the}} photograph. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether data submitted though such an application would be useful to scientists in <b>modeling</b> distributional shifts <b>of</b> commercially important species. I created a proxy for data submitted by commercial fishermen on red hake and used it as input data in maximum entropy models to determine whether such data would be comprehensive enough or spatially distributed in a manner that would make it suitable for species distribution modeling. All “citizen science” datasets of varying sample size and spatial distribution produced models with AUC values greater than 0. 75, while the baseline models using presence data from the trawl survey had lower AUC values around 0. 7. Our results indicate that concentrated data from fishing areas can lead to underestimation of species presence probability in regions where no fishing occurred. This happened because the fishing data used to generate random points from fishermen only covered part of the study region. Findings of this study suggest that presence data from fishermen are suitable for presence-only maximum entropy species distribution models, but actual Citizen science data collection and further modeling should include data from fishermen in the Mid-Atlantic to produce more robust and reliable models...|$|R

40|$|Thirty-seven hauls <b>of</b> {{a bottom}} <b>trawl</b> were carried out, {{as part of}} a {{national}} French project. These sea trials were undertaken in an area with strong currents: up to 1 knot. The measurements at sea of the bottom bridle’s tension show a clear effect of the current. Although the water speed relative to the trawl is constant, when the boat tows with current, the bottom bridle’s tension increases, and when the boat tows against the current, the bottom bridle’s tension decreases. The mean bottom bridle tension is 7840 N and increases with a slope of 1197 N for each m/s of current.

40|$|Bottom trawls are a {{globally}} used {{fishing gear}} that physically disturb the seabed and kill non-target organisms, {{including those that}} are food for the targeted fish species. There are indications that ensuing changes to the benthic invertebrate community may increase the availability of food and promote growth and even fisheries yield of target fish species.

We <b>model</b> the effects <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> on a simple ecosystem of benthivorous fish and two food populations (benthos), susceptible and resistant to trawling.

Fishing may result in higher fish abundance, higher (maximum sustainable) yield and increased persistence of fish when the benthos which is the best-quality fish food is also more resistant to trawling. These positive effects occur in bottom-up controlled systems and systems with limited impact of fish feeding on benthos, resembling bottom-up control. Fishing leads to lower yields and fish persistence in all configurations where susceptible benthos are more profitable prey.

In the initial experiment, both the resolution and projection of the raster dataset are taken into account. It was found that, independently of the equal-area projection chosen for the analysis, the calculated areas are very similar, and the differences between them are insignificant. Likewise, any variation in the raster resolution did not change the computed area. Although the differences were shown to be insignificant, for the subsequent analysis we selected the cylindrical equal area projection, as it implies rectangular spatial extent, along with the automatically derived resolution. Then, in the second experiment, we focused on demersal fish biomass data acquired from trawl samples taken from the western parts of ICES Sub-area VII, near the sea floor. The aforementioned investigation into processing bathymetric data allowed us to build various statistical models that account for a relationship between biomass, sea floor topography and geographic location.

The increased homogeneity, coupled with the displacement <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> activity to previously unfished areas, is predicted to have slightly greater cumulative impacts on total benthic invertebrate production and lead to localized reductions in benthic biomass for several years. To ensure the effective integration of fisheries and environmental management, the wider consequences of fishery management actions should be considered a priori. Thus, when seasonal closures increase the homogeneity of overall disturbance or lead to the redistribution <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> activity to environmentally sensitive or previously unfished areas, then effort reductions or permanent area closures should be considered as a management option. The latter would lead to a single but permanent redistribution of fishing disturbance, with lower cumulative impacts on benthic communities in the long run...|$|R

The model was validated by sampling 33 stations subject to a range <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> intensities in four shallow, soft sediment areas in the North Sea. Both the model and the field data demonstrated that trawling reduced biomass, production, and species richness. The impacts <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> were greatest in areas with low levels of natural disturbance, while the impact <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> was small in areas with high rates of natural disturbance. For the North Sea, the model showed that the bottom trawl fleet reduced benthic biomass and production by 56 % and 21 %, respectively, compared with an unfished situation. Because of the many simplifications and assumptions required to synthesize these data, additional work is required to refine the model and evaluate applicability in other geographic areas. Our model enables managers to understand the consequences of altering the distribution o...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the {{spatial distribution of}} young-of-the-year common sole based on beam trawl surveys conducted in late summer in the coastal and estuarine parts of the Bay of Biscay (France). Previous studies showed that habitat suitability for juvenile common sole varies according to physical factors and notably bathymetry and sediment structure. Nevertheless, {{the use of these}} descriptors alone to model habitat suitability led to considerable unexplained variability in juvenile common sole distribution. Hence, the epibenthic macro- and megafauna collected during beam trawl surveys was taken into account to improve <b>models</b> <b>of</b> habitat suitability for these juvenile flatfish. Ecotrophic guilds based on life traits (behaviour, mobility and feeding) were used to develop generic indicators <b>of</b> <b>trawled</b> benthic fauna. These synthetic descriptors were used in generalized linear <b>models</b> <b>of</b> habitat suitability in order to characterize the distribution of juvenile common sole. This approach significantly improved the description based on physical descriptors and allowed demonstrating that young common sole distribution is related to the density <b>of</b> <b>trawled</b> deposit and suspension feeders and also of carnivorous organisms. These models provide a reliable method to develop indicators of nursery habitat suitability from trawl survey data with the aim of assessing and surveying their quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this series of papers has been given in Part 1 (see Additional informations for details) which deals with the first known {{commercial}} fishery on the Wadge Bank from 1928 to 1935. There is no recorded trawling on the Bank between 1936 and 1944. This paper deals with {{the changes in the}} total catch (i. e. all species combined) per hour <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> in relation to the changes in fishing intensity from 1945, when the present trawling activities started, to 1960. The effect <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> on individual categories or varieties will be presented later...|$|R
