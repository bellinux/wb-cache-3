40|$|We {{calculate}} the scalar gravitational and matter perturbations {{in the context}} of slow-roll inflation with <b>multiple</b> scalar <b>fields,</b> that take values on a (curved) manifold, to first order in slow roll. For that purpose a basis for these perturbations determined by the background dynamics is introduced and <b>multiple</b> <b>field</b> slow-roll functions are defined. To obtain analytic solutions to first order, the scalar perturbation modes have to be treated in three different regimes. Consistency of the various approximations fixes their matching times. <b>Multiple</b> <b>field</b> effects in the gravitational potential are due to the rotation of the basis and to the particular solution caused by the coupling to the field perturbation perpendicular to the field velocity. They can contribute even to leading order if the corresponding <b>multiple</b> <b>field</b> slow-roll function is sizable during the last 60 e-folds. The analytical results are illustrated and checked numerically with the example of a quadratic potential...|$|R

25|$|Scientific {{exploration}} increased {{through the}} 18th century, {{with the most}} extensive surveys being carried out by William Scoresby, who published several papers on the Arctic, and Baltazar Mathias Keilhau. The latter {{was the first to}} carry out expeditions in the interior, abandoning the large-scale operations used by the British and Russians. With the exception of the British, smaller more targeted expeditions became the norm. Science also took foot as the dominant motivation for expeditions {{until the end of the}} 19th century. A notable exception was the French Recherche expedition of 1838–39, which resulted in numerous publications in <b>multiple</b> <b>fields</b> and the construction of an observatory. Swedish exploration started with Sven Lovén in 1837, with lead way to Sweden dominating scientific investigations in the last half of the century. Particularly Otto Torell and Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld dedicated much of their research to the archipelago. Martin Conway was the first to produce a map of the interior of Spitsbergen.|$|E

500|$|In the {{landmark}} treatise Foundations of Economic Analysis (1947), Paul Samuelson identified a common paradigm and mathematical structure across <b>multiple</b> <b>fields</b> in the subject, building on previous work by Alfred Marshall. Foundations took mathematical concepts from [...] physics and applied them to economic problems. This broad view (for example, comparing Le Chatelier's principle to tâtonnement) drives the fundamental premise of mathematical economics: systems of economic actors may be modeled and their behavior described much {{like any other}} system. This extension followed {{on the work of}} the marginalists in the previous century and extended it significantly. Samuelson approached the problems of applying individual utility maximization over aggregate groups with comparative statics, which compares two different equilibrium states after an exogenous change in a variable. This and other methods in the book provided the foundation for mathematical economics in the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|In his review, Destructoids Zack Furniss {{praised the}} sequel's tonal {{shift to a}} lack of {{seriousness}} and stated that its protagonist Marcus Holloway boasted a similar charm and wit. He thought well of the hacking component as it was suggestible to <b>multiple</b> <b>fields</b> of use, and enjoyed its nature of compatibility with a non-lethal approach; in fact, Furniss felt that for this reason firearms could have been excluded entirely. The driving was lauded as an improvement from the first game, yet technical issues like glitches and low frame rates were cited as shortcomings. To Matt Buchholtz, writing for EGM, the game signified [...] "less a hacktivist tale and more a beautiful immersion into the San Francisco Bay". The setting, characters and story were cited as considerable refinements from its predecessor. Buchholtz discerned that the tasks demanded to gain followers were successful in encouraging world exploration. He noted however that – in context of the main character – murder made little sense, which led to increased usage of stealth. Elise Favis at Game Informer both disparaged and praised elements in comparison to those of Watch Dogs. She enjoyed that hacking was prioritized in the gameplay and the new [...] "smoother" [...] driving mechanic, but saw inconsistencies in the protagonist's actions versus his personality and thought supporting characters [...] "too obnoxious and petty to be meaningful companions". Favis also experienced low frame rate capabilities on PlayStation 4. Aron Garst of Game Revolution stated that Watch Dogs 2 had redressed [...] "nearly every negative aspect of the original", and as such, marked a favorable change in the franchise.|$|E

2500|$|Historical ecology {{involves}} {{an understanding of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>fields</b> of study such as archaeology and cultural history as well as ecological processes, species diversity, natural variability, {{and the impact of}} human-mediated disturbances. Having a broad understanding of landscapes allows historical ecology to be applied to various disciplines. [...] Studying past relationships between humans and landscapes can successfully aid land managers by helping develop holistic, environmentally rational, and historically accurate plans of action. As summarized in the postulates of historical ecology, humans play significant roles in the creation and destruction of landscapes as well as in ecosystem function. Through experience, many indigenous societies learned how to effectively alter their landscapes and biotic distributions. Modern societies, seeking to curtail the magnitude of their effects on the landscape, can use historical ecology to promote sustainability by learning from the past. Farmers in the Amazon region, for example, now utilize nutrient-rich terra preta to increase crop yields much like the indigenous societies that lived long before them.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, the New Atheists became focal polemicists in modern {{criticism}} of religion. The four authors come from widely different backgrounds and have published books {{which have been}} much the focus of criticism of religion narratives, with over 100 books and hundreds of scholarly articles commenting on and critiquing the four Horsemen. The works have spawned debate in <b>multiple</b> <b>fields</b> of inquiry and are heavily quoted in popular forms of media (online forums, YouTube, television, popular philosophy). Philosopher Sam Harris, in The End of Faith, focuses on violence among other topics. Daniel Dennett, also a philosopher, in [...] focuses {{on the question of}} [...] "why we believe strange things". Biologist Richard Dawkins, in The God Delusion, focuses on knowledge and testing religious claims. Journalist and polemicist Christopher Hitchens, in God Is Not Great, focuses on attacks on human dignity by religious forces. According to Thomas Zenc, in the Oxford Handbook of Atheism, the four books were published during a time of intense debate on political, religious and sociological questions. The works share many common themes yet still have notable differences. While the beginnings of a broader narrative (New Atheism) seems to have emerged it does not, according to Zenc, stand up to the full definition of a movement.|$|E
2500|$|Paintball {{is played}} at both {{commercial}} venues, which require paid admission, and private land; {{both of which}} may include <b>multiple</b> <b>fields</b> of varying size and layout. Fields can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain, and may also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or urban area, and may involve a historical context. [...] Smaller fields (such as those used for speedball and tournament play) may include an assortment of various inflatable bunkers; these fields are less prone to cause injury as the bunkers {{are little more than}} air bags, which can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed of various rigid building materials, such as plywood and framing timber, shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic drainage pipe. The use of plastic pipe tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common features in inflatable fields, such as [...] "can" [...] and [...] "snake" [...] bunkers, were derived from similar features built with plastic drainage pipe). Recreational fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers.|$|E
2500|$|The university's push {{to create}} various institutes {{has led to}} greater funding and an {{increase}} in the number of researchers in <b>multiple</b> <b>fields.</b> ASU Knowledge Enterprise Development (KED) advances research, innovation, strategic partnerships, entrepreneurship, economic development and international development. KED is led by Sethuraman Panchanathan. KED supports several interdisciplinary research institutes and initiatives: Institute for Humanities Research, NewSpace Initiative, Biodesign Institute, Institute for the Science of Teaching and Learning, Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability, Institute for Social Science Research, LightWorks, McCain Institute for International Leadership, Decision Theater Network, Flexible Electronics and Display Center, Complex Adaptive Systems @ ASU, Global Security Initiative. Other notable and famed institutes at ASU are: The Institute of Human Origins, L. William Seidman Research Institute (W. P. Carey School of Business), Learning Sciences Institute, Herberger Research Institute, and the Hispanic Research Center. Much of the research conducted at ASU is considered cutting edge with its focus on interdisciplinarity. The Biodesign Institute for instance, conducts research on issues such as biomedical and healthcare outcomes as part of a collaboration with Mayo Clinic to diagnose and treat rare diseases, including cancer. Biodesign Institute researchers have also developed various techniques for reading and detecting biosignatures which expanded in 2006 with an $18million grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The institute also is heavily involved in sustainability research, primarily through reuse of CO2 via biological feedback and various biomasses (e.g. algae) to synthesize clean biofuels. Heliae is a Biodesign Institute spin-off and much of its business centers on algal-derived, high value products. Furthermore, the institute is heavily involved in security research including technology that can detect biological and chemical changes in the air and water. The university has received more than $30million in funding from the Department of Defense for adapting this technology for use in detecting the presence of biological and chemical weapons. Research conducted at the Biodesign Institute by ASU professor Charles Arntzen made possible the production of Ebola antibodies in specially modified tobacco plants that researchers at Mapp Biopharmaceutical used to create the Ebola therapeutic ZMapp. The treatment is credited with saving the lives of two aid workers. For his work, Arntzen was named the No. 1 honoree among Fast Company's annual [...] "100 Most Creative People in Business" [...] 2015 awards.|$|E
