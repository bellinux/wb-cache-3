5000|$|<b>Meromelia</b> is a {{birth defect}} {{characterized}} by the lacking of a part, but not all, {{of one or more}} limbs with the presence of a hand or foot. It results in a shrunken and deformed extremity.|$|E
5000|$|Amelia (from Greek ἀ- [...] "lack of" [...] plus μέλος (plural: μέλεα or μέλη) [...] "limb") is {{the birth}} defect of lacking {{one or more}} limbs. It can also result in a {{shrunken}} or deformed limb. For example, a child might be born without an elbow or forearm. The term may be modified to indicate the number of legs or arms missing at birth, such as tetra-amelia {{for the absence of}} all four limbs. A related term is <b>meromelia,</b> which is the partial absence of a limb or limbs.|$|E
40|$|Thirty three {{pregnant}} rabbits {{were exposed}} to vapour of 10 % formaldehyde (12 ppm) throughout the gestation period to know its effect on newborns. The results showed no abortion or foetal mortality {{but there were some}} anomalies (23. 8 %) among the newborns rabbits which includes: <b>meromelia</b> (6. 8 %), encephalocele (6. 1 %), Oligodactyly (4. 1 %), Umbilical hernia (3. 4 %) and Short tail (3. 4 %); besides that small for date and decrease in the body weight of the newborns were also noticed. These findings suggest that formaldehyde is a teratogenic agent...|$|E
40|$|AbstractExogenous {{retinoic acid}} (RA) induces marked effects on limb patterning, but the precise role of {{endogenous}} RA {{in this process}} has remained unknown. We have studied the role of RA in mouse limb development by focusing on CYP 26 B 1, a cytochrome P 450 enzyme that inactivates RA. Cyp 26 b 1 was shown to be expressed in the distal region of the developing limb bud, and mice that lack CYP 26 B 1 exhibited severe limb malformation (<b>meromelia).</b> The lack of CYP 26 B 1 resulted in spreading of the RA signal toward the distal end of the developing limb and induced proximodistal patterning defects characterized by expansion of proximal identity and restriction of distal identity. CYP 26 B 1 deficiency also induced pronounced apoptosis in the developing limb and delayed chondrocyte maturation. Wild-type embryos exposed to excess RA phenocopied the limb defects of Cyp 26 b 1 −/− mice. These observations suggest that RA acts as a morphogen to determine proximodistal identity, and that CYP 26 B 1 prevents apoptosis and promotes chondrocyte maturation, in the developing limb...|$|E
