40|$|The {{effects of}} early right <b>ear</b> <b>deafness</b> on lateralisation of {{auditory}} language functions {{are not fully}} known. A 36 year old right handed man, {{with a history of}} perinatal right <b>ear</b> <b>deafness</b> and undergoing evaluation for surgical treatment of seizures that began at age 10 years was studied. Language lateralisation testing by intracarotid sodium amobarbital injection showed receptive and expressive language functions to be strongly lateralised to the left hemisphere. Results with intracarotid sodium amobarbital injection further suggested that transmission of auditory input to the patient's left hemisphere was partially dependent on ipsilateral left ear pathways. Cortical language mapping through implanted subdural electrodes localised auditory language functions to traditional left posterior perisylvian language areas. These results suggest that early right <b>ear</b> <b>deafness</b> does not impede left hemisphere lateralisation and localisation of auditory language functions. Moreover, transmission of auditory information to the patient's left hemisphere seems to be accomplished, in part, by recruitment of ipsilateral left ear pathways. ...|$|R

The present study used long-term <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> pressure measurements in patients with Menière’s disease for the first time. Thirty-three patients with Menière’s disease used Otoflex 100 (GN Otometrics) to perform mobile repetitive tympanometry. Due to portability of the device, measurements were performed during daily activities by the subjects themselves. In addition to the long-term measurements, a <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> pressure equalization provocation test was performed during an elevator ride over 12 floors in the university hospital in Aachen. Comparisons with two control groups, one group of twenty patients with sensorineural hearing loss and one group of thirty healthy subjects, were made. The results of the long-term pressure measurements over 24 hours showed that the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> pressure of patients with Menière’s disease was significantly lower than the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> pressure of the two control groups. Furthermore, in patients with Menière’s disease, the ability of pressure equilibration in the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> was significantly worse than that of the control groups in the elevator provocation test. The results of both tests confirm the theory that Menière’s disease is related to a <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> ventilation. Both tests suggest a defective <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> ventilation in patients with Menière’s disease. The long-term measurement turned out to be a useful diagnostic method to split the heterogonous group of patients with Menière’s disease into two subgroups on the basis of a mean <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> pressure of - 40 daPa. Forty-five percent of all patients with Menière’s disease showed a very low <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> pressure which suggests that <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> ventilation might be involved in the pathogenesis of Menière’s disease.

Methods. Sixty-three patients with CSOM were enrolled in the study. Culture specimens were collected from the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> and nasopharynx of patients who were admitted for operation. Samples collections were performed 3 times; from the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> and nasophaynx at the admission day, from the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> during the operation, and from the external auditory canal post-operatively. Bacteria were identified by gram staining and biochemical tests. The correspondence rate of organisms which simultaneously exist in the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> and the nasopharynx was measured.

30|$|Despite much {{research}} being undertaken on the <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> {{it remains a}} large uncertainty {{in the development of}} a dynamic model for the transfer characteristics of the human <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> First, the dynamic response of the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> varies according to its geometrical structures of the <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> This variability primarily arises from the differences of the geometrical structure between individuals (Voss et al. 2008). A recent research (Voss et al. 2008; Shahnaz and Bork 2006) reported significant differences in energy reflectance of <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> between Caucasians and Chinese. Second, the material properties of the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> components, such as the tympanic membrane, joints, tendons, and ligaments, have much uncertainty so that for many components, only wide ranges of the real values can be estimated (Volandri et al. 2011; Volandri et al. 2012). Therefore, in order to develop a valid numerical model of the human <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> for individuals, the specific geometrical information of the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> should be included in the model and the numerical model should be validated using the experimental data.

In addition, trans-tympanic injection of macrophage migration inhibitory factor up-regulated expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 2 in the <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> These findings indicate that H. pylori infection causes immunological inflammation in <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> epithelium, and H. pylori may play a significant role in otitis media...|$|R
40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 6 months post date of publicationOtitis media (OM) (a <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> infection) is {{a common}} {{childhood}} illness that can leave some children with permanent hearing loss. OM can arise following infection {{with a variety of}} different pathogens, including a coinfection with influenza A virus (IAV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus). We and others have demonstrated that coinfection with IAV facilitates the replication of pneumococci in the <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> Specifically, we used a mouse model of OM to show that IAV facilitates the outgrowth of S. pneumoniae in the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> by inducing <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> inflammation. Here, we seek to understand how the host inflammatory response facilitates bacterial outgrowth in the <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> Using B cell-deficient infant mice, we show that antibodies {{play a crucial role in}} facilitating pneumococcal replication. We subsequently show that this is due to antibody-dependent neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in the <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> which, instead of clearing the infection, allows the bacteria to replicate. We further demonstrate the importance of these NETs as a potential therapeutic target through the transtympanic administration of a DNase, which effectively reduces the bacterial load in the <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> Taken together, these data provide novel insight into how pneumococci are able to replicate in the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> cavity and induce disease.

40|$|Objective: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to define the hearing and {{prevalence}} of abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status across childhood and into young adulthood and attempt to understand {{the effects of a}} higher prevalence of abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status on the auditory system. The prevalence of abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status is higher in children with cleft lip and palate or cleft palate (CP±L) than in children without CP±L. Little is known when or if the prevalence of abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status decreases as children age or the effects of this higher prevalence of abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status on hearing. Methods: The studies examined audiological and otological data from children with CP±L and children without CP±L at 1, 1. 5, 3 and 5 years of age, analysed audiological and otological data from adolescents with CP±L with and without additional malformations at 7, 10, 13 and 16 years of age, and presented hearing and speech recognition performance from a group of young adults with CP±L. Results: The prevalence of abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status was higher in children with CP±L than in children without CP±L. This higher prevalence of abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status decreased significantly with age and normalized by 13 years. Individuals with CP±L also presented with worse hearing in the low and mid frequencies which also normalized by 13 years of age. However, the hearing thresholds in the higher frequencies did not improve. When abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status was present, children with CP±L presented with significantly higher hearing thresholds than children without CP±L. In young adults, poorer speech recognition performance existed in those with abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status on the day of testing as compared to those without abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status. Conclusion: Higher prevalence of abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status is evident in individuals with CP±L. Also when a hearing loss is present, individuals with CP±L experience higher hearing thresholds than those without CP±L. This higher prevalence of abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status results in poorer high frequency hearing which could potentially lead to challenges in academics. It may also lead to difficulties understanding speech in social situations. Therefore, individuals with CP±L need regular audiolgical and otological follow-up to ensure management is appropriate and timely to ensure optimal speech, language, and auditory development as the presence of abnormal <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> status effects hearing outcomes...|$|R
