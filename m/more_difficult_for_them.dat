5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

With respect to strategic trade theory, the idea that governments introduce mechanisms, which attempt to capture increased market share and profits for domestic enterprises. Traditionally, creating national champions through industrial policy has been a mode of augmenting the competiveness of domestic enterprises engaged in commercial affairs.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Asian American {{women are}} often {{misunderstood}} and disfranchised due to stereotypes and microaggressions, {{and they are}} frequently excluded from the mainstream leadership agenda in higher education discourse. Using critical race feminism (CRF) as a conceptual framework, my qualitative research examined 11 Asian American women's career movements and leadership experiences in community colleges in Washington State. The study focused on the participants' counter narratives in regard to campus climate, microaggressions, mentoring, and goals and professional advancement. As a way to combat microaggressions in a chilly climate where they work, microresistance was also investigated. My findings showed that all participants faced complex realities of multiple marginalities, each being both "a woman" and "Asian American of color. " Under the conditions of such intersectionality, the participants were quick to identify the everyday microaggressions they encountered. Some of them were not so "micro," but "macro," and illustrated their icy climate in countless instances. However, the participants did not just passively endure these microaggressions. Rather, they proactively combated their invisibleness and inequalities through intentionally applying microresistances. Such efforts became forms of empowerment, collaboration, and resistance against institutional oppression, and ultimately became alternative ways of leading {{as well as of}} microresistance. Mentoring relationships were also applied as a form of microresistance. Despite such ongoing effort, however, the participants' encounters with numerous and accumulative microaggressions often solidified as a pattern of unequal power and created a <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> space <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to plan, anticipate, and pursue meaningful leadership positions. Yet, the study illuminated frequently overlooked activisms and microresistances by Asian American women, as well as their alternative ways of leading.

An important thing to him when making characters was to create a mystery behind them, to make players curious about who the characters are and what their pasts are like. Another important element was the use of misdirection: by deliberately making certain characters seem like bad people, he would aim to get players to focus on them more, making it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to see who the [...] "real bad guy" [...] is.

Because the player characters in most games can die many times, Uchikoshi felt that video game characters' deaths may be taken lightly, which he saw as a weak point in games. To combat this, he focused on trying to get players to want to keep the story alive, rather than trying to keep the player character alive; as a result of wanting to keep the story going, players would also avoid the death of their character.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the ships}} were being repaired, Jones {{had to deal}} with the {{consequences}} of landing in a neutral port with prizes of war. He turned on the charm for diplomatic negotiations at The Hague and networking in Amsterdam, where he was the toast of society, known as [...] "The Terror of the English". On 8 October, the British ambassador, Sir Joseph Yorke, wrote to the rulers of the United Provinces, claiming that under international law, Jones, not being accredited by a recognised state, was a rebel and a pirate. Therefore, the two captured ships should be detained for handing back to their rightful owners. Yorke also asked that the wounded from the two ships should be taken ashore and treated at British Government expense. That request was agreed to immediately, but it was over a fortnight later, during which repair work proceeded without any hindrance, when the Dutch replied that their neutrality meant they could not judge the legality of actions between foreigners on the open sea, but that that would also apply to any attempt made by the British to retake their ships once they left port. Furthermore, Jones’s squadron was obliged to leave the Texel [...] "as soon as possible", and could not be supplied with arms or ammunition except [...] "what are absolutely necessary to carry [...] them safe to the first foreign port they can come at". Yorke replied by quoting treaties, returning to the [...] "pirate" [...] theme, and pointing out that under Dutch law, commanders of foreign naval forces were obliged to present authorisation from their governments when docking in Dutch ports. As the United Provinces did not officially recognise the government of the United States, that was a very tricky legal point, which the Dutch took quite a while to consider. To get round the problem, Pallas and Vengeance were declared officially French, and Captain Cottineau became commodore of a French squadron, his flagship the captured Serapis. With Landais barred from command until the case against him could be heard, Jones became captain of the avowedly American Alliance, not associated in any way with the newly French squadron. Several Royal Navy ships were waiting just off the coast for the day he was obliged to leave—the Dutch authorities making a great show of trying to eject him—but as winter storms made it more and <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to keep station, John Paul Jones (after recruiting another American commander, Gustavus Conyngham, who had escaped from British captivity) slipped away among a group of Dutch ships on 27 December and sailed to France.|$|E

Benson takes on the most pervasive government activity, the criminal justice system, and addresses the critical issue of our high crime rate.

In 1723 a later edition appeared, including An Essay on Charity and Charity Schools, and A Search into the Nature of Society. It was vigorously combatted by, among others, Bishop Berkeley and William Law, author of The Serious Call, and in 1729 was made the subject of a prosecution for its immoral tendency. This essay criticised the charity schools, designed to educate the poor and, in doing so, instil virtue in them. Mandeville disagreed with the idea that education adds virtue because he did not believe that evil desires existed only in the poor, but rather he saw the educated and wealthy as much more crafty.

40|$|We examine {{new survey}} data on attitudes towards {{international}} trade showing {{that women are}} significantly less {{likely than men to}} support increasing trade with foreign nations.

We fail to find direct evidence supporting this proposition, however, since various indicators of the risks and the costs of job loss do not appear to be related at all to the gender gap in trade preferences or it’s expansion among older and married respondents. We also do not find any strong evidence that gender differences in non-material values or along ideological dimensions have any affect on attitudes toward trade. Female protectionism thus represents a compelling puzzle and, we suggest, a good focal point for theoretical work on the role of gender in political economy...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{peculiarities of}} fitness gyms is the {{succession}} of people who try and follow a training programme and {{are not able to}} stick to it. Based on ethnographic research I try to account for this phenomenon. For regular participants, fitness training is not only important for the kind of body it will hopefully produce in the long run, but also for how it is lived in the present. I will try to show that the way gyms are locally organized - spatiality and interaction rules during training - is as important for exercise adherence as the culturally shaped ideals which sustain fitness culture. In particular, gyms need to provide not only for the substantial body objectives pursued by clients but also for their expressive demands. They need to offer not only competent trainers, but also training spaces where clients may feel secure enjoying a measure of discretion and sober informality. Still, the correct attitude towards fitness work-out is not a passive lack of desire. Fitness work-out asks for the demonstration of a particular kind of desire: each client can and must learn to concentrate only on him or herself in the attempt to improve his or her own exercise performance. Elaborating on my fieldwork, I propose that the more participants in fitness measure themselves against each other and a fantasized body ideal the less will be their capacity to continue attending the gym regularly. The more the desired objectives are perceived as vital, the more participants will feel inadequate, and the <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> will be <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to concentrate on performing each and all movements and, consequently, to construct and continue a fitness programme. The possibility of filtering body ideals while pursuing an activity which is aimed at their achievement is decisive in protecting individuals from the dangerous exposure of their inadequacies.

In {{noticing the}} more {{prominent}} forms {{in which this}} faithlessness manifested itself, {{it is necessary to}} distinguish justly between that which was the consequence of respect for Paganism, and that which followed from the corruption of Catholicism. For as the Roman architecture is not to be made answerable for the primal corruption of the Gothic, so neither is the Roman philosophy to be made answerable for the primal corruption of Christianity. Year after year, as the history of the life of Christ sank back into the depths of time, and became obscured by the misty atmosphere {{of the history of the}} world,--as intermediate actions and incidents multiplied in number, and countless changes in men's modes of life, and tones of thought, rendered it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to imagine the facts of distant time,--it became daily, almost hourly, a greater effort for the faithful heart to apprehend the entire veracity and vitality of the story of its Redeemer; and more easy for the thoughtless and remiss to deceive themselves as to the true character of the belief they had been taught to profess. And this must have been the case, had the pastors of the Church never failed in their watchfulness, and the Church itself never erred in its practice or doctrine. But when every year that removed the truths of the Gospel into deeper distance, added to them also some false or foolish tradition; when wilful distortion was added to natural obscurity, and the dimness of memory was disguised by the fruitfulness of fiction; when, moreover, the enormous temporal power granted to the clergy attracted into their ranks multitudes of men who, but for such temptation, would not have pretended to the Christian name, so that grievous wolves entered in among them, not sparing the flock; and when, by the machinations of such men, and the remissness of others, the form and administrations of Church doctrine and discipline had become little more than a means of aggrandizing the power of the priesthood, it was impossible any longer for men of thoughtfulness or piety to remain in an unquestioning serenity of faith. The Church had become so mingled with the world that its witness could no longer be received; and the professing members of it, who were placed in circumstances such as to enable them to become aware of its corruptions, and whom their interest or their simplicity did not bribe or beguile into silence, gradually separated themselves into two vast multitudes of adverse energy, one tending to Reformation, and the other to Infidelity.|$|E

40|$|If {{clients are}} to be motivated, {{they have to be}} made desirous of {{achieving}} an objective, confident of their abilities, and capable of imagining the possibilities opened up to them after the objective is accomplished. This Bachelor paper aims to find out how the clients of senior-citizen facilities are motivated for self-care. Degenerative changes encountered in seniors often deteriorate their self-care performance. The older the people get, the <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> it seems <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to find reasons why they should keep themselves active. A nurse, therefore, has to encourage in them the proper attitude through which the seniors will be able to maintain or even improve their level of self-reliance. This paper is to map the motivation mechanisms at work in the clients of senior-citizen facilities operating in the Region of South Bohemia and to examine {{the way in which the}} nurses motivate the clients for self-care and self-reliance. The data were generated through a qualitative survey of two different non-standardized types of interviews. The first type of interview was carried out with nurses working at the nursing homes at Kaplice, Máj and a senior-citizen facility of the Staroměstská Center of Social Services. The second type of interview was conducted with randomly selected clients of the facilities. The survey revealed the way in which the nurses motivated the clients for self-care, as well as the motives, both personal and factual, behind such efforts encountered in the clients. Moreover, the nurses` attitudes were investigated about how the nursing process could be used to motivate the clients for self-care, and the clients` needs were examined as they related to the self-care motivation induced by the nursing process. Conclusions of the paper can provide a source of information for both managers of the facilities and the nurses delivering the care. Future investigation should seek a method in which the nursing process can better motivate the clients for self-care, and possibly it should focus on the nursing documentation. Nurses providing care at the senior-citizen facilities strive to motivate the clients to resume their self-assistance capabilities and keep the capabilities workable. The clients appreciate their efforts...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulty}} of decision - making by {{women who are}} widows compared to when they were wives was studied. The areas of decision-making that were rated as to difficult concerned family finance, child care, homemaking (family foods, clothing, home furnishings, and housing), social activities, and yard and car care. The sample consisted of 33 widows living in Logan, Utah during Spring Quarter, 1971. The subjects {{had at least one}} child living at home and had been widowed at least one year. The instruments used were: (l) a background questionnaire, and (2) a decision-making questionnaire. The statistical test used for analysis was the sign (binomial) test. Decisions concerning family finance, child care, cleaning and upkeep of the home, and yard care were <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the women as widows than such decisions had been <b>for</b> <b>them</b> as wives. Decisions concerning food, clothing, and home furnishings were not <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the women as widows. Decisions concerning washing the car were not <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> while decisions about maintenance, servicing, and repairs for the car were <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the women as widows. Decisions concerning social activities that are often done as individuals, not couples, were not <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the women as widows. Decisions concerning those social activities that couples often participate in were <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the women as widows than such decisions had been <b>for</b> <b>them</b> as wives...|$|R

Para isso, foram ressaltadas a relevância epidemiológica para a abordagem do tema; a importância do corpo para a mulher; e as influências histórico-culturais no comportamento preventivo das mulheres. Dessa forma, foi realizado um estudo teórico descritivo, usando como fonte principal de informações dados do Ministério da Saúde e do Instituto Nacional do Câncer (INCA) e como fonte de apoio livros, artigos científicos, periódicos e dissertações que abordam a temática proposta. A fim de discutir possibilidades estratégicas que possam ser eficazes para uma maior adesão feminina às campanhas preventivas, foi considerada a importância da forma de abordagem dos profissionais de saúde, salientando para que atuem correspondendo aos valores culturais apresentados pelas mulheres. Além disso, ressaltou-se a linguagem utilizada nas campanhas de prevenção do câncer do colo do útero, atentando para o fato de que conceitos transmitidos podem endossar valores culturais de abordagem do feminino que dificultam a identificação e a adesão de muitas mulheres. Cervix uteri {{cancer is}} still a public health problem in Brazil, but the governmental prevention programs that exist {{for this type of}} cancer have not reached the estimated index of covering. The number of people assisted in the campaigns has not reached one quarter of what was estimated in the first campaign and in the second one the number was even inferior. In light of this situation, this article has the objective of raising questions related to the non-adhesion of many women to the campaigns. In order to do that, the article emphasizes the epidemiologic relevance to approach the subject; the importance of the body for the woman; and the historical and cultural aspects that influence the preventive behavior of women. Therefore, a descriptive theoretical study was carried out, using as primary information source data from the Ministry of Health and from the National Institute of Cancer (INCA), and as supportive sources, books, scientific articles, journals and dissertations that worked with the proposed theme. In order to discuss strategic possibilities that can be effective to promote a higher adhesion of women to the preventive campaigns, the importance of the kind of approach of the health professionals was considered, pointing out that they should act in accordance with the cultural values presented by the women. Furthermore, the language used in the campaigns for the prevention of cervix uteri cancer was highlighted, as the transmitted concepts can endorse some cultural values related to approaching the women that make <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> many of <b>them</b> to identify and adhere to the campaigns...|$|R
60|$|Many volumes {{might be}} filled with the {{frivolous}} speculations concerning the nature of Being (το ὄν, οὐσία, Ens, Entitas, Essentia, and the like), which have arisen from overlooking this double {{meaning of the word}} to be; from supposing that when it signifies to exist, and when it signifies to be some specified thing, as to be a man, to be Socrates, to be seen or spoken of, to be a phantom, even to be a nonentity, it must still, at bottom, answer to the same idea; and that a meaning must be found for it which shall suit all these cases. The fog which rose from this narrow spot diffused itself at an early period over the whole surface of metaphysics. Yet it becomes us not to triumph over the great intellects of Plato and Aristotle because we are now able to preserve ourselves from many errors into which they, perhaps inevitably, fell. The fire-teazer of a modern steam-engine produces by his exertions far greater effects than Milo of Crotona could, but he is not therefore a stronger man. The Greeks seldom knew any language but their own. This rendered it far <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> than it is for us, to acquire a readiness in detecting ambiguities. One of the advantages of having accurately studied a plurality of languages, especially of those languages which eminent thinkers have used as the vehicle of their thoughts, is the practical lesson we learn respecting the ambiguities of words, by finding that the same word in one language corresponds, on different occasions, to different words in another. When not thus exercised, even the strongest understandings find it difficult to believe that things which have a common name, have not in some respect or other a common nature; and often expend much labor very unprofitably (as was frequently done by the two philosophers just mentioned) in vain attempts to discover in what this common nature consists. But, the habit once formed, intellects much inferior are capable of detecting even ambiguities which are common to many languages: and it is surprising that the one now under consideration, though it exists in the modern languages {{as well as in the}} ancient, should have been overlooked by almost all authors. The quantity of futile speculation which had been caused by a misapprehension of the nature of the copula, was hinted at by Hobbes; but Mr. James Mill(25) was, I believe, the first who distinctly characterized the ambiguity, and pointed out how many errors in the received systems of philosophy it has had to answer for. It has, indeed, misled the moderns scarcely less than the ancients, though their mistakes, because our understandings are not yet so completely emancipated from their influence, do not appear equally irrational.|$|E
