40|$|Use of longer-wavelength X-rays has {{advantages}} {{for the detection}} of small anomalous signals from light atoms, such as sulfur, in protein molecules. However, the accuracy of the measured diffraction data decreases at longer wavelengths because of the greater X-ray absorption. The capillary-top <b>mounting</b> <b>method</b> (formerly the loopless <b>mounting</b> <b>method)</b> makes it possible to eliminate frozen solution around the protein crystal and reduces systematic errors in the evaluation of small anomalous differences. However, use of this method requires custom-made tools and a large amount of skill. Here, the development of a device that can freeze the protein crystal semi-automatically using the capillary-top <b>mounting</b> <b>method</b> is described. This device can pick up the protein crystal from the crystallization drop using a micro-manipulator, and further procedures, such as withdrawal of the solution around the crystal by suction and subsequent flash freezing of the protein crystal, are carried out automatically.

The slides were evaluated in differ­ent dates and times, more than four years. Different photos were made with differ­ent magnification during the evaluation time. Results: The double glass <b>mounting</b> <b>method</b> was stable during this time and compa­rable with classic method.

40|$|In this paper, a {{gyroscopic}} <b>mounting</b> <b>method</b> for {{crystal oscillators}} {{to reduce the}} impact of dynamic loads on their output stability has been proposed. In order to prove the efficiency of this mounting approach, each dynamic load-induced instability has been analyzed in detail.

The analysis {{results show that the}} proposed gyroscopic <b>mounting</b> <b>method</b> gives good performance for host vehicle attitude changes. A phase noise improvement of 27 dB maximum and 5. 7 dB on average can be achieved in the case of steady state loads, while under sinusoidal vibration conditions, the maximum and average phase noise improvement are as high as 24 dB and 7. 5 dB respectively. With this gyroscopic <b>mounting</b> <b>method,</b> random vibration-induced phase noise instability is reduced 30 dB maximum and 8. 7 dB on average.

40|$|In this paper, the {{efficiency}} of the gyroscopic <b>mounting</b> <b>method</b> is studied for a highly dynamic GNSS receiver’s reference oscillator for reducing signal loss. Analyses are performed separately in two phases, atmospheric and upper atmospheric flights. Results show that the proposed mounting reduces signal loss, especially in parts of the trajectory where its probability is the highest. This reduction effect appears especially for crystal oscillators with a low elevation angle g-sensitivity vector. The gyroscopic mounting influences frequency deviation or jitter caused by dynamic loads on replica carrier and affects the frequency locked loop (FLL) as the dominant tracking loop in highly dynamic GNSS receivers. In terms of steady-state load, the proposed mounting mostly reduces the frequency deviation below the one-sigma threshold of FLL (1 σFLL). The <b>mounting</b> <b>method</b> can also reduce the frequency jitter caused by sinusoidal vibrations and reduces the probability of signal loss in parts of the trajectory where the other error sources accompany this vibration load. In the case of random vibration, which is the main disturbance source of FLL, gyroscopic mounting is even able to suppress the disturbances greater than the three-sigma threshold of FLL (3 σFLL). In this way, signal tracking performance can be improved by the gyroscopic <b>mounting</b> <b>method</b> for highly dynamic GNSS receivers...|$|R
