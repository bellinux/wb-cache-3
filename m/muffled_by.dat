25|$|The engines were unusually quiet {{because the}} {{exhausts}} were <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the General Electric turbo-superchargers on the twin Allison V12s. There were early problems with cockpit temperature regulation; pilots were often too {{hot in the}} tropical sun as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe buffeting and were often too cold in northern Europe and at high altitude, as {{the distance of the}} engines from the cockpit prevented easy heat transfer. Later variants received modifications (such as electrically heated flight suits) to solve these problems.|$|E
25|$|Muffling {{the bass}} can be {{achieved}} with the same muffling techniques as the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> adding pillows, a sleeping bag or another soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows manipulation in internally placed muffling. The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.|$|E

2500|$|The P-38 {{was unusually}} {{quiet for a}} fighter, since the exhaust was <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the turbo-superchargers. It was {{extremely}} forgiving and could be mishandled in many ways but the rate of roll in the early versions was too low for it to excel as a dogfighter. [...] The P-38 was the only American fighter aircraft in high-volume production throughout American involvement in the war, from Pearl Harbor to Victory over Japan Day. At {{the end of the}} war, orders for 1,887 more were cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{capacity}} Radio City Music Hall audience of 6,200 watched Bing Crosby's White Christmas on November 7, a bomb stuffed {{into the bottom}} cushion of {{a seat in the}} 15th row exploded, injuring four patrons. [...] The explosion was <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the heavy upholstery, and only those nearby heard it. [...] While the film continued, the injured were escorted to the facility's first-aid room and about 50 people in the immediate area were moved {{to the back of the}} theater. [...] After the film and the following stage show concluded an hour-and-a-half later, the police roped off 150 seats in the area of the explosion and began the search for evidence.|$|E

5|$|The killings were methodical. After the {{condemned}} individual's personal information was checked and approved, he was handcuffed {{and led to}} a cell insulated with stacks of sandbags along the walls, and a heavy, felt-lined door. The victim was told to kneel {{in the middle of the}} cell, and was then approached from behind by the executioner and immediately shot in the back of the head or neck. The body was carried out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside and subjected to the same fate. In addition to <b>muffling</b> <b>by</b> the rough insulation in the execution cell, the pistol gunshots were also masked by the operation of loud machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. Some post-1991 revelations suggest that prisoners were also executed in the same manner at the NKVD headquarters in Smolensk, though judging by the way that the corpses were stacked, some captives may have been shot while standing on the edge of the mass graves. This procedure went on every night, except for the public May Day holiday.|$|R
60|$|Halsey started. The {{noise of}} the {{revolver}} shot had evidently been <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the heavy connecting doors, {{but there was a}} smell of gunpowder in the room, and a little wreath of smoke. The man rose slowly to his feet, still blinking.|$|E
60|$|It is {{afternoon}} of {{a sunny day}} about a week later. From the harbor and docks outside, <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the closed door and windows, comes the sound of steamers' whistles and the puffing snort of the donkey engines of some ship unloading nearby.|$|E
60|$|As {{they came}} to the stone Leonard heard a sound behind him, a sound of {{footsteps}} <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the snow, and glancing round he saw Soa rushing towards them, almost naked, a spear-wound in her side, and the light of madness shining in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned back}} in her chair with a {{contented}} sigh. A little tug came snorting up the river. Even the roar of the traffic over Waterloo Bridge seemed <b>muffled</b> and disintegrated <b>by</b> the breeze which swept on its way through the rustling lime trees.|$|R
60|$|The {{driver had}} run {{at once to}} the horses, and had <b>muffled</b> them, <b>by</b> {{throwing}} his coat {{over the head of}} one, and a rug over the head of the other, and, though snorting and trembling in every limb, they stood quiet until he had thrown a head rope round each of their necks, and fastened them to the heaviest of the branches. Then he seized a handful of fallen leaves, which were exposed by the melting of the snow above them, and threw them into the fire, whence a dense smoke poured out.|$|R
5000|$|Putting {{a pillow}} inside the drum (for bass drums). The amount of <b>muffling</b> is {{controlled}} <b>by</b> {{how much of}} the pillow touches the front or rear heads; the less contact, the less muffling. Some companies produce dedicated bass drum mufflers that look like odd-shaped pillows; these work in the same fashion.|$|R
6000|$|The latent {{reason of}} his {{lingering}} here so long revealed itself when the faint creaking of the joints {{of a vehicle}} became audible, {{and one of the}} men said, [...] "Here's he."

60|$|A beat of hoofs, partly <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the snow, {{came down}} the bitter wind, and {{a few moments later}} a {{horseman}} appeared from behind the trees. He was indistinct in the gathering gloom, but seemed to be riding furiously, and Harding drew the oxen out of the trail.|$|E
6000|$|And {{now they}} are {{wandering}} down the great dusty high road, beneath the sparse shade of the stunted acacias that border it. They feel neither heat, nor dust, and say but little as they walk.

60|$|Jim {{answered}} <b>by</b> <b>muffling</b> {{him in his}} blazer, {{and walking}} to the line. There were six competitors in all, each of whom owned a name ranking alphabetically higher than Thomson. Jim, therefore, had the outside berth. Drake had the one next to the inside, which fell to Adamson, {{the victim of the}} lost two pounds episode.|$|R
60|$|The three <b>muffled</b> figures side <b>by</b> side {{in close}} if {{somewhat}} unnumerical battle array {{had taken their}} {{stand in front of}} the postern gate, the heavy bolts of which were heard falling into their sockets behind them with a loud clang.

50|$|In 2000, Jenssen {{released}} Cirque on his {{new home}} Touch, an ambient album driven <b>by</b> <b>muffled</b> beats, samples, and minimal atmospherics.

60|$|A tense silence {{followed}} this remark. In {{the street below}} the rumble of the traffic came to us <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the heavy plate-glass windows.

I was besmirched, for the present at least.|$|E
6000|$|The boat rowed {{steadily}} {{in the course}} that was believed would take them straight out to sea, the mate listening attentively {{for the sound of}} the distant guns. The reports came up every two or three minutes, their sound <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the fog. [...] "Sure it's mighty difficult to tell where the sound comes from, but I think it is well over there on our beam. Do not you think so?" [...] the mate asked Mr. Atherton.|$|E
60|$|At this moment, {{slightly}} <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> {{the intervening}} door and passageway, there {{came from the}} direction of the hall a sound like the delivery of a ton of coal. A heavy body bumped down the stairs, and a voice which all three recognized as that of the Honorable Freddie uttered an oath that lost itself in a final crash and a musical splintering sound, which Baxter for one had no difficulty in recognizing as the dissolution of occasional china.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy {{rains and}} a moonless night {{provided}} some {{cover for the}} escaping Spanish.

40|$|Chemical {{reactions}} in the solid state {{are often not}} included in undergraduate chemistry curricula, due to requirements for special laboratory facilities such as ovens and precision weighing balances. This work aims to describe novel and relatively simple magnetite chemical syntheses in dry medium, which {{could also be used}} as an alternative for freshmen chemistry experiments. The proposed reaction was carried out in a <b>muffle</b> furnace <b>by</b> heating (i) a sol-gel preparation and (ii) natural hematite, under nitrogen atmosphere at 400 ºC. The synthesized magnetite was characterized with powder X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Results show that magnetite samples have chemical properties as well as crystalline structure quite similar to those of standard natural magnetite...|$|R
50|$|It's as if Stone, his {{architecture}} <b>muffled</b> and disregarded <b>by</b> Cloepfil, MAD and {{the city}} of New York, managed to have the last word on the preservation controversy, popping up from beyond the grave to say hello. The fact that the word in question is unpretentious and loosely informal makes it deliciously Stone-like, and allows it to undermine the severity and cold perfectionism of Cloepfil's exterior all the more.|$|R
60|$|Not {{a muscle}} was relaxed {{on the part}} of the onlookers. Not the weight of a body shifted from one leg to the other. It was a sacred silence. Only could be heard the roaring draft of the huge stove, and from without, <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the log-walls, the howling of dogs. It was not every night that high stakes were played on the Yukon, and for that matter, this was the highest in the history of the country. The saloon-keeper finally spoke.|$|E
60|$|On we crept--on, and on! There {{was no sign}} {{of light}} about the Tower, and not the faintest sound to be heard till we were almost close to the line of the rising wall; then we heard a sound of {{something}} like mirth, but <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> distance and thick walls. From it we took fresh heart, for it told us that our enemies were gathered in the lower chambers. If only the Voivode should be on the upper stage, all would be well.|$|E
60|$|At our {{appearance}} {{there was}} a movement of serving-men and a fall of hoofs, <b>muffled</b> <b>by</b> the snow. Some held torches that cast a ruddy glare upon the all-encompassing whiteness, and a groom was leading forward the horse that was destined to bear me. I donned my broad-brimmed hat, and wrapped my cloak about me. Some murmurs of farewell caught my ears, from those minions with whom I had herded during my three days at the Vatican. Then Messer del' Orca thrust me forward.|$|E
60|$|This needless infliction, coming {{upon him}} at the crisis of an adventurous night, infuriated Mr Pickering. He swore softly. He groped round the walls for an electric-light switch, but the shack had no electric-light switch. When there was need to {{illuminate}} it an oil lamp performed the duty. This occurred to Mr Pickering {{after he had been}} round the place three times, and he ceased to grope for a switch and began to seek for a match-box. He was still seeking it when he was frozen in his tracks by the sound of footsteps, <b>muffled</b> but <b>by</b> their nearness audible, just outside the door. He pulled out his pistol, which he had replaced in his pocket, backed against the wall, and stood there prepared to sell his life dearly.|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{is done to}} find out the behaviour of Metal Matrix Composite made by casting using raw material of aluminium alloy 2218 with alumina (Al 2 O 3) with variable speed of stirrer. Metal Matrix Composite is made by melting the aluminium alloy 2218 at 850 °C in <b>muffle</b> furnace <b>by</b> adding Al 2 O 3 using stirrer at different speed in the preheated solid state. Addition of Al 2 O 3 is used to increase the mechanical strength. Hardness and toughness both can be increased by adding Al 2 O 3. Microstructure is also checked to know the location of the additive particles in the aluminium alloy 2218. Tensile strength of MMCs is checked on tensometer, hardness is tested on Vicker hardness testing machine, toughness is tested by charpy test...|$|R
