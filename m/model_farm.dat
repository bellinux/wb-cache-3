500|$|Gates became {{influential}} {{in the development of}} the city of Port Arthur, Texas when he took over the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad in December 1899 after he forced it into bankruptcy along with its previous owner and Port Arthur founder Arthur Edward Stilwell. Gates built a winter home in the city and contributed much to its development. After Gates became the owner of the Port Arthur Canal and Dock Company, he held the asset for a time; in 1906 he gave the canal to the US government under the condition that Port Arthur would be named an international port of entry. [...] Gates founded the first bank, built a rice mill and established the Port Arthur Light, Power and Ice Company. When he decided to make Port Arthur his permanent residence in 1908, the town held a celebration.

The opening of the Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway in 1890, which linked Regina, Saskatoon and Prince Albert, ended Qu'Appelle's important role as a distribution centre. Bishop Burn's closing of the Qu'Appelle <b>Model</b> <b>Farm</b> and transfer of Bishop's Court (the bishop's [...] "palace") from Qu'Appelle to Indian Head in 1895 accelerated the decline. Thereafter Qu'Appelle's pretensions as the would-be metropole for the District of Assiniboia were comprehensively dispelled.|$|E
5|$|Another {{focus of}} the Canadian {{government}} {{was to make the}} Aboriginal groups of Canada sedentary, as they thought that this would make them easier to assimilate. In the 19th century, the government began to support the creation of <b>model</b> <b>farming</b> villages, which were meant to encourage non-sedentary Aboriginal groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture. When most of these <b>model</b> <b>farming</b> villages failed, the government turned instead to the creation of Indian reserves with the Indian Act of 1876. With the creation of these reserves came many restricting laws, such as further bans on all intoxicants, restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections, decreased hunting and fishing areas, and inability for status Indians to visit other groups on their reservations.|$|R

A five-year plan with a budget of more than US$100 million in grants and loans, it focused on investment in infrastructure. The plan's thesis was that plantation crops and livestock exports would increase if there were better roads, transportation facilities, ports, and irrigation works. Another large investment {{was made in the}} creation of <b>model</b> <b>farms</b> to attract farmers from around the country, who would learn improved techniques to apply on their own <b>farms.</b> <b>Model</b> <b>farms</b> in Baidoa in the Bay Region, Afgooye near Mogadishu, and Tog Wajaale, west of Hargeysa, were established during this period.|$|R

He tried to persuade Dincă not to return to his owners to Moldavia, offering to employ him as a secretary of the library. In the mid 1840s, Vârnav was also in contact with the agronomist and political thinker Ion Ionescu de la Brad, sponsoring his attempts to set up a <b>model</b> <b>farm</b> in southern Moldavia, and also offering to employ Ionescu as a trainer of peasants.|$|E
2500|$|Theodorescu {{argues that}} Năsturel's {{contribution}} as a palace commissioner is enduring, being a direct precursor of {{experiments in the}} 18th-century Brâncovenesc style. His literary adaptation, the blason, remained a standard and forme fixe in Romanian poetry into the 19th century, even after Slavonic had been dropped. As noted by Negrici, this pattern was exceedingly conservative, characterized by [...] "stereotypes and repetition". The Năsturel family, which continued {{to be associated with}} Udricani and Dobroteasa down to the 1840s, also used Udriște's coat of arms, although it was tolerated, rather than validated, by the succession of Wallachian Princes. In 1831, it transferred Herăști to Miloš Obrenović, whose Serbian princely family later sold the domain to a Romanian politician, Anastase Stolojan.
