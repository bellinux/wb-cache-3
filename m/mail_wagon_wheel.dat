50|$|There {{have been}} many debates amongst fans of the biscuit about its size. <b>Wagon</b> <b>Wheels</b> have {{supposedly}} shrunk in size over time, but Burton's Foods Ltd has denied this. It {{has been suggested that}} the supposed shrinkage is due to an adult's childhood memory of eating a <b>Wagon</b> <b>Wheel</b> held in a much smaller hand; this argument is perhaps moot, as it does not explain why the modern <b>Wagon</b> <b>Wheel</b> appears to be fatter than the original. Furthermore, in Australia, Arnott's has stated that tray packs of <b>Wagon</b> <b>Wheels</b> were in fact Mini <b>Wagon</b> <b>Wheels</b> and have re-released the original 48g <b>Wagon</b> <b>Wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Overpack was a wheelwright in Manistee, Michigan around 1875, {{when he was}} {{approached}} by a farmer to build a set of 8 ft <b>wagon</b> <b>wheels.</b> He built these unusually large <b>wagon</b> <b>wheels</b> and sold them to the local farmer. Time passed and later this same farmer returned asking Overpack for an even larger set of <b>wagon</b> <b>wheels.</b> Overpack was very curious by this time. He asked the farmer {{what he was doing}} with such large <b>wagon</b> <b>wheels.</b> The farmer replied he was using them to skid logs.|$|R
