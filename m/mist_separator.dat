50|$|In 1958, Walter Hengst {{founded the}} company Ing. Walter Hengst KG in Münster. In 1977, Günter Röttgering, the {{son-in-law}} of Walter Hengst, joined the company, later becoming his successor, {{as a result}} of which the company was rebranded as Ing. Walter Hengst GmbH & Co. KG.Following the introduction of the first service-friendly cup oil filters with automatic drain system and plastic screw cap in 1988, the filter plant Hengst Filterwerke Berlin GmbH & Co. KG was founded in Berlin in 1990. In 1992, Walter Hengst’s daughter, Wera Röttgering, founded the national registered association Herzenswünsche e. V. (Heart’s Desires).In 1993, Hengst launched the environmentally-friendly ENGERGETIC® filter system, which was the first metal-free filter insert. In 1995, the first cup oil filter with an integrated centrifuge was introduced, followed by the first fluid management module in 1996. In 1997, a highly efficient oil <b>mist</b> <b>separator</b> system (cyclones for Otto and diesel engines) was introduced.|$|E
40|$|Blowby {{emissions}} {{contribute a}} significant part of total hydrocarbon emission by an automobile, but no effort has so far been made in our country to control the same. The diesel engineers have, so far, neglected investigations in this held and the literature available on blowby emissions investigation is very scarce. This paper deals with investigations on the control of blowby emissions in high power turbocharged diesel engine by installing positive crank case ventilation (PCV) system. The lubricating oil mist escaping with blowby gases is also quite significant. Feasibility of recovering this mist by installing in the PCV system a lubricating oil <b>mist</b> <b>separator,</b> designed and fabricated for the purpose has been established. The results obtained clearly show that the blowby emissions can be effectively controlled with the help of PCV system. However, the cross-section area of the PCV pipe has to be adjusted according to the amount of blowby gases and the inflow of ventilating air through the breather. It was possible to separate the lubricating oil mist in the blowby gases and return the lubricating oil back to sump {{with the use of a}} <b>mist</b> <b>separator</b> installed in the PCV system. The PCV system and lubricating oil <b>mist</b> <b>separator</b> both can be retrofitted even on engines in service. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, cyclonic separators are acceptable as hydrocyclone, <b>mist</b> eliminators, <b>separator</b> internal device and compact metering package. Weight and small footprint requirements for {{applications such as}} subsea separation, downhole separation, and compact gas monetization systems is driving interest in using cyclonic separator for bulk gas-liquid separation. Unfortunately, the challenge of coping with the effect of unsteady inlet flow behaviour on the separator performance limit it acceptance for bulk gas-liquid separation. Fundamental understanding of the flow behaviour inside the separator under various inlet flow conditions is required {{to deal with the}} challenge. While most published work have addressed flow behaviour in the lower half of cyclonic separator, this thesis concentrated on the upper half. A gas-liquid pipe cyclonic separator was setup at Cranfield University for bulk gas-liquid separation. Large amount of data at the inlet and upper part of the separator were acquired using electrical resistance tomography (ERT), wire meshes sensor (WMS), conductivity hold up probe and pressure transducers. The acquired data were used in analysing flow regimes, upward swirling liquid film (USLF), zero-net liquid flow (ZNLF), liquid holdup and, general separator performance. It was found from analysis of USLF data that a maximum USLF height exists for every constant superficial liquid velocity. A correlation based on dimensionless numbers was proposed for predicting this height. Experimental results on ZNLF showed that a critical ZNLF also exist above which liquid carryover can take place. The liquid holdup for this critical ZNLF was measured under separator operating condition using ERT and a correlation for predicting the liquid holdup was proposed. Four flow regimes were identified as swirling annular, light-mist heavy-mist and churn using visual observations, ERT, WMS and pressure transducer. A flow regime map was proposed based on gas and liquid Froude number. The performance based on the operating envelope for liquid carryover and pressure drop for horizontal and 270 downward inclined tangential inlet was compared. It was concluded that the separation performance was marginally improved by using an inclined tangential inlet. The pressure drop for the inclined inlet was far greater than that of horizontal inlet. Two inlet nozzles with D–shape were used for separation enhancement. The nozzle that reduces the diameter of full pipe bore by 25 % gave slight improvement but also gave the greatest pressure drop. The nozzle that reduced the full pipe bore diameter by 50 % performed poorly...|$|R
