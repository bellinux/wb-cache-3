40|$|Abstract – The OB- 1 {{method for}} the {{calculation}} of the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> of fissile actinides in metal/water systems was described in a previous paper. A fit to the calculated <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> data using the extended criticality parameter {{is the basis of}} the revised method. The solution density (grams/ liter) for the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> is also obtained by a fit to calculated values. Input to the calculation consists of the Maxwellian averaged fission and absorption cross sections and the thermal values of nubar. The revised method gives more accurate values than the original method does for both the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> and the solution densities. The OB- 1 method has been extended to calculate the uncertainties in the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> for 12 different fissile nuclides. The uncertainties for the fission and capture cross sections and the estimated nubar uncertainties are used to determine the uncertainties in the mini-mum critical mass, either in percent or grams. Results have been obtained for 233 U, 235 U, 236 Pu, 239 Pu, 241 Pu, 242 mAm, 243 Cm, 245 Cm, 249 Cf, 251 Cf, 253 Cf, and 254 Es. Eight of these 12 nuclides are included in the ANS- 8. 15 standard.

This paper presents the results of an analytical study of the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> values for a set of materials using current codes and standard cross section sets. This work is meant to produce a consistent set of <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> values that can form the basis for adding new materials to the single-parameter tables in ANSI/ANS- 8. 1. <b>Minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> results are presented for bare and water reflected full-density spheres and for full density moist (1. 5 wt-% water) as calculated with KENO-Va, MCNP 4 A and ONEDANT. Calculations were also performed for both dry and moist materials at one-half density. Some KENO calculations were repeated using several cross section sets to examine potential bias differences. The results of the calculations were compared to the currently accepted subcritical limits. The calculated <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> values are reasonably consistent for the three codes, and differences most likely reflect differences in the cross section sets.

40|$|The <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>masses</b> of Plutonium 239 in a {{polyethylene}} moderator {{were calculated}} {{as a function}} of plutonium density for several polyethylene densities (various void fractions). This study has applications for solid transuranic (TRU) waste and for plutonium scrap dissolving operations where polyethylene bags may be present within the cans to be dissolved. Polyethylene is usually present in TRU waste as a result of glovebox bagout operations and as liners in 55 gallon drums. The methodology utilized the SCALE driver CSAS 1 X. MCNP 4 A with ENDF/B-V was also used as an independent check {{due to the lack of}} critical experiments for polyethylene moderator. For TRU solid waste, tests with 55 gallon drums indicate that polyethylene bagging cannot be tightly stuffed to a volume fraction greater than 15. 5 %. To allow for settling, calculations were conducted for 20 % and 50 % polyethylene volume fractions as well as for full density for comparison. The effects of 10 % concrete or steel mixed with 20 % polyethylene were also evaluated. Since water egress into underground solid waste containers would be possible, additional calculations evaluated <b>critical</b> <b>masses</b> of water in polyethylene moderator. Calculated <b>critical</b> <b>masses</b> for the various moderators were determined for a range of plutonium concentrations. For full density polyethylene, the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> plutonium <b>mass</b> is about 345 grams (at 30 grams per liter) versus 510 for water. Added concrete substantially decreases the <b>critical</b> <b>mass,</b> and added steel substantially increases the <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> This study indicates that in some situations the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> plutonium <b>mass</b> in polyethylene can be less than that of metal in water (about 510 grams).

The tank {{contains}} a significant quantity of fissile materials, including an estimated 9. 782 kg of plutonium. Before beginning jet pump mixing for mitigative purposes, the operations must be evaluated to demonstrate {{that they will be}} subcritical under both normal and credible abnormal conditions. The main objective {{of this study was to}} address a concern about whether two 300 -hp pumps with four rotating 18. 3 -m/s (60 -ft/s) jets can concentrate plutonium in their pump housings during mixer pump operation and cause a criticality. The three-dimensional simulation was performed with the time-varying TEMPEST code to determine how much the pump jet mixing of Tank AZ- 101 will concentrate plutonium in the pump housing. The AZ- 101 model predicted that the total amount of plutonium within the pump housing peaks at 75 g at 10 simulation seconds and decreases to less than 10 g at four minutes. The plutonium concentration in the entire pump housing peaks at 0. 60 g/L at 10 simulation seconds and is reduced to below 0. 1 g/L after four minutes. Since the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> concentration of plutonium is 2. 6 g/L, and the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> plutonium <b>mass</b> under idealized plutonium-water conditions is 520 g, these predicted maximums in the pump housing are much lower than the minimum plutonium conditions needed to reach a criticality level.

40|$|Giant planet {{formation}} by core accretion {{requires a}} core that is sufficiently massive to trigger runaway gas accretion in less {{that the typical}} lifetime of protoplanetary disks. We explore how the minimum required core mass, M_crit, depends on a non-ideal equation of state and on opacity changes due to grain growth, {{across a range of}} stellocentric distances from 5 - 100 AU. This minimum M_crit applies when planetesimal accretion does not substantially heat the atmosphere. Compared to an ideal gas polytrope, the inclusion of molecular hydrogen (H_ 2) dissociation and variable occupation of H_ 2 rotational states increases M_crit. Specifically, M_crit increases by a factor of ~ 2 if the H_ 2 spin isomers, ortho- and parahydrogen, are in thermal equilibrium, and by a factor of ~ 2 - 4 if the ortho-to-para ratio is fixed at 3 : 1. Lower opacities due to grain growth reduce M_crit. For a standard disk model around a Solar mass star, we calculate M_crit ~ 8 M_Earth at 5 AU, decreasing to ~ 5 M_Earth at 100 AU, for a realistic EOS with an equilibrium ortho-to-para ratio and for grain growth to cm-sizes. If grain coagulation is taken into account, M_crit may further reduce by up to one order of magnitude.

The elaboration of parameters for detection, categorizing and evaluation of a hypothetical new regional public transport network as a new layer in the existing spatial structure of Flanders, and its strategic potential as a catalyst for spatial (re) developments is a crucial step in order to build a designerly approach. As a result of two-way interaction between the Public Transport line and the relatively sparse developed suburban area it runs through, linear development is stimulated. These tools and indicators can be used in three ways. Primary for detecting valuable spatial linear configurations to transform into corridors structured by regional high-quality public transit. Populations, densities and distances are interpreted to verify if a <b>minimum</b> of <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> is present. By a second set of indicators, these corridors are categorized by the scale of the corridor, their conceptual choice for the trajectory (infrastructural-based, mobility-based or landscape-based) and subcategorized by specific spatial and mobility characteristics of this corridor.

40|$|In {{the core}} {{accretion}} hypothesis, giant planets form by gas accretion onto solid protoplanetary cores. The <b>minimum</b> (or <b>critical)</b> core <b>mass</b> {{to form a}} gas giant is typically quoted as 10 Earth masses. The actual value depends on several factors: the location in the protoplanetary disk, atmospheric opacity, and the accretion rate of solids. Motivated by ongoing direct imaging searches for giant planets, this study investigates core mass requirements in the outer disk. To determine the fastest allowed rates of gas accretion, we consider solid cores that no longer accrete planetesimals, as this would heat the gaseous envelope. Our spherical, two-layer atmospheric cooling model includes an inner convective region and an outer radiative zone that matches onto the disk. We determine the minimum core mass for a giant planet to form within a typical disk lifetime of 3 Myr. The minimum core mass declines with disk radius, from ~ 8. 5 Earth masses at 5 AU to ~ 3. 5 Earth masses at 100 AU, with standard interstellar grain opacities. Lower temperatures in the outer disk explain this trend, while variations in disk density are less influential. At all distances, a lower dust opacity or higher mean molecular weight reduces the <b>critical</b> core <b>mass.</b> Our non-self-gravitating, analytic cooling model reveals that self-gravity significantly affects early atmospheric evolution, starting when the atmosphere is only ~ 10 % as massive as the core.

In haloes below a <b>critical</b> shock-heating <b>mass</b> Ms~ 6 x 10 ^ 11 Msol, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation (SFR).

Cold streams penetrating through hot media in >Ms haloes at z> 2 lead to massive starbursts in >L* galaxies. At z Ms haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to AGN feedback. This shuts off gas supply and further star formation, preferentially in spheroids formed by mergers in groups. Subsequent passive evolution leads to red & dead massive spheroids starting at z~ 1. The SFR is high just below Ms, where the feedbacks are weak, leading to a minimum in M/L. Convolved with the clustering scale growth, this explains the observed SFR history.

Conditions evaluated included full (12 -in. water) reflection and nominal (1 -in. water) reflection, and full (100 %) and 20 % {sup 235 }U enrichment. Validation analyses of SCALE/KENO and the SCALE 27 -group cross sections for nuclear criticality safety applications indicate that a calculated k{sub eff} + 2 {sigma} < 0. 9605 may be considered safely subcritical. Thus, a system with a calculated k{sub eff} + 2 {sigma} {ge} 0. 9605 is considered unsafe and may be critical. Critical conditions were calculated to be 70 g U/L for 100 % {sup 235 }U and full 12 -in. water reflection. This corresponds to a <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> of approximately 1, 400 g {sup 235 }U for the approximate 20. 0 -L volume of the vacuum cleaner. The actual volume of the vacuum cleaner is smaller than the modeled volume because some internal materials of construction were assumed to be fissile solution. The model was an overestimate, for conservatism, of fissile solution occupancy. At nominal reflection conditions, the critical concentration in a vacuum cleaner full of UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } solution was calculated to be 100 g{sup 235 }U/L, or 2, 000 g mass of 100 % {sup 235 }U. At 20 % {sup 235 }U for the 20. 0 -L volume of the vacuum cleaner. At 15 % {sup 235 }U enrichment and full reflection, critical conditions were not reached at any possible concentration of uranium as a uranyl fluoride solution. At 17. 5 % {sup 235 }U enrichment, criticality was reached at approximately 1, 300 g U/L which is beyond saturation at 25 C...|$|E

A network of reflex agents is simulated where each agent has an unchanging threshold and will adopt social media {{if the number of}} their friends who have adopted is greater than it. In the first study, the size of the <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> that adopts is varied, and in the second, the size of the <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> that discontinues use is varied. The studies show that a <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> of leavers can cause a community to fail and that this mass can potentially be as small as that needed to influence a community to succeed; although given a certain <b>critical</b> <b>mass,</b> their leaving is less likely to cause failure than their adoption is success.
