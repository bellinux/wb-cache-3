2500|$|Slash was {{replaced}} by Nine Inch Nails touring guitarist Robin Finck in January 1997, who signed a two-year contract with the band in August 1997, making him an official member. Finck was originally recommended by Matt Sorum to Rose a year earlier as a possible second guitarist to complement Slash. Slash's departure was followed shortly thereafter by Matt Sorum in April 1997, who was fired by Rose after getting in an argument about Tobias's inclusion in the band. Sorum later stated Tobias was the [...] "Yoko Ono of Guns N' Roses". McKagan {{was the last of}} the Appetite lineup to leave, resigning as bassist in August 1997. McKagan had recently become a father and wrote about his decision to leave in his autobiography, stating [...] "Guns had been paying rent on studios for three years now—from 1994 to 1997—and still did not have a single song. The whole operation was so erratic that it didn't seem to fit with my hopes for parenthood, for stability." [...] McKagan {{was replaced}} later that year by former Replacements bassist Tommy Stinson. An actual break-up of Guns N' Roses never occurred, as new players were brought in as the old ones left. Rose reportedly purchased the full rights to the Guns N' Roses name in 1997. Slash claimed he and bandmates signed over the name in duress, stating [...] "Axl refused to go onstage one night during the Use Your Illusion tour in 1992 unless the band signed away the name rights to the band. Unfortunately, we signed it. I didn't think he'd go on stage otherwise." [...] Rose denied the claim, saying [...] "(it) Never happened, all made up, fallacy and fantasy. Not one single solitary thread of truth to it. Had that been the case I would have been cremated years ago legally, could've cleaned <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the name and damages. It's called under duress with extenuating circumstances." ...|$|E
