500|$|Measles {{is an old}} disease, but it was {{not until}} the 10th century that the Persian {{physician}} Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (865–925) – known as [...] "Rhazes" [...] – first identified it. Rhazes used the Arabic name hasbah for measles. It has had many other names including rubeola from the Latin word rubeus, [...] "red", and <b>morbilli,</b> [...] "small plague". The close similarities between measles virus, canine distemper virus and [...] rinderpest virus have given rise to speculation that measles was first transmitted to humans from domesticated dogs or cattle. The measles virus appears to have fully diverged from the then-widespread rinderpest virus by the 12th century.|$|E

40|$|Current {{recommended}} {{treatment of}} chronic hepatitis C {{is the combination}} of peg interferon and ribavirin. Ribavirin has shown that it poses both direct and indirect action mechanisms against several DNA and RNA viruses. Interferon is a potent immune modulating substance, but {{its effect on the}} immune system of HCV-infected patients during treatment is not known in detail. It has been shown that interferon induces a significant increase in total IgG and C 1 inhibitor (INH) in patients with MS. The primary aim of this work was to study the effects of the combination therapy on the immunoglobulin levels. More specifically to see whether, the increased IgG levels were primarily due to HCV antibodies or whether antibodies to other viruses such as adenovirus, measles virus, and rubella virus are also increased. Sera from 24 patients in the NORDynamIC study at Haukeland University Hospital between February 2004 and March 2006 were used. Combination therapy with ribavirin and peginterferon was given for 12 or 24 weeks. Total IgG level, anti-HCV level, and antibodies to rubella, adeno and <b>morbilli</b> viruses were studied at different time points over 48 weeks. Total IgG level was fluctuating during the period of study. The highest level of IgG was found at day 8 whereas the lowest level was found at week 8 of treatment. Those who responded to the combination therapy showed a declining level of total IgG even after cessation of therapy while the non-responders showed an increased level og IgG after cessation of therapy. The relationship between IgG and anti-HCV levels showed the same pattern in responders whereas in non-responders total IgG show considerable variation and did not follow anti-HCV levels as observed in responders. All patients were anti-rubella IgG positive and there is a correspondence between the mean rubella antibody levels and mean IgG levels both in responders and non-responders. Most of the sera had no reactivity to either adeno virus or <b>morbilli</b> virus and there was no correspondence between antibody levels for <b>morbilli</b> or adeno viruses and total IgG. The study concludes that {{there seems to be an}} effect of combination therapy on total IgG and total IgG levels corresponds well with the anti-HCV antibody levels in responders. Rubella antibody was increased in all chronic HCV patients in the study and seems to have relationship with the total IgG level. Antibodies to adeno and <b>morbilli</b> viruses were not influenced by the treatment...|$|E

IgG and IgM were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa). PPD induced both IgM and IgG production, with a predominance of IgM. PPD usually stimulated a stronger IgM response but a weaker IgG response than did pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Supernatants of PPD- or PWM-stimulated lymphocyte cultures were tested for antibodies to <b>morbilli,</b> rubella and herpes simplex by Elisa.

40|$|Measles, {{also called}} <b>morbilli</b> or rubeola, {{is a highly}} {{contagious}} disease of humans. After an incubation period of 9 - 11 days characteristic clinical signs develop like coryza, cervical lymphadenitis, so-called Koplik's spots in the mouth, conjunctivitis, photophobia, myalgia, malaise, sneezing and coughing lasting for about 1 week. Fever precedes the typical rash consisting of generalised maculopapular lesions that first appear on the face and soon after on the trunk and the extremities. Measles is one out of six infectious diseases that cause 90 % of infectious disease deaths, worldwide (Fig. la). It is a major childhood killer in developing countries, accounting for about 900, 000 deaths a year (Fig. 1 b). Data from the pre-vaccination era showed that in Europe by 10 years of age virtually everyone had evidence of past measles virus (MV) infection...|$|E
40|$|Lower {{respiratory}} tract infections {{are among the}} most important causes of childhood mortality worldwide, more than 2 million children die due to pneumonia every year. A number of infections caused by the main pathogens related to pneumonia can be prevented through vaccination (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type-b, <b>morbilli,</b> pertussis, influenza). In the last decade, after the introduction of the 7 -valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV), the epidemiological background of childhood pneumonia has changed. Recently, several studies have been performed to collect data and evidences about the efficacy of PCV against noninvasive pneumococcal diseases (e. g. pneumonia, otitis media). These investigations showed 10 – 50 % decrease of all pneumonia cases, 10 – 30 % decrease of radiologically diagnosed pneumonia, and 50 – 70 % decrease of the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in children. The aim of this review was to determine the role of the PCV in the prevention of childhood pneumonia according to the medical literature, and to summarize the efforts of global organizations (WHO, UNICEF, GAVI) in the fight against pneumonia in children...|$|E
40|$|Contagious {{diseases}} {{present the}} {{leading causes of}} getting diseased and mortality {{in different parts of}} the world, regardless of improved socio-economic life conditions. The most important among them are the diseases which can be spread by air and water. Immunization against contagious diseases presents the most effective form of prevention, ending, elimination and, where possible, eradication of disease. When there are good programs of immunization properly implemented, and when they greatly cover the population which they refer to, the changes in frequency of vaccinable diseases can be observed, eg. contagious nosological entities that could be prevented by vaccination. Certain vaccines protect from bacterial or viral infections and reduce the possibility of infection, that is, prevent its transmission. The objective of the research is to point to the results of conducting the compulsory systematic immunization and to examine the effect of immunization on spreading of some respiratory vaccine-preventable diseases within Sumadija Region. This study shows the scope of immunization and spreading of some respiratory vaccine-preventable diseases, before all <b>morbilli,</b> parottitis epidemica, rubella and pertussis, in Sumadija Region for the last ten years.

In this study, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was standardized against RP and PPR. RNA of these viruses was isolated using denaturing solution (Solution D) containing guanidium thiocynate, sarcosyl, sodium citrate and ß 2 mercapto-ethanol. Regular PCR using <b>morbilli</b> specific oligonuclotides based on the sequences of conserved region of F and P-gene. These F and P gene primers amplified 429 bp and 372 bp, respectively for both RP and PPR. Nested PCR was performed to differentiate RP and PPR using F-gene amplicons by F 3 A/F 4 A and F 1 A/F 2 A primers, respectively. These set of primers amplified a product of 235 bp and 309 bp for RP and PPR, respectively.

Am J Epidemiol 100 : 136 - 149, 1974. —From the national (central) population regis-ter for Denmark, {{a random sample of}} all children aged 0 - 14 years was drawn. A questionnaire was sent for each sampled child (a total of 6804 individuals); 6333 (93 %) replied. According to the given information, 6126 children could be classified according to their measles (rubeola, <b>morbilli)</b> history; 207 could not be classified and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 6126 chil-dren, 612 contracted measles in 1972. The incidence among susceptible children (who had not previously had measles) increased from 100 per 1000 among the youngest to a peak 500 per 1000 among the 6 -year-olds; there-after the rate declined. The incidence was similar in urban areas and rural districts and among girls and boys up to 6 years of age. Girls older than 6 years had higher rates.

40|$|This study {{utilised}} epidemiological, haematological, pathological {{findings and}} serological detection of specific antibodies {{to evaluate and}} confirm a peste des petit ruminants (PPR) outbreak in a herd of west African dwarf (WAD) goats in Ibadan, Nigeria. The morbidity and mortality rates post exposure (PE) were 96 % and 60 % respectively. Laboratory analyses revealed significant differences (PÂ <Â  0. 05) in mean values of the haematological and serum biochemical indices between the PE and control groups. The PE group experienced a significant (PÂ <Â  0. 05) increase in white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte and monocytes after 10 Â days PE; the drop in glucose {{and high levels of}} alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) indicated liver damage, while increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid arose from kidney impairment. The electrolyte imbalance (potassium, sodium and chloride ions) resulting from the symptomatic diarrhea affected the functionality of the Na+âK+ pump mechanisms, hence pathologic damage to the liver, kidneys, skin, gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The competitive enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (c-ELISA) detected varying antibody levels in the PPR infected WAD goats; the percent inhibition was highest (PÂ <Â  0. 001) in survivors (70. 00 Â Â±Â  1. 73), then in contact group (60. 00 Â Â±Â  2. 00), and least in infected (23. 33 Â Â±Â  1. 53), which were sero-negative.

40|$|We briefly {{review the}} pathology, {{epidemiology}} and molecular biology of cetacean viruses (including <b>morbilli,</b> papilloma and pox) and Brucella spp. encountered in South America. Antibodies against cetacean morbillivirus were detected (by iELISAs and virus neutralisation tests) in SE Pacific and SW Atlantic delphinids. Morbilliviruses are possibly enzootic in Lagenorhynchus obscurus and offshore Tursiops truncates from Peru and in Lagenodelphis hosei from Brazil and Argentina, but no morbillivirus antibodies {{were found in}} inshore small cetaceans. Papillomaviruses cause genital warts {{in at least three}} odontocete species in Peru. Two Phocoena spinipinnis papillomaviruses (PsPVs) were found in warts of Burmeister’s porpoises; one (PsPV- 1) was cloned and characterized. Half of porpoises had developed genital warts, while in 10 % of males the lesions were sufficiently numerous and severe to at least hamper, if not impede, copulation. High titers of cowpox virus neutralising antibodies were detected in Peruvian D. capensis, T. truncatus, L. obscurus and P. spinipinnis in 1993 - 1995. The high prevalence of orthopoxvirus neutralising antibodies with high titres indicates common infection by poxviruses antigenically related to cowpox virus, the probable causative agents of tattoo skin disease. Cetacean poxviruses may cause significant mortaliy among neonates and calves unprotected by maternal immunity. In Peru, Brucella spp. antibodies were detected (competitive ELISA) in D. capensis, T. truncatus, L. obscurus and P. spinipinnis. Brucellosis is likely enzootic in the latter two species, and may lead to orchitis and bone lesions in L. obscurus and D. capensis. The enzootic circulation of brucellae in L. obscurus and P. spinipinnis may constitute a measurable limiting factor among the environmental variables affecting population dynamics. Also, widespread Brucella spp. infection in several Peruvian odontocetes has public health implications (zoonosis), considering frequent manipulation of carcases and consumption of meat. Extrinsic anthropogenic factors may not only exacerbate the consequences of viral infections on the health of a particular individual, but also operate at the population level...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} mass strandings {{caused by a}} <b>morbilli</b> virus {{epizootic}} in 1987 / 88 were estimated to have caused the mortality of between 10 and 50 percent of the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, population along the Atlantic coast of the United States. In addition, the stranding provided further evidence of two distinct stocks of dolphins, one inshore and one offshore. Subsequently the coastal stock of bottlenose dolphins was declared depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and holds that status today. From April 1982 to August 1984 aerial sightings were recorded seasonally along the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras, NC to Key West, FL. These data were collected {{in conjunction with the}} Southeast Turtle Surveys (SETS) conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service along random aerial line transects. These datasets were analyzed using the computer program Distance v 5. 0 to determine population density and abundance across locations, seasons, and years. Covariates, including temperature and sea state, which may affect the ability of observers to sight the dolphins, were considered. Numbers were pooled to determine population abundance prior to the 1987 mass stranding event to determine density change, if any. To visually demonstrate density the sightings and tracklines were mapped using the computer program Global Mapper v 7. 0. Results demonstrate the dolphins follow similar migratory patterns as currently observed including a shift of animals north in the summer and south the winter. The total abundance of dolphins in this area in the 19802 ̆ 7 s was significantly (p = 0. 0014) less than that found in the 2002 dolphin surveys with a total number in the summer of the early 19802 ̆ 7 s of 10, 102 (CV = 0. 1445) and a current estimate of 21, 527 (CV = 0. 2427). In 1995 the Southeast cetacean aerial survey, a replicate study of SETS, was completed in the winter and found 20, 005 individuals, a significantly (p = 0. 0456) larger number than estimated in SETS. These abundance estimates indicate that the mortality caused by the morbillivirus in 1987 / 88 did not significantly decrease the overall population of bottlenose dolphins in United States 2 ̆ 7 waters south of Cape Hatteras, NC...|$|E
40|$|Measles, {{as one of}} {{the oldest}} known {{infectious}} deaseses in humans, still {{play a significant role in}} terms of morbidity- and mortality- rates, especially in developing countries. However, even in industrialized coutries smaller epidemics are occasionally to be registered. Objective of the current dissertation is to analyze the scientific efforts that have been made in the years between 1900 and 2008. Therefore the database ISI- Web of Science had been used under the search terms measle or <b>morbilli.</b> Overall a total of 14. 254 publications could be identified in terms of the years, countries, journals and institutions of publication. Moreover the so called subject areas, the citation patterns and the single authors were examined under scientometric aspects. The presentation of the results took place, among others, by reference to map- anamorphosises and net- charts. The isolation of the measles virus in 1954 and the introduction of the vaccine in 1963, represent milestones of scientific efforts concerning measles- research. Therefore high numbers of measles- specific publictions could be recorded during that timeperiod. Due to the currentness of the topic within the last 20 years there has been a continuous increase in terms of scientific publications. The incorporation of the abstracts into the databases has led to a higher hit ratio that may be achieved. English ist by far the most prevalent publication language. One quater of all publications have their origin in the United States, as well as the majority of the publishing institutions. Even african countries such as the Gambia or Guinea- Bissau may list a significant number of publications. This fact might be affiliated to a large number of cooperatons with countries such as the USA or Denmark. The Journal of Virology ist the most publishing journal, but even The Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine and Vaccine play a major role concerning measles- specific publications. This is also shown by their high citation rates. The overall largest number of citations could be assigned to the United States, whereas Peru features the highest citation rate (46, 7) worldwide. William Bellini, an american author was identified as most productive scientist, having published a total number of 161 articles. There are two german authors as well, that show an exceptional engagement. The highest h- Indices could be matched to Volker Ter Meulen and Jürgen Schneider- Schaulies, who have been shown distinct activities in measles- research in the last 20 years...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this thesis the {{development}} of the present knowledge about Canine Distemper throughout history is described. Different opinions of practitioners, scientists and amateurs during the single eras as well as the problems and errors while coping {{with one of the most}} dangerous diseases of dog are explained. One can trace early occurrence of Canine Distemper up to the age of Aristoteles. Since 1761 Canine Distemper spread through europe. At this time numerous presumptions exist regarding the etiology of the disease, and corresponding to this the methods of treatment were quite adventurous. In 1809 Jenner was probably one of the first who gave a more reliable description of Canine Distemper. Also the first attempts to develop a vaccination took place in this period. At the end of the 19 th century Canine Distemper was described as the probably most frequent disease of dog. Up to this time various bacteriological findings failed to proove associations with Canine Distemper. The diagnosis was set up exclusively by clinical symptoms which were described well at this time. However, the prognosis ever was formulated. The situation about 1900 was characterized by an intensive search for the infectious agent of Canine Distemper, for possibilities of therapy and prophylaxis. In 1905 Carre succeded to reproduce the disease in susceptable dogs with germ-free nasal mucus of infected dogs. By this experiment the virus etiology was prooved basically and confirmed finally in 1926 by Duncin and Landlow who established the ferret as an adequate test animal in the Distemper research. In the middle of the 20 th century the germ of Canine Distemper was recognized as a virus of the <b>morbilli</b> genus in the paramyxo virus family. In this period one succeeded also in adapting the virus to embryonated eggs and in cultivating it in culture tissues. These to milesteps met the requirements for developing a vaccine. Due to immunoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment the classical clinical appearance of Canine Distemper changed. Modern methods of virology and molecular biology lead to new insights in the nature of this RNA virus. The disease transfer to man resp. ist contribution to other diseases was discussed, but could not be confirmed until now. All Canidae, Procyonidae and Mustelidae are considered to be susceptible. Despite vaccination Canine Distemper is next to Canine Parvovirosis still the most important viral disease of dog with worldwide importance attributable to ocasional epidemics. The dog is the main reservoir of the virus. There is a need for more investigations concerning the importance of wild species as virus reservoir. From the present status of knowledge a causal therapy of Cannine Distemper is impossible. Prophylaxis by vaccination is still the most important disease prevention. Conclusively, Canine Distemper still has to be considered as a disease with an uncertain prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 60 : 13 in lengthThe repertoire chosen {{calls for a}} wide range of stylistic interpretation. Three musical eras are represented: the Classical, the Romantic and the Modem or Twentieth Century. "Mentre ti lascio" (1787), with text taken from La Disjatta di Dario by Angioli <b>Morbilli,</b> serves as an important lesson in the performance practice of a concert aria in a recital setting. The text describes the bitter parting of a father from his daughter and the music conveys how he is shaken to the bones. This piece also demands an elevated concept of musical phrasing. As in every song, a key to pacing and better communication is in proper emphasis. There is also a great deal of word painting occurring in the music. "Trema" or "Tremble" in the first line is marked with mezzo forte and staccato, indicating the pounding heart of this tortured father as it trembles. There are two particularly expressive moments when the accompaniment builds from pianissimo to forte, first in a six bar theme and at its return in eight bars. The steadily racing chordal sixteenth notes and relentless progression of quarter notes supporting the lines, "Figlia, ti lascio. Ahi, che partenza amara!" and "Figlia, io parto, ti lascio. Addio! Ahi che partenza amaral" clearly convey the shaking terror of the father. In the framework of the entire piece, the tempo moves from a heavy larghetto, through a moving allegro, ending in a relentless piu allegro. This use of tempo further emphasizes the singer's journey from sorrow, to troubled regret and frantic desperation. Vier ernste Geslinge, composed in 1896, represents the pinnacle of German art song and constitutes Johannes Brahms' most ambitious and final song cycle. Here Brahms fully utilized his expertise in form and word painting. The songs are full of rich, long melodic lines, characteristic of Brahms' compositions. The songs' lavish harmony, frequent modulation and increased chromaticism require careful attention in regard to vocal line and its relationship to the harmony at hand. Similar to Wagner's concept of leitmotif, Brahms identifies death with a descending third; this third unifies the entire cycle. When death is seen as a blessing rather than a curse, in the second half of the third song, " 0 Tod," the interval changes to an ascending sixth. The general progression of the cycle is from minor to major. The first song begins and ends in d minor. The second song, which begins in g minor, ends with its last fifteen of 7 5 measures in brighter G major. With G major, there is the first glimpse of light and hope, as the text focuses on the sun. "O Tod" progresses even further in this direction, as half is in e minor and the entire second half (including the coda) is in E major. The fourth song is a glorious celebration of the triumph of love over death in the key of E-flat major. Lastly, words such as "stirbt" meaning "he dies" and "Staub" meaning "dust" with their harsh German consonants add bite to the message conveyed. (See more in text. ...|$|E
