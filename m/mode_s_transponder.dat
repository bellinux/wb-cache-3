50|$|TCAS and its {{variants}} {{are only}} able to interact with aircraft that have a correctly operating mode C or <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder.</b> A unique 24-bit identifier is assigned to each aircraft that has a <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Transponder: The <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> {{is fully}} {{operational}} and will reply to all appropriate ground and TCAS interrogations. TCAS remains in stand-by.|$|E
50|$|Stand-by: Power {{is applied}} to the TCAS Processor and the <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>{{transponder}},</b> but TCAS does not issue any interrogations and the transponder will reply to only discrete interrogations.|$|E
5000|$|One {{issue with}} <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders</b> is that pilots {{have entered the}} wrong flight {{identity}} into their <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders.</b> [...] In this case, the capabilities of ACAS II and <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> SSR can be degraded.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders</b> also reply on this frequency, and encoded {{within the}} <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> {{transmission}} is the mode A (squawk) and mode C (altitude) information.|$|R
50|$|Because {{primary radar}} {{generally}} gives bearing and range position information, but lacks altitude information, mode C and <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders</b> also report pressure altitude. Some lower-end altimeters do not normally have a built in encoder {{and so a}} modified Gray code, called a Gillham code, is used to pass altitude information to the transponder. Around busy airspace {{there is often a}} regulatory requirement that all aircraft be equipped with altitude-reporting mode C or <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders.</b> In the United States, this is known as a Mode C veil. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders</b> are compatible with transmitting the mode C signal, and have the capability to report in 25 foot increments. Without the pressure altitude reporting, the air traffic controller has no display of accurate altitude information, and must rely on the altitude reported by the pilot via radio. Similarly, the traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) installed on some aircraft needs the altitude information supplied by transponder signals.|$|R
50|$|Automatic (traffic/resolution advisories): The <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> {{is fully}} operational. TCAS will operate {{normally}} and issue the appropriate interrogations and perform all tracking functions. TCAS will issue traffic advisories (TA) and resolution advisories (RA), when appropriate.|$|E
50|$|Antennas: The antennas used by TCAS II {{include a}} {{directional}} antenna that {{is mounted on}} the top of the aircraft and either an omnidirectional or a directional antenna mounted on the bottom of the aircraft. Most installations use the optional directional antenna on the bottom of the aircraft. In addition to the two TCAS antennas, two antennas are also required for the <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder.</b> One antenna is mounted {{on the top of}} the aircraft while the other is mounted on the bottom. These antennas enable the <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> to receive interrogations at 1030 MHz and reply to the received interrogations at 1090 MHz.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} a target with an SSR Mode C or <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> can also be {{provided}} by decoding the Mode C or Mode S response directly, which is the {{normal mode of operation}} for the civilian VERA-AP system.|$|E
50|$|European Aviation Safety Agency {{certification}} {{for private}} use was achieved on 21 November 2008. It requires the aircraft to be equipped {{differently from the}} FAA certification, including the Avio NG 1.5 avionics system, a third attitude indicator and dual <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders.</b>|$|R
40|$|III GPS-Squitter merges the {{capabilities}} ofAutomatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) with the <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> beacon system. In ADS, an aircraft determines {{its position on}} board by using satellite navigational data from a system such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). The information is then broadcast to ground and airborne users to provide surveillance ofthe aircraft. In GPS-Squitter, an aircraft would transmit the ADS information by using the <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> squitter-a spontaneous periodic broadcast transmitted by all <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders.</b> Currendy, the <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders</b> emit a 56 -bit squitter once per second, and the squitters are used by the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) to acquire the 24 -bit address ofthe aircraft. For the GPS-Squitter system, the squitter broadcast is extended to 112 bits {{to provide for the}} transmission of a 56 -bit ADS message field. This article defines the GPS-Squitter concept, describes its principal surveillance and data-link applications, and provides estimates ofthe expected performance in future moderate-to-high-density environments. The progra...|$|R
50|$|Two other modes, mode 4 and <b>mode</b> <b>S,</b> are not {{considered}} part of the ATCRBS system, but they use the same transmit and receive hardware. Mode 4 is used by military aircraft for the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> is a discrete selective interrogation, rather than a general broadcast, that facilitates TCAS for civilian aircraft. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders</b> ignore interrogations not addressed with their unique identity code, reducing channel congestion. At a typical SSR radar installation, ATCRBS, IFF, and <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> interrogations will all be transmitted in an interlaced fashion. Some military facilities and/or aircraft will also utilize <b>Mode</b> <b>S.</b>|$|R
50|$|Traffic {{advisories}} only: The <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> {{is fully}} operational. TCAS will operate normally and issue the appropriate interrogations and perform all tracking functions. However, TCAS will only issue traffic advisories (TA), and the resolution advisories (RA) will be inhibited.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009 the ICAO {{published}} an [...] "extended" [...] form of Mode S with more message formats {{to use with}} ADS-B; it was further refined in 2012. Countries implementing ADS-B can {{require the use of}} either the extended squitter mode of a suitably-equipped <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder,</b> or the UAT transponder on 978 MHz.|$|E
5000|$|Another mode called Mode S (Select) is {{designed}} to help avoiding overinterrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. Mode S transponders are compatible with Mode A and Mode C Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) systems. [...] This is the type of transponder that is used for TCAS or ACAS II (Airborne Collision Avoidance System) functions, and is required to implement the extended squitter broadcast, one means of participating in ADS-B systems. A TCAS-equipped aircraft must have a <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder,</b> but not all Mode S transponders include TCAS. Likewise, a <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> is required to implement 1090ES extended squitter ADS-B Out, but {{there are other ways to}} implement ADS-B Out (in the U.S. and China.) The format of Mode S messages is documented in ICAO Doc 9688, Manual on Mode S Specific Services.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} L-band {{ranges from}} 962-1213MHz. Aircraft can use Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) equipment at 1090 MHz to communicate position {{information to the}} ground as well as between them for traffic information and avoidance. The 1090 MHz frequency (paired with 1030 MHz) is also used by <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders,</b> which ADS-B augments when operated at this frequency. The TCAS system also utilizes the 1030/1090MHz paired frequencies. ADS-B information can also be broadcast on the L band frequency of 978 MHz. DME and TACAN systems are also in this frequency band.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{the type}} of interrogation, the {{transponder}} sends back a transponder code (or [...] "squawk code", Mode A) or altitude information (Mode C) to help air traffic controllers to identify the aircraft and to maintain separation between planes. Another <b>mode</b> called <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> (<b>Mode</b> Select) is designed to help avoiding over-interrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders</b> are backward compatible with Modes A and C. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> is mandatory in controlled airspace in many countries. Some countries have also required, or are moving towards requiring, that all aircraft be equipped with <b>Mode</b> <b>S,</b> even in uncontrolled airspace. However, in the field of general aviation there have been objections to these moves, because of the cost, size, limited benefit to the users in uncontrolled airspace, and, in the case of balloons and gliders, the power requirements during long flights.|$|R
50|$|Product designs {{include the}} World's Smallest Mode C and <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> Aviation <b>Transponders</b> with ADS-B In and Out, Dual-Channel ADS-B Receivers with AHRS and {{integrated}} GPS and WiFi. Areas of expertise include radio frequency communications, microcontroller and FPGA, sensors and sensing systems, ultra-miniature and low-power designs for space-constrained and power-limited environments.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} selling points for the SR20 is its Garmin Cirrus Perspective {{avionics}} suite with dual 10 in or 12 in screens: one primary flight display (PFD) and one multi-function display (MFD). This provides all standard communication, navigation (GPS and conventional VHF), and surveillance (<b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder)</b> functions. Other avionics features include in-flight weather information and TCAS-like traffic information.|$|E
50|$|TCAS IV uses {{additional}} information encoded by the target {{aircraft in the}} <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> reply (i.e. target encodes its own position into the transponder signal) to generate a horizontal resolution to an RA. In addition, some reliable source of position (such as Inertial Navigation System or GPS) is needed on the target aircraft in order {{for it to be}} encoded.|$|E
50|$|In the Mode S {{secondary}} {{surveillance radar}} system, 'squitter' is a term used to describe messages that are unsolicited downlink transmissions from an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> system. Mode S transponders transmit acquisition squitter (unsolicited downlink transmissions) to permit passive acquisition by interrogators with broad antenna beams, where active acquisition may be hindered by all-call synchronous garble. Examples of such interrogators are an {{airborne collision avoidance system}} and an airport surface system.|$|E
40|$|Location and {{identification}} of cooperating {{aircraft in the}} airport area (and beyond) may be implemented by multilateration (MLAT) systems using the secondary surveillance radar (SSR) <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> signals. Most of these signals, spontaneously emitted from on-board <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponders</b> at a fixed carrier frequency, arrive randomly at the receiving station, {{as well as many}} mode A/C replies from legacy transponders still in use. Several SSR signals are, then, overlapped in multiple aircraft situations. Therefore, the aim of this work is the separation of overlapped SSR signals, i. e., signals superimposed in time at receiving stations. We improve the MLAT receiving station by replacing the single antenna by an array of m elements and using array signal processing techniques. In the literature, several algorithms address the general source separation problem, but a very few of them are specifically designed for a mixture of overlapping SSR replies. Unfortunately, all of them have either some shortcomings, or an expensive computational cost, or no simple practical implementation. In this paper, we use the time sparsity property of the sources to propose more reliable, simpler, and more effective algorithms based on projection techniques to separate multiple SSR signals. Real recorded signals in a live environment are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{systems can}} use the speed and {{direction}} information. The safety systems need to use this information. The conflict alert (CA) system will compare the direction, altitude and speed of multiple aircraft {{to see if there}} are any possibilities of aircraft being too close together. Maps of the area along with <b>Mode</b> C or <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> elevations will allow Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) systems to warn controllers of possible terrain conflicts.|$|R
50|$|The airline {{industry}} {{has been working with}} the Air Transport Association of America (ATA) since 1955 toward a collision avoidance system. It was not until the mid-1970s, however, that research centered on using signals from ATCRBS airborne transponders as the cooperative element of a collision avoidance system. This technical approach allows a collision avoidance capability on the flight deck, which is independent of the ground system. In 1981, the FAA announced our decision to implement an aircraft collision avoidance concept called the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The concept is based upon agency and industry development efforts in the areas of beacon based collision avoidance systems and air-to-air discrete address communications techniques utilizing <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> airborne <b>transponder</b> message formats.|$|R
5000|$|Upon interrogation, Mode S transponders {{transmit}} {{information about}} the aircraft to the SSR system, to TCAS receivers on board aircraft and to the ADS-B SSR system. This information includes the call sign of the aircraft and/or the aircraft's permanent ICAO 24-bit address (which is represented for human interface purposes as six hexadecimal characters. One of the hidden features of Mode S transponders {{is that they are}} backwards compatible; an aircraft equipped with a <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> can still be used to send replies to Mode A or C interrogations. This feature can be activated by a specific type of interrogation sequence called inter-mode.|$|E
50|$|Air Evac {{owns and}} {{operates}} around 140 Bell 206 L1+ Long Ranger helicopters and about a dozen Bell 407 helicopters which are equipped with: Allison Rolls-Royce C30 engine, Garmin 396 GPS with XM Weather overlay, Garmin 430W GPS VHF, Becker <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>Transponder,</b> SkyTrac® satellite tracking, SatPhones, TDFM-7000 3 Band radios, Intellistart®, ANVIS-9 Night Vision Goggles, and Air Evac's proprietary litter system. The company has flown the Bell 206 LongRanger {{since its founding in}} 1985 because of its reliability, efficiency, agility and excellent safety record. While these aircraft are widely used and regarded as safe aircraft, in comparison to other airframes used, they are cramped for space which can sometimes make patient care difficult.|$|E
50|$|The system {{relies on}} two {{avionics}} components—a high-integrity GPS navigation source and a datalink (ADS-B unit). There are {{several types of}} certified ADS-B data links, but the most common ones operate at 1090 MHz, essentially a modified <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder,</b> or at 978 MHz. The FAA {{would like to see}} aircraft that exclusively operate below 18000 ft use the 978 MHz link since this will help alleviate further congestion of the 1090 MHz frequency. To obtain ADS-B Out capability at 1090 MHz, one can install a new transponder or modify an existing transponder if the manufacturer offers an ADS-B upgrade, plus install a certified GPS position source if one is not already present.|$|E
5000|$|<b>S</b> <b>Transponder</b> — <b>Mode</b> <b>S,</b> {{including}} both pressure altitude and {{aircraft identification capability}} ...|$|R
50|$|The {{primary mission}} of their AirScene System is to track {{all types of}} {{aircraft}} {{in the air and}} on an airport surface and transponder-equipped vehicles to provide a high fidelity, high accuracy, and high update rate air/surface surveillance display. The system receives and decodes signals transmitted by <b>Mode</b> A/C, <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> and ADS-B <b>transponders.</b> The system can be configured so that the sensors are connected to a central processor in real-time, for up-to-the-second track information. Each signal is directly communicated to the central processor where the aircraft/vehicle(s) is/are identified and its/their position calculated in real time (nominally once per second).|$|R
5000|$|Air {{traffic control}} uses primary and {{secondary}} radars. Primary radars are a [...] "classical" [...] radar which reflects all kind of echoes, including aircraft and clouds. Secondary radar emits pulses and listens for special answer of digital data emitted by an Aircraft Transponder as an answer. Transponders emit different kind of data like a 4 octal ID (mode A), the onboard calculated altitude (mode C) or the Callsign (not the flight number) (<b>mode</b> <b>S).</b> Military use <b>transponders</b> to establish the nationality and intention of an aircraft, so that air defenses can identify possibly hostile radar returns. This military system is called IFF (Identification Friend or Foe).|$|R
5000|$|Automatic Independent Surveillance - Privacy (AIS-P) is a {{data packet}} {{protocol}} for the TailLight system of aircraft Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), wherein a single Mode S 64 microsecond message is transmitted by an aircraft ATCRBS or <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder,</b> and received by aircraft and Air Traffic Control on the ground. This is an augmentation to aircraft transponders, which report aircraft position and velocity {{in such a}} way as to minimize interference with any other avionics system, maximize the possible number of participating aircraft, while not relying on any equipment on the ground, and protecting aircraft from potential attack. AIS-P and ADS-B are competing protocols for aircraft based surveillance of traffic, a replacement technology for Mode S radar and TCAS.|$|E
50|$|The newest Seeker variant under {{development}} at Denel Dynamics offers enhanced situational awareness capabilities and other improvements over the Seeker 2. It can provide real-time {{day and night}} reconnaissance; target location, surveillance and designation; Artillery fire support; Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and conduct Border and Maritime patrol missions. New additions include the capability of carrying weapons such as the laser guided missile with a missile stand-off range of 10 km. It can also operate up to 16 hours with a maximum of 100 kg of multi-mission payloads. It also features dual uplinks and downlinks, Brake assisted ground operation, piloted and autonomous flight capability, VHF and UHF FM tactical radios and <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>Transponder</b> and VHF AM Air Traffic Control (ATC) radio for ATC interfacing. The mission control units remain relatively {{the same as the}} Seeker 2's with modular hardware and software.|$|E
50|$|With 1090 ES, the {{existing}} <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> <b>transponder</b> (TSO C-112 or a standalone 1090 MHz transmitter) supports a message type {{known as the}} extended squitter message. It is a periodic message that provides position, velocity, time, and, in the future, intent. The basic ES does not offer intent since current flight management systems do not provide such data (called trajectory change points). To enable an aircraft to send an extended squitter message, the transponder is modified (TSO C-166A) and aircraft position and other status information is routed to the transponder. ATC ground stations and aircraft equipped with {{traffic collision avoidance system}} (TCAS) already have the necessary 1090 MHz (Mode S) receivers to receive these signals, and would only require enhancements to accept and process the additional extended squitter information. As per the FAA ADS-B link decision, and the technical link standards, 1090 ES does not support FIS-B service.|$|E
50|$|INSAT-4E {{has five}} C x <b>S</b> <b>transponders</b> each of 9 MHz {{bandwidth}} and five <b>S</b> x C <b>transponders</b> each of 2.7 MHz bandwidth which will together {{cover the entire}} country.|$|R
40|$|The Engineering Model of SUNSAT, a 50 kg, 45 cm, Ariane ASAP-compatible {{microsatellite}} {{is scheduled}} for assembly in December 1993, permitting flight model completion early in 1995. Fifteen M. Eng. students, led by Computer 2 ̆ 6 Control System lecturers at Stellenbosch University, began detail design in January 1992. Most prototype hardware was operating by July 1993, and assembly of the first final-sized PCB 2 ̆ 7 s started. A packet radio service, a 2 m parrot speech transponder, and <b>Mode</b> A and <b>S</b> <b>transponders,</b> all defined and endorsed by SA-AMSAT, comprise the Amateur Radio communications payload. Verification of the 15 - 20 m pixel spacing, 3 -color, 3456 pixel pushbroom imager capable of stereo imaging, is a major research goal. Data will be downlinked in S-band, or single images stored in a 64 Mbyte RAM. Coarse attitude stabilization by gravity gradient and magnetorquing is improved by small reaction wheels during imaging. Continuous attitude sensing is by magnetometers. Sun sensors, visible band horizon sensors, and star sensor provide 1 mrad accuracy when imaging from the sun-synchronous orbit. Average power of 30 W enables images of South Africa to be taken {{on a daily basis}} for real time downlinking. Satisfaction of SA electronics companies on our Advisory Board with the engineering model will lead to continued student funding. Demonstration of a working engineering model will then hopefully provide the credibility we need to finalize a launch opportunity.
