2500|$|On September 3, Ninth Circuit {{solicitor}} (district attorney) Scarlett Wilson {{announced that}} she intended to {{seek the death penalty}} against Roof in the state proceedings, with the decision being made since more than two people were killed in the shooting and others' lives were put at risk. On September 16, Roof said through his attorney {{that he was willing to}} plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison without parole. On October 1, the federal trial was pushed back to at least January 2016 to give prosecutors and Roof's attorneys more time to prepare. On December 1, the trial was postponed again to an unknown date. He and Joey Meek, accused of <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> <b>felony</b> and lying to investigators about Roof's plans, were to reappear in federal court on February 11, 2016, while their lawyers hold a bar meeting with prosecutors to discuss their cases. On November 7, 2016, U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel postponed jury selection until November 9, later postponing the process again until November 21. Gergel later postponed the jury selection to November 28. On November 28, a federal judge granted a motion by Roof to represent himself. On December 4, Roof, in a handwritten request, asked Gergel to give him back his defense team for the guilt phase of his federal death penalty trial. On December 5, 2016, Gergel allowed Roof to hire back his lawyers for the guilt phase of his trial. On December 6, 2016, a federal judge denied a motion by Roof's defense team to delay Roof's trial.|$|E

On March 11, Jeffrey Lehrmann, another former NOPD officer, pleaded guilty to <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> a <b>felony</b> for failing to report the cover-up. On April 7, Michael Hunter, one of the seven officers originally charged with attempted murder in 2007, pleaded guilty to <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> a <b>felony</b> and obstruction <b>of</b> justice. Hunter later became a key witness in the case against Bowen, Gisevius, Faulcon, and Villavaso.|$|R

5000|$|In 1999 Kane & Abel became {{entangled}} {{in a federal}} case involving the activities of convicted New Orleans drug lord Richard Pena.

During the investigation, {{they were asked to}} testify against No Limit Records CEO Master P, but the rappers refused, Master P was never charged in the case. In June ( [...] two years after Pena had pleaded guilty on his own), Kane & Abel would agree to a plea bargain that would allow the brothers to plead guilty to drug possession with intent to distribute. Under the agreement, they would serve six months in a prison boot camp & the rest of the 24-month sentence in a halfway house or home detention. On May 7, 2001 Kane & Abel's lawyers reached an agreement with prosecutors in which they admitted to committing <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> a <b>felony</b> by refusing to report to federal agents about the activities of drug lord Richard Pena. On September 14, 2001 it was reported that Kane & Abel were sentenced to three years in jail in the federal case due to them admitting to committing <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> a <b>felony.(</b> [...] which means that they refused to report, or CONCEALED a crime.https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/4) ...|$|R

50|$|Under the old {{common law}} {{hierarchy}} of crimes (as treasons, felonies and misdemeanours), misprision of treason was a felony and <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> <b>felony</b> was a misdemeanour. (There {{was no such}} offence as misprision of a misdemeanour.) These categories were abolished in 1967.|$|E
50|$|The old writers {{say that}} a misprision is {{contained}} in every felony and that the Crown may elect to prosecute for the <b>misprision</b> instead <b>of</b> the <b>felony.</b> This proposition merely affirms {{the right of the}} Crown to choose a more merciful remedy in certain cases, and has no present value in the law. Positive misprisions are now only of antiquarian interest, being treated as misdemeanours.|$|R
50|$|Esposito was a {{prominent}} criminal defense attorney and four-term Mayor of Logan who was directed to buy votes by the FBI and implicate as many local politicians as possible in a Federal probe directed by Assistant U.S. Attorney R. Booth Goodwin II. In the end, Esposito was directed {{to pull out of}} the race before the general election and pleaded guilty to a single charge <b>of</b> <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> a <b>felony,</b> putatively for bribing Logan County, West Virginia magistrate, Danny Wells, who himself received a nearly eight-year Federal sentence for his own bribery and extortion charges. Esposito himself was merely disbarred and served two years of probation. He is considered to have bribed Wells by paying off his $6500 bar tab.|$|R
50|$|Negative misprision is the {{concealment}} <b>of</b> treason or <b>felony.</b> By {{the common}} law of England it was the duty of every liege subject to inform the king's justices and other officers {{of the law of}} all treasons and <b>felonies</b> <b>of</b> which the informant had knowledge, and to bring the offender to justice by arrest (see Sheriffs Act 1887, s. 8). The duty fell primarily on the grand jurors of each county borough or franchise (until the abolition of grand juries in 1933), and is performed by indictment or presentment, but it also falls in theory on all other inhabitants. Failure by the latter to discharge this public duty constitutes what is known as <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> treason or <b>felony.</b>|$|R
50|$|Five {{family members}} of the {{perpetrator}} were arraigned for <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> <b>felony,</b> due to their suspected knowledge of the perpetrator's intent and lack of reporting of said intent to Palestinian or Israeli authorities, allegedly having read the perpetrator's Facebook post a few hours prior to the attack.|$|E

50|$|<b>Misprision</b> <b>of</b> <b>felony</b> is the {{concealment}} of {{a felony}} committed by another person, but without such previous concert with, or subsequent {{assistance of the}} offender, as would make the concealer an accessory {{before or after the}} fact.

50|$|On December 9, 2003, Steven and Rita Bixby were arraigned in Abbeville County {{on various}} charges {{related to the}} deaths of Wilson and Ouzts. Steven was charged with two counts of murder and one count of {{criminal}} conspiracy, while Rita was charged with accessory before the fact to murder, criminal conspiracy, and <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> a <b>felony.</b> Arthur Bixby was later arraigned on charges similar to those against Steven. Prosecutors originally planned to seek the death penalty for all three Bixbys, but on August 23, 2006, Circuit Judge Alexander Macaulay ruled that the death penalty was not an option in Rita's case, a ruling that prosecutors appealed to have overturned by the South Carolina Supreme Court. In State v. Bixby, 373 S.C. 74, 644 S.E.2d 54 (2007), the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision that Rita Bixby was ineligible for the death penalty under South Carolina law because she was merely charged with accessory before the fact of murder.|$|R
2500|$|On April 16, Robert Barrios {{was charged}} with one count of conspiring to obstruct justice, {{becoming}} the fourth NOPD officer to be federally charged in the case. He promptly resigned from the force. A fifth man, Marion David Ryder, a civilian who witnessed the incident and falsely represented himself as a law enforcement officer, was also charged in the case. He was accused of lying to the FBI about the event when he claimed {{that one of the}} victims had a weapon. On April 28, he pleaded guilty to the charges. On May 21, Ignatius Hills was charged by a bill of information with one count of conspiring to obstruct justice and one count <b>of</b> <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> a <b>felony,</b> becoming the fifth NOPD officer to be federally charged.

50|$|On April 25, 1996 {{after five}} hours of {{deliberation}} a federal jury returned a verdict of guilty of conspiring to build an ammonium nitrate bomb on Lampley, Cecilia, and Baird. Lampley and Baird were also convicted of carrying firearms {{in relation to a}} crime, and Lampley was convicted of solicitation of a crime of violence. Lampley was sentenced to imprisonment of 11 years and six months, Baird was sentenced to 120 months, Cecilia was sentenced to 51 months. Crow as part of his plea deal plead guilty to <b>misprision</b> (concealment <b>of</b> a <b>felony</b> by one not a participant in the crime) received probation, a six-month stay in a halfway house, and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service.|$|R
50|$|<b>Misprision</b> <b>of</b> <b>felony</b> was {{an offence}} under {{the common law}} of England and was {{classified}} as a misdemeanour. It consisted of failing to report knowledge of a felony to the appropriate authorities. Exceptions were made for close {{family members of the}} felon and where the disclosure would tend to incriminate him of that offence or another.|$|E
5000|$|United States law defines <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> <b>felony</b> as {{a federal}} crime.

5000|$|From 2005 to 2009, the Metro Courthouse was at {{the center}} of a {{high-profile}} fraud investigation, during which allegations emerged that a group of conspirators had siphoned off $4.2 million from the courthouse construction project in a scheme described by the Albuquerque Journal as [...] "breathtaking in scope and star power." [...] Eight people were eventually named as defendants in the case, including the former president pro tempore of the New Mexico State Senate and a former mayor of Albuquerque. The investigation ended with six of the accused pleading guilty to conspiracy and mail fraud, while the other two pleaded guilty to <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> <b>felony.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the crime of treason, the Treason Felony Act 1848 (still in force today) created a new offence known as treason felony, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment instead of death (but today, due to {{the abolition of the}} death penalty, the maximum penalty both for high treason and treason felony would be the same—life imprisonment). Under the traditional categorisation of offences into treason, felonies, and misdemeanours, treason felony was merely another form <b>of</b> <b>felony.</b> Several categories <b>of</b> treason which had been introduced by the Sedition Act 1661 were reduced to felonies. While the common law offences <b>of</b> <b>misprision</b> and compounding were abolished in respect <b>of</b> <b>felonies</b> (including treason felony) by the Criminal Law Act 1967, which abolished the distinction between misdemeanour and <b>felony,</b> <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> treason and compounding treason are still offences under the common law.|$|R
50|$|<b>Misprision</b> <b>of</b> treason is {{an offence}} under {{the common law}} of England and Wales and the common law of Northern Ireland. By statute, the offence <b>of</b> <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> treason under the common law of England has been made an offence which is cognisable under the law of Scotland. This offence was {{formerly}} known as <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> high treason in order to distinguish it from <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> petty treason.|$|R
50|$|Section 3 {{deals with}} <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> treason.|$|R
50|$|Section 1 {{abolished}} {{the distinction between}} felonies and misdemeanours. Originally, all crimes in English law were categorised in a hierarchy of treason, felony, and misdemeanour, each with their own rules of procedure and evidence. (Treason had been brought in line with felony in 1945.) The 1967 Act abolished felonies and stated that all former felonies would be tried {{according to the rules}} of procedure and evidence that applied in trials and pre-trial hearings for misdemeanours, whether the felony had been committed before or after the Act was passed. This also had the effect of abolishing the offences of <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> <b>felony</b> and compounding a felony (but these offences were replaced with new ones in sections 4 and 5). Although all offences were now misdemeanours, the maximum penalties were not affected.|$|E

The prosecution also stated that it was dropping the murder charges against Gibson, who would instead be charged with <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> <b>felony.</b> After a three-week trial, in late July a twelve-person jury unanimously found both Owen and West guilty of murder. The state prosecutors, Kathy Pryce and Karen Seymour Johnson, requested that Owen and West face the death penalty.However, in November Justice Lloyd Hibbert sentenced them to life in prison, stipulating that they must serve a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole. He stated that in sentencing the pair he took into account the fact that they had already spent a decade in custody. In December, both Owen and West launched appeals against their conviction.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Misprision</b> <b>of</b> <b>felony</b> was {{abolished}} in 1967 but new statutory offences {{of failure}} {{to comply with a}} duty to disclose terrorist acts or funding under s19(2) Terrorism Act 2000, and failure to disclose knowledge or suspicion of money laundering maintain the tradition. Similarly, the appropriation element in s1 theft may be committed by an act or by keeping when there is a duty to return the property, a deception under s15(4) Theft Act 1968 may be committed by what is not said or done, and [...] "dishonestly secures" [...] under s2(1) Theft Act 1978 may also be committed by omission (see R v Firth (1990) CLR 326 in which the defendant failed to tell the NHS that patients using NHS facilities were in fact private patients thereby obtaining the use of the facilities without payment). One of the simpler examples is the offence of failing to report a road traffic accident (s. 170 Road Traffic Act 1988).|$|E
5000|$|The Act {{provided}} {{that it was}} henceforth a crime to conspire to [...] "set at liberty" [...] any person imprisoned on the Queen's orders for treason (or suspicion of treason) against the Queen's person. If the conspiracy to release the prisoner was made before the prisoner had been indicted, the conspirator was guilty <b>of</b> <b>misprision</b> <b>of</b> treason and would be imprisoned; if the prisoner was between indictment and conviction, the conspirator was guilty <b>of</b> <b>felony</b> and liable to be executed by hanging; and if the prisoner had already been convicted, the conspirator was guilty of high treason and would be hanged, drawn and quartered (if male) or {{burned at the stake}} (if female).|$|R
