5|$|Another treaty dealing the <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} borders was the Treaty of Novgorod {{signed with}} Norway in 1326, which ended {{the decades of}} the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark. Per the terms of this treaty, Norway relinquished all claims to the Kola Peninsula. However, the treaty {{did not address the}} situation with the Sami people paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920.|$|E

5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E

40|$|Following {{intracranial}} inoculation, Theiler’s virus causes {{either an}} acute encephalitis (strain GDVII) or a chronic demyelinating disease (strain DA).

Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phenotype <b>of</b> recombinant viruses {{has shown that}} the viral capsid contains determinants for persistence and demyelination. Our previous studies showed that a Lys at position 141 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VP 2 capsid protein (VP 2 - 141) could render a chimeric virus persistent. We also reported that another recombinant virus, virus R 5, migrated from <b>the</b> grey <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord inefficiently and was unable to infect <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord. In this article, we report that introducing a Lys at position VP 2 - 141 in virus R 5 increases its ability to infect <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord. Our results indicate that this amino acid is important for <b>the</b> spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus within the central nervous system. Theiler’s virus is a murine picornavirus related to the Car-diovirus genus (17, 18, 20).
