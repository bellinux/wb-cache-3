40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} {{the perception of}} optically simulated haptic feedback. The perception of optically and <b>mechanically</b> <b>simulated</b> bumps and holes was tested experimentally. In an earlier article, we have described the active cursor technique, a method to simulate haptic feedback optically without resorting to special mechanical force feedback devices, commonly applied to produce haptic percepts in computer interfaces. The operation of the force feedback device is substituted by tiny displacements on the cursor position relative to the intended force. This method exploits the domination of the visual over the haptic modality. Results show that people can recognize optically simulated bump and hole structures and that active cursor displacements influence the haptic perception of bumps and holes. Depending on the simulated strength of the force, optically simulated haptic feedback can take precedence over <b>mechanically</b> <b>simulated</b> haptic feedback and also the other way around.

In this paper, the maximum wind power penetration focusing on system inertia and primary reserve value is assessed. The Spanish power system is used as an example for the calculation of these values. For this purpose, real Spanish scenario data are used.

40|$|Mechanically {{stimulating}} cell-seeded scaffolds by flow-perfusion is {{one approach}} utilized for developing clinically applicable bone graft substitutes. A key challenge is determining {{the magnitude of}} stimuli to apply that enhances cell differentiation but minimizes cell detachment from the scaffold. In this study, we employed a combined computational modeling and experimental approach to examine how the scaffold mean pore size influences cell attachment morphology and subsequently impacts upon cell deformation and detachment when subjected to fluid-flow. Cell detachment from osteoblast-seeded collagen-GAG scaffolds was evaluated experimentally {{across a range of}} scaffold pore sizes subjected to different flow rates and exposure times in a perfusion bioreactor. Cell detachment was found to be proportional to flow rate and inversely proportional to pore size. Using this data, a theoretical model was derived that accurately predicted cell detachment as a function of mean shear stress, mean pore size, and time. Computational modeling of cell deformation in response to fluid flow showed the percentage of cells exceeding a critical threshold of deformation correlated with cell detachment experimentally and the majority of these cells were of a bridging morphology (cells stretched across pores). These findings will help researchers optimize the mean pore size of scaffolds and perfusion bioreactor operating conditions to manage cell detachment when <b>mechanically</b> <b>simulating</b> cells via flow perfusion.

This study investigated how <b>mechanically</b> <b>simulated</b> root herbivory of lucerne (Medicago sativa) before and after aphid infestation affected the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) under elevated temperature (eT) and carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO 2). eT increased plant height and biomass, and eCO 2 decreased root C:N. Foliar amino acid concentrations and aphid numbers increased in response to eCO 2, but only at ambient temperatures, demonstrating the ability of eT to negate the effects of eCO 2. Root damage reduced aboveground biomass, height, and root %N, and increased root %C and C:N, most probably via decreased biological nitrogen fixation. Total foliar amino acid concentrations and aphid colonization success were higher in plants with roots cut early (before aphid arrival) than those with roots cut late (after aphid arrival); however, this effect was counteracted by eT. These results demonstrate the importance of amino acid concentrations for aphids and identify individual amino acids as being potential factors underpinning aphid responses to eT, eCO 2, and root damage in lucerne.

It {{has already been}} established that IAS measurement is much more superior to the conventional methods i. e. analyzing acoustic waveforms, current signatures, temperature variations, and vibrations etc. However, an accurate IAS measurement becomes very difficult due to slow and noisy response of the rotary transducers of low speed rotating machines.

Since the RMF revolves at a speed, several times the speed of the rotating member or the rotor of synchro, hence the IAS measurement becomes very fast and accurate.

Digital panoramic radiography, conventional and digital periapical radiography (charged couple device and photo-stimulable phosphor plate), and high-resolution cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were previously performed to exclude regions presenting periapical lesions or similar conditions, which then formed the control and experimental groups. Then, periapical diseases were progressively produced with drills of different diameters, thus creating lesions of different sizes. The different image diagnosis methods were applied after each lesion produced. The data were assessed using the Kappa test, ROC curve graphs and Cochran's Q test. The significance level was set at 0. 05. ResultsThe images obtained with conventional film and digital panoramic radiography showed the worse results (0. 65 and 0. 55, respectively), and statistically significant differences compared to the controls (p< 0. 05) for lesions artificially produced with # 6 drill. With regard to high-resolution CBCT, the area values were found to be high for all lesion sizes. ConclusionConventional periapical radiography and digital panoramic radiography did not provide satisfactory images for the identification of incipient periapical diseases.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Determining the {{performance}} characteristics of various ocean wave energy converters (OWEC) {{has proven to}} be difficult due to problems replicating a baseline motion profile in the ocean or wave tank to compare these devices. The linear test bed seeks to <b>mechanically</b> <b>simulate</b> the relative linear motion between the active components experienced by a point absorber OWEC in an ocean environment. A gimbal mount allows the active components of a “float” of a point absorber OWEC to be mounted to the machine’s carriage, which is mechanically driven by timing belts. The “spar” portion of the OWEC is mounted {{to the base of the}} linear test bed so that as the carriage moves the float vertically, there is relative linear motion between the float and spar. The current control system allows researchers to input a vertical position versus time function to be tracked by the linear test bed. However, researchers have desired to improve the linear test bed control system by implementing a force control algorithm based on hydrodynamic equations to accurately reproduce the driving force of the ocean wave. With only position control, the linear test bed will use any necessary force to follow that profile, exaggerating the capabilities of the wave especially if the device is electrically loaded. In addition, the hydrodynamic interaction of the OWEC and an ocean wave cannot be reproduced using only a position feedback control system. The linear test bed design, position control system, and a comprehensive presentation of the novel force control system are provided through this thesis work...|$|R

The aim {{is to make the}} vehicle on the dynamometer accelerate and decelerate {{the same way}} as on a real road.First you need to know the parameters of the [...] "behavior" [...] of the vehicle on a real road.In order to get [...] "road parameters", vehicle must be driving on ideal flat road with no wind from any direction, gear set to neutral and time needed to slow down without braking is measured in certain intervals i.e. 100-90 km/h, 90-80 km/h, 80-70 km/h 70-60 km/h etc. Slowing down from higher speed takes shorter time mainly due to air resistance.Those parameters are later set in dynamometer workstation, together with vehicle inertia. Vehicle is restrained and so called vehicle adaptation has to be performed.During vehicle adaptation dynamometer automatically slowing down from set speed, changing its own [...] "dyno parameters" [...] and trying to get same deceleration in given intervals as on real road. Those parameters are then valid for this vehicle type. Changing of set <b>simulated</b> <b>inertia</b> it is possible to simulate vehicle ability to accelerate if fully loaded, with setting gradient it is possible to simulate force if vehicle going downhill etc. Chassis dynamometers for climatic chamber does exists, where it is possible to change temperature in give range i.e. -40 to +50 °C or altitude chamber where it is possible to check fuel consumption with different temperatures or pressure and to simulate driving on mountain roads.|$|R
