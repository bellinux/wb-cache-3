50|$|The Central <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> (Mazama temama) is {{a species}} of brocket deer ranging from {{southern}} Mexico, through Central America, to northwestern Colombia. It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> from South America, but its karyotype has 2n = 50, while the latter's was initially described as having 2n = 68-70. However, a more recent description gives the <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> a variable karyotype with 2n varying from 48 to 54. It is sympatric with the Yucatan brown brocket over part of its range. The species is found in primary and secondary tropical forest at altitudes from sea level to 2800 m. In Mexico, it is regarded as an agricultural pest by bean farmers. It is probably threatened by hunting and deforestation.|$|R
50|$|It {{formerly}} {{included the}} Central <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> (M. temama) {{and sometimes the}} Yucatan brown brocket (M. pandora) as subspecies. Considerable taxonomic confusion still exists for the populations remaining in the <b>red</b> <b>brocket.</b> Pending a solution to this, it has been evaluated as data deficient by the IUCN, though as presently defined, {{it is the most}} widespread species of brocket. It is sympatric with the smaller Amazonian brown brocket over much of its range (the latter tends to have significantly lower population densities). The karyotype of the <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> was initially described as having 2n = 68, FN = 74, and more recently as having 2n varying from 48 to 54 and FN varying from 54 to 56. This variability may indicate the presence of unrecognized species in the population.|$|R
50|$|Among the mammals {{present in}} the park are the South <b>American</b> tapir, the <b>red</b> <b>brocket,</b> the {{collared}} peccary, the ocelot, the black-capped squirrel monkey, the brown-mantled tamarin monkey, the red-faced spider monkey, the nine-banded armadillo, the pacarana, the Northern Amazon red squirrel, the kinkajou, and the South American coati.|$|R
50|$|Ecoregions are {{not only}} {{established}} to protect the forests themselves {{but also because they}} are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (Pharomacrus mocinno), three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata), bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and black guan (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, {{which is part of the}} Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extincition are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. Jaguars, cougars, spider monkeys, as well as tapirs, and anteaters live in the woods of Central America. The Central <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.|$|R
2500|$|Systematic {{recording}} of dietary intake {{while living in}} the forest entirely off wild foods suggests that about 80% of the energy in the diet comes from meat, 10% from palm starch and hearts, 10% from insect larva and honey, and 1% from fruits. Total energy intake is approximately 2700 kcal per person daily, and males acquire about 84% of all calories consumed. Children do not produce significant amounts of food until they are fully adult. Despite the presence of over 500 species of edible vertebrate prey, only nine species of mammals provide more than 1% of the prey biomass actually harvested by Aché hunters. [...] Most important (in descending order) are nine-banded armadillo, paca, South American tapir, capuchin monkey, white-lipped peccary, South <b>American</b> coati, <b>red</b> <b>brocket,</b> and tegu lizards.|$|R

50|$|The little <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> or swamp brocket (Mazama rufina), {{also known}} as the Ecuador <b>red</b> <b>brocket,</b> is a small, little-studied deer native to the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador and {{northern}} Peru, where found in forest and páramo at altitudes between 1400 and 3600 m. It is one of the smallest brocket deer. The coat is reddish, and the legs and crown are blackish. As recently as 1999, some authorities included both the pygmy brocket (M. nana) and Merida brocket (M. bricenii) as subspecies of the little <b>red</b> <b>brocket.</b>|$|R

50|$|The small <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> (Mazama bororo) {{is a small}} {{species of}} deer in the family Cervidae. It is endemic to Atlantic Forest in Paraná, Santa Catarina and São Paulo in southeastern Brazil. This species, which only was scientifically {{described}} in 1996, is threatened by habitat loss. Though its size and structure most resemble that of the pygmy brocket (M. nana), its coloration {{is very similar to}} that of the <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> (M. americana). It resembles hybrids between these two species even more closely, but differs from both, and their hybrids, in karyotype.|$|R
5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} gray brocket deer comes from Félix de Azara's gouazoubira. Azara {{was the first to}} provide a quality description of the small deer in the Americas, and he referred to the <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> as gouazoupita, while he referred to the gray brocket as gouazoubira, which has been maintained in the current species name, Mazama gouazoubira. Though sometimes it is seen as Mazama gouazoupira, this is incorrect, perhaps mistakenly replacing a [...] "b" [...] with a [...] "p" [...] from Azara's name for the <b>red</b> <b>brocket,</b> Gouazoupita.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> browses on vegetation, preferring fruit {{when it is}} available. It is {{generally}} solitary and stays in dense jungles. When alarmed, the animal snorts or stomps its hooves.|$|R

25|$|They {{include the}} tufted {{capuchin}} (Sapajus apella), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> (Mazama americana), Azara's agouti (Dasyprocta azarae), dusky-legged guan (Penelope obscura), the frog Vitreorana uranoscopa and snakes such as Bothrops neuwiedi and Spilotes pullatus.|$|R
40|$|Background: The <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> deer, Mazama americana, has {{at least}} six {{distinct}} karyotypes in different regions of South America that suggest the existence of various species that are today all referred to as M. americana. From an evolutionary perspective, the <b>red</b> <b>brockets</b> are a relatively recent clade that has gone through intense diversification. This study sought to prove the existence of post-zygotic reproductive isolation in deer offspring between distinct chromosome lineages. To achieve this, inter-cytotype and intra-cytotype crosses were performed, which resulted in both F 1 hybrid (n = 5) and pure offspring (n = 3) in captivity. Results: F 1 females were analyzed {{in terms of their}} karyotypes, ovarian histology, estrous cycles and in vitro embryo production. Pure females presented parameters that were similar to those previously reported for M. Americana; however, the parameters for hybrid females were different. Two hybrids were determined to be sterile, while the remaining hybrids presented characteristics of subfertility. Conclusions: The results support the existence of well-established reproductive isolation among the most distant karyotype lineages and elucidates the need to define all karyotype variants and their geographical ranges in order to define the number of species of <b>red</b> <b>brocket...</b>|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{reproductive}} biology {{is critical for}} the development of management strategies of the species both in captivity and in the wild, and to address conservation concerns regarding the sustainable use of a species. The present report characterizes some aspects of {{the reproductive}} biology of the wild <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> deer inhabiting the Northeastern Peruvian Amazon region, based on the anatomical and histological examination of the female reproductive organs of 89 wild adult females in different reproductive states. The <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> deer female presented ovarian follicular waves involving the synchronous growth of a cohort of an average 25 follicles but only one follicle generally survived and continued development, reaching maturity at 4 mm. Mean ovulation rate was 1. 14 and litter size was 1 fetus. Females presented a low rate of reproductive wastage of 14. 3 % of embryos. Among the 89 adult females studied, 41 (46. 1 %) were pregnant and 48 (53. 9 %) were nonpregnant females. In the Northeastern Peruvian Amazon, conceptions occurred year-round in the <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> deer but there were peaks in the rate of conception. Estimated yearly reproductive production was 0. 76 - 0. 82 young per adult female. Most pregnant females in advanced stage of pregnancy had at least one active CL, suggesting the persistence of CL throughout gestation...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the green monkeys, which roam freely {{in and out of}} the fenced enclosure, the wildlife reserve also keeps a variety of other animals, many of which roam the reserve freely without separation from visitors. These include <b>red</b> <b>brockets,</b> red-footed tortoises, Patagonian maras, Cuban rock iguanas, and numerous caged tropical birds.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the obvious differences in color, the gray brocket is generally smaller than the <b>red</b> <b>brocket.</b> Separation of the gray brocket and the Amazonian brown brocket using external features is far harder, but the former has a more orange rump, bigger, more rounded ears, wider auditory bullae, and smaller eyes.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the species}} of fauna in the park are {{threatened}} by hunting and deforestation.They include the tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> (Mazama americana), Azara's agouti (Dasyprocta azarae), dusky-legged guan (Penelope obscura), the frog Vitreorana uranoscopa and snakes such as Bothrops neuwiedi and Spilotes pullatus.|$|R
50|$|Major {{species of}} animals that are hunted by the Aguaruna include the sajino, the huangana, the Brazilian tapir (sachavaca), the little <b>red</b> <b>brocket,</b> the ocelot and the otorongo (jaguar).
