Prions composed of the prion protein (PrP) are believed to be the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) among other diseases.|$|E
5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E
5|$|Python allows boolean {{expressions}} {{with multiple}} equality relations in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a {{is less than}} b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} {{electronic}} realizations like the Kibble balance {{is that the}} definition and dissemination of the kilogram {{would no longer be}} dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the Kibble balance, while the kilogram would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the kilogram would depend only on the definitions of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c. If the kilogram is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a Kibble balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.|$|E

25|$|At {{other times}} clan names and patronymics ("son of") were also common, as in Aristides Lysimachu.

25|$|The party seeking title by adverse {{possession}} {{may be called}} the disseisor, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an {{adverse possession}} claim are different in each state, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect {{the title of the}} disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> open and notorious, keep out others, and use {{it as if it were}} his own.

For a domesticated industry to succeed on a small scale and be accessible to the poorest of the poor, the cost of production would have to be comparable with the cost of wild worms or dried worms at the market.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to having a diffusive effect on ion transport, water molecules also form hydration shells around individual ions due to their polar nature. The hydration shell not only shields the charge on ions from other ions but also modulates the ion radial distribution function causing the formation of peaks and troughs. The average minimum distance between two ions is increased as there is always at least one layer of water molecules present between them, acting as a physical deterrent preventing two ions from getting too close to each other, in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> similar to the short-range repulsive component of the Lennard-Jones potential.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, further {{advances}} {{were made}} in the field of intratracheal anesthesia. Among these were those made by Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986). Working at the Queen's Hospital for Facial and Jaw Injuries in Sidcup with plastic surgeon Sir Harold Gillies (1882–1960) and anesthetist E. Stanley Rowbotham (1890–1979), Magill developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation. Magill devised a new type of angulated forceps (the Magill forceps) that are still used today to facilitate nasotracheal intubation in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> little changed from Magill's original technique. Other devices invented by Magill include the Magill laryngoscope blade, as well as several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill.|$|E

25|$|Berkshire's class A shares {{sold for}} $281,000.00 , making them the highest-priced shares on the New York Stock Exchange, {{in part because}} they have never had a stock split and have only paid a {{dividend}} once since Warren Buffett took over, retaining corporate earnings on its balance sheet in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> impermissible for mutual funds.

25|$|Traditionally, DGs {{have had}} a {{different}} approach to linear order (word order) than constituency grammars. Dependency-based structures are minimal compared to their constituency-based counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions. Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency-based structures has allowed DGs, starting with Tesnière (1959), to focus on hierarchical order in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> hardly possible for constituency grammars. For Tesnière, linear order was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesnière produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesnière adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.|$|E
