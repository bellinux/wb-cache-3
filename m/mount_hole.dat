50|$|All of the July 1961 through August 1964 221-260-289 engines used a five-bolt bell housing, {{with all}} 221s and 260s being of this configuration, but the 289 changed to the six-bolt {{arrangement}} {{at this time}} - the change was made due to transmission utilization issues i.e. the need for larger-diameter clutches, for example. The block mount pads and the cylinder wall contour of the 221 and 260 engines changed in January-February 1963 {{with the introduction of}} the 289 variant - all 221 and 260 engine blocks up to this time featured 'corrugated wall' construction with two freeze plugs on the side of each bank and engine <b>mount</b> <b>hole</b> pitch distances of 6 inch. All three block variants from this point on featured the straight wall method of construction, three freeze plugs and an engine <b>mount</b> <b>hole</b> pitch distance of seven inches. The corrugated wall method of block construction had caused cleaning difficulties in the foundry from day one and a change was phased in.|$|E

Tools do not cause cracks and tears. Substitute die-forming process for hammer-and-center-punch process. De-forming process {{requires}} less skill and gives results of greater quality and consistency...|$|R
50|$|The {{dimensions}} and <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> must suit {{the equipment that}} uses the fan. Square-framed fans are usually used, but round frames are also used, often so that a larger fan than the <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> would otherwise allow can be used (e.g., a 120 mm fan with holes for the corners of a 90 mm square fan). The width of square fans and the diameter of round ones are usually stated in millimeters. The dimension given is the outside width of the fan, not the distance between <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> Common sizes include 40 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, 92 mm, 120 mm and 140 mm, although8 mm, 17 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, 30 mm, 35 mm, 38 mm, 45 mm, 50 mm, 70 mm, 250 mm and 360 mm sizes are also available. Heights are typically 10 mm, 25 mm or 38 mm, but this is usually not an important dimension as it does not affect <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> or apertures in the case.|$|R

Take conical {{cylinder}} spherical swashplate type {{axial piston}} pump as research object, the calculation method limitation of slipper shoe <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> which located in mounting plate is analyzed.

In order to deign the slipper shoe <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> accurately, this paper recommends the most reasonable method is using slipper movement envelope to determine its shape and size...|$|R
40|$|The {{rubberized}} {{fuel tank}} {{was found to}} have failed in the collar band regions. The failure was by tensile tearing along the line joining the <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> It appears most probable that improper tightening of the mounting brackets and/or nonconformities in the dimension of the rubberized fuel tank would have resulted in the tensile load in the <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> No material abnormalities appear to be responsible for the failure...|$|R

50|$|Threaded <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> in racks {{where the}} {{equipment}} is frequently changed are problematic because the threads can be damaged or the mounting screws can break off; both problems render the <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> unusable. Tapping large numbers of holes that may never be used is expensive; nonetheless tapped-hole racks are still in use, generally for hardware that rarely changes. Examples include telephone exchanges, network cabling panels, broadcast studios and some government and military applications.|$|R
