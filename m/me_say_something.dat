2500|$|At the October 2015 primary debate, Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, defended Clinton, saying: [...] "Let me say this. Let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> {{that may}} not be great politics. But I think the {{secretary}} is right. And that is that the American people {{are sick and tired of}} hearing about your damn emails!" [...] Sanders later clarified that he thought Clinton's emails were a [...] "very serious issue", but Americans want a discussion on issues that are [...] "real" [...] to them, such as paid family and medical leave, college affordability, and campaign finance reform.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{early in her}} career, Grant stated, [...] "I have a healthy {{sense of right and}} wrong, but sometimes, for example, using foul, exclamation-point words among friends can be good for a laugh." [...] The article which was based on that interview was constructed in such a manner so as to make it appear as though Grant condoned premarital sex. Later Grant reflected on how the article misrepresented her views, stating: [...] "We probably talked for two hours about sexual purity, but when the interview finally came out he worded {{it in such a way}} that it sounded like I condoned premarital sex. So I picked up that article and thought, 'You've made <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> I've never said, and you've totally disregarded two hours of Bible put in one flippant comment that I made about a moan.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} {{one day before}} it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium. After the screening, it received [...] "wild cheering" [...] from the audience. When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced Wild at Heart as the Palme d'Or winner at the awards ceremony, the boos almost drowned out the cheers, with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors. Barry Gifford remembers {{that there was a}} prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail. [...] "All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> like 'This is nothing like the book' or 'He ruined my book'. I think everybody from Time magazine to What's On In London was disappointed when I said 'This is fantastic. This is wonderful. It's like a big, dark, musical comedy'".|$|E
60|$|So {{he filled}} up the cheque for £250 {{and threw it}} down on the table before <b>me,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> about its being a bother to mix up {{business}} with pleasure.|$|R
60|$|I thought Joseph looked {{confused}} {{when he opened}} the house-door to me. As I ran upstairs, he followed <b>me,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>something.</b> I was in too great a hurry to pay any attention to him.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Rubelle waited, quietly {{arranging}} her nosegay, as if {{she expected}} <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Use against Clinton of the [...] "bitch" [...] epithet flourished {{during the}} campaign, {{especially}} on the Internet but via conventional media as well. [...] Hundreds of YouTube videos carried the word, with such titles as [...] "Hillary Clinton: The Bitch is Back" [...] and [...] "Hillary Clinton: Crazy Bitch", and a Facebook groups with the theme proliferated, including one named [...] "Life's a Bitch, Why Vote for One?" [...] that had more than 1,500 members. [...] Broadcaster Glenn Beck used the term in describing her. In a November 2007 public appearance, John McCain was asked {{by one of his}} supporters, [...] "How do we beat the bitch?" [...] (McCain responded by saying, [...] "May I give the translation?" [...] and then went on to say he respected Clinton but could defeat her.) [...] A February 2008 Saturday Night Live monologue by Tina Fey led a backlash-through-embracing movement, when she said [...] "I think what bothers me the most is when people say that Hillary is a bitch. Let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about that. Yeah, she is. And so am I.... You know what? Bitches get stuff done.... Get on board. Bitch is the new black!" [...] A new Facebook group [...] "Bitch is the new Black" [...] gained three times the membership of all the anti-Clinton groups named after the word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good Selina! dear Selina! You shall talk to <b>me.</b> <b>Say</b> <b>something</b> harmless--tell me {{a melancholy}} story--try {{to make me}} cry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to you, Infanta?" [...] {{returned}} Fordham, {{with all}} his gentleness. [...] "It {{seems to me that}} you are not always quite kind in your way of speaking of Allen." ...|$|E
60|$|She broke off, {{as though}} expecting <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> and I {{felt a little}} awkward.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you call}} yourselves {{religious}} men!" [...] I remarked {{when they had}} finished their story {{and looked at me}} expecting <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He paused again, as if expecting <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> After {{the words}} he had just spoken, what could I say? what could I think? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{love you}} so dearly. Let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> very plainly. If it be a long story, forgive me because of its {{importance}} to myself. I did think that you were--well, inclined to like me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no! But I knew it, all the same. It was {{not such}} a very wicked thing, as those things go. But I liked your not liking it. Will you let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Betty!" [...] Elsa's {{voice was}} serious. [...] "We've {{been friends for}} a good long time, so you'll let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> won't you? I think you're getting just the least bit hard. Now turn and rend me," [...] she added good-humoredly.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Somers: [...] "Well, no, then. I don't {{believe you}} would be a bore, if you knew it. Is that enough? or do you expect <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{prediction}} {{seems almost}} vague {{enough to have}} been uttered by an ancient oracle," [...] said I, observing that he waited, after repeating the verses, as if expecting <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The pony-chaise drew {{up at the}} door. This {{was another}} of the rare {{occasions}} in my life on which I acted discreetly. It was necessary for <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> I said, [...] "Good morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} hear <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> I did not mean?" [...] asked Lingard. [...] "You said you didn't want to die here--well, you must live [...] . Unless you change your mind," [...] he added, as if in {{involuntary}} afterthought.|$|E
60|$|So {{much for}} what I {{have heard from}} others {{on the subject of}} my Uncle George. My own {{personal}} experience of him is limited to what I remember as a mere child. Let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> however, first about my parents, my sister and myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} not to know wants than not to know want!" [...] I tell you, [...] boy, {{that is a great}} truth, and I hope you will {{remember}} it for [...] yourself as well {{as a part of the}} wisdom of your mother. And here [...] let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> else which is a sort of corollary of that wise [...] utterance: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} stop him, Copperfield, if you can,' cried Uriah, {{with his long}} {{forefinger}} pointing towards <b>me.</b> 'He'll <b>say</b> <b>something</b> presently--mind you!--he'll be sorry to have said afterwards, and you'll be sorry to have heard!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Let <b>me</b> now <b>say</b> <b>something</b> {{concerning}} {{the other great}} cause of some people's fear, as Wood has taught the London newswriter to express it. That [...] "his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant is coming over to settle Wood's halfpence." ...|$|R
50|$|I often try to {{make people}} like or accept <b>me</b> more by <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> funny about my own weaknesses, blunders, or faults.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll hear <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> more, presently," [...] {{retorted}} the other, {{with heat}} scarcely controlled. [...] "But we're wasting time. I don't insist {{that you see}} Neale. That's your affair. It {{seems to me the}} least you could do would be to thank him. I certainly advise you not to offer him gold. I do insist, however, that you let him see the girl!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Seizing this opportunity, Dick Lancaster {{stopped the}} captain, who {{he saw was}} {{preparing}} to go lengthily into the recent affair. [...] "Yes, yes," [...] he said, speaking quickly, [...] "and my blood has run hot as I read those beastly papers. But let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to you while I can. I am deeply interested in something else just now. I came here, captain, to propose marriage to your niece. Have I your consent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This remark {{suddenly}} {{brought home}} to Shelton the conviction that he was further than ever from avoiding the necessity for speaking. He {{walked over to the}} window. The rain was coming down with fury, though a golden line far down the sky promised the shower's quick end. [...] "For goodness' sake," [...] he thought, [...] "let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> however idiotic, and get it over!" [...] But he did not turn; a kind of paralysis had seized on him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} me again, as if he {{expected}} <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> more. I remained silent. He took a letter out of the breast-pocket of his coat {{and laid it on}} the table before me--just where the Confession had lain before I destroyed it! ...|$|R
60|$|He cannot believe <b>me.</b> It must <b>say</b> <b>something</b> else as well. He has {{not done}} {{anything}} contrary to these directions. He is most distressed.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was time}} for <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> There was a {{challenge}} in the reposeful black eyes resting upon my face. I murmured that I was very glad to hear it. She waited a little, then uttered meaningly, “Mr. Mills {{is a little bit}} uneasy about you.” ...|$|R
60|$|Here let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> at once. If this marvellous {{creature}} {{expected that}} the revelation of her splendour {{was going to make}} me her slave; to cause me {{to fall in love with}} her, as it is called, well, she must have been disappointed, for it had no such effect. It frightened and in a sense humbled me, that is all, for I felt myself to be in the presence of something that was not human, something alien to me as a man, which I could fear and even adore as humanity would adore that which is Divine, but with which I had no desire to mix. Moreover, was it divine, or was it something very different? I did not know, I only knew that it was not for me; as soon should I have thought of asking for a star to set within my lantern.|$|E
6000|$|... "The men {{here have}} {{generally}} high cheek bones, and are lean and swarthy, fond of action, dancing in particular. Now that I have mentioned dancing, let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> of their balls, {{which are very}} frequent here. When a stranger enters the dancing-hall, he sees {{one end of the}} room taken up by the ladies, who sit dismally in a group by themselves; in the other end stand their pensive partners that are to be; but no more intercourse between the sexes than there is between two countries at war. The ladies indeed may ogle, and the gentlemen sigh; but an embargo is laid on any closer commerce. At length, to interrupt hostilities, the lady directress, or intendant, or what you will, pitches upon a lady and gentleman to walk a minuet; which they perform with a formality that approaches to despondence. After five or six couple have thus walked the gantlet, all stand up to country dances; each gentleman furnished with a partner from the aforesaid lady directress; so they dance much, say nothing, and thus concludes our assembly. I told a Scotch gentleman that such profound silence resembled the ancient procession of the Roman matrons in honor of Ceres; and the Scotch gentleman told me (and, faith, I believe he was right) that I was a very great pedant for my pains.|$|E
6000|$|At length Rice himself came in, {{for it was}} now dark, with an ox-whip in his hand, {{breathing}} hard, and he {{too soon}} settled down into his seat not far from me, as if, now that his day's work was done, he had no farther to travel, but only to digest his supper at his leisure. When I {{asked him if he}} could give me a bed, he said there was one ready, in such a tone as implied that I ought to have known it, and the less said about that the better. So far so good. And yet he continued to look at me as if he would fain have <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> further like a traveller. I remarked, that it was a wild and rugged country he inhabited, and worth coming many miles to see. [...] "Not so very rough neither," [...] said he, and appealed to his men to bear witness to the breadth and smoothness of his fields, which consisted in all of one small interval, and to the size of his crops; [...] "and if we have some hills," [...] added he, [...] "there's no better pasturage anywhere." [...] I then asked if this place was the one I had heard of, calling it by a name I had seen on the map, or if it was a certain other; and he answered, gruffly, that it was neither the one nor the other; that he had settled it and cultivated it, and made it what it was, and I could know nothing about it. Observing some guns and other implements of hunting hanging on brackets around the room, and his hounds now sleeping on the floor, I took occasion to change the discourse, and inquired if there was much game in that country, and he answered this question more graciously, having some glimmering of my drift; but when I inquired if there were any bears, he answered impatiently that he was no more in danger of losing his sheep than his neighbors; he had tamed and civilized that region. After a pause, thinking of my journey on the morrow, and the few hours of daylight in that hollow and mountainous country, which would require me to be on my way betimes, I remarked that the day must be shorter by an hour there than on the neighboring plains; at which he gruffly asked what I knew about it, and affirmed that he had as much daylight as his neighbors; he ventured to say, the days were longer there than where I lived, as I should find if I stayed; that in some way, I could not be expected to understand how, the sun came over the mountains half an hour earlier, and stayed half an hour later there than on the neighboring plains. And more of like sort he said. He was, indeed, as rude as a fabled satyr. But I suffered him to pass for what he was,--for why should I quarrel with nature?--and was even pleased at the discovery of such a singular natural phenomenon. I dealt with him as if to me all manners were indifferent, and he had a sweet, wild way with him. I would not question nature, and I would rather have him as he was than as I would have him. For I had come up here not for sympathy, or kindness, or society, but for novelty and adventure, and to see what nature had produced here. I therefore did not repel his rudeness, but quite innocently welcomed it all, and knew how to appreciate it, as if I were reading in an old drama a part well sustained. He was indeed a coarse and sensual man, and, as I have said, uncivil, but he had his just quarrel with nature and mankind, I have no doubt, only he had no artificial covering to his ill-humors. He was earthy enough, but yet there was good soil in him, and even a long-suffering Saxon probity at bottom. If you could represent the case to him, he would not let the race die out in him, like a red Indian.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your trip {{has done}} you good," [...] said Sir Mallaby approvingly. [...] "The sea air has given you some sense. I'm glad of it. It {{makes it easier}} for <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> else that I've had on my mind for a good while. Sam, it's time you got married." ...|$|R
5000|$|About the structure—cited as {{the best}} of 1965 by the American Institute of Architects (AIA)—Bartos offered: [...] "The scrolls are not visual as a Rembrandt is visual. Only {{scholars}} can actually decipher them. It was up to us and <b>me</b> to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about them. Thus we built up an air of mystery".|$|R
60|$|The army drew nearer, marshalled in regiments and halted on {{the plain}} some two hundred yards away. Presently from it {{advanced}} generals and old men, clad in white, whom I took to be priests and elders. They approached {{to the number of}} twenty or more and bowed deeply, first to Quilla, who bent her head in acknowledgment and then to myself. After this they went to speak with Quilla and her following, but what they said I did not know. All the while, however, their eyes were fixed on me. Then Quilla brought them to me and one by one they bowed before <b>me,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> in a language which I did not understand well, for it was somewhat different from that which Kari had taught me.|$|R
