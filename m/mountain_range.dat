5|$|Black Rock, Antelope Island, White Rock, Egg Island, Fremont Island, and the Promontory <b>mountain</b> <b>range</b> {{are each}} {{extensions}} of the Oquirrh <b>Mountain</b> <b>Range,</b> which dips beneath the lake at its southeastern shore. Stansbury, Carrington, and Hat Islands are {{extensions of the}} Stansbury <b>mountain</b> <b>range,</b> and Strongs Knob {{is an extension of}} the Lakeside Mountains which run along the lake's western shore. The lake is deepest in the area between these island chains, measured by Howard Stansbury in 1850 at about 35 feet (10.7 meters) deep, and an average depth of 13 feet (four meters). When the water levels are low, Antelope Island becomes connected to the shore as a peninsula, as do Goose Islands, Browns Island, {{and some of the other}} islands. Stansbury Island and Strongs Knob remain peninsulas unless the water level rises well-above the average.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level <b>Mountain</b> <b>Range.</b> This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases of the presence of subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level <b>Mountain</b> <b>Range,</b> was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E
50|$|The Transverse Ranges is {{a unique}} set of <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> in California. They are the only <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> that run west to east, as opposed to the rest of California’s ranges that run north to south. These <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> run from Santa Barbara County into San Bernardino County. They derive the name Transverse Ranges due to their East-West orientation, making them {{transverse}} to the general North-South orientation of most of California's coastal <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges.</b>|$|R

5|$|The name Level Mountain is a {{reference}} to the gently sloping plateau surface of this large volcano. It was adopted on December 21, 1944 as identified in the Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. This name appeared on the National Topographic System (NTS) map 104/NE but was replaced with the name Level <b>Mountain</b> <b>Range</b> on August 14, 1952 upon production of NTS map 104J. The reason for this name change was that cartographers were uncertain as to what the name Level Mountain referred to. They cited H. S. Bostock's 1948 report Physiography of the Canadian Cordillera, With Special Reference to the Area North of the Fifty-Fifth Parallel in which Bostock stated that Level Mountain is a small prominent <b>mountain</b> <b>range</b> on the Nahlin Plateau. Despite this misinterpretation, Level Mountain is still the local name for the entire massif and the Level <b>Mountain</b> <b>Range</b> for a range of steep peaks centered on the volcano's summit.|$|E

5|$|A <b>mountain</b> <b>range</b> in Alaska, and two naval ships, {{were named}} in De Long's honor. The three Arctic islands {{discovered}} during the expedition, plus two others discovered {{a few years}} later, form an archipelago that bears the name Ostrova De Longa; despite Melville's planting of the American flag, the islands have always been accepted as Russian territory.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1986 Idaho {{license plates}} {{depicted}} a basic <b>mountain</b> <b>range</b> {{that was supposed}} to represent the Sawtooths; in 1991 the plates were revised to more accurately represent the mountains. The Idaho Division of Motor Vehicles also created a license plate depicting the SNRA.|$|E
5|$|Exposed in {{the middle}} of the <b>mountain</b> <b>range</b> is an {{assemblage}} of deformed andesite to dacite lava flows and volcanoclastic sediments. These basement rocks were created during the late Mesozoic era, long before the Itcha Range formed.

5|$|Huascarán National Park {{protects the}} Cordillera Blanca, {{which is the}} world's highest {{tropical}} <b>mountain</b> <b>range.</b> Located in the central Peruvian Andes, the park's 340,000 hectares cover an elevational range from around 2,500 m to the several snow-capped peaks above 6,000 m. Among those peaks are Huascarán (Peru's highest at 6,768 m), Huandoy, Copa, Huantsán and many others.|$|E
5000|$|Mountains {{on other}} planets and natural {{satellites}} of the Solar System are often isolated and formed mainly by {{processes such as}} impacts, though there are examples of <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> (or [...] "Montes") somewhat similar to those on Earth. Saturn's moon Titan and Pluto, in particular exhibit large <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> in chains composed mainly of ices rather than rock. Examples include the Mithrim Montes and Doom Mons on Titan, and Norgay Montes and Hillary Montes on Pluto. Some terrestrial planets other than Earth also exhibit rocky <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges,</b> such as Maxwell Montes on Venus taller than any on Earth and Tartarus Montes on Mars, Jupiter's moon Io has <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> formed from tectonic processes including Boösaule Montes, Dorian Montes, Hi'iaka Montes and Euboea Montes.|$|R

50|$|During the Japanese {{colonial era}} (1910-1945), Imperial Japan {{attempted}} to restructure Korean mountains {{in accordance with}} the concept of <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges.</b> The notion of the <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> that prevailed during the Japanese colonial era was one based on geological structures under the ground rather than topographical ones.|$|R
5|$|In South America, the Andes <b>mountain</b> <b>range</b> blocks Pacific {{moisture}} that {{arrives in}} that continent, {{resulting in a}} desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina. The Sierra Nevada range creates the same effect in North America forming the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts.|$|E
5|$|In the 9th century BC, the Assyrian king AshurnasirpalII {{conquered the}} Lebanon <b>mountain</b> <b>range</b> and its coastal cities. The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon, along {{with every other}} Phoenician city. These {{payments}} stimulated Sidon's search for new means of provisioning and furthered Phoenician emigration and expansion, which peaked in the 8th century BC.|$|E
