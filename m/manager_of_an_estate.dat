50|$|Snorri and Herdís were {{together}} {{for four years}} at Borg. They had at least two children, Hallbera and Jón. The marriage succumbed to Snorri's philandering, and in 1206, he settled in Reykholt as <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>estate</b> there, but without Herdís. He made significant improvements to the estate, including a hot outdoor bath (Snorralaug). The bath and the buildings have been preserved to some extent. During the initial years at Reykholt he fathered five children by three different women: Guðrún Hreinsdóttir, Oddný, and Þuríður Hallsdóttir.|$|E

50|$|Sweden was at war {{during most}} of the 17th-century. This meant that many men were absent serving in warfare abroad, and the {{responsibility}} of their estates in Sweden fell upon their wives who were left behind at home. Because of gender roles expecting a different behavior from a female, female landowners were regarded to be more cruel than males when taking the role of the <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>estate.</b> Tales of former landowners haunting their estates after death out of remorse for their repression therefore became a way of tenants to indirectly criticize their own living landowners.|$|E
5000|$|Hilda Caselli {{was born}} and raised at Gammelsbo in Ramsberg in Västmanland, were her father was {{employed}} as the <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>estate.</b> Her father became blind in 1859, and the family moved to Uppsala, were her brothers studied at the university: similar to many females of her generation, she and her sisters were in contrast educated in very little more than to manage a household at home. She found this unfair, which reportedly affected her. As an adult, she educated herself in the governess training course at the newly founded pioneer female seminary of Jane Miller Thengberg in Uppsala, the Klosterskolan, and made a study trip to England in 1862.|$|E
50|$|Jensen {{was born}} in Nakskov, Denmark, but {{spent much of his}} {{childhood}} in northern Sweden, because his father obtained a job there as the <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>estate.</b> Their family returned to Denmark before 1876, when Jensen enrolled to the Copenhagen College of Technology. Although he studied mathematics among various subjects at college, and even published a research paper in mathematics, he learned advanced math topics later by himself and never held any academic position. Instead, he was a successful engineer for the Copenhagen Telephone Company between 1881 and 1924, and became head of the technical department in 1890. All his mathematics research was carried out in his spare time. Jensen is mostly renowned for his famous inequality, Jensen's inequality. In 1915, Jensen also proved Jensen's formula in complex analysis.|$|E

5000|$|In the Kamakura period, the vassalage {{ties between}} the samurai {{stewards}} (jito) and the Kamakura regime (AD 1185-1333) were intermediary, because they placed the samurai steward (Jitō) {{in a position where}} he was answerable {{at the same time to}} both Kamakura and Kyoto. As a samurai he was placed in a direct vassalage relationship to the shogun as a member of his house in a fictive kinship tie. As a steward, the samurai became a shogunal houseman (gokenin) and trusted vassal, and given the management of an estate that legally belonged to a noble in Kyoto. [...] This is where the intermediary nature of Kamakura vassalage ties lies. As a vassal of the warrior regime in Kamakura he was answerable to the shogun in the form of military service and dues, but as a <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>estate</b> owned by a noble, he had to pay rent to the latter.|$|E

50|$|The present {{manor house}} is a {{building}} with eight axes of symmetry with rendered walls, a slate-covered half-hipped mansard roof.

50|$|The {{activities}} of the meter maids were supposed to promote goodwill, but they were controversial because feeding parking meters was illegal. However the council decided to ignore the offence because the maids were providing such good publicity for the area. The first maid, Annette Welch, was disinherited by her grandmother for working in that way, but went on to marry the <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> real <b>estate</b> firm in Surfers Paradise. Many women who worked as meter maids went on to have careers as models after the initial exposure.|$|R
50|$|Macqueen {{was born}} in Crawford, Lanarkshire, Scotland, in 1778 and had become <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sugar <b>estate</b> on Grenada by 1797. The British Admiralty postal sailing brigs were {{considered}} to be slow and unreliable by the colonial community, so on his return to Glasgow in 1830 he started a campaign for a steamship mail service to the West Indies. The government eventually decided to fund the project, and in 1839 the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company was granted a royal charter. In 1840 the Admiralty awarded it a contract to deliver mail to the West Indian colonies, with the first departure from Falmouth, Cornwall, on 3 January 1842. The mail network expanded and the company operated services within the West Indies and to New York and Halifax.|$|R

50|$|Eileen Jessup, a {{nurse in}} her 60s, owned a house on Great North Road in Auckland, that had a full street frontage. Paul Nichols, <b>a</b> <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> real <b>estate</b> agency in Australia, owned {{the house on the}} back section, and its sole access was a 3.66 meter {{easement}} over Nichols property. This means of access was deemed to be unsatisfactory to Nichols. To rectify this Nichols proposed to Jessup that they amalgamate both their respective driveways, which would improve the value of the back property by $45,000 {{due to the fact that}} the improved access would let Nichols to build up to 12 flats on that property, and reduce the value of front property by $3,000 as the widened driveway would now come up to inches of the side of her house.|$|R

Sergey Nikitich Sokolov (a variation on whose father's name, Mikita, he later used as a second part to his nom-de-plume), and Maria Ivanovna Sokolova (1870—1939), a peasant woman. He spent his early years in Smolenskaya gubernia, at Kislovo village, his father's homeland. In 1903 Ivan Sokolov entered the Alexandrovsky school in Smolensk, dropped in 1910 (for alleged participation in local revolutionary circles) and moved to Saint Petersburg where he enrolled at the State agricultural management's four-year courses. In Petersburg he's met Aleksey Remizov, Alexander Kuprin, Mikhail Prishvin and started to write; his debut Salt of the Earth short story, a complicated folklore-influenced piece, was dedicated to Remizov, his friend and critic.|$|R
40|$|Forest {{planning}} in Sweden today translates not only into planning of timber production, {{but also for}} the provision of other functions and services. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods provide a way to take also non-monetary values into account in planning. The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain experience on how to use a forest decision support system combined with an MCDA tool in practical forestry. We used a new forest planning tool, PlanWise, which includes an integrated MCDA module, PlanEval. Using the software, the decision maker can compare different forest plans and evaluate them against his/her objectives in a structured and analytical manner. The analysis thus provides <b>a</b> ranking <b>of</b> the alternatives based on the individual preferences of the decision maker. PlanEval and the MCDA planning process are described in a case study, where the <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forest <b>estate</b> in southwestern Sweden used the program to compare different forest plans made for the estate. In the paper, we analyze possibilities and challenges of this approach and identify problems such as the adherence to formal requirements of MCDA techniques and the difficulty of comparing maps. Possibilities to expedite an MCDA planning process further are also discussed. The findings confirm that integration <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MCDA tool with a forest decision support system is valuable, but requires expert assistance to be successful...|$|R

5000|$|According to S.H.

Dr. Baini Prashad, Director of the Zoological Survey of India, Indian Museum, Calcutta made further inquiries and learned that the creature was a black leopard and not, as reported by Reuters, a tiger. Sankahal noted that the [...] "Dibrugarh Black Tiger" [...] reported to be 12 feet long and 3.5 feet high {{turned out to be}} a 7 ft black leopard. R. I. Pocock wrote [...] "A ridiculous measurement (12 ft) ever for a tiger: the animal would require another pair of legs in the middle of its body, like a billiard table, to support its weight." ...|$|R
