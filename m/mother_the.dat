50|$|The Strange Situation was an {{experimental}} procedure developed by Ainsworth {{to study the}} variety of attachment forms between one- to two-year-olds and their <b>mothers.</b> <b>Mothers</b> at <b>the</b> time were their primary caregivers. The sample {{was made up of}} 100 middle class American families. There was a room set up with one-way glass allowing the researcher to observe the interaction. Inside the room, there were some toys and a confederate, fulfilling the role of stranger. The Strange Situation had eight episodes lasting three minutes each. The behavior of the infant was observed during each phase. <b>The</b> <b>mother,</b> baby and experimenter were all together initially. This phase lasted less than one minute. Then <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> and baby were alone in the room. A stranger, confederate, joined <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> and infant. After a set time had passed, <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> would leave <b>the</b> room, leaving her child with the stranger. The children with a secure attachment to their mother would cry for a few minutes but were able to compose themselves and play with the toys. Once <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> returned, <b>the</b> children with secure attachments greeted them and returned to play. Sometimes, they would show their <b>mothers</b> <b>the</b> toys with which they had played. As <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> returned, <b>the</b> stranger left. Then <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> left and <b>the</b> infant was left alone. The stranger returned. Lastly, <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> returned and <b>the</b> stranger left.
