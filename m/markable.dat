60|$|The third lion of Arles {{has nothing}} to do with the ancient world, but only with the old one. The church of Saint Trophimus, whose {{wonderful}} Romanesque porch is the principal ornament of the principal place, - a place otherwise distinguished by the presence of a slim and tapering obelisk in the middle, as well as by that of the Hotel de Ville and the museum - the interesting church of Saint Trophimus swears a little, as the French say, with the peculiar character of Arles. It is very remarkable, but I would rather it were in another place. Arles is delightfully pagan, and Saint Trophimus, with its apostolic sculptures, is rather a false note. These sculptures are equally re- <b>markable</b> for their primitive vigor and for the perfect preservation in which they have come down to us. The deep recess of a round-arched porch of the twelfth century is covered with quaint figures, which have not lost a nose or a finger. An angular, Byzan- tine-looking Christ sits in a diamond-shaped frame at the summit of the arch, surrounded by little angels, by great apostles, by winged beasts, by a hundred sacred symbols and grotesque ornaments. It is a dense embroidery of sculpture, black with time, but as uninjured as if it had been kept under glass. One good mark for the French Revolution! Of the in- terior of the church, which has a nave of the twelfth century, and a choir three hundred years more recent, I chiefly remember the odd feature that the Romanesque aisles are so narrow that you literally - or almost - squeeze through them. You do so with some eager- ness, for your natural purpose is to pass out to the cloister. This cloister, as distinguished and as per- fect as the porch, has a great deal of charm. Its four sides, which are not of the same period (the earliest and best are of the twelfth century), have an elaborate arcade, supported on delicate pairs of columns, the capitals of which show an extraordinary variety of device and ornament. At the corners of the quadrangle these columns take the form of curious human figures. The whole thing is a gem of lightness and preserva- tion, and is often cited for its beauty; but - if it doesn't sound too profane - I prefer, especially at Arles, the ruins of the Roman theatre. The antique element is too precious to be mingled with anything less rare. This truth was very present to my mind during a ramble of a couple of hours that I took just before leaving the place; and the glowing beauty of the morning gave the last touch of the impression. I spent half an hour at the Museum; then I took an- other look at the Roman theatre; after which I walked a little out of the town to the Aliscamps, the old Elysian Fields, the meagre remnant of the old pagan place of sepulture, which was afterwards used by the Christians, but has been for ages deserted, and now consists only of a melancholy avenue of cypresses, lined with a succession of ancient sarcophagi, empty, mossy, and mutilated. An iron-foundry, or some hor- rible establishment which is conditioned upon tall chimneys and a noise of hammering and banging, has been established near at hand; but the cypresses shut it out well enough, and this small patch of Elysium is a very romantic corner.|$|E

The corpus consists of 480 news articles, i. e. 120 English news articles and their translations in Spanish, Italian, and Dutch. MEANTIME contains annotations at different levels. The document-level annotation includes <b>markables</b> (e. g. entity mentions, event mentions, time expressions, and numerical expressions), relations between <b>markables</b> (modeling, for example, temporal information and semantic role labeling), and entity and event intra-document coreference. The corpus-level annotation includes entity and event cross-document coreference.

The {{goal of the}} task was to construct a system that links the <b>markables</b> corresponding to the same entity. Materials and methods The task organizers provided progress notes and discharge summaries that were annotated with the <b>markables</b> of treatment, problem, test, person, and pronoun. We used a multi-pass sieve algorithm that applies deterministic rules {{in the order of}} preciseness and simultaneously gathers information about the entities in the documents. Our system, MedCoref, also uses a state-of-the-art machine learning framework {{as an alternative to the}} final, rule-based pronoun resolution sieve. Results The best system that uses a multi-pass sieve has an overall score of 0. 836 (average of B 3, MUC, Blanc, and CEAF F score) for the training set and 0. 843 for the test set. Discussion A supervised machine learning system that typically uses a single function to find coreferents cannot accommodate irregularities encountered in data especially given the insufficient number of examples. On the other hand, a completely deterministic system could lead to a decrease in recall (sensitivity) when the rules are not exhaustive. The sieve-based framework allows one to combine reliable machine learning components with rules designed by experts. Conclusion Using relatively simple rules, part-of-speech information, and semantic type properties, an effective coreference resolution system could be designed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{long-term}} {{goal of this}} work is the automated discovery of anaphoric relations from the clinical narrative. The creation of a gold standard set from a cross-institutional corpus of clinical notes and high-level characteristics of that gold standard are described. METHODS: A standard methodology for annotation guideline development, gold standard annotations, and inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was used. RESULTS: The gold standard annotations resulted in 7214 <b>markables,</b> 5992 pairs, and 1304 chains. Each report averaged 40 anaphoric <b>markables,</b> 33 pairs, and seven chains. The overall IAA is high on the Mayo dataset (0. 6607), and moderate on the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) dataset (0. 4072). The IAA between each annotator and the gold standard is high (Mayo: 0. 7669, 0. 7697, and 0. 9021; UPMC: 0. 6753 and 0. 7138). These results imply a quality corpus feasible for system development. They also suggest the complementary nature of the annotations performed by the experts {{and the importance of}} an annotator team with diverse knowledge backgrounds. LIMITATIONS: Only one of the annotators had the linguistic background necessary for annotation of the linguistic attributes. The overall generalizability of the guidelines will be further strengthened by annotations of data from additional sites. This will increase the overall corpus size and the representation of each relation type. CONCLUSION: The first step toward the development of an anaphoric relation resolver as part of a comprehensive natural language processing system geared specifically for the clinical narrative in the electronic medical record is described. The deidentified annotated corpus will be available to researchers...|$|R

The reason for this choice is due to the fact that event coreference can only take place whenever argumenthood is properly computed. It is a fact that in many cases, arguments of predicates are implicit and thus linguistically unexpressed. This prevents training to produce sensible results. We also assume that spatiotemporal locations need to be taken into account and this is also very often left implicit.

His resumption of ministerial work in 1863 did not interfere with his literary energy, which led to his undertaking in 1875 the editorship of the Expositor.

Its general tendency is perhaps best indicated by a sentence in Cox's own exposition of his aims in the first number : 'Our sole purpose is to expound the scriptures honestly and intelligently by permitting them to explain themselves neither thrusting upon them miracles which they do not claim or dogmas to which they lend no support, nor venturing to question the doctrines they obviously teach or the miracles which they plainly affirm.'
