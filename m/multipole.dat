Therefore, {{it is used}} to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the Tevatron and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex <b>multipole</b> magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.|$|E

A dichroic signal exploiting the Borrmann effect with a linearly polarized beam presents charge-like <b>multipoles</b> that include a hexadecapole. A difference between dichroic signals obtained with a twisted beam carrying spin polarization (circular polarization) and opposite winding numbers presents charge-like atomic <b>multipoles,</b> whereas a twisted beam carrying linear polarization alone presents magnetic (time-odd) <b>multipoles.</b> Charge-like <b>multipoles</b> include a quadrupole, and magnetic <b>multipoles</b> include a dipole and an octupole.
