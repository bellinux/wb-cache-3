25|$|The {{scientific}} and natural interest of this tiny group of islands {{lies in its}} marine biodiversity, its unique flora and many avian species that breed annually on its rock cliffs or use them on their stopover on normal migratory patterns. About 3% of the 9000 species of birds are marine species, the remaining are migratory species. The abundance of birds on the islands, at one time, made the islands an attractive hunting area for peoples of the region. At {{the end of the}} 19th century the German naturalist Ernst Schmitz noted that 20–22,000 Cory's shearwaters were hunted in September or October in the islands; the hunts continued until 1967. Madeiran expeditions to the islands were responsible for the killing of juvenile birds for food, while their down was used to stuff pillows and comforters. Presently the islands are home or stopover for: Cory's shearwaters (approximately 14,000), white-faced storm-petrel (12,000), Bulwer's petrel (500), North Atlantic little shearwater (500), <b>Madeiran</b> <b>storm-petrel</b> (1000), yellow-legged gull, the roseate tern and Berthelot's pipit; which are subjects of annual scientific expeditions. Many of theses species are vulnerable to local predators, primarily from populations of brown rat and predatory bird species, like the yellow-legged gull, which will consume both eggs and chicks (the white-faced storm-petrel and Bulwer's petrel are primarily susceptible). These islands also have many endemic fauna species, including local snails and the unique gecko Tarentola boettgeri bischoffi.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of sympatric speciation (the evolution of reproductive isolation between codistributed populations) in generating biodiversity is highly controversial. Whereas potential examples of sympatric speciation exist for plants, insects, and fishes, most theoretical models {{suggest that it}} requires conditions that are probably not common in nature, and only two possible cases have been described for tetrapods. One mechanism by which it could occur is through allochronic isolation-separation of populations by breeding time. Oceanodroma castro (the <b>Madeiran</b> or band-rumped <b>storm-petrel)</b> is a small seabird that nests on tropical and subtropical islands throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In at least five archipelagos, different individuals breed on the same islands in different seasons. We compared variation in five micro-satellite loci and the mitochondrial control region among 562 O. castro from throughout the species' range. We found that sympatric seasonal populations differ genetically within all five archipelagos and have ceased to exchange genes in two. Population and gene trees all indicate that seasonal populations within four of the archipelagos are {{more closely related to}} each other than to populations from the same season from other archipelagos; divergence of the fifth sympatric pair is too ancient for reliable inference. Thus, seasonal populations appear to have arisen sympatrically at least four times. This is the first evidence for sympatric speciation by allochrony in a tetrapod, and adds to growing indications that population differentiation and speciation can occur without geographic barriers to gene flow...|$|R
40|$|Breeding Madeiran Storm-petrels Oceanodroma castro on Farilhão Grande islet {{was first}} {{described}} in the early 80 s. Despite being an important breeding colony at nationally and global level for the species distribution, few studies regarding monitoring and/or research have been developed. In order to update the knowledge about this population, SPEA, under the FAME project, made 7 visits to the islet between 2011 and 2012. We used mist-nets, nocturnal vocalizations and ground search to assess the population size. The population {{was estimated to be}} 473 individuals, resulting in 102 - 201 breeding pairs, which may indicate a high population decreasing. Comparison with previous studies emphasizes the need to conduct a directed census in order to obtain more robust estimate of this population. For the first time it was used a tracking device (GLS) in Madeiran Storm-petrels to assess movements and distribution of the species during the breeding season. The only GLS recovered showed that the individual made a 5 days trip over open sea to the west coast of Morocco. The walls built in 2002, during an action performed previously by SPEA, which host some <b>Madeiran</b> <b>Storm-petrel</b> nests, were rebuilt. We also implemented 36 new artificial nests that will enable future work with this population. A census of Yellow-legged Gull Larus michahellis that breeds on the islet took place, and 170 - 180 pairs were estimated. During the several visits to the island, it was detected gulls like signs of predation on <b>Madeiran</b> <b>Storm-petrel.</b> This effect however will be better reported later...|$|E
40|$|Seabird {{populations in}} the Azores {{archipelago}} are currently much smaller and more restricted in distribution than in the past. Important factors in this decline include predation by alien mammals, human exploitation, and habitat loss. We investigated {{the extent to which}} the presence of human and introduced predators, and some geographical features of the islands affect distribution and richness of seabirds breeding on this archipelago. Richness of seabird species (five Procellariiformes, one gull and two tern species) was higher on the main islands, which possess cliffs. As a result, shearwaters and gulls were more likely to be found on the larger islands that also tended to have rats and cats present. However, <b>Madeiran</b> <b>Storm-petrel</b> Oceanodroma castro and Bulwer's Petrel Bulweria bulwerii only breed in numbers on a very few rat-free islets. Continued management is needed to avoid human disturbance and alien invasion onto islets with small petrels. We recommend study of the effects of mammals on Little Shearwaters Puffinus assimilis baroli and Manx Shearwaters P. puffinus in the Azores, as the overlap between the distributions of these two species and rats is surprising...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of two seasonally distinct breeding populations of Oceanodroma storm-petrels in the Azores islands was first documented in 1996. The discovery of morphological {{differences between the}} populations led to the suggestion that they may represent cryptic sibling species. Recent mtDNA and microsatellite analysis from storm-petrel populations has considerably advanced our understanding of their taxonomic relationships. Here we present new information on the timing of breeding and moult of the two Azores populations, the extent of exchange of individuals between seasons, and diet from feather isotopes. We conclude that the hot-season Azores population {{should be considered a}} new species for which we propose the name Oceanodroma monteiroi, Monteiro’s Storm-petrel. The species is both genetically distinct and genetically isolated from the sympatric cool-season population of <b>Madeiran</b> <b>Storm-petrel</b> Oceanodroma castro, and from all other populations of Oceanodroma castro in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans examined to date. Differences in the vocalizations permit species recognition, and the extent of primary feather wear and stage of moult aids separation of the two species in the Azores, which is especially valuable during August when both attend the breeding colonies in large numbers. Feather carbon and nitrogen isotope...|$|E
40|$|As on {{many other}} islands, {{most of the}} seabird species {{breeding}} in Portugal’s Azores archipelago are now restricted to tiny remnants of their former nesting range, owing {{in large part to}} the introduction of mammals by humans. Praia Islet, 0. 12 km 2 in size, is home to five seabird species, four of which fall under the European listing of “conservation concern. ” Introduced rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) on Praia had accelerated soil erosion through overgrazing, destroyed seabird nests, and competed for burrows with petrels. Restoration of seabird habitat on the islet began in 1995 and involved rabbit eradication, control of soil erosion, native plant reintroduction, and installation of artificial nests for common terns (Sterna hirundo), roseate terns (Sterna dougallii), and Madeiran storm-petrels (Oceanodroma castro). Rabbits were eradicated in 1997 using broadcast pellets containing poison. Since then, soil erosion has decreased, many of the reintroduced native plants have started to spread, and tern and <b>Madeiran</b> <b>storm-petrel</b> breeding numbers on the islet have increased by 1, 548 % and 43 %, respectively. However, Praia Islet seabirds remain vulnerable owing to human recreational activities. This case study highlights the need to consider local conditions carefully when assessing restoration options to effect rapid mammal eradication. It also confirms the value of combining measures aimed at restoring native vegetation and improving seabird habitat quality with alien herbivore eradication...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the results of}} a survey of breeding seabirds carried out between 2000 and 2002 in the northern islets of Lanzarote, Canary Islands, with particular emphasis on their status and distribution. For White-faced Stormpetrel Pelagodroma marina, <b>Madeiran</b> <b>Storm-petrel</b> Oceanodroma castro, Lesser Blackhacked Gull Larus [fuscus] graellsii and Yellow-legged Gull Larus cachinnans atlantis, somenew colonies were discovered on different islets. All species have maintained their numbers over the last 15 years, {{with the exception of the}} Yellow-legged Gull, which has undergone a well-documental increase; in 1987, about 400 breeding pairs were estimated but during the present study, almost 1000 pairs were counted. In addition, some comments on threats to these seabird populations are presented. On La Graciosa, feral cats are a major predator of the European Storm-petrel population, killing more than 50 birds during this study alone. The work reported in this paper was carried out as part of the project "Restoration of the islets and the cliffs of Famara (Lanzarote Island) " (LIFE 99 NAT/E/ 006392, 2000 - 2002) financed by the European Union and the Cabildo Insular de Lanzarote (Canary Islands, Spain).

40|$|Trophic {{ecology and}} {{movements}} are critical issues {{for understanding the}} role of marine predators in food webs and for facing the challenges of their conservation. Seabird foraging ecology has been increasingly studied, but small elusive species, such as those forming the"little shearwater" complex, remain poorly known. We present the first study on the movements and feeding ecology of the Barolo shearwater Puffinus baroli baroli in a colony from the Azores archipelago (NE Atlantic), combining global location-sensing units, stable isotope analyses of feathers (δ 13 C and δ 15 N), stomach flushings and data from maximum depth gauges. During the chick-rearing period, parents visited their nests most nights, foraged mainly south of the colony and fed at lower trophic levels than during the non-breeding period. Squid was the most diverse prey (6 families and at least 10 different taxa), but species composition varied considerably between years. Two squid families, Onychoteuthidae and Argonautidae, and the fish family Phycidae accounted for 82. 3 % of ingested prey by number. On average, maximum dive depths per foraging trip reached 14. 8 m (range: 7. 9 to 23. 1 m). After the breeding period, birds dispersed offshore in all directions and up to 2500 km from the breeding colony, and fed at higher trophic levels. Overall, our {{results indicate that the}} Barolo shearwater is a non-migratory shearwater feeding at the lowest trophic level among Macaronesian seabirds, showing both diurnal and nocturnal activity and feeding deeper in the water column, principally on small schooling squid and fish. These traits contrast with those of 3 other Azorean Procellariiformes (Cory"s shearwater Calonectris diomedea, the <b>Madeiran</b> <b>storm-petrel</b> Oceanodroma castro and Monteiro"s storm-petrel O. monteiroi), indicating ecological segregation within the Azorean seabird community...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent and}} {{intensity}} of artificial night lighting has increased with urban development worldwide. The resulting light pollution is responsible for mortality among many Procel- lariiformes species which show nocturnal activity on their breeding grounds. Here, we report light-induced mortality of Procellariiformes during a 9 -year study (1998 – 2006) on Tenerife, the largest island of the Canary archipelago. A total of 9880 birds from nine species were found grounded, the majority being Cory’s Shearwaters Calonectris diome- dea (93. 4 %). For this species the majority of grounded birds were fledglings (96. 4 %), which fall apparently while leaving their nesting colony for the first time; for the smaller species (storm-petrels) adult birds were more often grounded than fledglings. For almost all species, grounding showed a seasonal pattern linked with their breeding cycle. Certain phases of the moon influenced grounding of Cory’s Shearwater, with the extent of grounding being reduced during phases of full moon. The percentage of fledglings attracted to lights {{in relation to the}} fledglings produced annually varied between species and years (0 – 1. 3 % for the <b>Madeiran</b> <b>Storm-petrel</b> Oceanodroma castro; 41 – 71 % for Cory’s Shearwater). Mean adult mortality rates also varied between species (from 0. 4 % for the European Storm-petrel Hydrobates pelagicus and the Cory’s Shearwater, to 2. 3 % for the Manx Shearwater Puffinus puffinus). Here we show that light-induced mortality rates are of concern, at least for petrels and small shearwaters. Thanks to efforts involving civil cooperation, 95 % of grounded birds have been returned to the wild. To minimize the impact of artificial lights on petrels we recommend several conservation measures: continuing rescue campaigns, alteration of light signatures and reduction of light emis- sions during the fledging peaks. Furthermore, we recommend that a monitoring program for petrel populations be implemented, as well as further studies to assess the fate of released fledglings and continued research to address why petrels are attracted to lights.
