A transcript of the [...] "extremely contentious" [...] deposition was released in May 2016; Camille Cosby relied heavily on the <b>marital</b> <b>privilege</b> in refusing to respond to many questions.

40|$|In prosecutions {{for child}} abuse, the government’s most {{valuable}} witness {{is often the}} defendant’s spouse. Ordinarily, the <b>marital</b> <b>privileges</b> allow a witness to refuse to testify or a defendant to bar his or her spouse’s testimony. When a defendant is on trial for a crime committed against a child, however, the privileges are unavailable. Although this exception aims to serve justice on behalf of innocent children, its applicability often hinges {{on the relationship between}} perpetrator and victim. In some federal courts, the minor victim must be the child or stepchild of the defendant, while others have held the exception applicable even when the child is not related to the defendant. This Note addresses the injustice inherent in such a distinction, which protects some child victims of abuse better than others. Beginning with a background of the child abuse exception in federal courts, this Note then presents the current forms of the exception across the federal courts of appeals as well as in military courts-martial. Ultimately, this Note concludes that because the effective prosecution of child abusers {{is more important than the}} preservation of the defendant’s marriage, all federal courts should adopt an exception that would eliminate the <b>marital</b> <b>privileges</b> in prosecutions for the abuse of any child, regardless of the child’s relationship to the defendant...|$|R

25|$|As {{it could}} be expected, when they arrived on 13 August, Marie was disillusioned. The house, {{contained}} within {{the ruins of a}} former monastery, was in disrepair, damp and rat-infested. Her in-laws were peasants who disgusted her and regarded her with deep distrust. Instead of the wealth she expected, she was faced with considerable debt. In her despondency, she locked herself in her room the first night and wrote a letter to her husband, imploring him to release her from their marriage, while threatening to take her life with arsenic. Lafarge, whose affairs were desperate, agreed to make concessions except to release her from the marriage. He promised not to assert his <b>marital</b> <b>privileges</b> until he restored the estate to its original condition. She appeared to calm down, and their relationship appeared to have improved in the ensuing weeks.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} the first to explore whether the <b>marital</b> {{communications}} <b>privilege,</b> which protects from disclosure private communications between spouses, should attach to communication sent via Web-based email. Traditionally, the privilege does not attach where a third party learns, either intentionally or inadvertently, the content of an otherwise private communication. In the world of Web-based email, disclosure to a third party is necessary in order for successful communication to occur. Writers of Web-based email draft a message and store it on a third-party Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) server until the recipient reads the message. Even after the email has been delivered, a copy may remain on the ISP’s server indefinitely. This article investigates whether this process is inherently at odds with the <b>marital</b> communications <b>privilege.</b> This article will also explore whether marital communications should continue to be protected despite the privilege’s failure to meet some of its stated purposes...|$|R

50|$|In a few instances, {{such as the}} <b>marital</b> <b>{{privilege}},</b> {{the privilege}} is a right held by the potential witness.

40|$|Many {{same-sex}} couples {{have been in}} committed relationships for years, even decades. Yet until 2004 no {{same-sex couples}} in the United States {{had the right to}} marry in any state and until the U. S. Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges the right was unavailable to same-sex couples nationwide. Due to this longstanding denial of the right to marry, most same-sex relationships appear artificially short when measured solely by reference to the couple’s civil marriage date. This circumstance has important legal consequences for many same-sex couples, as a number of rights associated with marriage are tied not merely to the fact of marriage, but also to its length measured either in absolute terms or relative to a legally significant event. These rights include social security benefits, immigration rights, the <b>marital</b> communications <b>privilege,</b> and the rights to division of property and awards of alimony on divorce. Moreover, a same-sex couple whose relationship ended before the legalization of same-sex marriage may not receive any rights associated with marriage. This Article is the first to explore the phenomenon of backdating marriages as a means to ensure that same-sex couples are made whole for the harms caused by their longstanding inability to legally marry. The Article demonstrates that the Obergefell decision applies not merely prospectively but also retroactively, and that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to have their marriages backdated to the date they would have married but for the existence of a legal barrier. Because such backdating can create significant short-term administrative challenges, the Article provides alternatives to actual backdating that are somewhat easier for government agencies to administer but that still provide same-sex couples with constitutionally mandated “make whole” relief. Administrative challenges notwithstanding, the Article concludes that actual backdating—or its functional equivalent—is constitutionally necessary to remedy constitutional harms to same-sex couples imposed by the preexisting discriminatory scheme...|$|R
40|$|Despite a {{transformative}} {{half century}} of social change, marital status still matters. The marriage equality movement has drawn {{attention to the}} many benefits conferred in law by marriage {{at a time when}} the “marriage gap” between affluent and poor Americans widens and rates of nonmarital childbearing soar. This Essay explores the contested history of <b>marital</b> supremacy—the legal <b>privileging</b> of marriage—through the lens of the “illegitimacy” cases of the 1960 s and 1970 s. Often remembered as a triumph for nonmarital families, these decisions defined the constitutional harm of illegitimacy classifications as the unjust punishment of innocent children for the “sins” of their parents. By reaffirming the legitimacy of governmental objectives such as discouraging illicit sex and promoting traditional marriage, courts obscured the ways in which marital supremacy injured adults as well as children, reinforcing racial, gender, and economic inequality and circumscribing sexual and reproductive freedom. Using court documents and archival sources, this Essay uncovers alternative visions of the harm of illegitimacy penalties offered by advocates and activists who framed these laws and practices as centrally connected to poverty, systemic racial oppression, and the subordination of women. Civil rights and poverty lawyers spotlighted the disparate impact of illegitimacy penalties on poor families of color, especially African Americans in the South. Feminists emphasized how these laws disproportionately burdened women—who often bore primary responsibility for nonmarital children’s care and support—curtailing their sexual, reproductive, and economic freedom. The failure of these broader accounts of the harms of illegitimacy penalties to influence judicial opinions impoverished our constitutional politics in ways that reverberate today. In a world where marriage is both a privileged status and a status of the privileged, marriage equality that rests upon non-marriage’s ignominy risks reinforcing the many other status inequalities that taint the legacy of marital supremacy...|$|R

Believing the FBI will stop hassling her if they can't use her testimony, she asks Christopher to finally set a date for their wedding. However, she is forced to admit to Chris {{that she could be}} sterile, which sends him storming out in a fit of rage. Chris gets high on heroin and seeks advice from other mobsters, who urge him to marry Adriana regardless. Chris returns and agrees to marry Adriana. However, she learns from a lawyer that <b>marital</b> <b>privilege</b> only applies to conversations that take place after they get married, are not {{in the presence of a}} third party, and do not further any criminal enterprise. As no incriminating conversation she's ever had with Chris meets all these criteria, marriage will not solve her problems. This is reinforced by the FBI, who are marginally in favor of the proposed union. Adriana later cheerlessly unwraps her bridal shower presents in front of friends and family.|$|E

They are then interrupted by the arrival of Gabe Preston. Alex introduces them before promptly leading Reilly out of the house. On his way out, Reilly explains to Alex that whoever hired him did so on the instruction of her husband's killer, worried that she may regain her memory at any time, and wanting her close by if she did. Reilly says he believes she knows more than she realises, but she replies [...] "at times we all want to be kept in the dark".|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{all aspects of}} proposed federal rules of evidence affecting <b>marital</b> <b>privilege</b> in the United States.

40|$|To avoid {{reaching}} incorrect verdicts as {{a result}} of insufficient evidence, courts generally require witnesses to testify to all relevant facts within their knowledge. Two important exceptions to this general rule, incompetency and privilege, rest on very different rationales. Developed at common law to exclude unreliable evidence, rules of competency disqualify certain untrustworthy witnesses from testifying. To promote extrinsic public policies, however, privileges excuse competent witnesses from providing what may be highly probative and reliable evidence. In the past decade there have been calls for legislative or judicial recognition of a parent-child privilege, similar to the <b>marital</b> <b>privilege,</b> that would excuse parents from testifying against their offspring. In contrast to the virtually universal recognition of the <b>marital</b> <b>privilege,</b> however, among common law jurisdictions only Idaho recognized a parent–child privilege until a New York appellate court did so on federal constitutional grounds. This comment, in three parts, evaluates the propriety of recognizing a parent–child privilege. First, scrutiny of the general policy arguments advanced in support of the privilege and ananalysis of the privilege in light of Wigmore 2 ̆ 7 s conditions precedent to establishing any interpersonal privilege illustrate that sound public policy does not support recognition of a parent–child privilege. Second, despite the reasoning of the New York appellate court, the constitutional right of privacy does not encompass a parent–child privilege. Finally, the impossibility of fashioning an acceptable form of the privilege further demonstrates that a parent–child privilege should not be recognized...|$|E
