U. <b>S.</b> <b>motorcyclists</b> are at relatively high risk of crashing, per mile travelled, with rates 24 times {{higher than those of}} passenger car and light-duty truck drivers. However, motorcycles require just one quarter the parking space of a car, and can double network capacities (in terms of vehicles per hour), thereby reducing congestion. While most motorcycles enjoy high fuel economy, their low seating capacities render them little or no better than most cars and some light-duty trucks (assuming average vehicle occupancies). They emit relatively fewer grams of CO 2, NOx, SO 2 and PM 10 per person-mile traveled than most cars, but more VOC and CO, if a catalytic converter is not installed.

The Aircrew Training System (ATS) contractor utilizes a Fuselage Trainer (FuT) to provide scenarios for the Loadmaster students to practice {{loading and unloading}} a simulated aircraft. The problem was the USAF {{does not have enough}} training devices and these devices are not at a high enough fidelity to accomplish many of the aircraft functions to meet the training objectives before flying on the actual aircraft. The ATS has moved the pilot 2 ̆ 7 s initial training into the Weapon System Trainer (WST). The WST has nearly eliminated all the aircraft flights for pilot initial instrument training because the simulator is life-like enough to accomplish the training tasks to qualify the students in the device. The Loadmaster student flights are scheduled based upon the pilot 2 ̆ 7 s flight training, thus forcing the Loadmaster students to utilize some other type of simulator device for their initial training. The goal was to investigate an efficient and effective AR training system to instruct Loadmaster skills before they train on the aircraft.

We conduct sensitivity studies exploring the effects of pad composition, geometry, and material stiffness. We find that: (1) The football pad materials do not outperform the currently used military pad material in militarily-relevant impact scenarios; (2) Optimal material properties for a pad depend on impact energy; and (3) Thicker pads perform better at all velocities.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Sex and Gender: Military Contexts track. There has been a significant advancement in military technology recently. A shift has taken place from predominantly male infantry soldiers, with only basic protection and gear; to extremely effective, high-tech, lightweight protective gear and equipment, and some female infantry soldiers. It {{does not seem to be}} the case anymore that sheer brute strength is a necessary for an infantry soldier. Although there is no doubt that soldiers must be physically fit, recent projects like FIST (Future Infantry Soldier Technology) in the United Kingdom, have enabled soldiers to interact and respond to their environment in ways that was not previously possible. My aim in this paper is to discuss how new military technology seems to make traditional sexual distinctions irrelevant for soldiers. I will begin by briefly explaining FIST and the technological aspects that it entails. Secondly, I will explore some aspects of how this technology impacts women as infantry soldiers, and some possible ethical implications of this. It must be noted that information regarding FIST does not specifically address women in the military, but I am going to be using FIST as a case study. I think that the description of FIST lends itself to issues regarding sexual distinctions in the military. It is useful here to briefly describe FIST. FIST is an integration of various systems, which include (but is not limited to) : weapons, GPS, body armour, and communications devices. It is a current military project in the United Kingdom slated to enter service sometime between 2015 and 2020 (www. army-technology. com/projects/fist, 1) It should be noted that the FIST programme is not intended for every infantry soldier. Instead it will at the discretion of unit commanders whether their mission requires the FIST system. According to HYPERLINK 2 ̆ 2 [URL] www. army-technology. com/projects/fist, “The FIST programme covers the development of all areas of technology for the dismounted infantry soldier and emphasises (sic) the integration of the systems. ” This means that they will try to improve conditions for infantry soldiers in the battlefield. Specifically this is done by increasing a soldier 2 ̆ 7 s awareness of their environment, which is crucial. Improved communications and navigation equipment are connected directly to the soldier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>helmet</b> mounted sight, which will be explain shortly (Ibid, 2). The FIST system focuses on lighter, more maneuverable equipment and body armour. By shrinking the size of the equipment, and making it lighter, it will be much easier for a soldier to use. Likewise, body armour would be much more comfortable for the soldier of it was less bulky but nonetheless effective. The helmet mounted display will also be used for weapon sighting systems, which would reduce the amount of equipment the soldier would have to carry with them. Overall, “[T]he helmet-mounted display can show that battlefield situation, with wearer 2 ̆ 7 s position, positions of friendly and hostile troops and equipment and prioritised targets, as well as the downloaded imagery from his weapon sight. ” (Ibid., 3) From this brief description, I will draw some implications for women infantry soldiers. From the description, it seems evident that the goal of FIST is to enable soldiers with a better a chance at survival on the battlefield. The emphasis also seems to be on the accessibility of this equipment and making it much more lightweight. If this is the case, then physical strength will not matter as much when using it. Although there will be an obvious need for a soldier to have a certain level of physical fitness, there still opens the possibility for more people to become infantry soldiers who might have been excluded previously. FIST puts all potential infantry soldiers on the same level, as they will each have equipment that similarly enhances their ability to assess and interact with events on the battlefield. In this way, all traditional markers of sexual distinction, seem to no longer matter, nor even become apparent for the infantry soldier. It will become nearly impossible to distinguish between a female and a male infantry soldier on the battlefield when the FIST system is utilized. This seems to be a positive outcome of the FIST system because it will allow for infantry soldiers to be judged completely on merit. Certainly, while this is for the most part already happening in the military; the FIST system would ensure that more soldiers could participate in areas of their choosing, which could lead to more job satisfaction, hence leading to better job performance. 	Traditionally, the United Kingdom has not allowed women to serve in front-line infantry roles (BBC News, available at: [URL] It is only in the past ten years that they have considered trials to see how women soldiers react in combat situations (Ibid). If all infantry soldiers had access to the FIST system, the argument that women would not be able to cope with the physically demanding work (Ibid), would be all but void. This would allow women the opportunity to participate in the military in areas that were not traditionally open to them, hence allowing them more freedom to pursue their military careers as they see fit...|$|R
40|$|During the Apollo missions, many {{undesirable}} situations were encountered {{that must}} be mitigated prior to returning humans to the moon. Lunar dust (that part of the lunar regolith less than 20 m in diameter) was found to produce several problems with astronaut <b>s</b> suits and <b>helmets,</b> mechanical seals and equipment, and could have conceivably produced harmful physiological effects for the astronauts. For instance, the abrasive nature of the dust was found to cause malfunctions of various joints and seals of the spacecraft and suits. Additionally, though {{efforts were made to}} exclude lunar dust from the cabin of the lunar module, a significant amount of material nonetheless found its way inside. With the loss of gravity correlated with ascent of the lunar module from the lunar surface to rendezvous with the command module, much of the major portions of the contaminating soil and dust began to float, irritating the astronaut s eyes and being inhaled into their lungs. Our goal has been to understand some of the properties of lunar dust that could lead to possible hazards for humans. Due to the lack of an atmosphere, there is nothing to protect the lunar soil from ultraviolet radiation, solar wind, and meteorite impacts. These processes could all serve to activate the soil, or produce reactive surface species. In order to understand the possible toxic effects of the reactive dust, it is necessary to reactivate the dust, as samples returned during the Apollo missions were exposed to the atmosphere of the Earth. We have used grinding and UV exposure to mimic some of the processes occurring on the Moon. The level of activation has been monitored using two methods: fluorescence spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). These techniques allow the monitoring of hydroxyl radical production in solution. We have found that grinding of lunar dust produces 2 - 3 times the concentration of hydroxyl radicals as lunar simulant and 10 times that of quartz. Exposure of the lunar dust to UV radiation under vacuum was also found to lead to hydroxyl radical production. After grinding, we have also monitored loss of reactivity of the dusts by exposing them to conditions of known humidity and temperature. From these tests, {{it was found that the}} reactivity half-life of lunar simulant is approximately 3 hours, while that of quartz is approximately 2 hours. Placing lunar dust in solution could lead to effects on mechanical and physiological systems, as well as other biological systems. For instance, while it is known that lunar dust is highly abrasive and caused a variety of problems with suits and equipment during Apollo, it is unknown as to how these properties might be affected in the presence of water or other liquids. It is possible that the dust may release minerals (e. g., metallic nanophase Fe) into solution that could speed corrosion or rust. Also, as lunar dust produces hydroxyl radicals (and possibly other reactive oxygen species) in solution, these radicals could also lead to the breakdown of suit or habitat materials. In the body (i. e., in lung solution), the effects could be two-fold. First, if the lunar dust dissolves, it may release an excess of elements (such as zero-valence metallic Fe) that are necessary for bodily functions but only in certain concentration ranges. For lunar dust, the presence of nanophase iron being released into the body is a concern. Secondly, the hydroxyl radicals or other reactive oxygen species produced by the dust in solution could conceivably interact with cells, leading to various problems. We have studied the dissolution of both ground and unground lunar simulant in buffer solutions of different pH. The concentration of a number of species was determined using mass spectrometry. These studies showed that lowering the pH of the solution causes a dramatic increase in the amount of each element released into solution and that grinding also produces higher concentrations. Finally, we have perfmed initial tests aimed at understanding the effects of lunar simulant on cellular systems. Alveolar epithelial cells were cultured and exposed to different concentrations of dust suspended in cell culture media. After predetermined amounts of time, the media was removed and the concentrations of important inflammatory cytokines (IL 6, IL 8, and TNF-alpha) were measured. The results of these tests are being used to develop the correct protocols for tests to be performed using lunar dust samples...|$|R
