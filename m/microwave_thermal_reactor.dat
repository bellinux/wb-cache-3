40|$|The <b>microwave</b> <b>thermal</b> {{thruster}} heats propellant via a heat-exchanger then expands {{it through}} a rocket nozzle to produce thrust. The heat-exchanger is simply a microwave-absorbent structure through which propellant flows in small channels. Nuclear thermal thrusters are based on an analogous principle, using neutrons rather than microwaves, and have experimentally demonstrated specific impulses exceeding 850 seconds. A microwave equivalent will likely have a similar specific impulse, since both nuclear and <b>microwave</b> <b>thermal</b> thrusters are ultimately constrained by material thermal limits, rather than the energy-density limits of chemical propellants. We present the <b>microwave</b> <b>thermal</b> thruster concept by characterizing a novel variation for beamed-energy launch. In reducing the thruster concept to practice, the enabling physical process is microwave absorption by refractory materials, and we examine semiconductor and susceptor-based approaches to achieving this absorption within the heat-exchanger structure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Beamed-energy launch {{concepts}} {{employing a}} <b>microwave</b> <b>thermal</b> thruster are feasible in principle, and microwave sources of sufficient power to launch tons into LEO already exist. <b>Microwave</b> <b>thermal</b> thrusters operate on an analogous principle to nuclear thermal thrusters, which have experimentally demonstrated specific impulses exceeding 850 seconds. Assuming such performance, simple {{application of the}} rocket equation suggests that payload fractions of 10 % are possible for a single stage to orbit (SSTO) <b>microwave</b> <b>thermal</b> rocket. We present an SSTO concept employing a scaled X- 33 aeroshell. The flat aeroshell underside is covered by a thin-layer microwave absorbent heat-exchanger that forms part of the thruster. During ascent, the heat-exchanger faces the microwave beam. A simple ascent trajectory analysis incorporating X- 33 aerodynamic data predicts a 10 % payload fraction for a 1 ton craft of this type. In contrast, the Saturn V had 3 non-reusable stages and achieved a payload fraction of 4 %...|$|R
50|$|Pu-240, Pu-241, Pu-242 are {{produced}} by further neutron capture. The odd-mass isotopes Pu-239 and Pu-241 have about a 3/4 chance of undergoing fission on capture of a thermal neutron and about a 1/4 chance of retaining the neutron and becoming the following isotope. The even-mass isotopes are fertile material but not fissile and also have a lower overall probability (cross section) of neutron capture; therefore, they tend to accumulate in nuclear fuel used in a <b>thermal</b> <b>reactor,</b> the design of nearly all nuclear power plants today. In plutonium {{that has been used}} a second time in <b>thermal</b> <b>reactors</b> in MOX fuel, Pu-240 may even be the most common isotope. All plutonium isotopes and other actinides, however, are fissionable with fast neutrons. Pu-240 does have a moderate thermal neutron absorption cross section, so that Pu-241 production in a <b>thermal</b> <b>reactor</b> becomes a significant fraction as large as Pu-239 production.|$|R
