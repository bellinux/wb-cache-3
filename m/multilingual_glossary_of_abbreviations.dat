40|$|A {{comparative}} study of translation equivalents for health/medical terminology in Xitsonga was conducted. The research involved studying a selection of terms from a <b>glossary</b> (the DSAC <b>Multilingual</b> <b>Glossary</b> <b>of</b> Medical/Health Terminology) compiled by language experts. Purposive sampling was used, resulting {{in the identification of}} 33 problematic source language (English) terms. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted during which health experts were asked to provide Xitsonga equivalents for the selected English terms from the glossary. The translation equivalents provided in the DSAC <b>Multilingual</b> <b>Glossary</b> <b>of</b> Medical/Health Terminology and those given by the health experts were then subjected to evaluation, followed by comparative analysis by the researcher. The analysis indicates that the DSAC <b>Multilingual</b> <b>Glossary</b> <b>of</b> Medical/Health Terminology applied a variety of term formation strategies in accordance with the term formation principles available to Xitsonga. The most frequently used strategy, in 40 % of the cases, was translation by making use of a more general word, whilst paraphrasing was the second most frequently applied term formation strategy (32, 5 %). A number of source language (English) terms was found to be provided with inappropriate/incorrect target language equivalents. The health experts, on the other hand, mainly used paraphrase as a translation strategy, i. e. in 62, 5 % of the cases. The use of a more general word was the second most frequently applied term formation strategy (in 28, 1 % of cases). Although not similar to the DSAC <b>Multilingual</b> <b>Glossary</b> <b>of</b> Medical/Health Terminology translation equivalents, health experts also managed to apply a variety of different term formation strategies available to Xitsonga. Unlike the DSAC <b>Multilingual</b> <b>Glossary</b> <b>of</b> Medical/Health Terminology list in which a number of English terms (13 out of the total of 33 selected source language terms) were not provided with Xitsonga translation equivalents, the health experts provided Xitsonga equivalents for all the terms, except for one term (keratectomy). The reason why the health/medical experts used paraphrasing extensively may be that a single term equivalent did not exist or was not known, due to inadequate availability of standardised terms. However, the health experts also clearly felt the need for providing users with an explanation {{that could be used for}} communicative purposes, e. g. between medical staff and patients. Moreover, when developing terms (outside of the context of a particular translation task) it is highly probable that term developers would rather opt for maximising transparency and comprehensibility, than putting in an effort to coin a term that can be used as a so-called ‘directly insertable translation equivalent’. The implications of the research findings are discussed, with one main finding of the study suggesting a need for a collaborative effort in terminology development.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the experiments for knowledge exchange using social media during TSRC’s Beyond the Radar knowledge exchange work. Launched in July 2011, the “#btr 11 ” experiment sought to trial, and learn from, new ways of engaging with people around ‘below the radar’ issues using a range of online platforms. The paper introduces the project and the evaluation approach, before describing the project in greater detail. The approach is then contextualised within digital knowledge exchange literatures, and justification is provided for using social exchange theory as the evaluation’s underlying framework. Next, the paper uses this framework to generate some learning from #btr 11, through a thematic discussion around accepted practices, shared values and exchange relationships. It concludes with a summary and a set of lessons and insights that could be helpful for future experimentation with social media platforms. Hyperlinks have been provided where possible to provide readers with direct links to all the resources used for the evaluation – other resources are given in the bibliography.

40|$|Considerations on {{uncertainties}} and {{inconsistencies in}} the dendrometric terminology. In the italian forestry literature, the adjective “cormometric” {{combined with the}} noun volume or its equivalent, is used with three different meanings which are respectively linked to the stem, to the trunk or large timber. To find the origins and also the reasons for these different meanings of the term, {{we need to go}} back in history. The first definition is by Alfonso Di Berenger first director of the Vallombrosa Forest, the first seat of higher Forestry education in Italy between 1869 and 1951. He defined cormometric the volume of the “legname sociale” (industrial timber), or the trunk. Follows the definition of Vittorio Perona that, {{in the wake of the}} German concept of Derbholz, considers cormometric volume as including also portions of branches above seven centimeters. Giuseppe Di Tella, Professor of forest mensurations and forest management in Florence between 1916 and 1937 is the author of a large general volume table for fir where the cormometric volume is defined as the “stem including the top”, but also, following the doctrine, as a measure expressing the volume of the part of the stem that can provide wood for building or industry. Subsequently, with the definitions of the Professors Generoso Patrone and Guglielmo Giordano confirming the doctrinal meaning of Di Tella, the sense of the term remains unchanged. In 1986 Hellrigl called cormometric mass, the aboveground woody tree mass limi - ted to trunk and limbs to be determined; however, this definition did not find any application. Alternative definitions by Roberto Del Favero and Orazio La Marca consider cormometric volume including top and cormometric volume excluding top. In the forest literature, instead, there were more changes in 2007, when the Forestry Research Portal published a notation regarding cubing of forest stands, stating “in the cubing of forest stands, woody volume estimated for conifers is, in general, cormometric (i. e., volume of the stem including bark) ” which gave rise to the present note.

Fast-tracking concept learning to English as an Additional Language (EAL) students through corpus-based <b>multilingual</b> <b>glossaries.</b> Alternation. 17 (1) : 225 - 248. Available: [URL] aim {{of this article is to}} discuss the corpus-based <b>Multilingual</b> Concept <b>Glossaries</b> project at the University of Cape Town (UCT) and to show how <b>multilingual</b> <b>glossaries</b> can be used to fast-track concept literacy among English as Additional Language students (EALs). In South Africa, it is an accepted fact that most of EAL students from poor academic and family backgrounds enter higher education with limited English proficiency which makes it difficult for them to learn and understand concepts in different content learning areas (cf. Kapp 1998; Council on Higher Education 2007; National Benchmark Tests Project Progress Report 2009). Thus, the development <b>of</b> the <b>multilingual</b> <b>glossaries</b> is aimed at providing academic support to these students. It is the contention of this article that the development <b>of</b> these <b>glossaries</b> constitutes an important intervention strategy to optimize concepts learning in different content areas to EAL students. The pedagogic value <b>of</b> <b>glossaries</b> is widely acknowledged by many scholars in the field of academic literacy (cf. Hüllen 1989; Marzano 2003, 2004; Graves 2006; Beck, McKeown & Kucan 2008; Hiebert & Kamil 2005; Farstrup & Samuels 2008; Sauer 2009). However, as the Project is still in its initial stage, the article mainly provides a conceptual argument based on two theories, namely, the theory of conceptual difficulty (cf. Perkins 2007; 2009), which provides a theoretical framework for analysing EAL students' conceptual difficulties, and Vygotsky's socio-cultural constructive theory which provides a framework of pedagogic intervention to fast-track concepts learning...|$|R
