5|$|Hansen locates Yusupov, {{who tells}} him that Anna Kamsky, Viktor's daughter, is onboard and must be saved. Yusupov had brought her to Sakhalin to {{blackmail}} Viktor into turning the exocels into biological weapons. Eventually, Viktor and his colleague, Dr. Pavel Bakharev, began to experiment on live human infection, and the Eastern Spirit {{was on its way}} from the Sakhalin to collect the next batch of human specimens supplied by the Mafia when the exocel outbreak occurred. An exocel then bursts out of Yusupov's chest, killing him. Hansen finds Anna, who tells them they <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio room and contact her father. They contact the rig, but Bakharev tells Anna that Kamsky is missing and pleads with her not to return. She says no, telling Bakharev she will see him soon. They turn the ship back towards the Sakhalin but because the seas are so rough, they are unable to dock with the platform. As such, they head to the crow's nest and jump from the ship when it collides with the rig. Hansen makes the jump, but Anna falls into the sea.|$|E

Ashtar then blasts Ryu with energy from his own sword; before Ashtar can finish off Ryu, Robert appears and shoots Ashtar in the back, stopping him. Robert orders Ashtar to hand over his sword and give up, but Ashtar escapes with Irene, telling Ryu to follow him into the Maze of Darkness.|$|E

5|$|The Woman Hater is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Tom Taylor, a woman-hater, who sells his property to a financier at a play. In order to finalize the transaction, Taylor <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> financier's hotel and becomes {{the subject of a}} bet by Lou Bennett that she can win his affections. Lou succeeds in the bet, but Taylor finds out and is preparing to leave forever when Lou speaks to him. Little is known about the production or the cast other than a single credit of Violet Heming as Lou Bennett. The film was released on June 14, 1910, but is not know to have been reviewed by any trade publications. The film is presumed lost, but another production of the same name released the same year was rediscovered in New Zealand in 2010.|$|E

25|$|Yield {{management}} is particularly suitable when selling perishable products, i.e. goods that become unsellable {{at a point}} in time (for example air tickets just after a flight takes off). Industries that use yield management include airlines, hotels, stadiums and other venues with a fixed number of seats, and advertising. With an advance forecast of demand and pricing flexibility, buyers will self-sort based on their price sensitivity (using more power in off-peak hours or going to the theater mid-week), their demand sensitivity (must have the higher cost early morning flight or <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Saturday night opera) or their time of purchase (usually paying a premium for booking late).|$|E
25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{species are}} {{sometimes}} mistaken for dolphin relatives {{due to their}} similar overall morphology. However, the morphological traits are convergent. Temnodontosaurus were not mammals but were large marine reptiles and their ancestors were land dwelling reptiles. Temnodontosaurus do have morphological traits which differ from Cetacea also. Temnodontosaurus tail would beat laterally side to side, instead of up and down. Temnodontosaurus skull's also have nostrils that are {{placed in front of}} the eyes instead of on the dorsal side of the head like Cetaceans. Though reptiles, Temnodontosaurus can also be mistaken for fish due to their fins and elongate undifferentiated body, but unlike fish Temnodontosaurus are air breathers and <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water’s surface for air. Also Temnodontosaurus, like other Ichthyosaurs, are viviparous.|$|E

25|$|Polling day at {{a general}} {{election}} is a public holiday, and voting is compulsory. Unless the returning officer decides otherwise, polling stations are open from 8:00am to 8:00pm Voters <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> polling stations assigned to them. After the poll closes, the presiding officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may also affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres to be opened and the ballots counted. A candidate or his counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} number of votes for the candidate or group of candidates with the most votes and the number of votes of any other candidate or group of candidate is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the returning officer states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E

500|$|Polling day is {{a public}} holiday and voting is compulsory. Unless the {{returning}} officer decides otherwise, polling stations are open from 8:00a.m. to 8:00p.m. on polling day. To vote, voters <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> polling stations assigned to them. Applying for a ballot paper or voting {{in the name of}} someone else amounts to the offence of personation. If a person claiming to be a voter named in the electoral register turns up at a polling station after someone else claiming to be that voter has already voted, the second person is permitted to cast what is called a [...] "tendered vote" [...] using a ballot paper of a different colour after taking an oath to confirm his or her identity.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, {{during a}} storyline that saw Victoria and her {{siblings}} sue their father {{for control of}} a cosmetics line, Bibel wrote: [...] "Victoria, whose true motivation was to get her hands on Beauty of Nature so she could become its CEO, got a rude awakening when Nick told her {{in no uncertain terms}} that he had no interest in trading the settlement money for the company.

[...] Soon after, Bibel said that Victoria had been [...] "whiny" [...] and found the character's mother Nikki's storyline [...] "far more interesting". That same year, Giddens wrote that a blogger from The Washington Post compared Victoria to Rupert Murdoch, saying: [...] " [...] partial nod <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> soap opera The Young and the Restless, whose character Victoria Newman was arrested on her wedding day for allegedly bribing a foreign dignitary.

Jack and Sawyer meet up with Lapidus at the helicopter, but decide to rescue Hurley, who is with Ben, the mercenaries' target, before leaving for the freighter. Meanwhile, Sayid arrives at the beach on the freighter's Zodiac boat and informs the survivors that they <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> freighter {{as soon as possible}} because the mercenaries' secondary objective is to kill everyone on the island. He and Kate go after Jack and Sawyer, but are captured by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) {{and the rest of the}} Others.

500|$|After this point, {{the story}} {{continues}} differently {{depending on the}} Hero's alignment.

On their way they have to kill the Chaos Hero and fight Yuriko, who {{turns out to be}} the demon Lilith in disguise; she calls the Hero [...] "Adam", and says she wanted to create a new age and live with him forever, which is why she tried to execute the Heroine. After defeating her in battle, the Hero and the Heroine reach the basement and kill the demon Asura-ou; they then go to the cathedral's roof, where they are thanked by a messenger from God. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "chaos", he and the Heroine <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top floor and kill the archangel Michael, and on their way kill the Law Hero; the Chaos Hero dies, too, because of the magical ring he has been wearing. On the roof, they meet Lucifer, who says that a new era will begin, where both demons and humans are free; he also warns them that God still is alive. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "neutral", he and the Heroine must kill the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, Asura-ou, and Michael, and fight Yuriko. On the roof, they meet Taishang Laojun, who thanks them and says that balance is needed to achieve happiness; he asks the Hero and the Heroine to lead humanity to a future that doesn't rely on gods or demons. The game ends with the Heroine saying that those who have died will be reborn, and that it is time for creation and rebuilding.|$|E
