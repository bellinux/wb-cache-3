Red deer are common {{on the hills}} and the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland in internationally important numbers, with colonies of the former found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles and the latter most abundant in the Firth of Lorn. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore minke whales, killer whales, basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins are among the sea life {{that can be seen}} and edible crab and oyster are also found, in for example, the Sound of Scalpay.

5|$|On {{the high}} {{mountain}} tops, species including ptarmigan, <b>mountain</b> <b>hare</b> and stoat {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E

25|$|Only a few {{species of}} wild land mammals {{are found in}} the Faroe Islands today, all {{introduced}} by humans. Three species are thriving on the islands today: <b>mountain</b> <b>hare</b> (Lepus timidus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the house mouse (Mus musculus).

40|$|Culling {{wildlife}} hosts {{is often}} implemented as a management technique to control pathogen transmission from wildlife to domestic or other economically important animals. However, culling may have unexpected consequences, {{can be expensive}} and may have wider implications for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. 2.  We assess the evidence that culling <b>mountain</b> <b>hares</b> Lepus timidus is an effective and practical way to control louping ill virus in red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. 3.  Evidence from the available literature is limited, restricting our ability to reliably assess the effectiveness of culling <b>mountain</b> <b>hares</b> to control ticks, louping ill virus, or increase red grouse densities. Furthermore, the information required to assess the cost-benefit of this management strategy is lacking. The population response of <b>mountain</b> <b>hares</b> to culling is not well understood and the possible effects on their conservation status and the upland ecosystem remain unexplored. 4.  We conclude {{that there is no}} compelling evidence base to suggest culling <b>mountain</b> <b>hares</b> might increase red grouse densities. 5.  Synthesis and applications. Widespread culling of wildlife is not necessarily effective in reducing disease or improving economic returns. The use of wildlife culls for disease control should be proposed only when: (i) the pathogen transmission cycle is fully understood with all host-vector interactions considered; (ii) the response of wildlife populations to culling is known; and (iii) cost-benefit analysis shows that increased revenue from reduced disease prevalence exceeds the cost of culling...|$|R

25|$|The European rabbit is {{the only}} rabbit species that has been domesticated. All pet breeds of rabbits, such as Mini Lops and angoras, are of this species. However, rabbits and humans {{interact}} {{in many different ways}} beyond domestication. Rabbits are an example of an animal treated as a food, pet, and pest by members of the same culture. Urbanized European rabbits descended from pets have become pest problems in some cities. For instance, one of the northernmost populations of the species is now hosted by Helsinki, Finland, with an estimated 2,500 animals at the end of 2006 and 5,000 in autumn 2007. Finland's native lagomorphs are the European hare and the <b>mountain</b> <b>hare.</b> In Iceland, populations of O. cuniculus are also found in Reykjavik and in the Vestmann Islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal life}} {{in these areas}} is also {{relatively}} rich. The zone is particularly important to the brown bear, which likes to hibernate the winter away in dens along the mountainside. In spring, the brown bears descent to the plains, and only return to the mountain when the berries do. These terrains are also favored stomping grounds of the Eurasian lynx. Both species, brown bear and Eurasian lynx, are protected in Sweden. Besides the red fox, the other predators, which are the wolverine, the gray wolf and the Arctic fox, are much rarer {{and do not have}} a fixed location in the park. The park shelters an important population of moose that pass the summer on the mountain, but prefer to spend the winter in areas less snowy. There are no more wild reindeerin the park, which is part of those few Swedish mountains not included in the area of pasture of domestic reindeer. Muskox, which left the area almost 4000 years ago, were reintroduced in Norway and sometimes wander near the park. Among the smaller animals, one can cite the red squirrel, the European pine marten, and the <b>mountain</b> <b>hare.</b> Like other Swedish mountains, the Norway lemming is present in Fulufjället, but in a patchy fashion, extremely numerous some years and almost absent others. This phenomenon is still not entirely understood.|$|E
40|$|Scientific and circumstantial {{evidence}} of recent decades indicate decreasing population {{trends in the}} native <b>mountain</b> <b>hares</b> Lepus timidus of Fennoscandia (Finland, Sweden, Norway).

How these ecological mechanisms could function in detail, however, has not been clarified. In this study I use uncorrected hunting bag data (HBD) densities at the county level to test the relative importance of two hypotheses. First, predation by red foxes Vulpes vulpes on <b>mountain</b> <b>hares</b> and congeneric brown hares Lepus europaeus will be scrutinized in a historical perspective by means of correlation analysis on the long-term data set for Sweden.

500|$|The white {{protective}} coloration {{of arctic}} animals was noted by an early student of camouflage, the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, in his 1889 book Darwinism; he listed the polar bear, the American polar hare, the snowy owl and the gyr falcon as remaining white all year, while the arctic fox, arctic hare, ermine and ptarmigan change their colour, and observed [...] "the obvious explanation", {{that it was}} for concealment. Later zoologists such as Hugh B. Cott have echoed his observations, adding that other animals of the Arctic such as musk ox, moose, reindeer, wolverine and raven never become white [...] "even in the coldest parts of their range". Cott noted that both animals that hunt, like polar bear and stoat, and prey animals like ptarmigan and <b>mountain</b> <b>hare,</b> require camouflage to hide from prey or from predators respectively. There is little experimental evidence for the adaptiveness of white as camouflage, though the ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan [...] "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that cryptic brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation."

2500|$|Outside {{of southwestern}} Europe, the next closest {{association}} between lagomorphs and this species {{is in the}} arid steppe of southern Russia, hares are apparently the primary prey of the local eagle-owls. Little has been published in recent ornithological review, but old {{studies have indicated that}} the eagle-owls in this region are so dependent on hares, primarily again the <b>mountain</b> <b>hare</b> species, that cyclical reductions in numbers of the hares are followed immediately by a reduction of the local eagle-owls. A similar phenomenon has been noted in the great horned owl in its association with the snowshoe hare in the American boreal forest. The same prey, the <b>mountain</b> <b>hare,</b> was the most important along the Pechora River in Russia, making up 34.1% of prey numbers, although the general habitat is distinctly different from the steppe, as it consists of mountainous sub-taiga dense forests. Together with sizeable numbers of Eurasian red squirrels and large forest grouse which are the next most significant prey types by number, the mean prey size along the Pechora is presumably extremely large. Although in surrounding arid lowlands the food is almost totally dominated by gerbils, jirds and their kin, in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the cape hare (Lepus capensis) was the leading prey species, making up 44% of the prey numbers. In Mongolia, tolai hare (Lepus tolai), of similar size to the cape and Granada hare, were the most significant contributor of prey biomass, making up 30.6% of biomass but only contributed 4% of the prey by number Other than the prior mentioned species, at least five other species of hare have been found as occasional contributors to the eagle-owl’s diet. The only other family in the lagomorph order, the pikas, have been found to factor regularly into the diet of Eurasian eagle-owls as well, mainly in the mountainous regions of Asia. Pikas are much smaller than rabbits and hares, averaging [...] amongst the know prey species. One study in Mongolia found that Daurian pikas (Ochotona dauurica) made up 73% by number of the remains. In the Tibetan Plateau, the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) and gansu pika (Ochotona cansus) were the second and third most numerous prey species. The more sizeable large-eared pika (Ochotona macrotis) was the second most regular prey species in the Pamir Mountains, comprising 10.8% of the remains.|$|E
2500|$|The {{estimated}} {{typical range}} of weights of hares hunted by golden eagles is , whereas rabbits hunted weigh {{a little under}} [...] on average. Except for the occasional Arctic hare, white-tailed or antelope jackrabbit (Lepus alleni), most leporids hunted in North America weigh [...] or less, including the smallest hare in the world, the [...] snowshoe hare, and the smallest rabbit in the world, the [...] pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis). In Europe, where the large brown and mountain hares, both sometimes weighing over , are habitually hunted, the prey may be dismembered before being brought to the nest. Across the golden eagle's range, hares and rabbits are generally known to be hunted via either “high soar with glide attack” or “contour flight with short glide attack”. Leporids are basically solitary animals but they can occur at high densities, such as when jackrabbits are at their peak numbers in brushy areas of Western North America or (historically at least) rabbits in similar brush habitats on the Iberian Peninsula. The goal of the golden eagle while hunting hares and rabbits is to catch the prey when it is foraging out in the open. If the leporid becomes aware of the eagle's descent upon them {{more than a few}} seconds before the strike, they invariably break into a fast, hopping run. Once contact is made, rabbits and hares will often kick or try to bite the eagle but escape is unlikely once they are pinned to the ground. In some case they are able to reach vegetative coverage and, if the said cover is sufficiently deep and dense, the eagle cannot pursue them any further. Although rare, golden eagles have been known to use the “walk and grab attack” to pull a leporid out of its cover. Many hunts in Scotland of <b>mountain</b> <b>hare</b> involve a somewhat lengthy tail chase. If the golden eagle is able to intercept a rabbit or hare far out in the open, a twisting and turning tail chase frequently occurs but the odds of survival for the prey are smaller the farther they are from coverage. On occasion, breeding pairs have been observed hunting jackrabbits together, where one will stoop on a gathering of them while the other waits out of sight and assaults one of the jackrabbits being made to run.|$|E
