50|$|Magnetically coupled pumps, or <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> pumps, {{vary from}} the {{traditional}} pumping style, as the motor is coupled to the pump by magnetic means rather than by a direct mechanical shaft. The pump works via a drive magnet, 'driving' the pump rotor, which is magnetically coupled to the primary shaft driven by the motor.7 They are often used where leakage of the fluid pumped poses a great risk (e.g., aggressive fluid in the chemical or nuclear industry, or electric shock - garden fountains). They have no direct connection between the motor shaft and the impeller, so no gland is needed. There is no risk of leakage, unless the casing is broken. Since the pump shaft is not supported by bearings outside the pump's housing, support inside the pump is provided by bushings. The pump size of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> pumps can go from few Watts power to a giant 1MW.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> pump {{has gotten}} great {{achievement}} {{and has been}} widely used in some special fields. Currently, the researches on <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> pump have focused on hydraulic design, bearing, axial force in China, and a new <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> pump with low flow and high head have been developed overseas. However, low efficiency and large size are the common disadvantages for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> pump. In order to study the performance of high-speed <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> pump, FLUENT is used to simulate the inner flow field of <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> pumps with different rotate speeds, and get velocity and pressure distributions of inner flow field. According to analysis the changes of velocity and pressure to ensure the stable operation of pump and avoid cavitation.

40|$|Recent {{high-resolution}} {{calculations of}} neutron star coalescences {{are used to}} investigate whether nu bar{nu} annihilation can provide sufficient energy to power gamma-ray bursts, especially those belonging to the short duration category. Late time slices of the simulations, where the neutrino emission has reached a maximum, stationary level are analyzed to address this question. We find that nu bar{nu} annihilation can provide the necessary driving stresses that lead to relativistic jet expansion. Maximum Lorentz factors {{of the order of}} 15 are found along the binary rotation axis, but larger values are expected to arise from higher numerical resolution. Yet the accompanying neutrino-driven wind must be absent from the axis when the burst occurs or prohibitive baryon loading may occur. We argue that even under the most favorable conditions, nu bar{nu} annihilation is unlikely to power a burst in excess of ~ 10 ^{ 48 } erg. Unless the emission is beamed into {{less than one percent of}} the solid angle, which we argue is improbable if it is collimated by gas pressure, this may fail to satisfy the apparent isotropic energies inferred at cosmological distances. This mechanism may nonetheless drive a precursor fireball, thereby evacuating a cavity into which a later <b>magnetic</b> <b>driven</b> jet could expand. A large range of time delays between the merger and the black hole formation are to be expected. If the <b>magnetic</b> <b>driven</b> jet occurs after the black hole has formed, a time span as long as weeks could pass between the neutrino powered precursor and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>driven</b> GRB.
