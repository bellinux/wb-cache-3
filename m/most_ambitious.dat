5|$|In {{the same}} neighbourhood, a huge concert hall, Musikkens Hus, {{designed}} by Coop Himmelb(l)au, opened in 2014. It is Aalborg's <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> construction project in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{exercises}} {{were held}} concurrently {{in the northern}} autumn of 1957. Operation Counter Punch, Operation Strikeback, and Operation Deep Water were the <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> military undertaking for the alliance to date, involving more than 250,000 men, 300 ships, and 1,500 aircraft operating from Norway to Turkey.|$|E
5|$|He {{was one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> and {{promising}} of the young princes of the Kamehameha realm. It is believed by old Hawaiians today that had he lived he would have become a real and constructive leader of the Hawaiian people. He had a splendid physique and a magnetic personality. The glance of his eyes made him friends everywhere.|$|E
50|$|The Last Month of the Year is {{considered}} their <b>most</b> musically <b>ambitious</b> and {{also one of}} the Trio's least known. It was recorded in 1960 between shows at The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} was listed at #38 on Rolling Stone's {{list of the}} top 50 albums of 2012, saying [...] "These Jersey boys might be America's <b>most</b> desperately <b>ambitious,</b> righteously exciting punk-rock flamethrowers." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} {{some of the}} <b>most</b> {{technically}} <b>ambitious</b> MS-DOS computer games such as Doom, Descent, Duke Nukem 3D, and Rise of the Triad were built using Watcom C/C++, some such as ROTT using the DOS/4GW protected mode extender with the Watcom compiler.|$|R
5|$|The Inner Ring Road was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of the 1960s. This was the <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> scheme of its kind in the UK with Leeds City Council subsequently promoting the city with the slogan Motorway City of the Seventies. The works involved the construction of many flyovers and tunnels and the Motorway construction is notable in itself.|$|E
5|$|This is {{yet another}} example of a devoted fanbase and a policy of {{openness}} combining to fill in blanks left by old media barriers. The entire NIN camp is absolutely thrilled that treating our fans with respect and nurturing their creativity has led to such an overwhelming outpour of incredible content, and that we now have such a high quality souvenir from our <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> tour ever.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, The New York Times called Babbitt [...] "Indisputably {{one of our}} <b>most</b> {{gifted and}} <b>ambitious</b> writers for children".|$|R
5000|$|Hubert Mounier's {{lyrics are}} often witty, {{containing}} {{a large amount}} of wordplay and puns. His <b>most</b> lyrically <b>ambitious</b> project was L'Affaire Louis' Trio's fourth album, Mobilis in mobile (1993) a concept album based on the character of Captain Nemo, from Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea ...|$|R
5000|$|The band {{made its}} Boston area debut in May 1989. Later that same year, Tristan Park {{released}} its first cassette, The Space Between, to positive critical response. In October 1989, the Nashua Telegraph hailed the band as [...] "the Nashua area’s <b>most</b> literate, <b>ambitious,</b> and talented rock band." ...|$|R
5|$|As of 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon {{continued}} the reform agenda covering oversight, integrity, and ethics which {{had previously been}} launched in response to investigation of the UN Oil-for-Food Programme. The Programme responded to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi civilians and was the largest, most complex and <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> relief effort {{in the history of}} the United Nations. With reference to the 2005 World Summit, the General Assembly approved in April 2007 a number of loosely related reform initiatives, covering international environmental governance, a unified gender organization, and ‘Delivering as One’ at the country level to enhance the consolidation of UN programme activities.|$|E
5|$|Considered {{to be one}} of {{the biggest}} and <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> film {{projects}} ever undertaken, with an overall budget of $281 million (some sources say $310-$330 million), the entire project took eight years, with the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in New Zealand, Jackson's native country. Each film in the series also had special extended editions released on DVD a year after their respective theatrical releases. While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and deviations from the source material.|$|E
5|$|From its {{establishment}} in 1967 to its abolition in 1992, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation created {{by far the}} largest and <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> of the British new towns: indeed its objective was to build a new city of 250,000 people. Many of Britain's most acclaimed building and landscape architects contributed to what was to be a show-piece of British design. Unlike previous new towns, Milton Keynes has a preponderance of privately funded development but these developments were subject to an exacting design brief in line with the design principles laid out in The Plan for Milton Keynes.|$|E
60|$|His Majesty the King, Pompadour, the Duc d'Aumont, Prime Minister of France, and he himself, Gaston de Stainville, the <b>most</b> ruthlessly <b>ambitious</b> {{man in the}} kingdom, all fooled, stupidly fooled and tricked by that man, who was {{too great}} a coward to meet the rival whom he had insulted.|$|R
50|$|Substatic is {{the fourth}} solo album by New Zealand {{composer}} Peter Jefferies, released on September 29, 1998 through Emperor Jones. One of his <b>most</b> musically <b>ambitious</b> and emotionally complex efforts, it marks Jefferies' return to the completely instrumental format he had previously explored on his 1987 album At Swim 2 Birds.|$|R
5000|$|Beckford {{brought to}} Jamaica the artist George Robertson, who {{produced}} what {{have been described}} as [...] "the <b>most</b> aesthetically <b>ambitious</b> views of Jamaica published in the eighteenth century." [...] Beckford's slavery-derived fortune also enabled him to host [...] "the most sumptuous banquets since Henry VIII" [...] and hire Mozart as his son's piano teacher.|$|R
5|$|In {{development}} since 1999, {{the project}} was repeatedly delayed, going through several revisions and having some of its <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> and immersive features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation 2 version cancelled. Although well received by most critics and regarded by some {{as one of the}} best horror video games of all time, Dark Corners of the Earth was a commercial failure. At least two additional Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions, including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End, but both were never completed due to Headfirst's bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for Gauguin's visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on {{advice from the}} station's postal supervisor Joseph Roulin, whose portrait he painted. On 17 September he spent his first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House. When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him, Van Gogh started {{to work on the}} Décoration for the Yellow House, probably the <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> effort he ever undertook. He completed two chair paintings: Van Gogh's Chair and Gauguin's Chair.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{continued}} to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with William Gear (1916–97) and Stephen Gilbert (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde COBRA group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution. Also a visitor to Paris was Alan Davie (b. 1920-2014), who was influenced by jazz and Zen Buddhism, and moved further into abstract expressionism. Ian Hamilton Finlay's (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially concrete poetry) and landscape architecture. His <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> work, the garden of Little Sparta opened in 1960.|$|E
5000|$|Recorded between late 2003 {{and spring}} 2004, the album [...] "Cottonhead" [...] was {{released}} {{at the end}} of October 2004 on a new label, Vertical Form. With strings, additional percussion and, on one track, the voice of reclusive 1960s folk singer Anne Briggs, Cottonhead was SRW’s <b>most</b> artistically <b>ambitious</b> and sophisticated record to date.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{wrote that}} [...] "What could have {{amounted}} {{to little more}} than a giant mess is in fact Goldenthal's <b>most</b> sophisticated and <b>ambitious</b> score to date..." ...|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic {{gave the}} album a mixed review, claiming: [...] "John Mellencamp responded to his massive {{heart attack and}} close-call with death with 'Mr. Happy Go Lucky,' the <b>most</b> overtly <b>ambitious</b> album in his career." [...] Entertainment Weekly also gave a mixed review, proclaiming: [...] "Mr. Happy Go Lucky is, disappointingly, not the groundbreaker it promised to be." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{success of}} The Quatermass Experiment led to two sequels, Quatermass II (1955) and Quatermass and the Pit (1958–59), both {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Cartier and written by Kneale. Both were successful and critically acclaimed, and Cartier's production work on them became increasingly ambitious. For Quatermass II, he pre-filmed {{a significant amount of}} material on location, using 35mm film, opening the drama out from a confined studio setting with the <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> location shooting yet attempted in British television. Cartier, with his previous experience as a film director, particularly enjoyed working on these cinema-style filmed scenes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> and {{expensive}} projects {{in the history of}} maritime archaeology, the Mary Rose project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming one of the first wrecks to be protected under the new Protection of Wrecks Act in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It {{was the first time that}} a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the Mary Rose was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the Mary Rose wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land.|$|E
5000|$|The Book of Dreams (1981). Howard Alan Treesong, a 'chaoticist', who embodies {{elements}} {{of all the}} foregoing, and has the <b>most</b> imaginatively <b>ambitious</b> plans of all. He attempts {{to take over the}} three major organisations of the Oikumene - the IPCC (law enforcement), the Jarnell Corporation (space ship technology), and the Institute (political and social power).|$|R

2500|$|According to Siegfried Hecker, {{a former}} {{director}} (1986–1997) of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States, [...] "India has the <b>most</b> technically <b>ambitious</b> and innovative nuclear energy programme in the world. The extent and functionality of its nuclear experimental facilities are matched only by those in Russia and are far ahead of what is left in the US." ...|$|R
5|$|Cloud Gate is {{described}} as a transformative, iconic work. It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless. Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor's <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> use of complex mirrored form dynamics. Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, Cloud Gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension. The sculpture {{is described}} as a disembodied, luminous form, which is also how his earlier 1000 Names (197980) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.|$|E
5|$|David Scott's (1806–49) <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> {{historical}} {{work was}} the triptych Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and J. P. Nichol's Architecture of the Heavens (1850). Because of this early death {{he was known}} to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood mainly through his brother William Bell Scott (1811–90), who became {{a close friend of}} founding member D. G. Rossetti. The London-based Pre-Raphaelites rejected the formalism of Mannerist painting after Raphael. Bell Scott was patronised by the Pre-Raphaelite collector James Leathart. His most famous work, Iron and Coal {{was one of the most}} popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{beyond the}} manned lunar landings, NASA {{investigated}} several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X,) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using {{the space in}} the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop {{to be built in}} orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the Apollo Telescope Mount, which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack. The <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus fly-by mission.|$|E
2500|$|Novelist David Foster Wallace, {{three years}} after the film's release, wrote that the film's [...] "transformation of Laura from object/occasion to subject/person was {{actually}} the <b>most</b> morally <b>ambitious</b> thing a Lynch movie has ever tried to do...and it required complex and contradictory and probably impossible things from Ms. Lee, who in my opinion deserved an Oscar just for showing up and trying." ...|$|R
5000|$|World Energy - The {{purpose of}} this recent project is to provide the public and {{industry}} experts with details of the <b>most</b> important and <b>ambitious</b> projects in the global energy sector.|$|R
