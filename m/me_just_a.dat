500|$|Minogue's third album, Rhythm of Love was {{released}} in November 1990 and was described as [...] "leaps and bounds more mature" [...] than her previous albums. Her relationship with Michael Hutchence was also {{seen as part of}} her departure from her earlier persona. She then embarked on the Rhythm of Love Tour in February 1991. Minogue's fourth album, Let's Get to It {{was released}} in October 1991 and reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. It was her first album to fail to reach the top ten. While the first single from the album, [...] "Word Is Out", became her first single to miss the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, subsequent singles [...] "If You Were with Me Now" [...] and [...] "Give <b>Me</b> <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> Little More Time" [...] both reached the top five. In support of the album, she embarked on the Let's Get to It Tour in October. She later expressed her opinion that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, saying, [...] "I was very much a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right." [...] Her first Greatest Hits album {{was released in}} August 1992. It reached number one in the United Kingdom and number three in Australia. The singles from the album, [...] "What Kind of Fool" [...] and her cover version of Kool & the Gang's [...] "Celebration" [...] both reached the top twenty of the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|In February 1968, Starr {{became the}} first Beatle to sing on another artist's show without the other three present. He sang the Buck Owens hit [...] "Act Naturally", and {{performed}} a duet with Cilla Black, [...] "Do You Like <b>Me</b> <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> Little Bit?" [...] on her BBC One television programme, Cilla. Later that year Apple Records released The Beatles, {{commonly known as the}} [...] "White Album". Creative inspiration for the double LP came in part from the band's recent interactions with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. While attending an intermediate course at his ashram in Rishikesh, India, they enjoyed one of their most prolific writing periods, composing most of the album's songs there. Starr left after 10 days, but completed his first recorded Beatles song, [...] "Don't Pass Me By". During the recording of the White Album, relations within the band became openly divisive. As the sessions progressed, their collective group dynamic began to decay; at times only one or two Beatles were involved in the recording for a track. Starr had grown weary of McCartney's increasingly overbearing approach and Lennon's passive-aggressive behaviour, which was exacerbated by Starr's resentment of Yoko Ono near-constant presence. After one particularly difficult session during which McCartney had harshly criticised his drumming, Starr quit the band for two weeks, taking a holiday with his family in Sardinia on a boat loaned by Peter Sellers. During a lunch break the chef served octopus, which Starr refused to eat. A subsequent conversation with the ship's captain regarding the behaviours of the animal served as the inspiration for his Abbey Road composition, [...] "Octopus's Garden", which Starr wrote on guitar during the trip. He returned to the studio two weeks later, to find that Harrison had covered his drum kit in flowers as a welcome-back gesture.|$|E
2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany <b>me.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E
