The {{common type}} of floater, which is present in most persons' eyes, is due to degenerative changes of the vitreous humour. The perception of floaters is known as <b>myodesopsia,</b> or less commonly as myodaeopsia, myiodeopsia, or myiodesopsia. They are also called Muscae volitantes (Latin: [...] "flying flies"), or mouches volantes (from the French). Floaters are visible because of the shadows they cast on the retina or refraction of the light that passes through them, and can appear alone or together with several others in one's visual field. They may appear as spots, threads, or fragments of cobwebs, which float slowly before the observer's eyes.

30|$|Symptoms of CAR often {{begin with}} photophobia, photosensitivity, and <b>myodesopsia.</b> The initial {{symptoms}} {{in the present}} case were central scotoma, photopsia, and photophobia of the left eye, with similar symptoms appearing in the right eye after 1  week; we subsequently observed exacerbation of the visual disorder weekly. Bleeding and vasculitis were not noted on fundoscopy, which revealed only lightly clouded spots scattered in the retina. Previous reports cited three cases involving both eyes, however, the occurrence and progression of which were not necessarily simultaneous and were heterogenous.|$|E
40|$|A 52 -year-old Japanese woman {{presented}} with optical symptoms, including left-sided <b>myodesopsia,</b> blurred vision, narrowed visual field, and diminished visual acuity. Ocular evaluation revealed a metastatic tumor in the choroid. Further examinations identified pulmonary adenocarcinoma {{as the primary}} tumor. Because an epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutation was detected in a biopsy specimen, gefitinib treatment was initiated. Dramatic responses were obtained in the primary tumor and metastatic foci. Optical symptoms improved and remained stable for 5 months during the treatment, until relapse. This report demonstrates that gefitinib is effective for choroidal metastasis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR mutation...|$|E
40|$|A case of von Hippel-Lindau disease {{associated}} with bilateral {{renal cell carcinoma}} is presented. A 27 -year-old female noticed <b>myodesopsia</b> and underwent laser coagulation of right retinal hemangioma in 1973. In addition, cerebellar hemangioblastomas were removed in 1977, 1978, 1983 and 1987. The patient was referred {{to the department of}} urology for further examination of bilateral renal masses which were incidentally found on abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance-CT. Fine needle biopsy performed and microscopic examination revealed the presence of clear cell type renal cell carcinoma (grade 1). Renal arteriography demonstrated multiple neovascularity in the bilateral masses. Complete tumor excision was impossible to retain the minimum of renal function, the patient was conservatively subjected to a follow-up study...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{present the}} case of an {{idiopathic}} epiretinal membrane (ERM) secondary to an acute self-repaired macular microhole documented by optical coherence tomography (OCT). A 65 -year-old phakic woman presenting with acute onset of light flashes, <b>myodesopsia,</b> and central negative scotoma in the right eye was diagnosed with age-related posterior vitreous detachment. Spectral-domain OCT showed a tiny defect of the outer retina, consistent with the diagnosis of macular microhole, which spontaneously closed after 4 weeks. Six months later, the patient developed a contracting ERM, and her visual acuity significantly worsened. This case represents the first in vivo documentation of retinal pigment epithelium cell migration through a macular microhole, highlighting the importance of OCT in understanding idiopathic ERM pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Choroidal {{metastasis}} from {{colorectal cancer}} is rare, {{and there have}} been no reported cases of such metastasis from early colorectal cancer. We report a case of choroidal metastasis from early rectal cancer. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 61 year-old-man experienced <b>myodesopsia</b> in the left eye 2 years and 6 months after primary rectal surgery for early cancer, and was diagnosed with left choroidal metastasis and multiple lung metastases. Radiotherapy was initiated for the left eye and systemic chemotherapy is initiated for the multiple lung metastases. The patient is living 2 years and 3 months after the diagnosis of choroidal metastasis without signs of recurrence in the left eye, and continues to receive systemic chemotherapy for multiple lung metastases. DISCUSSION: Current literatures have few recommendations regarding the appropriate treatment of choroidal metastasis from colorectal cancer, but an aggressive multi-disciplinary approach may be effective in local regression. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of choroidal metastasis from early rectal cancer. We consider it important to enforce systemic chemotherapy in addition to radiotherapy for choroidal metastasis from colorectal cancer...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of prepapillary {{vascular}} loops complicated by a suspected macroaneurysm rupture which was treated with intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB). A 62 -year-old woman presented with decreased vision and <b>myodesopsia</b> in her left eye. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0. 6 in the left eye. Fundus examination disclosed an elevated, round, and reddish lesion, retinal hemorrhage at the superior aspect of the optic disc, retinal opacification along the superior branch retinal artery, and a small vitreous hemorrhage. Optical coherence tomography showed a serous retinal detachment, and indocyanine green angiography demonstrated prepapillary vascular loops and a hypofluorescent area with hyperfluorescent margins. These findings suggested {{the presence of a}} macroaneurysm. No filling of the dye in the aneurysm-like dilatation suggested a blockage of the lumen with a thrombus which might be associated with a branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO). A diagnosis of prepapillary vascular loops complicated by a suspected macroaneurysm rupture and BRAO was made. Because of a persistent serous retinal detachment, IVB was performed. One month later, the BCVA improved to 1. 0. Fundus examination disclosed an organized yellowish-white macroaneurysm and resolution of the serous retinal detachment. We recommend careful monitoring of patients with prepapillary vascular loops because of complications such as macroaneurysm rupture and BRAO...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A pathergy {{reaction}} {{is defined as}} a hyperreactivity of the skin in response to minimal trauma, which is important in the diagnosis of Beh 7 et 2 ̆ 019 s disease (BD). However, a pathergy reaction may not be restricted to the skin, and little is known about whether an invasive medical procedure can induce the reaction. Here we present a pathergy reaction induced by renal biopsy, an invasive procedure. Case presentation A 46 -year-old man who was diagnosed with IgA vasculitis (IgAV) at the age of 38 was treated with prednisolone and mizoribine. However, complications such as common carotid arteritis or recurrent oral ulcer suggested the possibility of another pathophysiology. Later, increasing urine protein developed, suggesting disease aggravation. However, renal biopsy showed arteriosclerotic changes caused mainly by hypertension, negating exacerbation. After renal biopsy, his renal dysfunction and body temperature fluctuated, and detailed examinations revealed recurrent oral and genital ulcers and a folliculitis-like rash on his scrotum. Later, he complained of <b>myodesopsia</b> caused by hemorrhage in the ocular fundus due to occlusive vasculitis. Complete BD was diagnosed after development of the symptoms, and he was treated with prednisolone and colchicine. Conclusion Co-occurrence of BD with IgAV is very rare and may be associated with immune disorders. Interestingly, a renal biopsy revealed BD, which was masked by the presence of IgAV, and elucidated the etiology of the unexplainable symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of renal pathergy. This case enlightens clinicians to the fact that not only a needle stimulation but also an invasive procedure can cause a pathergy reaction...|$|E
