Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as <b>misplaced</b> as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E

O'Reilly lamented the decline of spin during his twilight years, and in the 1980s he was often derided by younger people who felt that his advocacy of spin bowling—which they deemed to be obsolete—was <b>misplaced.</b> He died just months before Shane Warne revived the art of leg spin on the international stage.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of {{his handling of the}} defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was <b>misplaced</b> and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E

5|$|At the interval, Liverpool defender Mark Wright was {{replaced}} by Steve Harkness. Nine minutes into the second-half, Liverpool scored their goal; Jason McAteer played the ball towards McManaman, running at the Newcastle defence in their penalty box and picking out a pass to Fowler, who scored his second goal of the match. Liverpool's advantage only lasted for two minutes; Asprilla, put through by Robert Lee, scored with the outside of his right boot. Newcastle began to dominate territorially and missed a chance to increase their lead shortly after Asprilla's goal: Ginola's <b>misplaced</b> final ball failed to reach an incoming Ferdinand. Liverpool continued to press forward and in the 65th minute levelled the score again; McAteer's curling cross confused the Newcastle defence and reached Collymore, who took a shot past goalkeeper Pavel Srníček.|$|E
5|$|Dunne {{had hoped}} that by moving to New York to write full-time, {{he would be able}} to greatly expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, {{including}} a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and for a series of third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a <b>misplaced</b> Dooley, deprived of his bar and control of the dialogue. Dunne was not happy with them either: a note from the author appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.|$|E

5|$|Historian David Detzer {{has argued}} that the fame that {{surrounds}} the 11th New York is <b>misplaced.</b> During its time in service, the 11th New York Regiment saw little fighting compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th New York, 20th Maine, and 28th Massachusetts. The 11th New York was often overshadowed by the 73rd New York, also known as the Second Fire Zouaves, which fought at Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. In addition, Ellsworth failed to consider that the New York City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at blazes. The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist and would not be created when they joined the regiment. In that respect, 11th New York was no different than many regiments, North and South.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had <b>misplaced</b> it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E

40|$|Development of Farmpacker is for {{accelerating}} {{the popularity of}} washed and graded egg. In addition to evaluating the performance test of imported machine, applying and manufacturing conditions are considered for domestic constraints. The operational models are completed according to the current conditions of egg industry in this study. Breakage is 4 % for the imported machine with the capacity of 20, 000 eggs/h. The drawbacks are high supplying speed, high breakage of distributing and putting system, and the damage of flat by the flat supply mechanism. Development of Farmpacker can establish domestic techniques, provide farmer convenient maintenance, and reduce the investment from NT$ 200, 000 to 500, 000 dollars per machine. Performance evaluations are conducted according {{to the results of}} previous test then decide the control policy and modified materials. The developed machine can be normally operated with capacity from 7, 200 to 19, 440 eggs/h. Average breakage is 0. 1 % and <b>misplacing</b> rate is 2. 3 % for the egg at high peak. Average breakage is 4. 6 % and <b>misplacing</b> rate is 0. 8 % for the egg after force molting. Average breakage is 4. 3 % and <b>misplacing</b> rate is 1. 3 % for durable test. Experimental results show that shape coefficients are significantly different between normal eggs and <b>misplacing</b> eggs, either at high peak or after force molting. Furthermore, symmetric coefficients can detect the different among normal eggs, <b>misplacing</b> eggs at high peak, and <b>misplacing</b> eggs after force molting. The developed machine can complete the treatment of eggs for a farm with 100, 000 layers in 5 hours every day. 為加速推行洗選蛋之作業，本研究進行排蛋機(Farmpacker) 之開發，除進 口之排蛋機之性能測試外，並進行考量國內之使用與製造條件而研發排蛋 機，最後根據蛋雞產業之現況進行作業模式之規劃。進口排蛋機作業在作 業量為 20, 000 個/h 時，其破損率低於 4 %，但有進蛋速度過高，分配與排 放系統之夾破蛋率過高，抓盤機構易損傷蛋盤等缺點。排蛋機之開發除可 建立本土化技術外，亦可提供農民快速且便利的維修服務，並可降低農民 購置設備的成本 20 ~ 50 萬/台。根據先期測試與檢討後而進行排蛋機之開發 ，制定控制策略與修正材料的使用而進行性能測試。機械的作業量 由 7, 200 ~ 19, 440 個/h 均能正常運轉。使用產蛋高峰期之雞蛋進行測試， 其破損率平均值為 0. 1 %，而反置率為 2. 3 %；使用經強制換羽後隻母雞所 產之雞蛋進行測試，其破損率平均值為 4. 6 %，而反置率則為 0. 8 %；而耐 久試驗的結果顯示其破損率平均值為 4. 3 %，而反置率則為 1. 3 %。本實驗 亦進行蛋形係數及對稱係數與反置蛋的關係之探討，研究結果顯示，不論 是產蛋高峰或是換羽後的反置蛋均與正常蛋的蛋形係數有顯著的差異，但 前兩者則無明顯差異。對稱係數可檢測出三者之間的差異，更能有效反映 出反置蛋的特性，經過強制換羽的雞所產的雞蛋對稱係數較高。依據機器 的作業速度及飼養規模，本排蛋機可在 5 小時內處理完飼養規模為 100, 000 隻雞的蛋雞場每日之雞蛋產量...|$|R

5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards {{made it difficult}} for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have <b>misplaced</b> the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, there was once again intense media {{speculation}} about the Spaniard's future, and in June 2010, a €35million bid from Barcelona was rejected. The 2010–11 season {{turned out to be an}} extremely competitive one in the Premier League; even though Arsenal had lost five games before mid-season, they were jostling for pole position with Manchester United and Manchester City. Going into late February, Arsenal were still in contention for the quadruple, but within a span of two weeks they lost in the League Cup final, were eliminated by Barcelona in the Round of 16 of the Champions League, and defeated in the FA Cup quarter-final. Although Fàbregas did not play in the League Cup Final, it was his <b>misplaced</b> backheel pass during the second leg of the Champions League game against Barcelona that allowed them to level the aggregate score. Arsenal remained in contention for the league title until a series of draws in the final third of the season caused them to fall too far behind league leaders Manchester United; they ended the season fourth. The following season was once again marked by uncertainty. Barcelona made several bids for Fàbregas, while Nasri, Arsenal's star performer the previous campaign, was courted by Manchester City.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{continued}} to be hailed as a relevant writer during the ten years following his death, and his wors went through new critical editions. Pajere was published in spring 1936, having been edited by Marica Caragiale-Sion and Alexandru Rosetti. Later in the year, a volume of collected works, Opere, was published by Rosetti and featured prints made by Mateiu Caragiale at various moments during his lifetime. Large portions of the diaries kept by Mateiu Caragiale are lost. The transcript made by Perpessicius was criticized for having selectively discarded much content, while originals kept by Rosetti were mysteriously lost during the Legionnaires' Rebellion of 1941. Additional notes, which notably featured Caragiale's criticism of his father, were preserved for a while by Șerban Cioculescu, before being borrowed to Ecaterina Logadi, Ion Luca's daughter, and never recovered. A significant number of his drawings and paintings, which Vianu assumed had survived by 1936, have also been <b>misplaced.</b>|$|E
