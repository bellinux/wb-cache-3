40|$|The 'Translating Music' {{network will}} bring academics, music and {{translation}} practitioners, and industry professionals together in exploring how musical texts are translated (or not) today. Fostering collaboration and debates across geographical borders, professions and musical genres will ensure {{new developments in}} an area {{which has not been}} given prominence and which yields opportunities for development. Through collaborative meetings, training workshops, seminars, a symposium and public performances, this research network will seek: -To create an interdisciplinary forum for the discussion and exchange of ideas on the latest developments regarding the translation and adaptation of contemporary musical texts for a range of media (films, videogames, television, live performances). The network will foster new thinking and dialogue between professionals working in musical genres as different as opera, pop songs, world music or rock. - To take stock of the current provision of translation in the music industry, map existing practices in the main areas of music provision (music on television, music in videogames, opera and classical music live or in digital formats) and create opportunities in area of translation. This will allow the mapping of areas in which translation is not provided and will foster collaboration between different professionals in different sectors of the musical industry. Since translation and accessibility are most strongly offered in opera, we shall ask professionals in this area to play a leading role in sharing their knowledge and discuss possible applications to other genres. - To facilitate knowledge exchange between academics, professionals in the music industry and members of the third sector in order to a) develop the translation of musical texts across different platforms, b) expand the provision of accessibility in music, and c) set standards in musical adaptation and translation across musical genres. - To set up an advisory group in order to a) develop a successful provision of training opportunities for academics, translators, postgraduate translation and music students in translation and accessibility in music b) to discuss how new technologies can best support the translation of musical texts, and c) to engage in a constructive and informative exchange between policy makers, the music industry, academics and the third sector, so that opportunities in terms of entrepreneurship in music mediation and needs in terms of public needs for access and translation are discussed. - To foster musical performances which promote accessibility and translation, encouraging events in which they are given visibility and drawing on existing expertise, particularly in opera, which has pioneered and strongly developed music accessibility. This will require collaboration with the third sector, at the forefront of developments in Britain. This will boost Britain's role as a leader in accessibility provision, promote work in the music or media industry and encourage international knowledge exchange in accessibility practices. - To establish and nurture a long-lasting international network, using existing links in academia, the support of the EU institutions and the collaboration of <b>music</b> <b>translation</b> providers across geographical borders. As membership of the network develops, it will expand and will maximise participation beyond Europe. - To stimulate existing and forthcoming postgraduate students in translation in further developing research and involvement in the area of <b>music</b> <b>translation,</b> particularly through joint international doctoral studies, in the first instance with our Italian partners. - To discuss potential technology developments in facilitating the understanding of musical texts and the visibility of their multilingual and multicultural content and to set a plan of action collaborating with industry on the development of suitable software to facilitate translation in music...|$|E
