The Vertebrata as a subphylum comprises such a small proportion of the Metazoa that to speak of the kingdom Animalia in terms of [...] "Vertebrata" [...] and [...] "Invertebrata" [...] has limited practicality. In the more formal taxonomy of Animalia other attributes that logically should precede the presence or absence of the vertebral column in constructing a cladogram, for example, the presence of a notochord.

50|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which {{regulates the}} {{international}} wildlife trade, added the eight known species of pangolin to its appendices in 1975. CITES places species {{it seeks to}} protect in three appendices organized according to urgency and, correspondingly, the strictness of the regulations. Appendix I includes the strictest prohibitions and is reserved for animals threatened with extinction. In 1975, Smutsia temminckii was placed in Appendix I; Manis crassicaudata, Manis culionensis, Manis javanica, and Manis pentadactyla were placed in Appendix II; Smutsia gigantea, Phataginus tetradactyla, and Phataginus tricuspis were placed in Appendix III. In 1995, Smutsia and Phataginus were moved to Appendix II. Finally, in 2016, at the 17th CITES Conference of Parties in Johannesburg, representatives of 182 countries unanimously enacted {{a ban on the}} international trade of all pangolin species by moving them to Appendix I. Though the individual species are listed in Appendix I, the family as a whole (<b>Manidae)</b> is under Appendix II, with the implication that if additional species are discovered, they will be automatically placed in Appendix II.|$|E

Thereby we implement the “Data Portal of German Marine Research” for coherent discovery, view, download and dissemination of aggregated content. <b>MaNIDA</b> receives a unique momentum from the cooperation and financial partnership between main German marine research institutes (AWI, MARUM, HZG, GEOMAR, Uni Hamburg, Uni Kiel, Uni Bremen) and the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency as well as active participation in international and major EU-initiatives (ICSU, GEOSS, SeaDataNet, EMODNET, ODIP). Together with a coherent management strategy coordinated by the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research, sustainability will be achieved via the long-term commitment of framework funding by the Helmholtz Association, Germany’s largest scientific research organization for large-scale facilities and scientific infrastructure. Strategic Aims The installation of the “Data Portal of German Marine Research” will address the urgent demands of the German research community for reliable and easy access to marine research data at one single point of access and truth. Primary focus {{will be given to}} data derived from nationally operated research and monitoring facilities (vessels, observatories, alert systems, etc), whereby related contextual content and publications will {{become an integral part of}} the aggregation effort. For the scientific community we define responsibilities and commitments across partners while complementing existing data repositories and the new portal with well-articulated workflows from the instrument to the data product. Necessary level of quality assurance and user support will be implemented to achieve substantial enhancements in the whole lifecycle management of marine scientific data. The creation of a data curation and customer support centre holds a significant role in that course as well as the intense exchange of ideas/wishes with stakeholders and scientists. Research & Development • In terms of integration, harmonization and aggregation – data from three national large-scale data repositories and national publication e-infrastructures will be aggregated into a central metadata catalogue. • Dynamic procedures for harmonization and integration of content are under development using common vocabulary, terms (ontology) according to international initiatives (SDN, GEOSS, ICSU). • Concerning automation we will improve the standardization of sensor networks (e. g., OGC/SWE standards) and revise and adapt a future version of DSHIP (ship information system), a de-facto standard for research vessels, to repository and portal solutions. • We are developing a series of content-specific discovery, view, download and dissemination services to enable coherent discovery and visualization (search/browse and mapping services) as well as provider based dissemination of content at European and International levels. Finally the “Data Portal of German Marine Research” will enhance data mining in various disciplines as well as improve planning of future expeditions. It will also provide means for combining various data types (e. g. underway data, post cruise data, satellite data, oceanographic and interdisciplinary marine data) into enhanced data products to comply with our data-intensive marine science...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rice farming {{activities}} involve prolonged {{manual work}} and human-machine interaction. Prolonged farming risk-exposure {{may result in}} lower limb malalignment. This malalignment may {{increase the risk of}} lower extremity injury and physical disabilities. However, the prevalence and factors associated with lower extremity malalignment have not yet been reported. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of lower extremity malalignment among rice farmers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 249 rice farmers. Lower extremity alignment assessment included: pelvic tilt angle, limb length equality, femoral torsion, quadriceps (Q) angle, tibiofemoral angle, genu recurvatum, rearfoot angle, and medial longitudinal arch angle. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze participant characteristics and prevalence of lower extremity malalignment. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of lower extremity malalignment was foot pronation (36. 14 %), followed by the abnormal Q angle (34. 94 %), tibiofemoral angle (31. 73 %), pelvic tilt angle (30. 52 %), femoral antetorsion (28. 11 %), limb length inequality (22. 49 %), tibial torsion (21. 29 %), and genu recurvatum (11. 24 %). In females, the risk factors were abnormal Q angle, tibiofemoral angle, and genu recurvatum. Being overweight was a risk factor for abnormal pelvic tilt angle, Q angle, and tibiofemoral angle. Age was a risk factor for limb length inequality. Years of farming were a major risk factor for abnormal Q angle, tibiofemoral angle, and foot malalignment. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of lower extremity malalignment was reported in this study. Female sex, being overweight, and years of farming were major risk factors for lower extremity malalignment. Lower extremity screening should assist in the identification of foot and knee malalignment in rice farmers. This may then lead to early prevention of musculoskeletal disorders arising from such malalignment. Usa Karukunchit, Rungthip Puntumetakul, <b>Manida</b> Swangnetr, Rose Boucau...|$|R

The institute built up a static website ([URL] that allows reviewing all the track lines of the research vessels where data is available. Although mandatory, some of the datasets never reached BSH. Upon request, the accessible data will be available for download via FTP from the BSH web-portal. For a more contemporary and sustainable approach in accessing bathymetric metadata and data of all German research vessels, we created a bathymetry showcase within the <b>MaNIDA</b> project (2011 / 2 - 2014; [URL] and the resulting “Data Portal German Marine Research” ([URL] A PostGIS database based on the ISO 19139 - 2 : 2012 standard was set up and a solitaire frontend-GUI developed, which allows ingestion of cruise metadata and the automatic acquisition of hydro-acoustic metadata on the entity level (per recorded raw data survey-line). In parallel, the dataset will be archived in PANGAEA ([URL] and metadata then completed with the link to the stored dataset. The Bathy-Meta-Database and its services run as a surplus-portal of PANGAEA.

40|$|Abstract Pangolins (Pholidota: <b>Manidae)</b> are {{frequently}} hunted {{as a source}} of bushmeat in Ghana. However, no information exists with regards to the level of trade of pangolins outside of major bushmeat market surveys in Ghana. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the level of trade among other stakeholders in the bushmeat commodity chain for pangolins in Ghana. Data were collected from 153 stakeholders using semi-structured interviews and direct observation between September 2013 and January 2014. A total of 341 pangolins were recorded to have been traded in this study period. The white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis) represented 82 % and the black-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tetradactyla) 18 % of the observed pangolins traded by the stakeholders. Chopbar operators accounted for the highest retailer sales to consumers. The number of pangolins traded was negatively correlated to the distance between settlements and protected forest regions. The levels of pangolin trade were previously underestimated in Ghana as the pangolin bushmeat commodity chain does not form the supply chain to the major bushmeat markets where most surveys were undertaken. The Wildlife Conservation Act of 1971 (LI 685) that prohibits the hunting of pangolins can be regarded as ineffective and not serving as a deterrent to poaching...|$|E
40|$|International {{trade in}} {{wildlife}} {{is a major}} threat to biodiversity conservation. CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, is the primary mechanism for maintaining sustainability in international wildlife trade. Although a comparatively well-designed legal instrument, CITES has been criticised because of its emphasis on regulatory measures and disregard for the economic reality of wildlife trade. Through means of a case study on the trade in pangolins (Pholidota: <b>Manidae)</b> in Asia, we evaluate the CITES approach to controlling trade and demonstrate significant areas to be addressed. These arise because CITES fails to accurately monitor supply, particularly where trade is illegal, it fails to consider the impact of trade controls in realistic terms, and it does little to consider the complex nature of demand or contend with changing market dynamics. To more effectively manage trade we argue that reforms are needed within CITES. Specifically, we highlight improved monitoring of supply (by accounting for illegal and legal trade) and of demand and prices for wildlife (through national wildlife consumption surveys). This information would generate a more holistic understanding of wildlife trade and, if integrated with the Convention’s existing trade database, would allow a more realistic evaluation of the performance of trade controls, and could inform decision-making and the implementation of interventions which go beyond regulation and address demand directly. In a world of rapid economic and social change understanding markets and addressing demand as well as supply is essential to conserving the world’s trade threatened species...|$|E

In order to provide users integrated access and retrieval of expedition or cruise metadata, data, services and publications as well as relationships among the various objects, we are developing (web) applications based on {{state of the art}} technologies: the Data Portal of German Marine Research. Since the German network of distributed content providers have distinct objectives and mandates for stor- ing digital objects (e. g. long-term data preservation, near real time data, publication repositories), we have to cope with heterogeneous metadata in terms of syntax and semantic, data types and formats as well as access solutions. We have defined a set of core metadata elements which are common to our content providers and therefore useful for discovery and building relationships among objects. Existing catalogues for various types of vocabularies are being used to assure the mapping to community-wide used terms. We distinguish between expedition metadata and continuously harvestable metadata objects from distinct data providers. • Existing expedition metadata from distinct sources is integrated and validated in order to create an expedition metadata catalogue which is used as authoritative source for expedition-related content. The web application allows browsing by e. g. research vessel and date, exploring expeditions and research gaps by tracklines and viewing expedition details (begin/end, ports, platforms, chief scientists, events, etc.). Also expedition-related objects from harvesting are dynamically associated with expedition information and presented to the user. Hence we will provide web services to detailed expedition information. • Other harvestable content is separated into four categories: archived data and data products, near real time data, publications and reports. Reports are a special case of publication, describing cruise planning, cruise reports or popular reports on expeditions and are orthogonal to e. g. peer-reviewed articles. Each object’s metadata contains at least: identifier(s) e. g. doi/hdl, title, author(s), date, expedition(s), platform(s) e. g. research vessel Polarstern. Furthermore project(s), parameter(s), device(s) and e. g. geographic coverage are of interest. An international gazetteer resolves geographic coverage to region names and annotates to object metadata. Information is homogenously presented to the user, independent of the underlying format, but adaptable to specific disciplines e. g. bathymetry. Also data access and dissemination information is available to the user as data download link or web services (e. g. WFS, WMS). Based on relationship metadata we are dynamically building graphs of objects to support the user in finding possible relevant associated objects. Technically metadata is based on ISO / OGC standards or provider specification. Metadata is harvested via OAI-PMH or OGC CSW and indexed with Apache Lucene. This enables powerful full-text search, geographic and temporal search as well as faceting.

50|$|At any rate, {{all five}} hostages {{were taken to}} England and three were given (without explanation) to Sir Ferdinando Gorges. Gorges was an {{investor}} in the Weymouth voyage and became the chief promoter of the scheme when Arundell withdrew from the project. In a book published in 1658, a decade after Gorges had died, and presumably written when Gorges was quite old, Gorges wrote of his delight in Weymouth's kidnapping, and named Squanto {{as one of the}} three given over to him.George Weymouth, having failed at finding a Northwest Passage, happened into a River on the Coast of America, called Pemmaquid, from whence he brought five of the Natives, three of whose names were <b>Manida,</b> Sellwarroes, and Tasquantum, whom I seized upon, they were all of one Nation, but of severall parts, and severall Families; This accident must be acknowledged the meanes under God of putting on foote, and giving life to all our Plantations …. Circumstantial evidence makes nearly impossible the claim that it was Squanto among the three taken by Gorges, and no modern historian entertains this as fact. But Gorges's involvement in the abductions {{is an important part of}} Squanto's story. The abductions were an intentional policy of the English entrepreneurs and lead directly to Squanto's own abduction (although unauthorized by the London entrepreneurs). But even before that the abduction of Natives became a regular feature of the English colonial enterprise. Gorges, chief among the entrepreneurs, wanted to impress on the Natives the superiority of the English technology and military might that would back colonists, and the colonial entrepreneurs wanted to learn as much as they could from their captives about the lands and peoples of the New World. And they displayed their victims prominently to attract financing and public support for their commercial project. It is difficult to understand how they did not see that the policy was destined to misfire by creating a hostility toward the English among the natives peoples of New England which would prove dangerous to those sent to man colonial outposts. It is more difficult to understand how they continued the policy after the experience with these first captives. Two of the captives, Manedo and Sassacomit, were sent back with Captain Henry Chollons in 1606, but the ship was intercepted by the Spanish. Manedo was lost, but Sassacomit, seriously injured, was lodged in a Spanish prison. In an odd foreshadowing of Squanto's own fate, Sassacomit was forced to escape his bondage in Spain and make his way to England before he could be returned to his home in what is now Maine. That may not be the only coincidence uniting the two. Two other of the kidnapped Abenaki were returned to Maine in connection with Gorges's plan to found a trading colony there. His idea was that the returned Abenaki would act as liaison between the English settlers and the local population. Instead of providing a safe entrée for the English escorting him, however, one of the two, Skidwarres, had to be forced to identify himself so that the Natives would stop the attack they made on the English. Skidwarres once home, did not persuade the Abenaki to trade with the English but instead warned them to be wary of them. The conduct of Skidwarres and fellow abductee Tahanedo, nurtured the mistrust that would eventually doom the Sagadahoc colony. This experience did not deter Gorges or other English entrepreneurs from continuing the practice of abducting local men to be transported to England. In fact it would be used in the Cape Cod area as well. But the practice of kidnapping was only part of the brutally imperious policy of the privately financed imperial enterprise which created the political and social landscape that the Mayflower settlers would have to navigate, and it would be Squanto who gave them the most important assistance in this endeavor.|$|R
40|$|International {{trade in}} {{wildlife}} {{is a major}} threat to biodiversity conservation. CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which entered into force in 1975, is the primary mechanism for maintaining sustainability in international wildlife trade. However, CITES boasts few conservation successes and its regulatory approach is proving ineffective in many cases. In this thesis I recommend reforms to international wildlife trade interventions both within and beyond CITES, which would enable the Convention to more effectively govern trade and lead to the improved conservation status of trade-threatened species. In chapter two, I review typical and atypical interventions in CITES and critically evaluate the effectiveness of the Convention. I argue that trade measures need to go beyond regulation and should be multi-faceted, reflecting the socio-economic, cultural and economic complexity of wildlife trade and I outline key areas of research to inform these interventions. In chapter three I focus on high-value wildlife and argue that a regulatory response to poaching for international trade is an inadequate long-term conservation strategy and interventions should involve incentivizing local communities to conserve wildlife, the re-examination of sustainable off-take mechanisms, including regulated trade, ranching, and wildlife farming, and demand management measures. In chapter four, I critically evaluate CITES from an economic perspective through a case study on the trade in pangolins (Pholidota: <b>Manidae)</b> in Asia. I assert that to more effectively manage trade CITES should seek to understand markets and the impact of trade controls and address demand for wildlife as well as supply. In chapter five, I investigate the influence of non-state actors on decisions to amend the CITES Appendices. I find that they are successful in influencing decision-making, but they also claim unwarranted campaign victories and seek to abuse CITES, and Parties should exercise caution when interpreting non-state actor policy advice. In chapter six I discuss the contribution this thesis makes to conservation science and implications for governing wildlife trade before drawing final conclusions...|$|E
