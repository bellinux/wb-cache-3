25|$|After 2002, ADMARC {{was under}} {{pressure}} to reduce its financial losses by reducing its trading operations. The World Bank disliked ADMARC being under political control and proposed that it should only keep its core agricultural marketing operations and only provide <b>marketing</b> <b>services</b> in those outlying {{areas of the country}} with limited private sector competition. It was also to give up excess warehouse space in and near towns to a new company, the Malawi Agricultural Warehousing and Trading Company (MAWTCO), which would then lease warehouse space to the private sector. These reforms were implemented from 2006 on, with World Bank support. The private sector lacked the capacity to provide competitive <b>marketing</b> <b>services.</b> It was unable to store enough of grain to meet food needs in the lean season, unwilling to buy maize from smallholders in remote rural areas and without the capacity to import sufficient maize during national shortfalls to maintain prices. As Malawian maize markets did not act competitively, direct state intervention was needed. ADMARC therefore remained as a residual buyer and seller, operating designated floor and ceiling prices. ADMARC’s role allowed some long-distance maize trading between surplus and deficit areas, and created some competition in areas which lacked competing buyers.|$|E

500|$|To {{compete with}} Nintendo, Sega was {{more open to}} new types of games than its rival, but still tightly {{controlled}} the approval process for third-party games and charged high prices for cartridge manufacturing. Technicians from American third-party video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) reverse engineered the Genesis in 1989, following nearly one year of negotiations with Sega in which EA requested a more liberal licensing agreement than was standard in the industry before releasing its games for the system. The clean room reverse engineering was led by Steve Hayes and Jim Nitchals, lasting several months before EA secretly began game development. EA founder Trip Hawkins confronted Nakayama with this information one day prior to the 1990 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), noting that EA {{had the ability to}} run its own licensing program if Sega refused to meet its demands. Sega relented, and the next day EA's upcoming Genesis games were showcased at CES. EA signed what Hawkins described as [...] "a very unusual and much more enlightened license agreement" [...] with Sega in June 1990: [...] "Among other things, we had the right to make as many titles as we wanted. We could approve our own titles... the royalty rates were a lot more reasonable. We also had more direct control over manufacturing." [...] After the deal was in place, EA chief creative officer Bing Gordon learned that [...] "we hadn't figured out all the workarounds" [...] and [...] "Sega still had the ability to lock us out," [...] noting [...] "It just would have been a public relations fiasco." [...] EA released its first two Genesis games, Populous and , within the month. The first Genesis version of EA's John Madden Football arrived before the end of 1990, and became what Gordon called a [...] "killer app" [...] for the system. Taking advantage of the licensing agreement, Gordon and EA's vice president of <b>marketing</b> <b>services</b> Nancy Fong created a visual identifier for EA's Genesis cartridges: A yellow stripe on their left side added during manufacturing.|$|E
