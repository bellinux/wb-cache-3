Recently we determined the activation mechanism of a Toll signaling pathway biochemically using a large beetle, Tenebrio molitor. However, DAP-type peptidoglycan recognition mechanism and its signaling pathway are still unclear in the fly and beetle. Here, we show that polymeric DAP-type peptidoglycan, but not its monomeric form, formed a complex with Tenebrio peptidoglycan recognition protein-SA, and this complex activated the three-step proteolytic cascade to produce processed Spätzle, a Toll receptor ligand, and induced Drosophila defensin-like antimicrobial peptide in Tenebrio larvae similarly to polymeric lysine-type peptidoglycan. Monomeric DAP-type peptidoglycan induced Drosophila diptericin-like antimicrobial peptide in Tenebrio hemocytes. In addition, both polymeric and monomeric DAP-type peptidoglycans induced expression of Tenebrio peptidoglycan recognition protein-SC 2, which is DAP-type peptidoglycan-selective N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase that functions as a DAP-type peptidoglycan scavenger, appearing to function as a negative regulator of the DAP-type peptidoglycan signaling by cleaving DAP-type peptidoglycan in Tenebrio larvae.

Large variations in mating systems exist in fungi, allowing the study of their origin and consequences. In fungi, sexual incompatibility is determined by <b>molecular</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> controlled by a single mating-type locus in most unifactorial fungi. In Basidiomycete fungi, however, which include rusts, smuts and mushrooms, a system has evolved in which incompatibility is controlled by two unlinked loci. This bifactorial system probably evolved from a unifactorial system. Multiple independent transitions back to a unifactorial system occurred. It is still unclear what force drove evolution and maintenance of these contrasting inheritance patterns that determine mating compatibility. Here, we give {{an overview of the}} evolutionary factors that might have driven the evolution of bifactoriality from a unifactorial system and the transitions back to unifactoriality. Bifactoriality most likely evolved for selfing avoidance. Subsequently, multiallelism at mating-type loci evolved through negative frequency-dependent selection by increasing the chance to find a compatible mate. Unifactoriality then evolved back in some species, possibly because either selfing was favoured or for increasing the chance to find a compatible mate in species with few alleles. Owing to the existence of closely related unifactorial and bifactorial species and the increasing knowledge of the genetic systems of the different mechanisms, Basidiomycetes provide an excellent model for studying the different forces that shape breeding systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{entry of}} HIV- 1 into a target cell {{requires}} gp 120 and receptor CD 4 {{as well as}} coreceptor CCR 5 /CXCR 4 recognition events associated with conformational changes of the involved proteins. The binding of CD 4 to gp 120 is the initiation step of the whole process involving structural rearrangements that are crucial for subsequent pathways. Despite the wealth {{of knowledge about the}} gp 120 /CD 4 interactions, details of the conformational changes occurring at this stage remain elusive. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent based on the gp 120 /CD 4 /CD 4 i crystal structure in conjunction with modeled V 3 and V 4 loops to gain insight into the dynamics of the binding process. Three differentiated interaction modes between CD 4 and gp 120 were found, which involve electrostatics, hydrogen bond and van der Waals networks. A binding funnel model is proposed based on the dynamical nature of the binding interface together with a CD 4 -attraction gradient centered in gp 120 at the CD 4 -Phe 43 -binding cavity. Distinct dynamical behaviors of free and CD 4 -bound gp 120 were monitored, which likely represent the ground and pre-fusogenic states, respectively. The transition between these states revealed concerted motions in gp 120 leading to: i) loop contractions around the CD 4 -Phe 43 -insertion cavity; ii) stabilization of the four-stranded bridging sheet structure; and iii) translocation and clustering of the V 3 loop and the bridging sheet leading to the formation of the coreceptor binding site. Our results provide new insight into the dynamic of the underlying <b>molecular</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism</b> that complements the biochemical and structural studies...|$|E
40|$|The fungus Candida albicans is {{the most}} common cause of mycotic infections in immunocompromised hosts. Little is known about the initial {{interactions}} between Candida and immune cell receptors, such as the C-type lectin dendritic cell-specific intracellular cell adhesion molecule- 3 (ICAM- 3) -grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), because a detailed characterization at the structural level is lacking. DC-SIGN recognizes specific Candida-associated molecular patterns, that is, mannan structures present in the cell wall of Candida. The <b>molecular</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism</b> is however poorly understood. We postulated that small differences in mannan-branching may result in considerable differences in the binding affinity. Here, we exploit atomic force microscope-based dynamic force spectroscopy with single Candida cells to gain better insight in the carbohydrate recognition capacity of DC-SIGN. We demonstrate that slight differences in the N-mannan structure of Candida, that is, the absence or presence of a phosphomannan side chain, results in differences in the recognition by DC-SIGN as follows: (i) it contributes to the compliance of the outer cell wall of Candida, and (ii) its presence results in a higher binding energy of 1. 6 kB T. The single-bond affinity of tetrameric DC-SIGN for wild-type C. albicans is ~ 10. 7 kB T and a dissociation constant kD of 23 muM, which is relatively strong compared with other carbohydrate-protein interactions described in the literature. In conclusion, this study shows that DC-SIGN specifically recognizes mannan patterns on C. albicans with high affinity. Knowledge on the binding pocket of DC-SIGN and its pathogenic ligands will lead to a better understanding of how fungal-associated carbohydrate structures are recognized by receptors of the immune system and can ultimately contribute to the development of new anti-fungal drugs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Nowadays, {{more and}} more novel enzymes can be easily found in the whole enzyme pool with the rapid {{development}} of genetic operation. However, experimental work for substrate screening of a new enzyme is laborious, time consuming and costly. On the other hand, many computational methods {{have been widely used}} in lead screening of drug design. Seeing that the ligand-target protein system in drug design and the substrate-enzyme system in enzyme applications share the similar <b>molecular</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism,</b> we aim to fulfill the goal of substrate screening by in silico means in the present study. Results A computer-aided substrate screening (CASS) system which was based on the enzyme structure was designed and employed successfully to help screen substrates of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB). In this system, restricted molecular docking which was derived from the mechanism of the enzyme was applied to predict the energetically favorable poses of substrate-enzyme complexes. Thereafter, substrate conformation, distance between the oxygen atom of the alcohol part of the ester (in some compounds, this oxygen atom was replaced by nitrogen atom of the amine part of acid amine or sulfur atom of the thioester) and the hydrogen atom of imidazole of His 224, distance between the carbon atom of the carbonyl group of the compound and the oxygen atom of hydroxyl group of Ser 105 were used sequentially as the criteria to screen the binding poses. 223 out of 233 compounds were identified correctly for the enzyme by this screening system. Such high accuracy guaranteed the feasibility and reliability of the CASS system. Conclusion The idea of computer-aided substrate screening is a creative combination of computational skills and enzymology. Although the case studied in this paper is tentative, high accuracy of the CASS system sheds light on the field of computer-aided substrate screening. </p...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{signalling}} between aphids (small {{insects that}} suck plant sap) for mating and avoidance of antagonistic organisms, and between aphids and plants for location of hosts or avoidance of unsuitable plants, employs minute levels of small lipophilic molecules (SLMs), termed “semiochemicals”. These semiochemicals, which include sex and alarm pheromones, although often involving relatively simple volatile compounds to allow aerial transmission, convey highly accurate information, either through {{the uniqueness of}} their chemical structure or by acting together in characteristic mixtures. In addition, by chemical instability, they do not remain in the environment after their essential signalling role has occurred. Aphids, {{as a consequence of}} direct feeding or virus transmission, are major pests of agriculture and horticulture. Aphid semiochemicals present novel opportunities for management of pest populations, but problems of synthesis costs and delivery need to be overcome. Genes for associated enzymes in aphids and plants offer solutions, either for production and subsequent deployment in agriculture, or for direct biosynthesis by crop plants as a new generation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). These approaches are currently under active investigation. Semiochemicals released from plants during aphid feeding can also “switch on” defence chemistry-related genes in intact plants under field conditions, and the gene promoter sequences involved could be used to produce novel types of sentinel plants. The <b>molecular</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanisms</b> employed in aphid olfactory systems are being investigated to provide potential tools for recognition of SLMs, and the acceptance of substrate analogues is explored with enzymes synthesising aphid semiochemicals in an attempt to provide more active or stable structural analogues...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} to analysis of protein-ligand interactions, termed proteochemometrics, has been developed. Contrary to traditional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods that aim to correlate a description of ligands to their interactions with one particular target protein, proteochemometrics considers many targets simultaneously. Proteochemometrics thus analyzes the experimentally determined protein-ligand interaction activity data by correlating the data to a complex description of all interaction partners and; in a more general case even to interaction environment and assaying conditions, as well. In this way, a proteochemometric model analyzes an “interaction space,” from which only one cross-section would be contemplated by any one QSAR model. Proteochemometric models reveal the physicochemical and structural properties that are essential for protein-ligand complementarity and determine specificity of molecular interactions. From a drug design perspective, models may find use {{in the design of}} drugs with improved selectivity and in the design of drugs for multiple targets, such as mutated proteins (e. g., drug resistant mutations of pathogens). In this thesis, a general concept for creating of proteochemometric models and approaches for validation and interpretation of models are presented. Different types of physicochemical and structural description of ligands and macromolecules are evaluated; mathematical algorithms for proteochemometric modeling, in particular for analysis of large-scale data sets, are developed. Artificial chimeric proteins constructed according to principles of statistical design are used to derive high-resolution models for small classes of proteins. The studies of this thesis use data sets comprising ligand interactions with several families of G protein-coupled receptors. The presented approach is, however, general and can be applied to study <b>molecular</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of any class of drug targets...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{essential}} requirements for accurate functioning {{of the nervous system}} is that synaptic connections are formed and neural circuits are assembled with precision. Two major contributors to the establishment of selective synapse formation are thought to be the positional and molecular identities of neurons. In many instances, the fine-grained precision of synaptic connectivity is thought to occur through a process of <b>molecular</b> <b>recognition</b> that depends on the interaction of complementary recognition molecules expressed on pre- and post-synaptic partners. However, the lack of experimental observations suggests that this is perhaps not the predominant mechanism used in assembling neural networks. In addition to <b>molecular</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> the range of alternative postsynaptic targets can be reduced by organized patterns of neuronal position and axonal growth and termination to deliver the terminals of appropriate pre- and postsynaptic partners to restricted volumes of the developing nervous system. Thus, the positional identities of neurons carry significance in establishing neural networks. The selectivity with which sensory axons form connections with spinal motor neurons drives coordinated motor behavior. The precise profile of monosynaptic sensory-motor connectivity has been suggested to have its origins in the recognition of motor neuron subtypes by group Ia sensory afferents. Here I present an analysis of sensory-motor connectivity patterns in mice in which the normal clustering and positioning of motor neurons has been scrambled through genetic manipulations to conditionally knock out the transcription factor FoxP 1. FoxP 1, together with an intricate network of Hox genes, drives molecular differentiation programs that give rise to the molecular diversity observed in limb level motor neurons. Conditional ablation of FoxP 1 in motor neurons causes scrambling of the motor neurons as well as normalization of molecular identity among all limb level motor neurons. My findings in the conditional FoxP 1 mutant mice indicate that critical steps in the patterning of sensory-motor connectivity are governed more by the dorsoventral position of motor neurons than by their identity. My findings imply that sensory-motor specificity in monosynaptic reflex arcs depends on the ability of group Ia sensory afferents to target discrete dorsoventral domains of the spinal cord {{in a manner that is}} independent of motor neuron subtype identities, and even of motor neurons themselves. Motor pool clustering and positioning may therefore have evolved to ensure that the motor neurons that innervate a specific limb muscle are able to receive synaptic input from the group Ia sensory afferents supplying the same muscle...|$|R
