5|$|Most of the time, goalkeepers do low-intensity work (treading water {{without too}} much effort) but when they do work (for example, {{when they have a}} <b>man</b> <b>down</b> or are in the ready position) it is very intense.|$|E
5|$|The third {{televised}} match {{featured the}} Big Boss Man facing Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow attacked Boss Man before the match and controlled the match's beginning by using power moves to wear Boss <b>Man</b> <b>down.</b> Boss Man performed two clotheslines on Bigelow {{to gain the}} advantage. Bigelow responded by throwing Boss Man with a belly to back suplex, and then threw {{him out of the}} ring. He wore Boss <b>Man</b> <b>down</b> with a bear hug. Boss Man briefly regained the advantage by suplexing Bigelow but eventually tried to run at Bigelow to crush him {{in the corner of the}} ring. As Boss Man approached, Bigelow kicked him in the face and followed this up by performing a diving headbutt from the top rope to win the match by pinfall.|$|E

5|$|Resuming the {{partnership}} with Marko Pantelić {{begun in the}} second half of 2003–04, Žigić continued to score freely in the new season. With Red Star two goals and a <b>man</b> <b>down</b> in the first leg of the Champions League qualifier against Young Boys, he netted twice in the last 12 minutes to give his team an away draw. Domestically, Pantelić top-scored with 21 league goals and Žigić contributed 15 as Red Star finished in second place, behind Partizan. Žigić scored against Partizan to help Red Star reach the cup final, but was one of five regular starters unavailable for that match through injury or suspension, and his team lost to a last-minute goal to ten-man Železnik.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal played league challengers Manchester United on 11 April 1999. Neither {{team was}} able to score even after extra time had been played, {{therefore}} the match was decided in a replay four days later. David Beckham opened the scoring for United from a long range shot, but Bergkamp equalised with a shot that deflected off United's centre back Jaap Stam. United captain Roy Keane was red-carded for two bookable offences, with his team playing the last thirty minutes of normal time a <b>man</b> <b>down.</b> In injury time, Phil Neville fouled Parlour in the penalty area, conceding a penalty. Peter Schmeichel parried away Bergkamp's resultant spot kick and the game went into extra time. Giggs scored partway through {{the second half of}} extra time. Picking up possession on the halfway line after a loose pass from Patrick Vieira, he dribbled past the entire Arsenal back line before shooting just under Seaman's bar. Giggs ran celebrating towards the United fans, and the team held on win 2–1. The goal was the last ever scored in a FA Cup semi-final replay; it was to be abolished from the following season.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{started his}} English {{campaign}} slowly. Australia typically selected their strongest {{team for the}} tour opener against Worcestershire, and the all-rounder was omitted as the visitors won by an innings. As the Australians often played six days a week, they employed a rotation policy in the county matches, {{and in the second}} game against Leicestershire, Loxton made his debut on English soil. He made only four, before opening the bowling in both innings and taking a total of 1/23 in an innings victory. His attempts to break into the first-choice team were hampered by a groin strain he suffered in the third match against Yorkshire when he was striving for extra pace in his only over in the first innings. As a result, he played no further part in the match. One <b>man</b> <b>down,</b> Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour. They fell to 6/31 in pursuit of 60—effectively seven down with Loxton unable to bat—before scraping home without further loss after Yorkshire dropped both batsmen.|$|E

25|$|The Cougars {{journeyed to}} Conway, Arkansas for a Wednesday night game at Central Arkansas {{with both sides}} riding three-game win streaks. SIUE would unleash 28 shots, the most in a dozen years, but were unable {{to carry out a}} {{sustained}} attack. Despite playing a <b>man</b> <b>down</b> for over 96 minutes, the Bears defense repeatedly anticipated the Cougars' shots and turned them aside. SIUE's Dal Santo and UCA's Olsen are the two top goalkeepers in the MVC for save percentage, and both not only made at least one spectacular save, but both also made stops on penalty kicks that would have won the game. The Cougars unbeaten streak is now at eight games with the 11th ranked Loyola Ramblers next up at The Ralph on Saturday night.|$|E

Key was first to fall, clean bowled to Danish Kaneria with the score on 58. Yasir Arafat was next in, and lasted 9 balls and 10 runs before falling to the same bowler. Denly top scored with 36, {{but he was the}} third <b>man</b> <b>down,</b> neatly stumped by James Foster. Most of the middle order chipped in with good runs, Martin van Jaarsveld with sixteen, Darren Stevens with 29 and Azhar Mahmood with 24.
