40|$|The {{helicopter}} {{flight control}} system described in this report is designed {{with the objective of}} improving the handling qualities and to meet the fault tolerance requirements of a fully operational system. The emphasis in the design was put on minimising the effort in sensor redundancy required to perform the various control tasks. With respect to these objectives the most adequate design is a feed forward command system utilising the feedback of rate gyros. This controller design improves helicopter response dynamics and additionally gives sufficient (adequate) system stability. It is the basic fully redundant control mode. The higher control modes as heading <b>hold,</b> attitude <b>hold,</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>hold</b> and speed hold are designed as superimposed control modes requiring only simplex sensor signals. The control structure and its various modes were investigated initially in a ground simulation. In subsequent flight trials with the Bo 105 -S 3 the control parameters were optimised and finally evaluated. (orig.)

40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis, a nonlinear {{mathematical model}} simulation and linear controller {{design for the}} U 1 -H 1 helicopter was achieved. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part, the nonlinear dynamic model is developed using the Matrix Laboratory Software and Heli-Dyn R Software, which is a modeling and simulation tool for rotorcraft developed by Dr. Ilkay Yavrucuk at Middle East Technical University. The non-linear model consists in a contribution of main rotor, tail rotor, fuselage, gravitational model, horizontal and vertical tail rotor. The U 1 -H 1 main rotor non-linear mathematical model was build by use of blade element momentum theory, inflow dynamics and flapping dynamics. The total forces and moments are used in 6 degrees of freedom equations of motion model and helicopter states are obtained for hover conditions and forward flight. Trim and linearization process was done by Heli-Dyn R Software. The second part consists in a stability augmentation systems (SAS) followed by a set of automatic flight control systems (AFCS) designed by use of PID controllers. The AFCS main objective is to ease the pilot by decreasing the workload. The stability augmentation systems was designed by use of optimal control, especially Linear Quadratic Tracking Controller (LQT) and Linear Quadratic Regulator Controller (LQR). The automatic flight control systems implemented are heading <b>hold,</b> attitude, <b>hold</b> <b>altitude</b> acquire and <b>hold</b> mode for hover condition and heading <b>hold,</b> attitude <b>hold,</b> <b>altitude</b> acquire and <b>hold</b> mode and airspeed hold for forward flight condition. Furthermore, in order to check the robustness of the controllers and directory modes, disturbances were added to the model.

Furthermore, the controllers and directory modes shown a successful dynamic behavior towards perturbations...|$|R

At 7:34 pm, the airliner's crew reported passing Tri-State Airport's outer marker. The controller gave them clearance to land.

The director is used for <b>holding</b> <b>altitude</b> in the first segment and for descent at a controlled rate in the second segment.

50|$|Any gain or {{loss from}} a 1256 Contract is treated for tax {{purposes}} as 40% short-term gain and 60% long-term gain. Since most futures contracts are held {{for less than}} the IRS's 12-month <b>minimum</b> <b>holding</b> period for long-term capital gains tax rates, the gain from any non-1256 contract will typically be taxed at the higher short-term rate. Thus the 1256 Contract designation enhances the marketability based on the after-tax attractiveness of these products. The reason for the implementation of this tax code was {{due to the fact that}} traders were hedging their short term futures contracts (going long and short at the same time) in order to transition to the next tax year without paying the short-term capital gains tax on these positions and effectively making these positions qualify for long-term tax treatment.|$|R
