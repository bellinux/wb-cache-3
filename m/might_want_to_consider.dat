What special insight or superior moral sensitivity gives me license {{not only to}} accuse but to judge? [...] . It is far too easy to be ethically self-righteous. Franz J. Ingelfinger (2) L̂n the fall of 1990, Stanley Goldsmith, MD phoned to invite me {{to be on a}} panel to discuss monoclonal antibody imaging. In the course of the conversation, he mentioned that the panel <b>might</b> even <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> ethical issues. For example, should a diagnostic monoclonal antibody study for tumor detection be performed without informing the patient that the diagnostic study might preclude the possibility of future monoclonal antibody therapy due to a HAMA (human antimouse antibody) response. Medical ethics is rarely discussed in the context of monoclonal antibody imaging, but it is certainly a subject that appeals to bureaucrats; they have wrapped medical (and animal) ethics with rules and regulations endowing that area of human activity with a rapacious capacity to gobble time and generate reams of paperwork. The unintended result is that some of us probably put medical ethics in the same class as grace before meals, a perfunctory duty to keep up appearances before getting down to the real business; beyond that many of us are likely to feel the subject is best confined to the rarified and distant world of university philosophers. Nevertheless, Dr. Goldsmith's question trou bled me.

40|$|Stretch-shorten cycle (SSC) {{capability}} {{is fundamental to}} many sporting activities. To date, {{there have been numerous}} studies on the SSC potentiation in adults, however, there are very few studies of SSC potentiation in youths. For youths, the biological maturity may not necessarily coincide with the chronological age. Biological maturity for youths can be classified as either in the pre-puberty, puberty or post-puberty maturation stage. The limited literature to-date has shown that youths at different biological maturity stages have different muscle characteristics and development. This study aims to investigate SSC potentiation at the different biological maturity stages. Such a study will provide evidence as to a possible window of trainability for the development of SSC. Using a force plate, this study measured and compared the countermovement jump and squat jump capability of a total of 209 youths (male, = 101, females, = 108) aged between 11 to 17 years of age, from the Singapore Sports School. These youth were categorized into the three maturational groups. When compared, gender differences were observed and these differences increased with maturity. Differences in SJ performance across the maturational groups were different as compared to CMJ performance, where no significant maturational differences were observed. It was observed that {{there was a significant difference}} in the eccentric utilization ratio for peak force across the maturational stages for both genders. However differences for jump height were not significant. It would seem that concentric force/power capabilities (i. e. SJ performance) are more likely to be influenced by maturation than eccentric force and power. Furthermore it appears that the eccentric capability and thus SSC augmentation is optimal around pubescence and diminishes to some extent with maturity. These changes are most likely best explained by growth related factors (i. e. increase in bone length and loss of tissue extensibility around PHV) as well as maturational factors (i. e. changes in tissue compliance/stiffness). Given these findings it would seem that pre-pubescent athletes would react favorably to plyometric type training given their eccentric force power capability and proposed compliance of their tissues. This study concluded with recommendations for youth coaches <b>to</b> <b>consider.</b> Since vertical stiffness was found to increase with age, a good stretching routine is recommended during this sensitive growth period. Coaches <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> also <b>consider</b> focusing on eccentric training that focuses on full range of motion, correct alignment and stability...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{variability}} {{influences the}} development of crop diseases, including through an effect on crop structure and hence on the microclimate. In a context of climate change, emerging and/or more aggressive plant diseases are thus expected. It is therefore critical to understand, anticipate and quantify the effects of climate variability and climate change on numerous host plant/pathogen systems. For this purpose, an homogeneous and integrative approach to the disease dynamics of all airborne fungal pathogens affecting crops is necessary. It enables to identify when plant-climate-pathogen interactions lead to the onset or development {{of one or more}} pathosystem(s) at a local or regional scale. We therefore describe here the conceptual design of a mechanistic model of foliar disease dynamics coupled with a process-based crop model. This conceptual design proposes generic response functions based on existing response functions in published models to simulate climate-based epidemiological processes. The dispersal and deposition, infection, latency and secondary inoculum production processes are the modules in this generic model. Input variables are either climate-related (rain, wind, air temperature, and air relative humidity) or plant-related (canopy relative humidity, canopy temperature, host surface wetness, plant phenological stage, plant and tissue age, organ surfaces, plant nitrogen content and varietal resistance). We evaluated the general applicability of the conceptual design using a number of airborne fungal plant pathogens with contrasted biological behaviours. We successfully completed proof-of-concept tests, during which disease models for two airborne fungal pathogens, Plasmopara viticola and Puccinia triticina, were coupled with the grapevine and wheat versions of the generic crop model STICS. This revealed the ability of our conceptual design to be transposed into functional models and then coupled with a classical crop model. This conceptual design could be a valuable tool for agronomists who <b>might</b> now be <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> biotic stresses as additional constraints in their crop models...|$|R

50|$|The {{indicators}} {{that have been}} identified are allocated percentages and in a detailed cost breakdown analysis these indicators should add up closely to 100%. This process requires an in-depth analysis of the business's expenses.For simplicity's sake, these random percentages have been assigned to the six cost drivers of transportation this example entails. After this step, the cost drivers are being analyzed while the analyzing party (be it the business itself or an external agency) tries to examine possibilities to cut current expenses. The business might find 42% of total costs {{to be too much}} for motor fuel and might either want to look for an alternative supplier or change to more fuel efficient trucks. The cost breakdown analysis is even more effective when repeated constantly, so that changes in the respective shares in total costs of the various cost drivers can be tracked down. Over a five-year period, the share of expenses for tires might have risen from 5% to 8%, accompanied by a decrease of expenses for personnel from 35% to 32%, which featured the dismissal of workforce. The business <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> contracting a cheaper supplier of tires and reemploy its former employees.|$|E
