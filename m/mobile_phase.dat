25|$|Reversed-phase {{chromatography}} (RPC) is any {{liquid chromatography}} procedure {{in which the}} <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> is significantly more polar than the stationary phase. It is so named because in normal-phase liquid chromatography, the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> is significantly less polar than the stationary phase. Hydrophobic molecules in the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> tend to adsorb to the relatively hydrophobic stationary phase. Hydrophilic molecules in the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> will tend to elute first. Separating columns typically comprise a C8 or C18 carbon-chain bonded to a silica particle substrate.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> is {{the phase}} that moves in a {{definite}} direction. It {{may be a}} liquid (LC and Capillary Electrochromatography (CEC)), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of HPLC the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or a polar solvent such as methanol in reverse phase chromatography and the sample being separated. The <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated.|$|E
25|$|In HPLC {{the sample}} is forced by a liquid at high {{pressure}} (the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase)</b> through a column that is packed with a stationary phase composed of irregularly or spherically shaped particles, a porous monolithic layer, or a porous membrane. HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases. Methods in which the stationary phase is more polar than the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> (e.g., toluene as the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase,</b> silica as the stationary phase) are termed normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) and the opposite (e.g., water-methanol mixture as the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> and C18 (octadecylsilyl) as the stationary phase) is termed reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC).|$|E
40|$|Phenyl‐type {{stationary}} phase surfaces {{are useful for}} the separation of highly aromatic compounds because of the extensive intermolecular forces between the π‐electron systems. For this reason, we studied the retention behaviour and selectivity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on Synergi polar‐RP and Cosmosil 5 PBB chromatography columns using methanol/water, acetonitrile/water, benzene spiked (0. 5 %) methanol/water, and benzene spiked (0. 5 %) acetonitrile/water <b>mobile</b> <b>phases.</b> These four solvent systems were employed because π‐π. interactions between the aromatic solute (i. e., PAH) and the aromatic {{stationary phase}} should be inhibited in <b>mobile</b> <b>phases</b> that are also π electron rich, and hence a competitor for the analyte. Our {{results showed that the}} acetonitrile <b>mobile</b> <b>phases</b> were substantially stronger eluents than the methanol <b>mobile</b> <b>phases,</b> which was consistent with the premise that retention of aromatic compounds is sensitive to π‐π. interactions. Aside from changes in absolute retention, selectivity of the PAHs was also generally greater in methanol rather than acetonitrile <b>mobile</b> <b>phases</b> because the methanol did not attenuate the π‐π. bonding interactions between the PAH and the stationary phase; but, despite this, the retention behaviour of the Synergi polar‐RP column was similar to that observed on C 18 columns. The excessive retention times of the Cosmosil 5 PBB column were decreased dramatically when acetonitrile was used as the mobile phase; however, selectivity between structural isomers was lost. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The peak {{shapes of}} 4 {{anthracyclines}} {{have been investigated}} using isoeluotropic mixtures of acetonitrile, methanol and tetrahydrofuran (THF) in combination with formate buffer at pH 2. 9 on a silica column. With aqueous or aqueous-rich <b>mobile</b> <b>phases,</b> {{no significant differences in}} overloading behavior have been found with various organic modifiers. With organic-rich <b>mobile</b> <b>phases,</b> peak shape and its dependence on sample size are notably different when organic modifier concentration is changed. Pure aqueous buffer produces the overloaded peak profiles of the solutes associated with a typical Langmuir isotherm, while distinct anti-Langmuirian peaks have been achieved with organic-rich eluents. The general similarity of the loading behavior for the solutes with acetonitrile, THF or isopropanol has been reflected either in aqueous-rich or organic-rich eluents, suggesting that the nature of organic modifier don’t dominate the peak shape but water content in the <b>mobile</b> <b>phases...</b>|$|R
25|$|Common {{mobile phases}} used include any {{miscible}} combination {{of water with}} various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see Normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts {{to assist in the}} separation of the sample components. The composition of the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> may be kept constant ("isocratic elution mode") or varied ("gradient elution mode") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient elution the composition of the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1–3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile.|$|E
25|$|The chosen {{composition}} of the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> (also called eluent) depends on the intensity of interactions between various sample components ("analytes") and stationary phase (e.g. hydrophobic interactions in reversed-phase HPLC). Depending on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases analytes partition between the two during the separation process {{taking place in the}} column. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a liquid–liquid extraction but is continuous, not step-wise. In this example, using a water/acetonitrile gradient, more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) late, once the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> gets more concentrated in acetonitrile (i.e. in a <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> of higher eluting strength).|$|E

40|$|MLC is {{a mode of}} {{reversed}} phase {{liquid chromatography}} (RPLC), in which the <b>mobile</b> <b>phases</b> are aqueous solutions of a surfactant at a concentration above the critical micel-lar concentration (cmc).

In these media, the great variety of interactions between the solutes, micelles and stationary phase makes MLC a highly versatile technique, which is appropriate {{for a wide range of}} solutes (hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds) that can be separated in the same run. Most procedures for the determination of compounds by MLC make use of micellar <b>mobile</b> <b>phases</b> containing an organic modifier (hybrid micellar <b>mobile</b> <b>phases),</b> which is usually a short-chain alcohol (methanol, pro-panol, butanol or pentanol) or acetonitrile.

25|$|Aside from <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> {{surface tension}} (organizational {{strength}} in eluent structure), other <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> modifiers can affect analyte retention. For example, {{the addition of}} inorganic salts causes a moderate linear increase in the surface tension of aqueous solutions (ca. 1.5J/cm² per Mol for NaCl, 2.5J/cm² per Mol for (NH4)2SO4), and because the entropy of the analyte-solvent interface is controlled by surface tension, the addition of salts tend to increase the retention time. This technique is used for mild separation and recovery of proteins and protection of their biological activity in protein analysis (hydrophobic interaction chromatography, HIC).|$|E
25|$|The sample {{mixture to}} be {{separated}} and analyzed is introduced, in a discrete small volume (typically microliters), into the stream of <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> percolating through the column. The components of the sample move through the column at different velocities, which are a function of specific physical interactions with the adsorbent (also called stationary phase). The velocity of each component depends on its chemical nature, {{on the nature of}} the stationary phase (column) and on the composition of the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase.</b> The time at which a specific analyte elutes (emerges from the column) is called its retention time. The retention time measured under particular conditions is an identifying characteristic of a given analyte.|$|E
25|$|Similar is {{the effect}} of {{reducing}} the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> flow rate to the nanolitre-per-minute range since, in addition to resulting in improved desolvation, the smaller droplets formed are more tolerant to the presence of non-volatile species in the sample matrix.|$|E

25|$|Reverse phased HPLC often uses {{methanol}} / {{water mixtures}} as the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase.</b> Since the polarity of water spans the same range from 25 to 205°C, a temperature gradient {{can be used}} to effect similar separations, for example of phenols.|$|E
25|$|The {{driving force}} in {{reversed}} phase chromatography originates in the high order of the water structure. The role of the organic component of the <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> is to reduce this high order and thus reduce the retarding strength of the aqueous component.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) is {{a method}} {{that in some ways}} is more powerful than GC, but can be coupled to mass spectrometry just as easily. In LC, the concerns involving sample preparation can be minimal. In LC, both the stationary and <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> can affect the separation, whereas in GC only the stationary phase should be influential. This allows for the sample preparation to be minimal if one is willing to adjust the stationary phase or <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> before running the sample. The primary concern is the concentration of analyte. If the concentration is too high then separation can be unsuccessful, but mass spectrometry as a detection method does not need complete separation, showing another benefit of coupling LC to a mass spectrometer.|$|E
