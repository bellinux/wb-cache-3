40|$|Abstract Background Earlier {{observations}} in our lab had indicated that large, time-varying magnetic fields could elicit action potentials that travel {{in only one}} direction {{in at least some}} of the myelinated axons in peripheral nerves. The objective of this study was to collect quantitative evidence for magnetically induced unidirectional action potentials in peripheral nerves of human subjects. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>coil</b> was maneuvered to a location on the upper arm where physical effects consistent with the creation of unidirectional action potentials were observed. Electromyographic (EMG) and somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) recordings were then made from a total of 20 subjects during stimulation with the <b>magnetic</b> <b>coil.</b> Results The relative amplitudes of the EMG and SEP signals changed oppositely when the current direction in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>coil</b> was reversed. This effect was consistent with current direction in the coil relative to the arm for all subjects. Conclusion A differential evocation of motor and sensory fibers was demonstrated and indicates that it may be possible to induce unidirectional action potentials in myelinated peripheral nerve fibers with magnetic stimulation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Magnetically {{enhanced}} Vacuum Arc Thruster (MVAT) is a {{solid propellant}} micro-thruster based on a pulsed vacuum arc thruster (VAT) that produces precisely controlled impulse bits. The addition of a co-axial magnetic field to the VAT enhances the thrust efficiency of the thruster and collimates the plasma plume, which reduces contamination of the spacecraft. Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation, along with team member Aerojet, is developing a TRL 5 readiness level MVAT thruster with an integrated Power Processing Unit (PPU). The PPU is an inductive energy store driver that uses the 20 V bus voltage to generate both the 1 kV spike needed to trigger the arc {{as well as the}} energy to generate the axial magnetic field and the vacuum arc. Since the <b>magnetic</b> field <b>coil</b> is also the primary energy store, there is no mass penalty for the MVAT relative the VAT. This paper presents thrust stand measurements and retarding potential analyses to characterize the improvement of thrust performance with the application of the magnetic field.
