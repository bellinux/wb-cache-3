5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> out of use in many contexts.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006 Black {{allegedly}} suggested at {{an international}} conference in Amman, Jordan, that Blackwater USA was ready to move towards providing security professionals up to brigade size for humanitarian efforts and low intensity conflicts. Black denies the allegation. Critics have suggested this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> too far in putting political decisions {{in the hands of}} privately owned corporations. The company denies this was ever said.|$|E
500|$|The main {{legal issue}} with ouster clauses {{is whether it}} is in fact {{possible}} to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts by the use of carefully drafted provisions. Thio Li-ann has noted that [...] "courts generally loathe ouster clauses as these contradict the rule of law whereby judges finally declare the legal limits of power and also as the individual's ultimate recourse to the law is denied. Hence, courts try to construe these strictly to minimise their impact. In so doing, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> against the grain of parliamentary will." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was silent}} for a minute, and he sat still, feeling that {{ingenuity}} was powerless just now. Suddenly she turned away, and said in an agitated tone, [...] "It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> hindered--I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to my godfather." ...|$|R

500|$|Following {{the events}} in Smoking Mirror a few years ago, George Stobbart has {{returned}} to {{his life as a}} lawyer, and finds himself flying to the Congo Basin, alongside his pilot, Harry Gilligan, to meet a scientist by the name of Cholmondely, who claims to have created a machine that can make limitless energy. [...] However, a storm forces the pair's plane to crash land on a cliff-top, right close to the scientist's lab. [...] Escaping the wreckage, George makes his way to the lab, arriving {{just in time to see}} the scientist gunned down by a pale, lanky man, known as Susarro, and his bodyguard, after being questioned on an unknown subject. [...] A postcard hidden in the lab prompts George to travel to Glastonbury, England, to search for a man named Bruno, and a friend of the scientist, who had advised him to flee. In his attempts to find out where Bruno is, he quickly learns that he disappeared before his arrival and is now in danger. Although not knowing where he is exactly, after visiting a fortune teller, George spots a building that caught fire, and goes to deal with it, saving an old man trapped within it. [...] When they chat, he quickly learns that the old man's name is Bruno Ostvald, the scientist he met in the Hotel Ubu in Paris, and a Neo-Templar. [...] Bruno reveals to George that he left the group after the events of Shadows of the Templar, and that they are now led by Susarro, who took over and renamed it the Cult of the Dragon. Susarro is seeking to gain immortality through the use of the Earth’s ley lines, which Cholmondely was using in his experiments, and Bruno explains that he is able to track these with a special device he has, believing Susarro <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to a site in Paris to find something important, prompting the pair to follow after him.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1980s {{violent crimes}} in the United States have been {{steadily}} declining. Between 1980 and 1990, the murder rate for the United States fell by 9%, and between 1973 and 1992, the victimization rate of rapes fell by 28%. [...] "Although rates of crime <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> down for the United States generally, they are spirally upward for one specific group of Americans: African Americans." [...] Douglas Massey argues that the rising of African American poverty {{and the addition of}} racial segregation produces a sharp increase in the geographic concentration of poverty. He continues by stating that [...] "as poverty is concentrated… all things associated with it are concentrated, including crime… thus… creating an ecological niche characterized by high levels of violence and a high risk of victimization". Furthermore, Massey argues that a person living within this niche becomes violent themselves in an effort to deter potential criminals and increase their chance of survival, thus creating a cycle of African American violence which at some point cannot be reversed.|$|E
2500|$|The public's {{reaction}} {{towards the}} documentary has been positive. MTV asked various fans in New York and Los Angeles, California {{what they thought}} about the film, a fan quoted, [...] "It made me love her even more," [...] Shanna Birnbaum, 23, told MTV News. [...] "I think she was very honest. She really let her true self shine through. It showed people and young girls you can get through anything." [...] Stacey Medura, agreed, adding that [...] "For the Record" [...] humanized the pop star. [...] "It's easier to understand how she feels," [...] Medura said. [...] "Her opinion matters most. I think she covered a lot [...]" [...] Some said this look into Britney's life was inspiring. [...] "I really have gained {{a lot of respect}} for her now," [...] Derek wrote. [...] "I felt like this was the first time since she burst onto the scene a decade ago that she has spoken from the heart. ... I think this is what fans and others have wanted from her for a long time, to be honest. Her honesty can be helpful for others who <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> through situations like hers, such as dealing with a custody battle." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{atmosphere}} of the Lees' villa had disturbed Marjorie's feelings and ideas even more than it had Trafford's. She came back struggling to recover those high resolves that had seemed so secure when they had walked down to Les Avantes. There was a curiously tormenting memory of that vast, admirable nursery, and the princely procession of children that would not leave her mind. No effort of her reason could reconcile her to the inferiority of Margharita's equipment. She had a detestable craving for a uniform for <b>May.</b> But <b>May</b> <b>was</b> <b>going....</b>|$|R

50|$|The glacier {{has been}} {{undergoing}} a slow, near-continuous retreat {{since at least}} the early 1900s. There is evidence to indicate that this retreat <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on even longer than that, as glacial deposits much farther down the valley indicate that it <b>may</b> have once <b>been</b> over 200 miles long.|$|R
60|$|Something of {{the sort}} <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on in the temples of Egypt or Samaria a score of centuries before. I do not know.
