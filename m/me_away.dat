500|$|... "Rain" [...] {{is notable}} for Ringo Starr's drumming, which Starr rates as his best {{recorded}} performance. Critics agreed: both Ian MacDonald and Rolling Stone described his drumming {{on the track}} as [...] "superb", while Richie Unterberger of AllMusic praised his [...] "creative drum breaks". In 1984, Starr said: [...] "I think it's {{the best out of}} all the records I've ever made. 'Rain' blows <b>me</b> <b>away</b> … I know me and I know my playing … and then there's 'Rain'." ...|$|E
500|$|David Calvert-Smith, for the prosecution, {{alleged that}} the detectives' {{supposedly}} contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews. During the fifth, when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar, the notes show him saying: [...] "Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else will talk to you. You can't keep <b>me</b> <b>away</b> from them." [...] Silcott denied ever having said these words.|$|E
500|$|When Anderson first {{wrote the}} episode, {{she did not}} hint that Scully and Mulder had had sex. Spotnitz and the {{production}} crew, however, felt it was natural to suggest that Scully and Mulder's relationship may have evolved into a romantic one. The idea of heart chakra crop circles was included because Anderson wanted [...] "whatever Mulder was involved in that took him away from <b>me,</b> <b>away</b> from Washington, to somehow tie into {{what it was that}} I was going through—the journey that I was going through". As such, Anderson dedicated much of her time researching both crop circles and heart chakras, but she later gave additional credit to Spotnitz, who she noted was also heavily involved during the researching process.|$|E

500|$|The notes {{show him}} asking: [...] "Who told you that?" [...] When the detectives {{said they had}} witnesses, he {{reportedly}} said: [...] "They are only kids. No {{one is going to}} believe them." [...] The notes say he walked around the interview room with tears in his eyes, saying: [...] "You cunts, you cunts," [...] and [...] "Jesus, Jesus," [...] then: [...] "You ain't got enough evidence. Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else will talk to you. You can't keep <b>me</b> <b>away</b> from them." [...] The notes show him saying of the murder weapons: [...] "You're too slow, man, they gone." [...] He was at that point charged with murder, to which he reportedly responded: [...] "They won't give evidence against me." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{tells of the}} protagonist's devotion to her lover, proclaiming that while she knows [...] "you've got me", she'll be [...] "lovin' him long time". The first verse begins with [...] "You ain't even got to worry / About a thing, I've got you babe / And ain't nobody takin' <b>me</b> <b>away</b> / Its not a game I'm here to stay", {{describing}} her strong emotional attachment to him. As the verse continues, Carey makes references and comparisons to their love and drugs powerful effect over the body and its senses.

[...] Winners' reactions to the award range from Damien Hirst's [...] "A media circus {{to raise money for}} the Tate and Channel 4" [...] to Jeremy Deller's [...] "It blew <b>me</b> <b>away,</b> people's hunger to see what I'd done". Auction prices for works by previous winners have generally increased. [...] The award has also seen some unexpected results: [...] Tracey Emin's My Bed, was overlooked in 1999 despite drawing large crowds to the Tate. [...] The Chapman brothers and Willie Doherty lost out to Grayson Perry in 2003– Perry accepted the award dressed as a girl while Jake Chapman described [...] "losing the Turner prize to a grown man dressed as a small girl" [...] as his [...] "most embarrassing moment".|$|E

Furtado's vocal range spans from Ab3 to F5. Furtado has cited the [...] "spooky, keyboard-driven pop sound" [...] of the band Eurythmics, particularly their 1983 song [...] "Here Comes the Rain Again", as an influence on [...] "Say It Right" [...] and other tracks on Loose. [...] "I'm not 100 percent sure what [...] about, but it always takes <b>me</b> <b>away</b> to another place, and I love it", she said. In fact the song deals with mystic or transcendental experiences as she explains {{in an interview in}} 2007. [...] "It {{is a kind of a}} magical song. It has a mystery to it, that I have not quite figured out. It has a haunting twist to it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, one of Sesame Street's {{international}} co-productions, Takalani Sesame, {{caused some}} {{controversy in the}} US when the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, was created in response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic. It {{marked the first time}} AIDS and the goal of confronting the disease's stigma was included in a preschool curriculum. According to the documentary, The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop, and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, [...] "The reaction we got in the US blew <b>me</b> <b>away.</b> I didn't expect people to be so horrible... and hateful and mean". The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and prominent minister and conservative political commentator Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts. Kami went on to be named UNICEF's Champion for Children in November 2003.|$|E
500|$|... "Holding the gun {{became a}} {{controversial}} thing 'cause we filmed it in London, and they don't {{have a lot}} of gun use out there. That doesn't mean that there's no gun use, so I did find it really interesting. For me, the thing is, it blew <b>me</b> <b>away</b> that members of [...] Parliament were speaking about this. One, because it's a music video, and two, because don't you guys have television shows out there that show crime? It's really strange to me. I don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very strange to me. I was really surprised at how much the gun use was scrutinized. [...] a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun. We shouldn't censor ourselves." ...|$|E

500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent <b>me</b> <b>away</b> three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, [...] "She was absolutely magic [...] It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew <b>me</b> <b>away</b> because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put <b>me</b> <b>away</b> for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
