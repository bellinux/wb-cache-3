Today, the Norwegian maritime industries have found "a new equilibrium", where old and national traditions have successfully merged with the new and global realities.

40|$|In the 16 th {{century the}} Dutch Republic the <b>maritime</b> <b>labour</b> market was {{extraordinarily}} large for Europeans standards. This {{means that the}} Dutch East India Company (V.

However the employments level saw a steady rise after 1610 and this is wherea transition phase set in of a large company growing larger and demanding more from the <b>maritime</b> <b>labour</b> market.

40|$|The {{transition}} {{towards a}} global <b>maritime</b> <b>labour</b> market {{has led to}} a {{reduction in the number of}} ships flying the Swedish flag, and with it a decreasing number of employment opportunities on the national <b>maritime</b> <b>labour</b> market.

The main purpose of the present study is to explore, and empirically asses, the factors affecting the competitive situation for Swedish maritime officers. Theoretical results indicate a trade-off between price and efficiency, where employment opportunities are set in the relationship between national and international regulatory frameworks. The empirical results indicate that while Swedish maritime officers hold a high degree of competence, their competitive situation on the international <b>maritime</b> <b>labour</b> market is threatened by an increased cost awareness and contingent upcoming legislation. Suitable conditions need to be realised, in order to support the competitiveness of Swedish maritime officers. Suggestions for an appropriate course of action are provided.

China has emerged as the world׳s largest shipbuilder, the largest seafarers supplying country, one of the world׳s largest ship-owners, and one of the largest port states. Therefore, the Convention has perhaps more significant impact on China than any other country. Until now, China has not yet ratified the Convention.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention, 2006 (MLC, 2006), {{which will}} {{enter into force}} in 2012 or 2013, focuses on seafarers’ rights, safety and health {{in order to promote}} a better {{shipping}} environment. A Declaration of <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Compliance Part II (DMLC II) is required to state the measures taken to ensure the quality of seafarers’ living and working conditions on-board a ship. It is a challenge for ship owners to establish such a document and fit it into the existing safety management systems, International Safety Management Code (ISM). This paper proposes four possible documentation models of the ship owners’ management system to cover the DMLC II with pros and cons. An appropriate documentation model not only benefits owners with regard to enforcement of the MLC, 2006, but also helps the flag and port state administrations to perform effective and efficient inspections...|$|R

40|$|With an aim {{to ensure}} {{comprehensive}} worldwide {{protection of the}} social and labour rights of seafarers, the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention 2006, provides a model for tackling the most pressing globalisation challenges of our time by setting solid and uniform rules for the workers involved in commerce at sea, the seafarers. This study identifies implications of implementing the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention, 2006 for Norwegian offshore companies. In order to answer the aim and objectives in this study, a range of Norwegian offshore companies were approached through interviews. Observations are also used to get an in depth understanding of the implementation process. The study revealed that the Convention created some implementation challenges for the offshore companies, and discusses if these problems occur as a result of neglecting the offshore companies when making the Convention. It emerges that the offshore companies have not been considered as a separate activity in the Convention. This made the new definition of a seafarer specially challenging for the offshore companies, {{due to the nature of}} the sector. Offshore activities related to shipping, as we know it in Norway, are not as central in other countries, with a few exceptions. In Norway, exemptions for some offshore positions were granted, which solved the problems regarding the definition for vessels registered in Norway. Other flag states has granted a statement of interpretation for each vessel, which excludes some positions from the Convention. The definition of a seafarer is the same as it was before the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention, 2006 came. Further, it emerged that flag state inefficiency have been problematic for the offshore companies, which has lead to pressed time to finish the DMLC, which again has lead to pressed time to certify the vessels. The study concludes that the implications of implementing the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention for the Norwegian offshore companies occurs as a result of neglecting the offshore sector when the Convention was made...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe article aims at {{analyzing}} {{a reference}} legal instrument for seafarers’ rights – the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention, 2006. Created {{due to the}} lack of relevance of the body of international labour standards in the maritime sector, the Convention lays down in its regulations a firm set of principles and rights for an entire global industry. <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention is intended to complement three key maritime conventions, SOLAS, MARPOL and STCW as well as to become the fourth pillar of an international regulatory regime for quality shipping. It is internationally unique in that it aims both to ensure decent working conditions on board and a fair framework for ship-owners operating ships under the flag of States that have ratified the Convention.

40|$|To {{optimize}} their operating costs, many shipowners {{resort to}} manning agencies, intermediaries {{between them and}} the cosmopolitan crew of their ships, sailing, usually on the open registers advocating «absolute minimum» in social matters. This economic model based on the search for a lowering of the social cost on board ships must now reckon with the entry into force of the 2006 <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention («MLC 2006 »), which requires Member States to respect new obligations as to control of companies subleasing employees. Partly incorporated in the Community system, this new international social regulation nevertheless illustrates the difficulties of the European Union to develop a common response to widespread international practice of social dumping at sea. If the principle of social responsibility of States with regard to manning agencies is enshrined in the MLC 2006, the absence of Community regulation of this activity leaves the control of <b>maritime</b> <b>labour</b> companies to the sole discretion of the more diligent States in social matters...|$|R

30|$|Food is {{important}} for liner shipping companies (LSCs) {{in their efforts to}} support daily lives and fulfil seafarer demand. Food issues are addressed in the International Labour Organization’s (ILO’s) Food and Catering (Ships’ Crews) Convention 1946 (No. 68), amended 2006. Moreover, the enforcement of the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention (MLC) Regulations and Code appears to have ensured that seafarers have hygienic conditions and that good quality food and drinking water are provided. The MLC aims to meet all current standards of international <b>maritime</b> <b>labour</b> conventions and recommendations, and comply with the fundamental principles found in other international labour conventions. Yet despite these efforts, food issues require greater attention, as maintaining the food supply chain is a dynamic and difficult task. To identify strategies for improving the procurement of food for ships, this paper illustrates how to facilitate the food supply for shipping lines and further evaluate the associated supply chain. Advanced technology, comprehensive procurement procedures, qualified personnel, extensive outbound logistics (i.e., distribution) networks and sound training programmes on food quality and safety are critical elements in the food supply chain, and will enhance the quality of food for seafarers.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention {{amendments}} concerning {{abandonment of}} seafarers {{are expected to}} come into force in 2017, something long sought by seafarers’ representatives. The Convention is already considered a success, being {{referred to as a}} ‘super convention’ or ‘seafarers’ bill of rights’, and the amendments are expected to receive a similar reception. Although it is an international legal instrument, the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention also establishes, for contracting states, soft guidelines on how its provisions should be implemented. The Convention recognises that the seafarer is a transnational worker in that different states are entitled to adopt varying approaches to achieving the objectives of the law where the seafarer is concerned. It is argued in this thesis that seafarers are transnational workers, hence that ‘abandonment of seafarers’ is a transnational phenomenon. That in turn means that the concept should not be confined merely to current international legal definitions. From a legal point of view, abandonment is a contractual breach committed by the employer. From a moral point of view, it is the employer severing their responsibility for their employees. Although this analysis is made largely through an English law lens, legislations of different countries are also studied. The evaluation undertaken in this study proves that there is in reality only a nominal differences between the legal rules of these countries in this area. The thesis will also assert that third parties in the employer-worker relationship, the so-called ‘private actors’, also have responsibilities in preventing abandonment from occurring, or in providing assistance when abandonment does happen. These private actors are essentially those persons involved in the maritime trade network – including those having responsibility for safety, such as flag states, port states, classification societies and P&I Clubs. In this regard, it is also stressed in this thesis that substandard shipping is directly connected to abandonment of seafarers; indeed, the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Labour</b> Convention should thus be seen as an important tool to help combat substandard shipping...|$|R
