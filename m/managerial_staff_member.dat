30|$|The fifth column (model 8) of Table  4 {{examines}} possible {{heterogeneity of}} the income gap across occupational status with respect to different regions and industries. Results {{show that there is}} no heterogeneous effect from occupation on individual income across regions. In contrast, this effect varies significantly by industry. In particular, the occupational variation of individual income increases as either the proportion of female employees or the proportion of state-owned entities increases in an industry. The latter may reflect the fact that there exist huge income gaps between <b>managerial</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> and ordinary workers in state-owned enterprises.|$|R
30|$|Our {{findings}} have important {{theoretical and practical}} implications for understanding the issue of income inequality in China. This study not only provides empirical evidence supporting the idea of labor market segmentation theory, but also shows the multiplicity and complexity of labor market segmentation, which offers insights by which we can further refine the current theory. Furthermore, as shown by this study, macro structures such as region and industry characteristics are important sources of widening income inequality in China. Therefore, reducing the imbalance in regional development and limiting inter-industry income gaps are both critical to our ability to narrow the large income gaps in contemporary China. In particular, policy priority {{should be given to}} how to trim industrial monopoly given that it is the singly most important structural factor that drives income inequality across different social groups. Determining how best to eliminate the status privilege associated with administrative monopoly and to restrict the rapid increases in income for high ranking <b>managerial</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members,</b> while simultaneously raising ordinary workers’ income, should be the priority for the ongoing reform of income distribution.|$|R
5000|$|A family {{retreat from}} the city existed on the property, a massive {{shingled}} structure on Spring Valley Road. During {{the latter part of}} the nineteenth century wealthy members of the Manhattan blue book society built so many luxurious mansions in the Morristown area that it became labeled [...] "the inland Newport" [...] as recreational uses expanded to the mountainous areas (in contrast to the seaside sites to the east of Manhattan). Jessica van Beuren told her granddaughter, Liz van Beuren, that after a trip across the Hudson River, it was a four-hour carriage ride to these properties until the Vanderbilts constructed a rail line to reach the area. At that time the shingled structure in New Vernon was renovated into a brick structure that is described as one of the notable mansions of the area. It has four stories that included a basement through which a brook ran for fresh water and had household servant quarters on the fourth floor. Frederick Law Olmsted, who had created landscapes for the family residences in Manhattan, was commissioned to design the landscaping for this residence as well. Four other houses on the property served as living quarters for specialized and <b>managerial</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> for the estate, stables, and farm.|$|R

40|$|Social {{capital has}} {{increasingly}} {{been seen as}} a valuable organizational resource which enables to develop a firm's knowledge base. It comprises both the network of personal relationships and the knowledge resources that may be mobilized through that network. Social capital offers a valuable perspective for knowledge creation in construction organizations since lesser technical nature of knowledge practices in construction. Yet, the existence of enabling role of social capital in knowledge creation in construction context is relatively unexplored. Thus, the research problem is articulated for this study as: whether social capital acts as an effective enabler of knowledge creation in construction organizations in Sri Lanka? Survey research methodology was used to investigate the research problem through hypotheses. Structured questionnaire was the data collection technique of this study. Sample of 44 <b>managerial</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> related to field of construction was obtained across four large contracting organizations among Cl contractors in Sri Lankan construction industry. The phenomenon of 'social capital as an effective enabler of knowledge creation' was examined through self-administered questionnaire. Regression analysis technique was used to analyze the data. The empirical findings revealed that social capital which is manifested through structural, relational and cognitive dimensions has significant and positive influence over knowledge creation conditions of accessibility, anticipation of value, motivation and combination capability, which in turn, influences knowledge creation process in construction organizations. Thus, ability of social capital to act as an effective enabler of knowledge creation in construction organizations is confirmed. In particular, relational dimension of social capital is the strongest predictor of knowledge creation comparatively. This empirical revelation of social capital as an effective enabler of knowledge creation helps to make more credible decisions to support and develop social capital within construction organizations, to improve innovative potential and competitive advantage. Careful attention should be paid to nurture social capital especially, relational dimension within construction organizations. Further, strong empirical support is found for the theoretical phenomenon of 'social capital as an important vehicle and enabler of knowledge creation in organizations’ particularly, in construction context...|$|R

A <b>member</b> of the Northern Ireland Labour Party, he ran as an NILP candidate for Ards Council around 1956 in opposition to the Ulster Unionist Party. He considered football a great unifier across community divides. Despite this, some accused him of being uncharitable as in 1973 when he attempted to cancel a friendly game between the then World Champions, Brazil, and an all-Ireland select team. The game went ahead, although under the banner of southern club Shamrock Rovers F.C. rather than the original [...] "Ireland XI", resulting in the permanent exclusion of Northern Ireland's captain, Derek Dougan from the team. This accusation ignores the fact of Dougan's age and non-selection for the previous five Northern Ireland games prior to this.|$|R

The authors suggest that shifting recording logics weaken the validity of performance data.
