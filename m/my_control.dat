500|$|Even {{with his}} First Nations allies, Brock was outnumbered {{approximately}} two to one. He {{decided to use}} tricks to intimidate Hull. He dressed his militia contingent in uniforms discarded by his regulars, making it appear (at a distance) as if his force consisted entirely of British regular infantry. Brock laid siege to Fort Detroit, from established artillery positions across the river in Sandwich. Through a carefully crafted series of marches, he gave the appearance of having much more numerous forces. He had Tecumseh's forces cross {{in front of the}} fort several times (doubling back under cover), intimidating Hull with the show of a large, raucous, barely controlled group of First Nations warriors. Finally, he sent Hull a letter demanding his surrender, in which he stated, in part, [...] "It is far from my inclination to join in a war of extermination, but you must be aware that the numerous body of Indians who have attached themselves to my troops will be beyond <b>my</b> <b>control</b> the moment the contest commences." [...] Brock hammered the fort with cannon fire. On 16 August, the day after receiving Brock's letter, Hull surrendered. Hull, elderly and without recent military experience, was terrified that the civilian population of the fort, including his own daughter and grandson, would face torture {{at the hands of the}} First Nations.|$|E
500|$|At 21:30 on 12 September, the Japanese cruiser [...] {{and three}} destroyers shelled the Lunga {{perimeter}} for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight. Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge. Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion—led by Major Yukichi Kokusho—attacked the Raider's [...] "C" [...] company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning {{at least one}} platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. Kokusho's unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night. Kawaguchi, who was having trouble locating where he was {{in relation to the}} U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops' attacks, later complained, [...] "Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond <b>my</b> <b>control.</b> In my whole life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless." [...] Twelve U.S. Marines were killed; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.|$|E

2500|$|Gillespie has criticised {{dairy farming}} {{and the use}} of leather balls. While {{coaching}} Yorkshire, the club was sponsored by a dairy, about which Gillespie said: [...] "Yes, they are a sponsor but it doesn't mean I agree with what they do. It's out of <b>my</b> <b>control,</b> just like the fact that cricket balls are made of leather".|$|E
2500|$|Simon Jones took 3 for 19 for the {{defending}} champions Glamorgan Dragons took on Lancashire Lightning at Old Trafford. Afterwards he said, [...] "The older I've got the easier I've found bowling. <b>My</b> <b>control</b> has got better {{over the last}} couple of years and that showed today." [...] Alex Wharf and Robert Croft also both took 2 wickets as Lancashire moved to 160 for 8 off 41.2 overs, with Hogg top-scoring with 41 not out. Rain then brought proceedings to a close.|$|E
2500|$|Pressburger began {{a career}} as a journalist. After working in Hungary and Germany he turned to screenwriting in the late 1920s, working for UFA in Berlin (having moved there in 1926). [...] The rise of the Nazis forced him to flee to Paris, where he again worked as screenwriter, and then to London. He later said, [...] " [...] worst things that {{happened}} to me were the political consequences of events beyond <b>my</b> <b>control</b> ... the best things were exactly the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|Allenby {{arrived in}} Damascus at the Hotel Victoria {{where he met}} with Prince Feisal. He told Prince Fiesal to [...] "moderate his aims and await {{decisions}} from London," [...] and explained he would control Syria but not the Lebanon which the French would control. Allenby went on, [...] "As long as military operations were in progress I explained that I was in supreme command, and that all administration must be under <b>my</b> <b>control.</b> I communicated to Sherif Feisal {{the fact that the}} French and British Governments had agreed to recognize the belligerent status of the Arab forces fighting in Palestine and Syria, as Allies against the common enemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 15, 1977, the Cubs traded Coleman to the Oakland Athletics for pitcher Jim Todd. [...] Oakland owner Charlie Finley {{released}} Coleman in the spring, {{but then}} reversed the decision after being told Coleman had a two-year contract {{that would have}} to be paid. [...] Coleman rebounded during the 1977 season with the assistance of a hypnotist. [...] In addition to the skull fracture sustained in 1971, Coleman had been hit by line drives 10 or 12 times in 1974. Chicago coaches noticed in 1976 that Coleman was recoiling immediately after throwing each pitch. [...] Coleman recalled, [...] "I went to see a Catholic priest who doubles as a hypnotist. He put me under seven times in four days. After that, I didn't have any fear of getting hit, and <b>my</b> <b>control</b> was better." ...|$|E

2500|$|On May 29, Halladay {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list with a shoulder strain. It was his first DL stint since 2009. In a press conference on June 6, Halladay stated, [...] "Ultimately, my goal is to finish my career with the Phillies and win a World Series here. Some of those things are not fully in <b>my</b> <b>control,</b> but my intent is to play here and finish my career here and be here as long as I can." [...] Halladay stated this during his press conference about his shoulder injury, which he revealed that he will sit out three more weeks, and then re-evaluate his condition. The injury would eventually be diagnosed as a strained latissimus dorsi and Halladay was hopeful {{he would be able to}} return shortly after the All-Star break in July.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of her altered looks and weight gain from her {{rheumatoid}} arthritis treatment, The New York Times published this statement in 2005, [...] "Rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much. She later said in interviews that she didn't bother correcting the rumors because people in show business hire drunks all the time, but not people who are sick." [...] Turner has had well-publicized problems with alcohol, which she used as an escape from the pain and symptoms of acute rheumatoid arthritis. Turner has admitted that because of her illness, she was in constant unbearable agony and that as a result, the people she was closest to would suffer from it, as she was constantly drinking to relieve the pain and it made her a very difficult person. A few weeks after leaving the production of the play The Graduate in November 2002, Turner was admitted into the Marworth hospital in Waverly, Pennsylvania, for the treatment of alcoholism. [...] "I have no problem with alcohol when I'm working," [...] she explained. [...] "It's when I'm home alone that I can't control my drinking...I was going toward excess. I mean, really! I think I was losing <b>my</b> <b>control</b> over it. So it pulled me back." ...|$|E
2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as {{we were on our}} way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of <b>my</b> <b>control</b> inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling because there was no way I wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had no doubt in my mind I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{show what}} was my state, {{take the case}} of the very gentleman-like man whom I {{detected}} gazing fixedly at me, or so I thought, just as I had drawn valiantly near the door. I sauntered away, but when I returned he was still there, which seemed conclusive proof that he had smoked <b>my</b> purpose. Sternly <b>controlling</b> <b>my</b> temper I bowed, and said with icy politeness, [...] "You have the advantage of me, sir." ...|$|R
