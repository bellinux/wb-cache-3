In 1925 she published Elmer Ernest Southard and His Parents: A Brain Study, following the postmortem dissections of Southard's brain {{and those of}} his parents. Canavan undertook the study to examine hereditary links in brain structure. Southard had a prominent frontal lobe, which she associated with his planning ability. Canavan noted small olfactory tracts, and said that Southard had difficulty detecting certain smells. The arteries {{at the base of}} his brain were small, but the significance of this finding was unclear.

25|$|Current {{research}} also looks at DES {{in the third}} generation. These are the grandchildren of women who were given DES during pregnancy and whose <b>mother</b> <b>or</b> <b>father</b> was therefore exposed to DES in utero. Studies of the third generation are important because DES might be associated with epigenetic changes, which involve changes to the way genes behave (not involving the DNA itself) that may be heritable {{from one generation to}} another. If epigenetic changes occur and are heritable, studies of the DES-exposed third generation have implications for the influence of environmental endocrine disruptors on human health and evolution.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} types of social category, in Judaism the mamzer status is {{hereditary}} - a child of a mamzer (whether <b>mother</b> <b>or</b> <b>father)</b> is also a mamzer. However, since these rules are regarded as applying only to Jews, and since traditional Rabbinical law regards being a Jew as something which is only maternally inheritable, {{the child of a}} male mamzer and a non-Jewish woman cannot be a mamzer. Notably, the child of a female mamzer and a non-Jewish man is an ordinary Jew, because both parents must be Jews in order for mamzer status to accrue to the child, but the child does inherit Jewish status from the mother.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of these findings is that they contradicted both the traditional pedagogic advice of limiting or avoiding bodily contact {{in an attempt to}} avoid spoiling children, and the insistence of the predominant behaviorist school of psychology that emotions were negligible. Feeding was thought {{to be the most important}} factor in the formation of a mother–child bond. Harlow concluded, however, that nursing strengthened the mother–child bond because of the intimate body contact that it provided. He described his experiments as a study of love. He also believed that contact comfort could be provided by either <b>mother</b> <b>or</b> <b>father.</b> Though widely accepted now, this idea was revolutionary at the time in provoking thoughts and values concerning the studies of love.|$|E

25|$|While {{opposed to}} {{interfaith}} marriage in principle, {{officials of the}} major Reform rabbinical organisation, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), estimated in 2012 {{that about half of}} their rabbis partake in such ceremonies. The need to cope with this phenomenon – 80% of all Reform-raised Jews in the United States wed between 2000 and 2013 were intermarried – led to the recognition of patrilineal descent: all children born to a couple in which a single member was Jewish, whether <b>mother</b> <b>or</b> <b>father,</b> was accepted as a Jew on condition that they received corresponding education and committed themselves as such. Conversely, offspring of a Jewish mother only are not accepted if they do not demonstrate affinity to the faith. A Jewish status is conferred unconditionally only on the children of two Jewish parents.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of the US report was accompanied by two speeches, one from Smith and one from Senator Isidor Rayner (Democrat, Maryland). Towards {{the end of his}} speech, Smith declared: The calamity through which we have just passed has left traces of sorrow everywhere; hearts have been broken and deep anguish unexpressed; art will typify with master hand its lavish contribution to the sea; soldiers of state and masters of trade will receive the homage which is their honest due; hills will be cleft in search of marble white enough to symbolize these heroic deeds, and, where kinship is the only tie that binds the lowly to the humble home bereft of son or <b>mother</b> <b>or</b> <b>father,</b> little groups of kinsfolk will recount, around the kitchen fire, the traits of human sympathy in those who went down with the ship.

500|$|There {{are several}} reasons why some {{families}} feel {{that it would be}} more beneficial for the father to be the primary caregiver while the mother works outside the home.

There are now financial ramifications in deciding whether the <b>mother</b> <b>or</b> <b>father</b> should become the stay-at-home parent. In cases where the woman is the higher-paid parent, it makes more economic sense for her to continue to work while the man takes on the caregiver role.

Also, the first words that infants produce are mostly single-syllabic or repeated single syllables, such as [...] "no" [...] and [...] "dada". By 12 to 18 months of age, children's vocabularies often contain words such as [...] "kitty", [...] "bottle", [...] "doll", [...] "car" [...] and [...] "eye". Children's understanding of names for objects and people usually precedes their understanding of words that describe actions and relationships.

40|$|Background: Child maltreatment is {{recognised}} as {{a significant}} health problem in developed countries. There is increasing awareness on family violence in Chile, becoming a health priority {{in the last five}} years, but there is scant information about its prevalence. Aim: Determine prevalence of child abuse, and associated factors in a population sample from Temuco, Chile. Material and methods: A standardised questionnaire was applied to a sample of 422 women at their homes. Instrument had questions about disciplinary practices by caretakers, a standardised questionnaire to assess mental health, as measures of risk and protective factors for violence Results: The prevalence of psychological aggression delivered by <b>mothers</b> <b>or</b> <b>fathers</b> was 17. 5 % and 6. 8 % respectively. The figures for corporal punishment delivered by <b>mother</b> <b>or</b> <b>fathers</b> were 42. 3 % and 17 % respectively.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the interrelationships among parental expectations, children's perceptions of parental expectations, children's attitudes toward reading, children's self-concepts as readers and children's reading comprehension. The effects of gender on these variables were also examined. Relationships among these variables provided support for parents and teachers to create positive, realistic expectations, {{in order to promote}} maximum reading comprehension. [...] Scores obtained from forty children and their parents and or guardians, on instruments measuring the above variables were correlated. As well, analysis of variance tests were performed to determine gender effects for parental expectations, on children's perceptions of parental expectations, attitudes toward reading, self-concepts as readers and reading comprehension. [...] An analysis of variance was also used to test for gender effects on children's perceptions of parental expectations, attitudes toward reading, self-concepts as readers and reading comprehension. Significant relationships were found between parental expectations and children's reading comprehension, children's perceptions of parental expectations and their self-concepts as readers as well as between children's self-concepts as readers and their reading comprehension. There were no significant relationships between a) <b>mother's</b> <b>or</b> <b>father's</b> expectations for children's reading and children's reading comprehension, b) parent's, <b>mother's</b> <b>or</b> <b>father's</b> expectations for children's reading and children's attitudes toward reading, c) parent's, <b>mother's</b> <b>or</b> <b>father's</b> expectations for children's reading and children's self-concepts as readers, or d) children's attitudes toward reading and children's reading comprehension. However, significant relationships existed between specific variables within the overall measures. Gender was found to have a significant effect only on parental expectations for children's reading comprehension and children's self-concepts as readers. Parents held higher expectations for females' reading comprehension than for males'. Fathers' expectations affected females' self-concepts as readers more than did mother's expectations. [...] Children perceived what their parents expected for them in reading. Their perceptions of parental expectations were related to their self-concepts as readers. Children's self- concepts as readers were related to their reading comprehension. Consequently, this study supports the need for parents to create positive, realistic expectations and to clearly communicate them to children...|$|R
