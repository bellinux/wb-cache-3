40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the {{synthesis}} of polypyrrole (PPy) and hybrid (Au-PPy-Au) nanowire arrays of controlled dimension by an all electrochemical template method. PPy nanowires with an average diameter of only 38 - 160 nm were obtained by electropolymerization in well-defined conditions within the pores of homemade polycarbonate membranes. Characterization by scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM) revealed that the morphology (nanotubes or nanowires) of the resulting PPy nanostructures strongly depended on the electropolymerization conditions. Possible mechanisms responsible for the growth of nanowires vs. nanotubes are discussed. We also describe here a gold electroplating strategy using a homemade cyanide-free bath that was used to prepare high-quality Au nanowires with an inner PPy nanojunction.

40|$|Using first {{principles}} calculations {{in the framework}} of Density Functional Theory, we investigated the electronic and transport properties of metal(II) -phthalocyanine (M(II) Pc) systems, both in a single molecule configuration and in a model-device geometry. In particular, using the Copper(II) - and Manganese(II) -Pc as prototypical examples, we studied how electronic correlations on the central metal-ion influence the analysis of the electronic structure of the system and we demonstrated that the choice of the exchange-correlation functional, also beyond the standard local or gradient corrected level, is of crucial importance for a correct interpretation of the data. Finally, our electronic transport simulations have shown that M(II) Pc-based devices can act selectively as molecular conductors, {{as in the case of}} Copper, or as spin valves, as in the case of Manganese, demonstrating once more the great potential of these systems for <b>molecular</b> <b>nanoelectronics</b> applications.

Therefore, fault-tolerance is crucial for the realization of practical nanoscale devices. In this paper, we investigate a fault-tolerance scheme that utilizes redundancies in the rows and columns of a nanoscale crossbar molecular switch memory array. In particular, we explore the performance tradeoffs of time delay, power, and reliability for different amounts of redund-ancies.

40|$|Well-known {{conductive}} molecular wires, like cumulene or polyyne, {{provide a}} model for interconnecting molecular electronics circuit. In the recent experiment, the appearance of carbon wire bridging two-dimensional electrodes - graphene sheets - was observed [PRL 102, 205501 (2009) ], thus demonstrating a mechanical way of producing the cumulene. In this work, we study the structure and conductance properties of the carbon wire suspended between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) of different chiralities (zigzag and armchair), and corresponding conductance variation upon stretching. We find the geometrical structure of the carbon wire bridging CNTs similar to the experimentally observed structures in the carbon wire obtained between graphene electrodes. We show a capability to modulate the conductance by changing bridging sites between the carbon wire and CNTs without breaking the wire. Observed current modulation via cumulene wire stretching/elongation together with CNT junction stability makes it a promising candidate for mechano-switching device for <b>molecular</b> <b>nanoelectronics.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>nanoelectronics</b> is {{attracting}} much attention, {{because of the}} possibility to add functionalities to silicon-based electronics by means of intrinsically nanoscale biological or organic materials. The contact point between active molecules and electrodes must present, besides nanoscale size, a very low resistance. To realize Metal-Molecule-Metal junctions it is, thus, mandatory {{to be able to}} control the formation of useful nanometric contacts. The distance between the electrodes has to be of the same size of the molecule being put in between. Nanogaps technology is a perfect fit to fulfill this requirement. In this work, nanogaps between gold electrodes have been used to develop optoelectronic devices based on photoactive proteins. Reaction Centers (RC) and Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) have been inserted in nanogaps by drop casting. Electrical characterizations of the obtained structures were performed. It has been demonstrated that these nanodevices working principle is based on charge separation and photovoltage response. The former is induced by the application of a proper voltage on the RC, while the latter comes from the activation of BR by light of appropriate wavelength...|$|E
40|$|Hole {{transfer}} processes between base pairs {{in natural}} DNA and size-expanded DNA (xDNA) are studied and compared, {{by means of}} an accurate first principles evaluation of the effective electronic couplings (also known as transfer integrals), in order to assess the effect of the base augmentation on the efficiency of charge transport through double-stranded DNA. According to our results, the size expansion increases the average electronic coupling, and thus the CT rate, with potential implications in molecular biology and in the implementation of <b>molecular</b> <b>nanoelectronics.</b> Our analysis shows that the effect of the nucleobase expansion on the chargetransfer (CT) rate is sensitive to the sequence of base pairs. Furthermore, we find that conformational variability is an important factor for the modulation of the CT rate.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the potential of}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{as the basis for}} a new nanoelectronic technology. After briefly reviewing the electronic structure and transport properties of CNTs, we discuss the fabrication of CNT field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) formed from individual single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs), SWCNT bundles, or multiwalled (MW) CNTs. The performance characteristics of the CNTFETs are discussed and compared to those of corresponding silicon devices. We show that CNTFETs are very competitive with state-of-the-art conventional devices. We also discuss the switching mechanism of CNTFETs and show that it involves the modulation by the gate field of Schottky barriers at the metal-CNT junctions. This switching mechanism can account for the observed subthreshold and vertical scaling behavior of CNTFETs, as well as their sensitivity to atmospheric oxygen. The potential for integration of CNT devices is demonstrated by fabricating a logic gate along a single nanotube molecule. Finally, we discuss our efforts to grow CNTs locally and selectively, and a method is presented for growing oriented SWCNTs without the involvement of a metal catalyst.

40|$|We report {{theoretical}} investigations on {{the role}} of interfacial bonding mechanism and its resulting structures to quantum transport in molecular wires. Two bonding mechanisms for the Au-S bond in an Au(111) / 1, 4 -benzenedithiol(BDT) /Au(111) junction were identified by ab initio calculation, confirmed by a recent experiment, which, we showed, critically control charge conduction. It was found, for Au/ BDT/Au junctions, the hydrogen atom, bound by a dative bond to the Sulfur, is energetically non-dissociative after the interface formation. The calculated conductance and junction breakdown forces of H-non-dissociative Au/BDT/Au devices are consistent with the experimental values, while the H-dissociated devices, with the interface governed by typical covalent bonding, give conductance more than an order of magnitude larger. By examining the scattering states that traverse the junctions, we have revealed that mechanical and electric properties of a junction have strong correlation with the bonding configuration. This work clearly demonstrates that the interfacial details, rather than previously believed many-body effects, is of vital importance for correctly predicting equilibrium conductance of molecular junctions; and manifests that the interfacial contact must be carefully understood for investigating quantum transport properties of <b>molecular</b> <b>nanoelectronics.</b> Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, to be appeared in Frontiers of Physics 9 (6), 780 (2014...|$|E
40|$|The atomic scale {{structures}} of the molecule-metal interfaces of single-molecule nanowires forming stable electrically conducting bridges between metal electrodes have been studied intensively {{for more than a}} decade but have remained elusive, and are still central to the field of single-molecule nanoelectronics. In this theoretical study, I show how inelastic tunneling spectroscopy experiments with the help of theory are now capable of determining the unknown bonding geometries between the molecule and electrodes, and thus resolving the long standing “contact problem" of <b>molecular</b> <b>nanoelectronics.</b> As an example I consider the propanedithiolate (PDT) molecules bridging gold nanocontacts in the recent experiment of Hihath et al. [Nano Lett. 8, 1673 (2008) ] 1. Based on ab initio density functional and semi-empirical calculations, I find the relaxed geometries and vibrational modes of extended molecules each consisting of one or two PDT molecules connecting two gold nanoclusters and calculate their elastic conductances and inelastic tunneling spectra. Comparing my results with the data of Hihath et al., I find that the most frequently realized conformation in the experiment was trans molecules top-site bonded to both electrodes. I identify the features observed in the experimental inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) of these molecules at phonon energies near 46, 40 and 42 meV and show the switching from the 42 meV vibrational mode to the 46 meV mode observed in the experiment to be due to the transition of trans molecules from top-bridge to top-site bonding geometries. I extend my study to evaluating the effect of thiol hydrogen atoms in molecular junctions and show how IETS can be used to monitor gold-thiol bond formation and the cleavage of the S-H bond during this process. For pairs of PDT molecules connecting the gold electrodes in parallel, I find total elastic conductances close to twice those of single molecules bridging the contacts with similar bonding conformations and small splittings of the vi- brational mode energies for the modes that are the most sensitive to the molecule-electrode bonding geometries. I also describe the dependence of the transport properties of alkanedithiols molecular junctions on the length of the alkane chain...|$|E
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} research network, namely CHELLnet, was founded to investigate novel research approaches to chemical cellularity and complexity. The synthesis of artificial chemical systems (not based on biological components) showing life-like behaviour represented the unifying {{target for the}} various subprojects. The BrainCHELL project (or Directed Assembly of Functional Patterns, DAFP) aimed at developing multichannel, high sensitivity, electrical testing apparatus {{for the study of}} micro-scale, network-like, assemblies of various organic and hybrid materials. A multiple microelectrode array (MMEA) specifically designed for in-plane conductivity studies was used as the physical substrate for assembly, characterization, and reconfiguration experiments. Various nanomaterials were employed as the building blocks in the assembly procedures, with a focus on nanowires: 1) molecular wires (MWs) with oligophenyleneethynylenic (OPE) backbone were produced by organic synthesis methods and used for the interfacial assembly of MWs/NPs hybrid thin films; 2) conducting polymer (CP) polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) micro- and nanowires were electrochemically generated in-situ; 3) multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) assemblies were produced both in-situ via dielectrophoretic assembly and ex-situ via interfacial assembly; 4) MWNTs/PEDOT hybrid assemblies were produced both in-situ and ex-situ; 5) MWNTs/NPs assemblies were produced ex-situ. Two multichannel systems suitable for automated low-level electrical testing (nA and pA level current measurement) have been developed and used to demonstrate anisotropic conductivity and reconfigurability in networks of organic and hybrid nanomaterials, laying the basis for further development of the system.

The paper includes the investigation results of resonance (Davydov) splitting of the methylene СН 2 group rocking vibrations in the IR absorption spectra of even homologues of crystalline dicarboxylic НООС(СН 2) nСООН acids (crystal space group P 21 /a). Temperature dependence of the Davydov splitting value for the series of rocking vibration bands of methylene groups in the spectral range 700 - 1100 cm– 1 was investigated for homologues {{with the number of}} carbon atoms n = 4 - 10 using the polarized IR spectroscopy in the wide temperature range 100 - 300 K. Interpretation of the series of rocking vibration bands of methylene groups in the IR absorption spectra of even homologues of crystalline dicarboxylic acids is performed. Based on the theoretical calculation of normal modes and the assignment of observed absorption bands to vibrations of different symmetry types it was shown, that in the spectra of the studied acids the series of rocking vibration bands may be interpreted as the vibration of (n – 2) methylene groups connected by the collective interaction, in contrast to the case of normal paraffins where all the methylene groups are involved in rocking vibrations. Dependence of the Davydov splitting value on the number of methylene groups is analyzed, and shown that this value increases proportionally to the methylene chain length...|$|R
40|$|This book is an {{introduction}} to a rapidly developing field of modern theoretical physics – the theory of quantum transport at nanoscale. The theoretical methods considered in the book are in {{the basis of our}} understanding of charge, spin and heat transport in nanostructures and nanostructured materials and are widely used in <b>nanoelectronics,</b> <b>molecular</b> electronics, spin-dependent electronics (spintronics)  and bio-electronics.

The results in this part are obtained as possible without sophisticated techniques, such as nonequilibrium Green functions, which are considered in detail in the second part.

40|$|Silicon oxide (SiO x 1 ∠ x [∠, double =] 2) {{has long}} been used and {{considered}} as a passive and insulating component {{in the construction of}} electronic devices. In contrast, here the active role of SiO x in constructing a type of resistive switching memory is studied. From electrode-independent electrical behaviors to the visualization of the conducting filament inside the SiO x matrix, the intrinsic switching picture in SiO x is gradually revealed. The thesis starts with the introduction of some similar phenomenological switching behaviors in different electronic structures (Chapter 1), and then generalizes the electrode-material-independent electrical behaviors on SiO x substrates, providing indirect evidence to the intrinsic SiO x switching (Chapter 2). From planar nanogap systems to vertical sandwiched structures, Chapter 3 further discusses the switching behaviors and properties in SiO x. By localization of the switching site, the conducting filament in SiO x is visualized under transmission electron microscope using both static and in situ imaging methods (Chapter 4).

40|$|In this paper, geometric, {{electric}} and magnetic properties of graphitic heptazine with embedded Mn atom under bi-axial tensile strain are investigated using density-functional theory with the spin polarized generalized gradient approximation and Hubbard U correction. The binding energy computed for the systems {{are found to}} uniformly decrease {{with the increase in}} small bi-axial tensile strain (0 - 5 %). The decrease of the binding energy can be related to the increase in the N–C–N bond angle within the cavity which tries to recover its sp 2 hybridized bond. The projected density of states (PDOS) of strained/unstrained systems is also computed. It is found that the covalent bonding of the 6 nitrogen atoms located {{at the edge of the}} cavity and the embedded manganese atom in CN 1 is mainly contributed by s, dzx and dz 2 of the Mn atom, as well as the sp-like orbitals of these nitrogen atoms in the majority spin state respectively. Our calculations also predict enhanced band gap (0. 67 eV at zero strain, 1. 12 eV at 4 % strain) induced by small amount of bi-axial tensile strain. The increase in band gap can be attributed to the structural distortions of the sheet caused by the symmetric deformations which lead to the backward shift in the σ-like orbitals states of the CN 1 atoms.

Given this, the overall goal {{of the project was}} to investigate the conduction physics of a variety of proposed ferrocene diode / transistor designs in order to address the fundamental question; can electron transport within nm-length scale structures be modulated in a controlled fashion? During the funded period, substantial progress towards achieving this goal was made by surmounting a number of scientific and technical obstacles. More specifically, a concise and general synthetic route to several mono- and diferrocene dithiols and monothiols was achieved that now allows for the directed and controlled assembly of a variety of metal / molecule /metal test structures for the single molecule conductance measurements and the fabrication of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au(111) that are amenable to quantitative electrochemical characterization of electron-transfer rates. Most importantly, by using an electromigrated test structure, reproducible I/V data for one of the ferrocene dithiol molecules have been collected which exhibit surprisingly high conductance. Exceptional agreement of this result with theory serves to substantiate the original hypothesis that metal-centered states within a molecular bridge can indeed serve to establish higher conductance relative to all-organic molecular bridges. Overall, the successful demonstration of the ability of ferrocene-molecular frameworks to serve as exceptional molecular conductors will {{play an important role in}} the continued evolution in design of molecular {{components for}} nanoelectronic devices, which in turn, will have a positive impact on the science and potential technologies associated with these systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{functional}} molecular unit acting as a state variable provides an attractive alternative for the next generations of nanoscale electronics. It may help overcome the limits of conventional MOSFETd due to their potential scalability, low-cost, low variability, and highly integratable characteristics {{as well as the}} capability to exploit bottom-up self-assembly processes. This bottom-up construction and the operation of nanoscale machines/devices, in which the molecular motion can be controlled to perform functions, have been studied for their functionalities. Being triggered by external stimuli such as light, electricity or chemical reagents, these devices have shown various functions including those of diodes, rectifiers, memories, resonant tunnel junctions and single settable molecular switches that can be electronically configured for logic gates. Molecule-specific electronic switching has also been reported for several of these device structures, including nanopores containing oligo(phenylene ethynylene) monolayers, and planar junctions incorporating rotaxane and catenane monolayers for the construction and operation of complex molecular machines. A specific electrically driven surface mounted molecular rotor is described in detail in this review. The rotor is comprised of a monolayer of redox-active ligated copper compounds sandwiched between a gold electrode and a highly-doped P+ Si. This electrically driven sandwich-type monolayer molecular rotor device showed an on/off ratio of approximately 10 4 , a read window of about 2. 5 V, and a retention time of greater than 10 4 s. The rotation speed of this type of molecular rotor has been reported to be in the picosecond timescale, which provides a potential of high switching speed applications. Current-voltage spectroscopy (I-V) revealed a temperature-dependent negative differential resistance (NDR) associated with the device. The analysis of the device I–V characteristics suggests the source of the observed switching effects {{to be the result of}} the redox-induced ligand rotation around the copper metal center and this attribution of switching is consistent with the observed temperature dependence of the switching behavior as well as the proposed energy diagram of the device. The observed resistance switching shows the potential for future non-volatile memories and logic devices applications.
