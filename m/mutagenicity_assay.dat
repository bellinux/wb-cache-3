The effects of eugenol in rats was investigated in the unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay with established mutagens and the Salmonella typhimurium <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>assay.</b> In addition, the effect of in vitro treatment with eugenol on benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) -induced genotoxicity in human hepatoma cell line Hep G 2 was investigated in the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay. The mutagenicity of B[a]P in the S. typhimurium <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>assay</b> was lower in liver S- 9 fractions prepared from rats treated with eugenol orally (1000 mg/kg body weight) than in liver S- 9 fractions from control rats. Incubation of liver S- 9 fractions from eugenol-treated rats with dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) had no antimutagenic effect. Eugenol did not modify UDS activity in hepatocytes isolated from rats pretreated with eugenol orally after exposure of these cells in vitro to DMBA and aflatoxin B 1. Four different treatment schemes of combinations of B[a]P and eugenol were examined in Hep G 2 cells: pre-treatment with eugenol; simultaneous treatment with eugenol and B[a]P; {{a combination of these}} (pretreatment/simultaneous treatment); and post-treatment with eugenol.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the activities of}} 168 chemicals tested in a standard transformation assay using A- 31 - 1 - 13 BALB/c- 3 T 3 cells. The data set includes 84 carcinogens, 77 noncarcinogens, and 7 research chemicals. Carcinogens included 49 mutagens and 35 nonmutagens; noncarcinogens included 24 mutagens and 53 nonmutagens. The transformation assay did not use an exogenous activation system, thus, all chemical responses depended on the inherent target cell metabolic capacity where metabolic activation was required. The upper dose limit was 100 milli-osmolar because the assay could not discriminate active and inactive chemicals tested above this concentration. Certain physicochemical properties resulted in technical problems that affected chemical biological activity. For example, chemicals that reacted with plastic were usually nonmutagenic carcinogens. Similarly, chemicals that were insoluble in medium, or bound metals, were usually nonmutagenic and nontransforming. Multifactorial data analyses revealed that the transformation assay discriminated between nonmutagenic carcinogens and noncarcinogens; it detected 64 % of the carcinogens and only 26 % of the noncarcinogens. In contrast, the transformation assay detected most mutagenic chemicals, including 94 % of the mutagenic carcinogens and 70 % of the mutagenic noncarcinogens. Thus, transformation or Salmonella typuimurium <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>assays</b> could not discriminate mutagenic carcinogens from mutagenic noncarcinogens. Data analyses also revealed that mutagenic chemicals were more cytotoxic than nonmutagenic chemicals; 88 % of the mutagens had an LD 50 5 mM. Binary data analyses of the same data set revealed that the transformation assay and rodent bioassay had a concordance of 71 %, a sensitivity for carcinogens of 80. 0 %, and a specificity for detecting noncarcinogens of 60 %. In contrast, Salmonella <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>assays</b> and rodent bioassays had a concordance of 63 %, a sensitivity of 58 %, and a specificity of 69 %. The transformation assay complemented the Salmonella mutagenesis assay {{in the identification of}} nonmutagenic carcinogens; thus, the two assays had a combined 83 % sensitivity for all carcinogens and a 75 % specificity for nonmutagenic noncarcinogens...|$|R

Wheat bran, which binds HCAs in vitro, {{as well as}} refined wheat and unrefined whole wheat, inhibited the mutagenic activities of 2 -amino- 3 - methylimidazo [4, 5 -f] quinoline (IQ), 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo[4, 5 -b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) when they were co-incubated and the supernatant (minus grain) {{was added to the}} Salmonella <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>assay.</b> The water-soluble fraction alone from refined and unrefined wheat, but not bran, also inhibited these mutagens in vitro. In vivo, AIN- 93 G diets containing refined wheat or unrefined wheat were examined for their ability to inhibit IQ-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the F 344 rat. A slight {{increase in the number of}} aberrant crypts/ACF (AC/ACF) was seen after 16 weeks in rats treated post-initiation with refined wheat (p< 0. 05), and fewer foci with 2 or 3 aberrant crypts (ACF- 2) were found in rats given unrefined whole wheat post-initiation compared with animals treated with the same diet during the initiation phase (p< 0. 05). There was no significant difference in the profile of IQ urinary metabolites or excretion of promutagens 0 - 48 hours after carcinogen dosing, and grains had no effect on hepatic cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2, aryl sulfotransferase, or N-acetyltransferase activities; however, a slightly higher UDP-glucuronosyl transferase activity was observed in rats fed unrefined wheat compared with refined wheat diets (p< 0. 05). Thus, despite their antimutagenic activities in vitro, only marginal effects were seen with refined and unrefined wheat in vivo with respect to induction of hepatic enzyme activities, carcinogen metabolism, or IQ-induced ACF in the rat colon.

In both strains, however, all the natural colors showed less than 150 of His+ revertant colonies; ultraviolet irradiation to the natural colors caused no change of the mutagenic activities of the colors...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing {{interest}} in the application of plant-derived substances in agriculture as alternatives to the use of pesticides, in order to obtain healthy crops and more environmentally sustainable crop production systems. The properties of some essential oils as natural fungicides were evaluated, to promote their use in alternative agriculture. Potentially detrimental effects caused by essential oil residues in soil were also assessed by <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>assays</b> to avoid possible adverse effects related to the use of these materials. Trials in a controlled environment were set up, using ‘Romanesco’ zucchini treated with essential oils, either exclusively or alternated with a synthetic fungicide. The treatments were applied when natural infection by Podosphaera xanthii appeared on test plants, and powdery mildew incidence and severity were assessed after six weeks. Preliminary results indicated that the alternation of natural materials with effective synthetic fungicide maintained effective disease control, and may also assist with management of pesticide resistance in P. xanthii. No relevant mutagenic effects of essential oil residues in soil were revealed, although an appropriate formulation useful under field conditions is required for effective application...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{disinfection}} {{is routinely}} {{carried out to}} prevent the spread of human pathogens present in wastewater effluents. To this aim, chemical and physical treatments are applied to the effluents before their emission in water bodies. In this study, the influence of two widely used disinfectants, peracetic acid (PAA) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), on the formation of mutagenic by-products was investigated. Wastewater samples were collected before and after disinfection, in winter and in summer, at a pilot plant installed in a municipal wastewater-treatment plant. Samples were adsorbed usingsilica C 18 cartridges and the concentrates were tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella typhimurium reversion test with strains TA 98 and TA 100. Non-concentrated water samples were tested with two plant genotoxicity assays (the Allium cepa root anaphase aberration test and the Tradescantia/micronucleus test). <b>Mutagenicity</b> <b>assays</b> in bacteria and in Tradescantia showed borderline mutagenicity in some of the wastewater samples, independent of the disinfection procedure applied. Negative results were obtained in the A. cepa anaphase aberration test. These results indicate that, in the conditions applied, wastewater disinfection with PAA and NaClO does not lead to the formation of significant amounts of genotoxic by-products...|$|R
40|$|Three {{commercial}} {{brands of}} Swedish snus (SWS), an experimental SWS, and the 2 S 3 reference moist snuff were each tested in four in vitro toxicology assays. These assays were: Salmonella reverse mutation, mouse lymphoma, in vitro micronucleus, and cytotoxicity. Water extractions {{of each of}} the 5 products were tested using several different concentrations; the experimental SWS was also extracted using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Extraction procedures were verified by nicotine determinations. Results for SWS in the <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>assays</b> were broadly negative: there were occasional positive responses, but these were effectively at the highest concentration only (concentrations well above those suggested by regulatory guidelines), and were often associated with cytotoxicity. The 2 S 3 reference was unequivocally positive in one of the three conditions of the micronucleus assay (MNA), at the highest concentration only. Positive controls produced the expected responses in each assay. The SWS data are contrasted with data reported for combusted tobacco in the form of cigarettes, where strongly positive responses have been routinely reported for mutagenicity and cytotoxicity. These negative findings in a laboratory setting concur with the large amount of epidemiological data from Sweden, data showing that SWS are associated with considerably lowe...|$|R
