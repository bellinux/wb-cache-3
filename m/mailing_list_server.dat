5000|$|A web-based {{interface}} {{is often}} available {{to allow people}} to subscribe, unsubscribe, and change their preferences. However, <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> <b>servers</b> existed long before the World Wide Web, so most also accept commands over email to a special email address. This allows subscribers (or those who want to be subscribers) to perform such tasks as subscribing and unsubscribing, temporarily halting the sending of messages to them, or changing available preferences - all via email. The common format for sending these commands is to send an email that contains simply, the command followed by the name of the electronic <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> the command pertains to.

25|$|Spamming remains {{economically}} viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond {{the management of}} their <b>mailing</b> <b>lists,</b> <b>servers,</b> infrastructures, IP ranges, and domain names, {{and it is difficult}} to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. Because the barrier to entry is so low, spammers are numerous, and the volume of unsolicited mail has become very high. In the year 2011, the estimated figure for spam messages is around seven trillion. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by Internet service providers, which have been forced to add extra capacity to cope with the deluge. Spamming has been the subject of legislation in many jurisdictions.|$|R

40|$|As the Internet {{has become}} widely {{accessible}} <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> <b>servers</b> {{are being used}} increasingly to support collaborative discourse in scholarly communities.

However, new members joining the discourse of an established group may have difficulty calibrating their constructs {{with those of the}} existing members, particularly since the disciplinary background of members may not be evident and may vary widely. Major misunderstandings can arise because members use the same term with different technical meanings, or use different terms for the same construct. This article provides a framework for modeling the conceptual structures of members in an Internet community and describes web-based tools that can be used by members to develop models of the social practices of other users in the community and to calibrate their own use of terminology and constructs against those of others.

40|$|Overview: Virtual Organizations use various {{tools to}} collaborate: web portals, <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> or chat <b>servers.</b> Each tool {{requires}} {{information about the}} members of the VO and how they are grouped together; this information is duplicated for each tool wasting effort and introducing inconstancies. We have developed a solution that allows an array of collaborative tools to use automatically the information stored in VOMS, simplifying the configuration and maximizing the collaboration within the VO. Analysis: Virtual Organizations use a wide variety of different tools to collaborate. Many are standard services like web portals, <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> and chat <b>servers.</b> Information about authorized users including how they are grouped is duplicated in the configuration of each service. This is inefficient and error-prone. Our goal was to use the information in the VOMS server as a central database for configuring a number of different collaborative services, ideally making no modifications to the collaborative services themselves. Most services nowadays can use an LDAP server as a source of user and group information. Consequently, we have chosen to extract the information from the VOMS server and to populate an LDAP server with it. The other services then use the LDAP server for their configuration. The system regularly retrieves information from the VOMS server and updates the LDAP server. Each collaborative tool uses the LDAP server as the unique, centralized user database. Impact: Such a database ensures that the configuration is current and consistent, allowing the VO manager to update information in a single location. This system has been tested with the vo. grif. fr VO. It works. The system we have developed currently configures the following services: apache, openfire, mailman. Apache covers a large range of tools that need to authenticate users on their web interface. Each tool using apache shares the same users and groups information thanks to the new LDAP directory where users are mapped. The same is done for chat and <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> <b>servers.</b> The code itself consists of a small number of scripts and will be easy to maintain. It is also easy to extend to other services. Conclusions: Such a system simplifies collaboration within a VO. It reduces maintenance work of the managers thanks {{to the development of a}} solution to share the same information source by each collaborative tools of the VO. This system is easily extended to other services. Indeed, a lot of services can use LDAP as a centralized database and so expand communication channels for VOs. In the future, we will propose a standard "machine" that includes both the collaboration tools and VOMS server...|$|R

Copyright Notice Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2001). All Rights Reserved. Software that handles electronic <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> messages (<b>servers</b> and user agents) needs a way to reliably identify messages that belong to a particular <b>mailing</b> <b>list.</b> With the advent of list management headers, it has become even more important to provide a unique identifier for a <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> regardless of the particular host {{that serves as the}} list processor at any given time. The List-Id header provides a standard location for such an identifier. In addition, a namespace for list identifiers based on fully qualified domain names is described. This namespace is intended to guarantee uniqueness for list owners who require it, while allowing for a less rigorous namespace for experimental and personal use. By including the List-Id field, <b>list</b> <b>servers</b> can make it easier for mail clients to provide automated tools for users to perform list functions. The list identifier can serve as a key to make many automated processing tasks easier, and hence more widely available. 1...|$|R

40|$|Software {{peer review}} has been {{considered}} {{the basis of an}} effective procedure for examining software artifacts, identifying defects and increasing the efficiency of software firms for decades. The process of peer reviewing allows reviewers to check their co-worker's work, which helps in determining if a standard for a system has been maintained or achieved by the person whose work is being reviewed. The result of this process is a high quality working product that will likely reduce further maintenance effort. There is a large number of code review tools available in the market as of today, which assist in the reviewing task. All these tools are centralized, with the reviews and discussions being stored either on a <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> or a <b>server.</b> In contrast, the code that makes up a software system is increasingly being stored in a distributed version control system (e. g. Git). In an effort to determine if distributed peer review is a tenable idea, we develop a peer review tool, git-reviewed, which replicates the working model of Git by incorporating reviews into the current Git architecture. git-reviewed is a lightweight and a truly distributed peer review tool, which eliminates a centralized <b>server</b> or a <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> to store the review discussions. We model our use case based on the Linux kernel, which is a large open source project. git-reviewed has been designed to keep the current development and reviewing practices followed by the Linux kernel developers within the open source environment intact. We also provide better traceability by linking the review discussions on the <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> and the changes made in the Git repository. git-reviewed was evaluated by software developers working on large open source projects, (e. g. Linux, PostgreSQL, Git), whose feedback helped us improve our tool and determine if distributed reviewing works in practice...|$|R
