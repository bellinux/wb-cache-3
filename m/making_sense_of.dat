25|$|The quantum {{revolution}} of the mid-1920s occurred {{under the direction of}} both Einstein and Bohr, and their post-revolutionary debates were about <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the change.

25|$|In 1974, Tamiaki Yoneya {{discovered}} {{that all the}} known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct Ward identities to be a graviton.

They reintroduced Kaluza–Klein theory as a way of <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the extra dimensions. At the same time, quantum chromodynamics was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the dustbin of history.|$|E

25|$|In vertebrates, {{the nervous}} system can be split into two parts, {{the central nervous system}} (brain and spinal cord), and the {{peripheral}} nervous system. In many species — including all vertebrates — {{the nervous system}} is the most complex organ system in the body, with most of the complexity residing in the brain. The human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses; it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures, connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun to be unraveled. The majority of the approximately 20,000–25,000 genes belonging to the human genome are expressed specifically in the brain. Due to the plasticity of the human brain, the structure of its synapses and their resulting functions change throughout life. Thus the challenge of <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> all this complexity is formidable.|$|E
25|$|PDZ domains {{are found}} in many {{different}} contexts and diverse proteins, but all assist in localization of cellular elements. PDZ domains are primarily involved in anchoring receptor proteins to the cytoskeleton. For cells to function properly {{it is important for}} the right components—proteins and other molecules— to be in the right place at the right time. Proteins with PDZ domains are able to bind to different components to ensure that the correct arrangement is met. In the neuron, <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> neurotransmitter activity requires specific receptors to be located in the lipid membrane at the synapse. PDZ domains are crucial to this receptor localization process. Proteins with PDZ domains generally associate with both the C-terminus of the receptor and cytoskeletal elements in order to anchor the receptor to the cytoskeleton and keep it in place. Without such an interaction, receptors would diffuse out of the synapse due to the fluid nature of the lipid membrane.|$|E
25|$|Decollectivization {{increased}} the {{options available to}} individual households and made household heads increasingly responsible for the economic success of their households. In 1987, for example, it was legally possible to leave the village and move into a nearby town {{to work in a}} small factory, open a noodle stand, or set up a machine repair business. Farmers, however, still could not legally move into medium-sized or large cities. The Chinese press reported an increased appreciation in the countryside for education and an increased desire for agriculturally oriented newspapers and journals, as well as clearly written manuals on such profitable trades as rabbit-raising and beekeeping. As specialization and division of labor increased, along with increasingly visible differences in income and living standards, it became more difficult to encompass most of the rural population in a few large categories. During the early 1980s, the pace of economic and social change in rural China was rapid, and the people caught up in the change had difficulty <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the process.|$|E

His performance during the assault on Lumbier (October 1875) gained him Cruz Roja del Mérito Militar, with the second one obtained for directing artillery fire during the battle of Mañeru. Wounded in action a number of times. Following the battle of San Pedro Abanto he was nominated a captain, following the battle of Salvatierra/Agurain he rose to a , and he finished the war as a colonel. Following the Carlist defeat in 1876 he accompanied Carlos VII into exile and crossed the French border.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{consider}} García Márquez's book {{in terms}} of the historical novel, but differ over whether the label is appropriate. In his review of The General in his Labyrinth, Selden Rodman hesitated to call it a novel, since it was so heavily researched, giving Bolívar's views [...] "on everything from life and love to his chronic constipation and dislike of tobacco smoke". On the other hand, reviewer Robert Adams suggested that García Márquez had [...] "improved on history". According to critic Donald L. Shaw, The General in His Labyrinth is a [...] "New Historical Novel", a genre that he argues crosses between Boom, Post-Boom, and Postmodernist fiction in Latin American literature: [...] "New Historical Novels tend either to retell historical events from an unconventional perspective, but one which preserves their intelligibility, or to question the very possibility of <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the past at all." [...] Shaw believes that this novel belongs to the first category. García Márquez is presenting both a historical account and his own interpretation of events.|$|E
500|$|According to Andrew Kelham, Daybreaker is an [...] "urgent and resurgent" [...] record; it {{has been}} {{identified}} by critics as metalcore, progressive metal, mathcore and post-hardcore. Architects have been credited for fusing the intense technicality and metallic style of Hollow Crown with the [...] "soaring vocals" [...] and the much improved production of The Here and Now. The album is defined {{by a number of}} features, including a contrast of singing and extreme metal screaming, and melodic choruses complemented by [...] "soaring" [...] vocals, technical guitar work with palm muted breakdowns and the use of string instruments and piano to generate atmosphere. Daybreaker is noted for fusing influences from Architects' previous two albums The Here And Now and Hollow Crown; many reviewers have cited the album as a return to the band's heavier, more technical roots. When he interviewed the band, Kelham wrote, [...] "some will see Daybreaker as an apology, but it's not. Others will view it as a hasty attempt to claw back the glories of third album Hollow Crown, but it's not that either. It's a collection of songs about moving on, growing up and <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> what has come before".|$|E
500|$|Briggs and Whittington started {{experimenting with}} cladistics in 1980 to 1981 and the results, while full of uncertainties, {{convinced}} them that cladistics offered reasonable prospects of <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the Burgess Shale animals. Other fossil beds discovered since 1980 – some rather small and others rivalling the Burgess Shale – have also produced similar collections of fossils, {{and show that}} the types of animals they represent lived in seas all over the world. It appears {{that most of the}} major animal lineages had arisen before the time of the Burgess Shale, and before that of the Chengjiang and Sirius Passet lagerstätten about 15million years earlier, in which very similar fossils are found, and that the Cambrian explosion was complete by then. In the 1990s it was suggested that some Ediacaran fossils from , just {{before the start of the}} Cambrian, may have been primitive bilaterians, and one, Kimberella, may have been a primitive mollusc. By 1996, with new fossil discoveries filling in some of the gaps in the [...] "family tree", some Burgess Shale [...] "weird wonders" [...] such as Hallucinogenia and Opabinia were seen as stem members of a total group that included arthropods and some other living phyla.|$|E
