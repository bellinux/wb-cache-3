2500|$|The {{accident}} {{occurred on}} 17 August 2009 at 08:13 local time (00:13 GMT). [...] There {{was a loud}} bang from turbine 2. The turbine cover shot up and the [...] rotor then shot out of its seat. [...] After this, water spouted from the cavity of the turbine into the machinery hall. [...] As a result, the machinery hall and rooms below its level were flooded. [...] At the same time, an alarm was received at the power station's <b>main</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel,</b> and the power output fell to zero, resulting in a local blackout. The steel gates to the water intake pipes of the turbines, weighing [...] each, were closed manually by opening the valves with hydraulic jacks keeping them up between 8:35 [...] and 9:20 hours [...] (9.30 by official report).|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{association}} between the latest modern technology and robotic manipulators of older ages, has always been of interest to engineers. These machines were equipped with classical sensor devices such as absolute encoders and typical transducers like stepper and servo motors. Considering that present programming tools are very effectual and offer more user friendly interaction, the need for this association is enhanced. The aim of this research project is to present a method via which the SCORBOT ER-III robotic arm will be programmed, efficiently controlled and operated entirely by using a contemporary interface tool. For this purpose the former installed software, although still actual, is substituted by {{the latest version of}} LabVIEW program, offering additional stability and proficiency, as well as the ability of controlling and monitoring all robot functions in a more easier and flexible way. On the grounds of this project, there will be records and presentation of the control algorithms performance {{as well as of the}} robot feedback signals. Moreover, in the rest of this research paper, there will be a thorough explanation of the <b>main</b> interface <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> by demonstrating characteristic examples of operations and additionally the details of the code generation in block diagram format. ...|$|R

50|$|The 260Z {{claimed a}} few updates and {{improvements}} over the 240Z. The climate controls were more sensibly laid out {{and easier to}} work, and those cars with air conditioning now had the A/C system integrated into the <b>main</b> climate <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> There was also additional stiffness in the chassis due to a redesign of the chassis rails which were larger and extended further back than previous models. A rear sway bar was added as well. The 260Z debuted a redesigned dashboard and console, {{as well as new}} seat trim, and door panels for the interior. The tail lights were updated, moving the back up lights from the main tail light housing to the back panel. Early 1974 US 260Z models had bumpers that resembled those of the earlier 240Z, though increased slightly in size, pushed away from the body somewhat, and wearing black rubber bumper guards rather that the previous chrome bumper guards with rubber strips. These early cars still had the front turn signals located below the bumpers. Late 1974 U.S. 260Z models (often referred to as 1974.5 models) carried the heavier bumpers that would remain on the 1975-76 model years of the 280Z so as to be in compliance with United States bumper legislation in 1973. These late cars had the front turn signals relocated to the outer edges of the front grill, above the bumper.|$|R
