5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the <b>more</b> <b>it</b> snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E

5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the <b>more</b> <b>it</b> is stretched.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1350 or 1351, Ivan Shishman was {{the eldest}} son of emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371) and his second wife Sarah–Theodora, a Jew {{converted}} to the Eastern Orthodox Church. His birth brought {{up the issue of}} the succession to the Bulgarian throne. Ivan Shishman had two elder brothers by the Ivan Alexander's first wife, Theodora of Wallachia. The eldest one, Michael Asen, was proclaimed successor to the throne and co-emperor shortly after Ivan Alexander's accession to the throne. However, Michael Asen's early death in battle against the Ottomans in 1355 put forward the question of succession once <b>more.</b> <b>It</b> is likely that Sarah–Theodora pressured Ivan Alexander to select her own son as his successor, although Ivan Sratsimir would have come next under the majorat system. The issue was decided in Ivan Shishman's favour because the latter was born in the purple (after his father was crowned), thus making him eligible as successor. By the end of 1355, Ivan Shishman had been proclaimed heir to the throne and co-emperor.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} he reached his teens, Gygax had a {{voracious}} appetite for pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, he {{dropped out of high school}} in his junior year. He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From there, he commuted to a job as shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once a week or <b>more.</b> <b>It</b> was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E
5|$|Clemson {{returned}} Georgia Tech's kickoff to its 43-yard line, {{but despite}} the good field position, Clemson was unable to take advantage. On the first play of the drive, Clemson quarterback Parker threw an interception to Georgia Tech defender Dominique Reese, who went out of bounds at the Tech 45-yard line. Georgia Tech's offense returned to the field at that point and began driving down the field. In two plays, Tech passed the 50-yard line. In six <b>more,</b> <b>it</b> penetrated the Clemson 10-yard line. Once there, however, the Yellow Jackets' drive stalled. Three consecutive penalties against Georgia Tech pushed the Yellow Jackets back 20 yards, and Tech was unable to score a touchdown or gain a first down after that setback. Kicker Blair again returned to the field and scored a 49-yard field goal. With 5:35 remaining in the first half, Georgia Tech extended its lead to 13–7.|$|E

5|$|Gray {{was an avid}} reader even in his youth. He {{completed}} Clinton Grammar School {{from about}} 1823 to 1825, in those years reading many books from the nearby library at Hamilton College. In 1825 he enrolled at Fairfield Academy, switching to its Fairfield Medical College, {{also known as the}} Medical College of the Western District of Fairfield, in autumn 1826. It was during this time that Gray began to mount botanical specimens. On a trip to New York City, he attempted to meet with John Torrey to get assistance in identifying specimens, but Torrey was not home, so Gray left the specimens at Torrey's house. Torrey was so impressed with Gray's specimens that he began a correspondence with him. Gray graduated and became an M.D. in February 1831, even though he was not yet 21 years of age, which was a requirement at the time. Although Gray did open a medical office in Bridgewater, New York, where he had served an apprenticeship with Doctor John Foote Trowbridge while he was in medical school, he never truly practiced medicine as he enjoyed botany <b>more.</b> <b>It</b> was around this time that he began making explorations in New York and New Jersey. By autumn 1831 he had essentially given up his medical practice to devote more time to botany.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or <b>more,</b> <b>it</b> will count as one full term.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any <b>more...</b> <b>It</b> is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

5|$|Peaceful times {{ended in}} 1296, with the {{outbreak}} of the Wars of Scottish Independence. Dirleton, which guarded the route between Edinburgh and the English border, changed hands several times through the invasions of the English under King Edward I. During the campaign of summer 1298, the castle was besieged by English forces under Antony Bek, the Bishop of Durham. Dirleton withstood the assault for several months, until the English victory at Falkirk allowed them to bring up large siege engines, after which the castle was soon reduced. Dirleton was garrisoned by the English, but must have been retaken by the Scots before 1306, when the English commander Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke recaptured Dirleton once <b>more.</b> <b>It</b> was finally retaken by the Scots some time before 1314, and was slighted, or deliberately damaged, to prevent its reuse by the English.|$|E
