Supportive care may improve outcomes. This may include giving oral rehydration solution (slightly sweet and salty fluids), healthy food, and medications to control the fever. Antibiotics may be used if a secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia occurs. Vitamin A supplementation is also recommended in the developing world.|$|E

40|$|Two of {{the more}} {{heat-stable}} <b>measles</b> <b>vaccines</b> were field tested in Cameroon. Both maintained the minimum required infectivity titre {{and the ability to}} induce seroconversion after storage unreconstituted at 37 degrees C for 14 days. One of the vaccines, studied after reconstitution, maintained its ability to induce seroconversion after reconstitution and storage at 25 degrees C for 48 hours and at 37 degrees C for at least four hours. The increased heat stability of the studied vaccines will not eliminate the need for a well-monitored system of vaccine conservation and distribution but will ease the rigid cold-storage requirements of conventional <b>measles</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
25|$|Incomplete vaccine {{coverage}} {{increases the risk}} of disease for the entire population, including those who have been vaccinated, because it reduces herd immunity. For example, the <b>measles</b> <b>vaccine</b> is given to {{children between the ages of}} 9 and 12 months, and the short window between the disappearance of maternal antibody (before which the vaccine often fails to seroconvert) and natural infection means that vaccinated children are frequently still vulnerable. Herd immunity lessens this vulnerability if all the children are vaccinated. Increasing herd immunity during an outbreak or risk of outbreak is perhaps the most widely accepted justification for mass vaccination. Mass vaccination also helps to increase coverage rapidly, thus obtaining herd immunity, when a new vaccine is introduced.|$|E

2500|$|The term herd {{immunity}} {{was first used}} in 1923 to refer to an entire population's immunity, in reference to research examining disease mortality in mouse populations {{with varying degrees of}} immunity. Herd immunity was first recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when A. W. Hedrich published research on the epidemiology of measles in Baltimore and took notice that after many children had become immune to measles, the number of new infections temporarily decreased, including among susceptible children. In spite of this knowledge, efforts to control and eliminate measles were unsuccessful until mass vaccination using the <b>measles</b> <b>vaccine</b> began in the 1960s. Mass vaccination, discussions of disease eradication, and cost–benefit analyses of vaccination subsequently prompted more widespread use of the term {{herd immunity}}. In the 1970s, the theorem used to calculated a disease's herd immunity threshold was developed. During the smallpox eradication campaign in the 1960s and 1970s, the practice of ring vaccination, of which herd immunity is integral to, began as a way to immunize every person in a [...] "ring" [...] around an infected individual to prevent outbreaks from spreading.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} safety of <b>measles</b> and measles-mumps-rubella <b>vaccines</b> {{has been questioned}} in recent reports that propose a possible link between measles virus or <b>measles</b> <b>vaccines</b> and the occurrence of juvenile Crohn disease and autism. This article reviews the outcomes of several laboratory investigations which were carried out independently to identify {{the presence or absence}} of measles virus in the intestinal tissues derived from cases of inflammatory bowel disease. One research group reported the presence of measles virus particles and genomic RNA in inflammatory bowel disease tissues, but this could not be confirmed by other groups, despite use of techniques that are highly specific and sensitive for the detection of measles virus nucleic acid in clinical specimens down to the molecular level. Based on the published data reviewed here, it can be concluded that there is no direct association between measles virus or <b>measles</b> <b>vaccines</b> and the development of Crohn disease, a conclusion which is supported by most epidemiological findings...|$|R

2500|$|In Europe, the {{induction}} of active immunity emerged {{in an attempt}} to contain smallpox. Immunization, however, had existed in various forms for at least a thousand years. The earliest use of immunization is unknown, however, around 1000 A.D. the Chinese began practicing a form of immunization by drying and inhaling powders derived from the crusts of smallpox lesions. [...] Around the fifteenth century in India, the Ottoman Empire, and east Africa, the practice of inoculation (poking the skin with powdered material derived from smallpox crusts) became quite common. This practice was first introduced into the west in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In 1798, Edward Jenner introduced the far safer method of deliberate infection with [...] cowpox virus, (smallpox vaccine), which caused a mild infection that also induced immunity to smallpox. By 1800 the procedure was referred to as vaccination. To avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation was increasingly referred to as variolation, and it became common practice to use this term without regard for chronology. The success and general acceptance of Jenner's procedure would later drive the general nature of vaccination developed by Pasteur and others {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. In 1891, Pasteur widened the definition of vaccine in honour of Jenner and it then became essential to qualify the term, by referring to polio vaccine, <b>measles</b> <b>vaccine</b> etc.|$|E

Among the 20 females and 22 males with undetectable anti-MV antibodies {{at the time of}} immunization, females had significantly lower ADCC than males (median cytotoxicities of 1 / 100 serum dilutions = 8. 4 and 12 %, respectively; P = 0. 04).

40|$|Several viruses {{may cause}} {{more or less}} severe acute {{respiratory}} infections in man, {{some of which are}} followed by systemic infection. Only for influenza and <b>measles</b> are licensed <b>vaccines</b> available at present. The protection induced by influenza vaccines, which are based on inactivated whole virus or viral subunits, depends largely on the matching of vaccine strain and circulating virus. <b>Measles</b> <b>vaccines,</b> which are based on attenuated live virus, have been quite effective in controlling the disease in vaccinated populations in the industrialized world. In developing countries, severe measles infections occur in infants from six to nine months of age, which necessitates the vaccination of children of less than six months. At that time maternal antibodies, that may interfere with the induction of protection, may still be present. Therefore, instead of using the parenteral route, the possibility to use the mucosal route of primary immunization is also investigated for vaccination with attenuated live <b>measles</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The use of inactivated <b>measles</b> <b>vaccines</b> has resulted in a state of immunity which upon exposure to the virus may induce an atypical measles syndrome including a severe pneumonia. Measles virus proteins presented in an iscom matrix have recently been shown to induce functional B and T cell responses to both the surface glycoproteins of the virus. These responses could also be induced in the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies and they proved to be protective in several animal model systems. Many of the problems that have been encountered in the development of <b>measles</b> <b>vaccines,</b> proved to be similar in the development of vaccines against other paramyxoviruses causing acute respiratory infections in man, including respiratory syncytial virus. Parenteral application of inactivated and attenuated live vaccines against these paramyxoviruses has generally had little success. Topical application of attenuated live vaccines has been more successful, and also the use of vaccinia recombinant viruses expressing foreign paramyxoviral glycoproteins has shown promising results in laboratory animals. Live vaccines based on adenovirus types 4 and 7 in oral enteric-coated vaccines, which lead to virus replication in the intestines but not in the respiratory tract have been included in military vaccination programs. The possibility to replace e. g. the E 3 region with foreign DNA makes adenoviruses also suitable as cloning vectors for proteins of other respiratory viruses. Although live attenuated vaccines against some of the serotypes of rhinoviruses have shown promising results, the generation of a multivalent vaccine against this epidemiologically most significant cause of acute respiratory infections will be almost impossible, due to the multiplicity of serotypes involved.
