The qualitative study includes {{the identification of the}} bright spot (high-amplitude anomalies) indicating the presence of oil and gas in the reservoir zone using the maps as illustrated by the work of Shenghong et al.

50|$|<b>Map</b> <b>matching</b> is {{the problem}} of how to match {{recorded}} geographic coordinates to a logical model of the real world, typically using some form of Geographic Information System. The most common approach is to take recorded, serial location points (e.g. from GPS) and relate them to edges in an existing street graph (network), usually in a sorted list representing the travel of a user or vehicle. Matching observations to a logical model in this way has applications in satellite navigation, GPS tracking of freight, and transportation engineering.|$|E
50|$|<b>Map</b> <b>matching</b> {{algorithms}} can {{be divided}} in real-time and offline algorithms. Real-time algorithms associate the position during the recording process to the road network. Offline algorithms are used after the data is recorded and are then matched to the road network. Real-time applications can only calculate based upon the points prior to a given time (as opposed to those of a whole journey), but are intended {{to be used in}} 'live' environments. This brings a compromise of performance over accuracy. Offline applications can consider all points and so can tolerate slower performance in favour of accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Generic {{referencing}} is {{an attempt}} to attach data to any map database by discovering reference information through a form of <b>map</b> <b>matching.</b> The function-specific data items are assigned to elements, such as points, links or areas, that likely only approximate the corresponding map elements in a specific map database. A search of the map database is made for the best fit. To enhance the search process neighboring elements are strategically appended to each given element to help ensure that the correct solution is found in each case. For example, if the map element is a link connecting two intersections, then one or both cross streets could be appended {{for the sake of the}} search. Hopefully, this makes an incorrect match unlikely. Although the procedure is quite heuristic, a proposed standard called Agora outlines the strategy for choosing neighboring elements to append.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to carry out an {{inventory}} of the different hydrocarbon reservoirs and their corresponding wells in {{the east of the}} RDR Basin using seismic attributes as guide. Seismic attributes (RMS and maximum amplitudes) within the framework of this research have been used to provide good information about the mapped reservoirs, identify new areas where wells could be drilled and improve reservoir characterization. It was observed that some attribute <b>maps</b> <b>matched</b> very well with the fluid content of the wells while there was a mismatched between other attribute maps and their corresponding well fluid contents. This could be related {{to the quality of the}} seismic data, induced by the presence of some artifacts, and some reservoir properties. This analysis helped to realize that the GH and WX concessions were the best concessions in the east of the RDR Basin since most of their reservoirs, especially WX S 6.3 maximum amplitude <b>map,</b> <b>matched</b> with their well fluids contents.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} assumption underlying {{virtually all}} approaches to multi-robot exploration is prior knowledge about their relative locations. This {{is due to}} the fact that robots need to merge their maps so as to coordinate their exploration strategies. The key step in map merging is to estimate the relative locations of the individual robots. This paper presents a novel approach to multi-robot map merging under global uncertainty about the robot’s relative locations. Our approach uses an adapted version of particle filters to estimate the position of one robot in the other robot’s partial map. The risk of false-positive <b>map</b> <b>matches</b> is avoided by verifying match hypotheses using a rendezvous approach. We show how to seamlessly integrate this approach into a decision-theoretic multi-robot coordination strategy. The experiments show that our sample-based technique can reliably find good hypotheses for <b>map</b> <b>matches.</b> Furthermore, we present results obtained with two robots successfully merging their maps using the decision-theoretic rendezvous strategy. ...|$|R

5000|$|A European {{consortium}} called ActMAP (Actualize Map) is (in their words) [...] "developing standardised {{mechanisms to}} update existing map database content and enable dynamic attachment {{of information to}} the digital in-vehicle map". The ActMAP consortium comprises ERTICO (coordinator), BMW, CRF Fiat Research Centre, DaimlerChrysler, Navigon, Navteq, Tele Atlas, and Siemens VDO Automotive. They have finished most of their work and published a number of reports, which were submitted to the ISO committee TC204 WG3 for standardization. Their reports serve as {{a good starting point}} and reference for the work of this project. An important issue their reports address is dealing with the complexity of multiple map suppliers, using proprietary formats, coupled with multiple data suppliers and multiple versions of in-vehicles maps. They resolve this by using an open intermediate map format expressed with XML and based on the concepts of the ISO standard GDF 4.0. All modifications to a supplier's database are first converted to this intermediate format, stored on a server and then converted to each format used within individual vehicles. They assume that each car has a [...] "baseline" [...] map from a map supplier and that this baseline defines reference identifiers (e.g. map segment ID) for most features to be updated. For features with no reference identifier in the baseline, they propose using a [...] "generic" [...] reference that is discovered heuristically using <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> as described by a proposed standard called AGORA ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Many <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> {{algorithms}} {{have been}} developed to match GPS points to a digital map in previous studies. But the previous studies assume short polling time intervals(about 1 second) of the GPS data. And the <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> algorithms of such studies are not appropriate for the GPS data with relatively long polling time intervals(about 2 ~ 5 minutes). In this paper, we will review the previous <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> algorithms and discuss the <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> algorithms which can be used under circumstances of relatively long polling time intervals...|$|E

40|$|<b>Map</b> <b>matching</b> {{has been}} widely applied in car {{navigation}} systems as an efficient method to display the location of vehicles on maps. Various map-matching algorithms have been proposed. Inevitably, the correctness of the <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> {{is closely related to}} the accuracy of positioning sensors, such as GPS or Dead Reckoning (DR), and the complexity of the road network and map, especially in urban areas where the GPS signal may be constantly blocked by buildings and the road network is complicated. The existing <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> algorithms cannot resolve the positioning problems under all circumstances. They sometimes give the wrong position estimates of the car on road; the result is called mismatching. In order {{to improve the quality of}} <b>map</b> <b>matching,</b> a deep understand of the accuracy of sensor errors on mismatching is important.

40|$|We {{present a}} robust method for solving the <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> problem {{exploiting}} massive GPS trace data. <b>Map</b> <b>matching</b> {{is the problem}} of determining the path of a user on a map from a sequence of GPS positions of that user — what we call a trajectory. Commonly obtained from GPS devices, such trajectory data is often sparse and noisy. As a result, the accuracy of <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> is limited due to ambiguities in the possible routes consistent with trajectory samples. Our approach is based on the observation that many regu-larity patterns exist among common trajectories of human beings or vehicles as they normally move around. Among all possible connected k-segments on the road network (i. e., consecutive edges along the network whose total length is approximately k units), a typical trajectory collection only utilizes a small fraction. This motivates our data-driven <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> method, which optimizes the projected paths of the input trajectories so that the number of the k-segments being used is minimized. We present a formulation that admits efficient computation via alternating optimization. Furthermore, we have created a benchmark for evaluating the performance of our algorithm and others alike. Exper-imental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to state-of-art single trajectory <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> tech-niques. Moreover, we also show that the extracted popular k-segments can be used to process trajectories that are not present in the original trajectory set. This leads to a <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm that is as efficient as existing single tra-jectory <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> algorithms, but with much improved <b>map</b> <b>matching</b> accuracy...|$|E
