The Peruvian government turned Callao {{over to the}} United States Shipping Board (USSB) whereupon she was towed from Lima by the dredge Culebra to Balboa, Panama in October 1918 {{to be the first}} of five seized German vessels to be repaired by the Panama Canal Company's <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Division</b> correcting damage from long internment and sabotage done by their German crews. Sabotage included firing the boilers at full capacity without water in an effort to destroy them, prevented only by the superheating tubes, but still causing extensive damage, and damage to the engines. Repairs, including a completely new electrical system, were completed with the ship ready for sea on 5 April 1919. Callao transited the canal, loaded cargo at Cristobal and cleared for New York on 8 April. The USSB transferred Callao to U.S. Navy to be commissioned USS Callao (ID-4036) 26 April 1919, making two round trips to France to return personnel, whereupon she decommissioned 20 September 1919 at Norfolk, Virginia. [...] Callao, then located at New York, was offered for sale at auction 7 November 1921 by USSB.|$|E

The VFRS <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Division</b> provides both in-shop and mobile mechanical service {{for a number of}} Regional Emergency Service partners as well as a warranty repair depot for major fire service equipment suppliers and manufacturers. The <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Division</b> implemented on board GREEN generators for engines/rescues. When the fire apparatus are at idle for more than three minutes, the engine automatically shuts off and a smaller engine maintains essential systems, lighting and heat/air conditioning as required. This can be useful because upon arriving at an incident, firefighters would not want to waste precious time turning off the engine and lights.|$|E
