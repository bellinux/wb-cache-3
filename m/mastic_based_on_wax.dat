40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate rutting, fracture and thermal cracking resistance behavior of asphalt mastic containing inert and active fillers. A control neat binder (AC- 30) along with basalt (B) as an inert filler and hydrated lime (HL) as active filler were selected in this study. The asphalt mastics were prepared for different percentages of HL (5, 10, 15 and 20 %) filler, {{in such a way}} that Filler to Binder (F/B) ratio becomes 0. 8. A total of five combinations of asphalt mastic were prepared such as: AC- 30 + 80 % B + 0 % HL, AC- 30 + 75 % B + 5 %HL, AC- 30 + 70 % B + 10 %HL, AC- 30 + 65 % B + 15 %HL, and AC- 30 + 60 % B + 20 % HL. The rutting, fracture and thermal cracking resistance of asphalt mastics was evaluated using Superpave rutting factor parameter, Double Edge Notched Tension (DENT) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR), respectively. Influence of HL on the, performance of neat asphalt mastic was observed to be predominant in high-temperature range as obtained from the G*/Sin delta value. The aging resistivity of asphalt mastic increased with the inclusion of HL, indicating a better rutting performance of asphalt mastic. The intermediate-temperature performance of asphalt mastic with HL was found to be higher compared to neat asphalt mastic from Critical Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) results, implying better resistance to fracture. The addition of HL increased the low-temperature performance of asphalt mastic obtained from S(t) and m(t) values with S(t) and E(t) master curve, indicating enhanced resistance to thermal cracking. The combined effect of B and HL filler on the G*/Sin delta, CTOD, S(t), m(t) and E(t) parameters are presented in this study. In addition, ranking of asphalt <b>mastics</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> various parameters (i. e. CTOD and m(t)) is discussed in this paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Different spectroscopic {{techniques}} <b>based</b> <b>on</b> infrared and Raman {{were used}} to evaluate the natural wax and related surface quality of apple fruit. Transmission near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was applied to solutions of single wax components and extracted apple wax, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used for transmission measurements of <b>wax</b> films <b>on</b> NaCl crystals, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was used to analyze wax powders, and FT-Raman spectroscopy was explored to examine intact <b>wax</b> layers <b>on</b> whole fruit. The natural wax layers of apple fruit from a maximum of three different cultivars (Jonagold, Jonagored, and Elshof) from three picking dates (early, commercial, and late), three controlled atmosphere storage durations (0, 4, and 8 months), and three shelf life periods (0, 1, and 2 weeks) within each storage duration were examined. Canonical discriminant analysis was carried out on the first derivative NIR and FTIR spectra to describe the information contained in the spectra. Discrimination between cultivars and between storage duration <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>wax</b> layer properties was achieved with reasonable accuracy from both of the techniques. Information contained in the spectra of apples from different picking dates and shelf life periods was not significant. Differences between cultivars and storage periods in this analysis mostly related to differences in the number of aliphatic chains (e. g., alkanes and esters) and the presence of alpha-farnesene.

40|$|The {{essential}} oil of the resin of Pistacia lentiscus var.

Furthermore its chemical composition was analyzed by means of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and the possibility of using the {{essential oil}} in food preservation was discussed. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of mastic oil were estimated for 6 species of bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus), 2 species of yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zygosaccharomyces bailii) and 3 species of fungi (Penicillium roquefortii, Aspergillus flavus and Eurotium amstelodami). GC-MS analysis revealed a chemotype dominated by monoterpenes, principally alpha-pinene and beta-myrcene comprising more than 90 % of the mastic oil. Both methods showed Cl. perfringens as the most susceptible microorganism followed by S. cerevisiae and Z. bailii. With the exception of C. jejuni, Gram-positive were found to be more susceptible to the essential oil than Gram-negative microorganisms and all fungi appeared very resistant to <b>mastic</b> oil. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> the observed MICs, the contribution of mastic oil to the preservation of bakery/confectionary products at the amounts currently used for flavoring purposes is likely to be negligible...|$|R

40|$|A new {{formulation}} of aluminium phosphide {{was developed in}} Australia in the early 1990 s (Waterford et al. 1994).

The need for a controllable source of on-site phosphine has long been recognised by the Australian grain industry. Controlled delivery of phosphine to a fumigation gives many advantages.

The flow assurance in the deepwater pipelines is very important due to the precipitation of the solid phase of <b>wax</b> <b>on</b> the pipe wall creating blockages and reduces or stops production. There are several mitigation methods were used in the different oil fields around the world to reduce wax deposition such as inhibitors and thermal insulation. This work describes the underlining wax models implemented in OLGA, depending on the experimental data of this study. OLGA software was used to simulate the wax deposition process to predict the behaviour of the wax deposition. A comparison between the experimental wax thickness and the predicted wax thickness was presented. Since simulations <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the default <b>wax</b> parameters did not achieve a complete match with experiments, it was important to find out to what extent tuning of wax parameters was necessary. Three scenarios were created to match the experimental wax thickness, including studying the effect of changing wax porosity in OLGA, changing the crude oil components and the influence of simulation time <b>on</b> <b>wax</b> deposition.

A {{benchtop}} scouring {{procedure was}} used to evaluate the ability of conventional detergent scouring systems to adequately clean fleece samples from a selection of Western Australian Merino wools. Sixteen fleeces were selected from the Western Australian Department of Agriculture resource flocks, covering a wide range in yield (49. 2 to 77. 5 %), wax (7. 3 to 26. 9 %), suint (4. 9 to 11. 6 %), and dust (1. 4 to 16. 3 %) contents. Using a simple detergent-based system, 50 % of the fleeces were classified as effectively scoured, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> residual <b>wax</b> content. When scouring liquor was not refreshed between subsamples drawn from the same fleece, wool wax, staple length and dust content in the greasy fleece accounted for 93 % of the variation in the rate of residual wax increase observed in sequential 10 g samples of wool. Residual ash content also increased but the greasy fleece parameters measured were not statistically significant predictors of residual ash changes. The rate of scoured wool colour change, when sequential samples of greasy wool from the same fleece were scoured without liquor change, could be predicted from greasy fleece yields. The scouring efficiency of the more difficult to scour wools was improved by the addition of sodium carbonate to the main scouring bowls...|$|R

In this work, a new approach <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>wax</b> appearance temperature of crude oil was proposed to estimate PC-SAFT parameters in thermodynamic modeling of wax precipitation from crude oil. The proposed approach was verified using experimental data obtained in this work and also with those reported in the literature. In order to compare {{the performance of the}} PC-SAFT model with previous models, the wax precipitation experimental data were correlated using previous models such as the solid solution model and multi-solid phase model. The results showed that the PC-SAFT model can correlate more accurately the wax precipitation experimental data of crude oil than the previous models, with an absolute average deviation less than 0.4  %. Also, a series of dynamic experiments were carried out to determine the rheological behavior of waxy crude oil in the absence and presence of a flow improver such as ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymer. It was found that the apparent viscosity of waxy crude oil decreased with increasing shear rate. Also, the results showed that the performance of flow improver was dependent on its molecular weight.|$|R
