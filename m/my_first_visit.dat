25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all know {{something}} about my trip and {{the condition of the}} country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E

40|$|My {{interest}} in the subject of this thesis dates back ten years to the time when as a College and Theological Seminary Graduate I began to make <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> to the sick in the congregation of which I had become pastor. Questions began to present themselves because the average sick calling seemed so perfunctory. Was I calling just to bring greetings from the church and to show my own interest? If I had prayer with the person who was sick, what answer should I expect to my prayer? Would or should there be immediate improvement and if not, why not? Would prayer help at all in the recovery? Was prayer merely a subjective spiritual exercise and if so did it have value alike for functional and organic sickness...|$|R

2500|$|Following his Australian {{citizenship}} ceremony, Coetzee {{said that}} [...] "I did {{not so much}} leave South Africa, a country with which I retain strong emotional ties, but come to Australia. I came because {{from the time of}} <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> in 1991, I was attracted by the free and generous spirit of the people, by the beauty of the land itself and– when I first saw Adelaide– by the grace of the city that I now have the honour of calling my home." [...] When he initially moved to Australia, he had cited the South African government's lax attitude to crime in that country as a reason for the move, leading to a spat with Thabo Mbeki, who, speaking of Coetzee's novel Disgrace stated that [...] "South Africa is not only a place of rape". In 1999, the African National Congress submission to an investigation into racism in the media by the South African Human Rights Commission named Disgrace as a novel exploiting racist stereotypes. However, when Coetzee won his Nobel Prize, Mbeki congratulated him [...] "on behalf of the South African nation and indeed the continent of Africa".|$|E
40|$|In this seminar, I {{would like}} to briefly illustrate, also using some images, the study I am working on in Cerveno, a small valley town in the Italian Alps. This involves, as is {{customary}} in cultural and social anthropology, a phase of fieldwork, which began with <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> in March 2011 and is still in progress. This will culminate in the observation of a religious representation, which I will discuss later, on May 20, 2012. My fieldwork also involved {{an exploration of the}} local civil and religious archives, which was obviously crucial in understanding the phenomenon being studied, as well as raising a whole range of as yet unanswered questions for the ethnographer. There is also a phase of study linked to a precise theoretical and methodological problem, taking place in New York with the precious contribution of the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies at Columbia University...|$|R

[...] John Lennon in Anthology stated: [...] "We'd had a top 30 entry with 'Love Me Do' and we really thought we were on top of the world. Then came 'Please Please Me'—and wham! We tried to make it as simple as possible. Some of the stuff we've written in the past has been a bit way-out, but we aimed this one straight at the hit parade. … We almost abandoned it as the b-side of 'Love Me Do'. We changed our minds only because we were so tired the night we did Love Me Do. We'd been going over it a few times and when we came to the question of the flipside, we intended using 'Please Please Me'. Our recording manager, George Martin, thought our arrangement was fussy, so we tried to make it simpler. We were getting very tired, though, and we just couldn't seem to get it right. We are conscientious about our work and we don't like to rush things." ...|$|E

60|$|Old as it looks, {{all this}} portion of Warwick has overbrimmed, as it were, from the {{original}} settlement, being outside of the ancient wall. The street soon runs under an arched gateway, with a church or some other venerable structure above it, and admits us {{into the heart of}} the town. At one of <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>visits,</b> I witnessed a military display. A regiment of Warwickshire militia, probably commanded by the Earl, was going through its drill in the market-place; and on the collar of one of the officers was embroidered the Bear and Ragged Staff, which has been the cognizance of the Warwick earldom from time immemorial. The soldiers were sturdy young men, with the simple, stolid, yet kindly faces of English rustics, looking exceedingly well in a body, but slouching into a yeoman-like carriage and appearance the moment they were dismissed from drill. Squads of them were distributed everywhere about the streets, and sentinels were posted at various points; and I saw a sergeant, with a great key in his hand (big enough to have been the key of the castle's main entrance when the gate was thickest and heaviest), apparently setting a guard. Thus, centuries after feudal times are past, we find warriors still gathering under the old castle-walls, and commanded by a feudal lord, just as in the days of the King-Maker, who, no doubt, often mustered his retainers in the same market-place where I beheld this modern regiment.|$|R

40|$|Broadband {{will soon}} reach small {{communities}} in remote Australia, writes Ellie Rennie in Inside Story. But a few details {{need to be}} sorted out first… • ON one of <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> to Mungalawurru, a small Aboriginal community ninety kilometres northwest of Tennant Creek, a senior man {{asked if he could}} use our Toyota LandCruiser’s high-frequency radio. His relative was in hospital and he wanted to know how the man was faring. The extended family gathered around the car as Alyson Wright, a researcher from the Central Land Council, made contact. The doctor informed everyone that the patient was awake and recovering, but his leg had been amputated. Although I didn’t ask the cause, nearly all major amputations among Indigenous Australians (98 per cent, according to one study) are associated with diabetes. That day our radio was the only means by which the residents of Mungalawurru could contact the outside world. The one payphone in the community was out of order – a regular occurrence – and there are no home phones. A few people own mobile phones, but they must drive halfway back to Tennant Creek to make the call, along an unsealed road, to the old Warrego gold mine where you can pick up a bar or two of reception on some handsets. There was only one laptop among the twenty-two permanent residents of Mungalawurru, but it wasn’t connected to the internet… Read the full article Above: Clinton Walker (left) and Miles Lauder at Mungalawurru.

The artwork is the final presentation of projects they have produced. When <b>my</b> class <b>first</b> <b>visited</b> the charter school and saw colorful pictures of presidents with poems under them, the principal explained that the kids were interested in learning about money.

What is interesting about this approach to learning is the students told their teacher what interested them and the teacher helped guide them to answer their own questions.

Charley is such a capital fellow, so thoroughly good and hearty, and I am sure he would cut off his little finger if he thought it would give Polly pleasure. I tell her that I think she has her own way too much, more than it is good that a wife should, but Polly only laughs, and says, [...] "That her dear old bear is quite contented with his chain, but that if he were to take it into his head to growl, and pull his own way, that he would find the chain only a flimsy pretence after all." ...|$|R

Our journey led us up a winding hill through beautiful country. I sat in front with the chauffeur, but behind me my three comrades {{seemed to me to be}} all talking together. Lord John was still struggling with his buffalo story, so far as I could make out, while once again I heard, as of old, the deep rumble of Challenger and the insistent accents of Summerlee as their brains locked in high and fierce scientific debate. Suddenly Austin slanted his mahogany face toward me without taking his eyes from his steering-wheel.|$|R

Much has happened in the past twenty years in Beida and around us. I could not have dreamed in 1982 of the transformed Beida Library of today: this grand building, the elegant facilities for its special collections, the advanced equipment and services. Indeed, a rejuvenated life for this old library. Thus, the title of my speech this morning: "For as the Sun is Daily New and Old.
