5|$|Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but {{the theatre}} {{was forced to}} pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was {{organized}} by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections {{to the content of}} Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies in major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>determination,</b> but reached conflicting findings; with Thompson concluding it was a box office success and Pratt concluding it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E

25|$|Linguistic {{analysis}} is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics {{used by many}} governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim. This often {{takes the form of}} an interview by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like English. Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved. Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can {{play a critical role in}} the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.|$|E
