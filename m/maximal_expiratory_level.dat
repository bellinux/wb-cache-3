METHODS: Cross-sectional observational analytical study that enrolled 34 children divided into groups A (17 with acute leukemia in the maintenance phase of chemotherapy) and B (17 healthy children). The groups were matched for sex, age and height. Spirometry was measured using a spirometer Microloop Viasys(r) in accordance with American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society guidelines. Maximal respiratory pressures were measured with an MVD 300 digital manometer (Globalmed(r)). Maximal inspiratory pressures and <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> pressures were measured from residual volume and total lung capacity, respectively.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Meridional Hospital, Cariacica/ES, Brazil. SUBJECTS: Thirty-two obese women undergoing elective open bariatric surgery {{were randomly assigned to}} receive preoperative inspiratory muscle training (inspiratory muscle training group) or usual care (control group). MAIN MEASURES: Respiratory muscle strength (maximal static respiratory pressure - maximal inspiratory pressure and <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> pressure), lung volumes, and diaphragmatic excursion. RESULTS: After training, there was a significant increase only in the maximal inspiratory pressure in the inspiratory muscle training group. The <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> pressure, the lung volumes and the diaphragmatic excursion did not show any significant change with training. In the postoperative period there was a significant decrease in maximal inspiratory pressure in both the groups.

Methods: Eighteen healthy non-smoking subjects were exposed to NBO breathing 100 % oxygen and to breathing ambient air, both for 90 minutes on separate days and in random order. Dynamic and static lung volumes, <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow rates, distribution of ventilation including closing volume and slope of phase III of the nitrogen washout curve (Δ N 2), diffusion capacity (DLCO) and FENO were measured before and after the exposures. Results: The mean reduction in FENO was 20 % (SD= 20) after the NBO exposure (p< 0. 001). Static and dynamic lung volumes, <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow rates, DLCO and distribution of ventilation were unchanged.

40|$|Analysis of airflow in the {{terminal}} portion of the <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow volume curve has been suggested as a useful test for the early diagnosis of chronic airways obstruction. Whether such an analysis can identify early disease, and whether any subsequent action can prevent the progress of chronic airways obstruction, is unknown and will require prospective studies. As a precursor of such a study {{we have tried to}} establish the intrasubject variability of those tests of forced expiration which may be used for screening. We therefore measured expiratory flow volume curves of five healthy males and five healthy females aged 20 - 30 years as this is an age-group in which early detection of airways obstruction may be of value. Flow volume curves were obtained on the same day of the week for six weeks, and on three separate days during this period we carried out three flow volume curves every hour from 9 am to 6 pm. The data were subjected to analysis of variance to determine the variability of each measurement. Data were collected from forced expired volume in one second (FEV 1) forced vital capacity (FVC), maximum expiratory flow rates at 50 % and 75 % of expired vital capacity, and forced expiratory time (FET). The results showed no consistent pattern of diurnal variation over the working day. The variation in any subject for FEV 1 and FVC over the study period was considerably less than variations detected in the <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow rates at 50 % and 75 % of the expired vital capacity and FET. Our results suggest that the intrasubject variation found in flow rates of {{the terminal}} portion of the <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow volume curve and forced expiratory time may limit the usefulness of these tests in detecting early airways obstruction. FEV 1 and FVC are more reproducible tests and are therefore particularly suited for cross-sectional screening. The more sensitive <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow volume curve may, however, be more useful for long-term studies in individuals when the onset of disease is sought, or for short-term challenge studies requiring the most sensitive index of change in airway characteristics...|$|R
40|$|We have {{described}} impairment of the respiratory function in adult patients with childhood-onset growth hormone (GH) deficiency. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate lung volumes and respiratory muscle strength in patients diagnosed as GH deficient before and after 6 and 12 months of recombinant GH treatment. Ten adults diagnosed as GH deficient in childhood, ten adults diagnosed as GH deficient in adulthood and ten healthy subjects entered the study. For each subject, evaluation of respiratory function followed the same standard approach, consisting of respiratory muscle strength assessment, record of flow-volume curves, measurement of static lung volumes and lung diffusing capacity. Childhood-onset GH-deficient patients had a significant reduction of maximal inspiratory (p < 0. 01) and <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> (p < 0. 05) mouth pressures. Total lung capacity, vital capacity and functional residual capacity were significantly reduced compared to healthy subjects (p < 0. 05). Conversely, residual volume and diffusing lung capacity did not show any significant change. No significant change of the ratio between the percentage forced expiratory volume in 1 s and the forced vital capacity was observed. The decrease of respiratory mouth pressures was not correlated to the decrease of lung volumes. Adult-onset GH-deficient patients had only a significant reduction of <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> pressure compared to healthy subjects (p < 0. 05). After 6 months of treatment no significant differences in any of the evaluated parameters were found. After 12 months of treatment patients with childhood-onset GH deficiency show a significant improvement of lung volumes (p < 0. 01) and maximal respiratory mouth pressures (p < 0. 005), whereas adult-onset GH-deficient patients show a significant improvement of <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> pressure (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, the results of this study showed that adult patients affected with childhood-onset GH deficiency suffer from an impairment of the ventilatory function due to a reduction of lung volumes and a decrease of respiratory pressures probably due to a reduction of respiratory muscle strength. This impairment was reversed after 12 months of treatment with recombinant GH. Conversely, adult-onset GH-deficient patients had only an impairment of the <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> pressure, probably due to respiratory muscle weakness re-established after 12 months of GH therapy...|$|R

Twelve healthy young men performed five 12 -min running tests on a 400 -m track on separate days: a preliminary trial, two trials after induction of EMF, and two trials without prior muscle fatigue. Tests with and without prior EMF were performed in an alternate order, randomly starting with either type. EMF was defined as a >or= 20 % drop in <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> mouth pressure achieved during expiratory resistive breathing against 50 % <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> mouth pressure. The average distance covered in 12 min was significantly smaller during exercise with prior EMF compared to control exercise (2872 +/- 256 vs. 2957 +/- 325 m; P= 0. 002). Running speed was consistently lower (0. 13 m s(- 1)) throughout the entire 12 min of exercise with prior EMF.

OBJETIVOS: Este estudo avaliou o efeito da ventilação não invasiva com dois níveis pressóricos (BiPAP) na função pulmonar, a incidência de complicações pulmonares no pós-operatório imediato e o desenvolvimento de deiscência de anastomoses em pacientes obesos mórbidos submetidos a derivação gastrojejunal em Y-de-Roux (RYGB). MÉTODOS: Estudo analítico, ensaio clínico envolvendo pacientes submetidos à RYGB, com índice de massa corpórea (IMC) de pelo menos 35 kg/cm², randomizados para receber BiPAP (estudo) ou terapia padrão com oxigênio (controle), nas primeiras quatro horas de pós-operatório.

BACKGROUND: Morbidly obese patients {{develop more}} atelectasis during general anesthesia than non-obese ones, and these atelectasis persist for 24 {{hours after the}} end of the surgical procedure. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effect of noninvasive ventilation with two pressure levels (BiPAP) in the pulmonary function, incidence of immediate postoperative pulmonary complications and the development of anastomotic dehiscence in morbid obese patients submitted to gastrojejunal derivation in Roux-en-Y (RYGB). METHODS: It was an analytical and clinical study involving patients who were submitted to RYGB, had a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35 kg/cm², and were randomly chosen to receive BiPAP (experimental group) or standard oxygen therapy (control group), in the first four hours of the post-operation period. Patients with chronic or acute pulmonary disease were not included, and neither were the ones who needed invasive mechanical ventilation by the end of the surgery.

MIP is a measure of inspiratory muscle strength (which is representative for the function of the diaphragm), whereas MEP measures the strength of the abdominal and intercostal muscles (Barbalho-Moulim et al. 2011 a, 2013; Pazzianotto-Forti et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To develop {{statistical}} models to predict lung function and respiratory muscle strength from personal and lesion characteristics {{of individuals with}} motor complete spinal cord injury. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, multi-centre cohort study. SUBJECTS: A total of 440 individuals with traumatic, motor complete spinal cord injury, time post-injury >/= 6 months, lesion level C 4 -T 12, underwent measurements of lung function and respiratory muscle strength. METHODS: Prediction models for lung volumes and peak inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength were calculated. Using multi-level regression models, the effects of personal characteristics (gender, age, height, body mass) and lesion characteristics (time post-injury and lesion level) were determined. RESULTS: Positive predictors of lung function parameters were: male gender, younger age, greater height, greater body mass and lower lesion level. For maximal inspiratory muscle strength, male gender, younger age, greater body mass and lower lesion level were significant positive predictors, whereas for <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> muscle strength, male gender, younger age, longer time post-injury and lower lesion level were positive influencing parameters. CONCLUSION: In contrast to predictive models for able-bodied individuals, lung function parameters of persons {{with spinal cord injury}} are influenced by body mass and lesion <b>level.</b> <b>Maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> muscle strength improves with longer time post-injury...|$|R
40|$|<b>Maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow {{in chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{could be reduced}} by three different mechanisms; loss of lung elastic recoil, decreased airway conductance upstream of flow-limiting segments; and increased collapsibility of airways. We hypothesized that decreased upstream conductance would be related to inflammation and thickening of the airway walls, increased collapsibility would be related to decreased airway cartilage volume, and decreased collapsibility to inflammation and thickening of the airway walls. Lung tissue was obtained from 72 patients with different degrees of COPD, who were operated upon for a solitary peripheral lung lesion. Maximal flow-static recoil (MFSR) plots to estimate upstream resistance and airway collapsibility were derived in 59 patients from preoperatively measured <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow-volume and pressure-volume curves. In 341 transversely cut airway sections, airway size, airway wall dimensions and inflammatory changes were measured. Airflow obstruction correlated with lung elastic recoil and the MFSR estimate of airway conductance but not to airway collapsibility or to the amount of airway cartilage. The upstream conductance decreased as the inner wall became thicker. Airway collapsibility did not correlate with the amount of airway cartilage, inflammation, or airway wall thickness. We conclude that the maximal flow-static recoil model does not adequately reflect the collapsibility of the flow-limiting segment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} {{compared}} four different sites and {{conditions for the}} measurement of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> pressure (MEP) in 38 spontaneous breathing tracheotomised patients. Of the patients, 28 had {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The four different conditions were: 1) through a cuff inflated cannula (condition A); 2) through the mouth with a deflated cannula (condition B); 3) through the mouth with a phonetic uncuffed cannula (condition C); and 4) through the mouth after stoma closure (condition D). Five trials in each condition were performed using a standardised method. The measurement of both MIP and MEP differed significantly depending on the condition of measurement. MIP taken in condition A was significantly higher when compared with conditions B, C and D. MEP in condition A was significantly higher when compared with condition B and D. In condition A the highest frequency of the best measurement of MIP and MEP was observed at the fourth and fifth effort, respectively. The same results were obtained after the selection of only COPD patients. In conclusion, respiratory muscle assessment differs significantly depending on measurement condition.

40|$|ABSTRACT Ventilatory {{function}} and carbon monoxide transfer factor were studied in nine adult patients with post-tricuspid intracardiac defects and the Eisenmenger syndrome. A consistent mild defect of ventilatory function was found, with raised residual volume and closing capacity and reduction of other lung volumes and <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flows. <b>Maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow was particularly reduced at low lung volumes. One {{of the four}} subjects in whom pressure-volume studies were performed showed loss of normal elastic recoil at low lung volumes. A significant poorly ventilated space was excluded since the volume of distribution of helium during a 10 second breath-hold at full inspiration was close to plethysmographically measured total lung capacity. Carbon monoxide transfer factor, after correction for haemoglobin concentration, was 77 % of predicted normal values. Sequential assessment of carbon monoxide transfer factor might be useful in the early diagnosis of pulmonary vascular disease in infants with large intracardiac defects, since {{it is likely to}} be raised early due to high pulmonary blood flow and will fall with the development of pulmonary vascular disease. There have been few reports of the effects of hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease on ventilatory function. Furthermore, most reports have reflected a mixed population with both pre-and post-tricuspid shunts (Mcllroy and Apthorp...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of inspiratory muscle strength training in decreasing symptoms, disability or handicap of patients affected by COPD {{are not well}} established. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the efficacy of the constant use of a new flow-volumetric inspiratory exerciser, named Respivol™, in improving respiratory functional parameters in COPD patients. Twenty consecutive ambulatory patients affected by COPD were enrolled. Each patient was assessed, before and after 3 and 6 months inspiratory exercise with Respivol™, for the following clinical parameters: maximal inspiratory pressure, <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> pressure, dyspnoea grade, quality of life by a self-administered St George questionnaire and a 6 -min walking test. After a brief progressive ambulatory training programme, inspiratory exercise with Respivol™ was performed at home for 6 months. All patients used Respivol™ together with medical treatment. Maximal inspiratory pressure and <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> pressure values were significantly increased after 3 and 6 months of exercise. Dyspnoea grade was significantly reduced and the 6 -min walking test showed an increase in effort tolerance, after 6 months of home training. Quality of life assessment showed an improvement, associated with a decrease of respiratory disease symptoms. Inspiratory muscle strength training with Respivol™ seems to be efficient in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life in adults with COPD...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Respiratory muscle {{function}} {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF) has been studied by measurement of maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> pressure (PEmax), and the pressure-time index of the respiratory muscles (PTImus). The maximum rate of pressure development (MRPD) during PImax (MRPD-PImax), MRPD during PEmax (MRPD-PEmax), maximal relaxation rate (MRR) during PImax (MRR-PImax), and MRR during PEmax (MRR-PEmax) have not been studied in CF. Our aim was to study MRPD and MRR and investigate their possible appli-cation as accessory indices of respiratory muscle {{function in}} patients with CF. METHODS: FEV 1, FVC, and <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow between 25 % and 75 % of vital capacity, body mass index (BMI), upper arm muscle area, PImax, PEmax, PTImus, MRPD-PImax, MRPD-PEmax, MRR-PImax, and MRR-PEmax were assessed in 123 CF patients and in a control group of 123 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. RESULTS: MRR-PEmax was significantly increased and MRPD-PEmax was significantly decreased in the CF patients, compared to the healthy controls. In the CF patients MRR-PImax {{was significantly related to}} PTImus (P. 02), FEV 1 (P. 03), FVC (P. 001), BMI (P <. 001), and upper arm muscle area (P <. 001).

40|$|International audienceChanges in lung {{function}} {{in patients with}} chronic heart failure (CHF), usually reported at rest, may be exacerbated during exercise and induce post-exercise effects. We investigated the hypothesis that post-exercise induced changes in {{lung function}} in CHF patients are due to the consequences of left atrial overload. Twenty-one CHF patients and six healthy subjects (Ctrl) participated in this study. Transfer lung capacity for carbon monoxide (T(LCO)) and <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flows (V (max)) were measured before a maximal exercise test and 1 h, 2 h and 20 h afterwards. CHF patients were divided in two groups according to their ventilatory response to the maximal exercise test (V(E) vs. V(CO(2)) relationship slopes above or below 34, i. e., CHF> 34 and CHF 34. T(LCO) per unit volume (K(CO)) was increased 1 h post-exercise while <b>maximal</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow between 25 and 75 % of forced vital capacity was decreased 2 h and 20 h post-exercise. We observed a negative correlation between the delta T(LCO) 1 h post-exercise from rest and the delta T(LCO) 2 h post-exercise from rest. The decreases in pulmonary V(max) we observed well after exercise following increases in K(CO) in patients with high ventilatory response to exercise (CHF> 34) might indicate bronchial congestion resulting from increased left atrial pressure during exercise. We propose that endurance training should be prescribed cautiously for these patients...|$|R
