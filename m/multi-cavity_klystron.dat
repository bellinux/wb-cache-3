40|$|The MIT X-Ray Laser project, {{to produce}} output in the 0. 3 to 100 {{nanometer}} range, {{is based on}} a super-conducting 4 GeV linear accelerator, using 24 cryo-modules, each with its own RF amplifier, operating at 1. 3 GHz. The CW output of each amplifier is nominally 15 kW. Although nothing precludes consideration of any RF amplifier type, including solid-state or conventional triode or tetrode, the most appropriate technology includes the Klystron and the IOT. The mechanisms by which these devices convert DC input into RF output are discussed. The devices are then compared with regard to availability (developmental status), efficiency, means of pulse-modulation, gain, phase and amplitude stability (pushing factors), and acquisition and life-cycle costs. Figure 1 : Cross-section of typical <b>multi-cavity</b> <b>klystron.</b> The IOT, shown in figures 2 and 3, also uses a cylindrically shaped stream of magnetically-focused electrons. The input cavity, however, has a cathode where the leading-edge of a gap would be and a grid where the trailing-edge would be. The RF voltage between grid and cathode determines the amplitude of the emitted current, as in a triode. The discs of electrons are accelerated through a tailpipe by the beam voltage to an output gap and resonant cavity, like that of a Klystron, where the bunches give up their energy to the RF gap voltage. The grid has a negative DC bias, so that there is no quiescent cathode current. Current leaves the cathode only for grid voltage exceeding cutoff, having a maximum conduction angle of 180 degrees. It is already bunched...|$|E
