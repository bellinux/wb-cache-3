25|$|Despite rapidly {{increasing}} tolerance {{and acceptance of}} alternative lifestyles, Malta offers its gay and lesbian locals and visitors less nightlife options than other Southern European destinations. With the exception of several staple bars (including Tom's, Valletta and Klozett, Paceville), gay bars in Malta {{have a tendency to}} pop up, relocate, and disappear from one summer season to the next. However, the local gay population is usually very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> – and welcome – at the mainstream clubs of Paceville and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The summit area is {{extremely}} stony, striking pale rocks being <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence.</b> A {{series of steps}} rise up from Ore Gap whilst the approach from Esk Hause is rough and eroded. A small cairn on the highest craggy outcrop marks the highest point. Esk Pike's central position above Eskdale gives it glorious views of the Scafells, with the Eastern and Northern Fells also forming a fine panorama. Derwentwater and a section of Windermere complete the scene. A little to the south, Pike de Bield provides an intimate view of the upper Esk.|$|E

25|$|The Irish {{element of}} Puerto Rico is very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence.</b> Their {{contributions}} to the archipelago's agricultural industry and {{in the fields of}} politics and education are highly notable. In the city of Bayamón, there is an urbanization called Irlanda Heights (Ireland Heights). For the last several years, the town of Luquillo has hosted a day-long Saint Patrick's Day festival which includes a Desfile de San Patricio (St. Patrick's Parade) honoring Ireland's chief patron saint. There are various Irish pubs around the island which also celebrate the holiday and serve the typical green colored beer on the occasion. Among them are Shannon's Irish Pub in San Juan, and Logan's Irish Pub in Río Piedras.|$|E
25|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his political}} position through military campaigns, diplomacy, and a firm domestic administration, Suryavarman launched into {{the construction of}} Angkor Wat as his personal temple mausoleum. Breaking with {{the tradition of the}} Khmer kings, and influenced perhaps by the concurrent rise of Vaisnavism in India, he dedicated the temple to Vishnu rather than to Siva. With walls nearly half a mile long on each side, Angkor Wat grandly portrays the Hindu cosmology, with the central towers representing Mount Meru, home of the gods; the outer walls, the mountains enclosing the world; and the moat, the oceans beyond. The traditional theme of identifying the Khmer devaraja with the gods, and his residence with that of the celestials, is very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence.</b> The measurements themselves of the temple and its parts in relation to one another have cosmological significance. Suryavarman had the walls of the temple decorated with bas reliefs depicting not only scenes from mythology, but also from the life of his own imperial court. In one of the scenes, the king himself is portrayed as larger in size than his subjects, sitting cross-legged on an elevated throne and holding court, while a bevy of attendants make him comfortable with the aid of parasols and fans.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of people going to Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is still very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are not going to make it go away by themselves. Politicians past and present have been accused of short-sightedness in speculating that they would.|$|E

In the far west however, {{particularly}} in the land between the Isen and the Adorn west of the Gap of Rohan, many Rohirrim were of mixed Rohirrim and indigenous (i.e. Dunlending) ethnicity, and were thereby shorter, with darker eyes and hair <b>much</b> more <b>in</b> <b>evidence.</b> The Rohirrim were described by the Dúnedain as by nature stern, fierce and grave, yet generous.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2006 land in {{and around}} the wood has been the site of a {{proposed}} major urban extension to the Worthing suburb of West Durrington. The proposed development has prompted environmental protestors to tree-sit within the wood since May 2006. [...] Since then Worthing Borough Council has agreed to a substantial new housing development just to the east of the woods themselves, as an extension of Durrington. This includes a new school, doctors surgery and around 2000 new houses on agricultural land. Though the ancient woodland itself would not be destroyed because of this, the large increase in people will inevitably lead to the degradation of the forest due to fly-tipping and other unsavoury activities, such as drug use, which is <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> the pockets of woodland remaining in Durrington itself.|$|R
25|$|Miss Lucilla Edith Cavell Teatime is a ladylike conwoman whose {{occasional}} lapses into verbal vulgarity {{make her}} all the more endearing. She has a liking for whisky, a game of dominoes and all things tasteful. She first steps off the train in Flaxborough (a town once described as having the fictional solidarity of Arnold Bennett's Five Towns) in the fourth mystery set there, Lonelyheart 4122. She likes the town {{so much that she}} settles there, even though her attempt at swindling through a lonely-hearts bureau nearly makes her the third woman killed by another swindler. She appears in all subsequent Flaxborough novels except Blue Murder. By the eleventh volume, Plaster Sinners, she is the proprietress of the 'House of Yesteryear' in Northgate, Flaxborough, and a regular attender at local auctions. Her old talents and sleight of hand remain <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence.</b> On one occasion two glass decanters are rendered extremely cheap when she casually transfers the stoppers to a tray of miscellaneous items, which she then bids for as well. Her final appearance is in Whatever's Been Going On At Mumblesby? where we find her with an assistant called Edgar and offering opinions on the marketability of such religious relics as saints' kneecaps. In the 1977 Murder Most English BBC television series, which offered adaptations of four of Colin Watson's Flaxborough novels, Lucy Teatime was portrayed by Brenda Bruce.|$|E

500|$|In 1880 Bottomley married Eliza Norton, the {{daughter}} of a debt collector. Bottomley's biographers have tended to regard this early, unambitious marriage as a mistake on his part; she was not equipped, intellectually or socially, to help him advance in the world. In the same year, Bottomley left his job to become a full-time shorthand writer for Walpole's, a firm that provided recording and transcription services for the law courts. His competence impressed his employers sufficiently for them, in 1883, to offer him a partnership, and the firm became Walpole and Bottomley. As Bottomley emerged from adolescence to maturity he began to show signs of the characteristics that would be <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> in his later life: greed for fleshly pleasures, a thirst for fame, spontaneous generosity, combined with a charm that, according to his biographer Julian Symons, could [...] "tempt the banknotes out of men's pockets".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{software}} projects fail {{because they}} {{commit to a}} set of plans and specifications with little evidence that if these are used on the project, they will lead to a feasible system being developed within the project’s budget and schedule. An effective way to avoid this is to make the evidence of feasibility a first-class developer deliverable that is reviewed by independent experts and key decision milestones: shortfalls <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> are risks to be considered in going forward. This further implies that the developer will create and follow processes for evidence development. This paper provides processes for developing and reviewing feasibility evidence, and for using risk to determine how to proceed at major milestones.
