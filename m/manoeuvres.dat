40|$|Background: Intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> {{resulted}} in less blood loss and better preservation of liver function {{when it was}} applied for fewer than 120 minutes. The mechanism of better preservation of liver function under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> at molecular level remains unclear. Furthermore, the ultrastructural features in the liver with chronic diseases under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> have not been studied. The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate the expression of stress genes and ultrastructural change of the liver under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre.</b> Methods: From July 1995 to February 1998, 131 patients underwent hepatectomy for liver tumours (61 patients without Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> and 70 patients with intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre).</b> Twenty-five patients (15 with Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> and 10 without Pringle <b>manoeuvre)</b> were included in the study of hepatic stress gene expression during hepatectomy. Twenty-two patients (18 patients with intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> and four patients without Pringle <b>manoeuvre)</b> were randomly assigned for electron microscopic examination. Results: For the expression of stress genes, both the heat shock genes (HSP 70 A and HSC 70) and acute phase genes (TNF-α and interleukin- 6) were detected simultaneously in the patients with or without intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre.</b> The patients under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> had relatively higher mRNA levels of heat shock gene 70 family, which is related to intracellular repair and protection. Induction of TNF-α and interleukin- 6 genes, which contributed to ischaemia-reperfusion injury and postoperative complication, was not found in the patients under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre.</b> Under the electron microscopy, the hepatic ultrastructure was well maintained under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> whatever the liver status, even when the accumulated ischaemic duration was extended to 120 min. Conclusion: Intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> induced relatively higher expression of heat shock genes, which are related to intracellular homeostasis, and is consistent with the well maintenance of liver ultrastructure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Review, Admiral Graf Spee returned to Spain for a fourth non-intervention patrol. Following fleet <b>manoeuvres</b> and a brief visit to Sweden, the ship conducted a fifth and final patrol in February 1938. In 1938, KzS Hans Langsdorff took command of the vessel; she conducted a series of goodwill visits to various foreign ports throughout the year. These included cruises into the Atlantic, where she stopped in Tangier and Vigo. She also participated in extensive fleet <b>manoeuvres</b> in German waters. She was part of the celebrations for the reintegration of the port of Memel into Germany, and a fleet review in honour of Admiral Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. Between 18 April and 17 May 1939, she conducted another cruise into the Atlantic, stopping in the ports of Ceuta and Lisbon. On 21 August 1939, Admiral Graf Spee departed Wilhelmshaven, bound for the South Atlantic.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a new technical variant applied to the Gufoni's <b>manoeuvre,</b> in the treatment of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (HSC-BPPV). 87 patients with BPPV of HSC (55 women and 32 men), aged between 21 and 80 years, were randomized either to modified Gufoni's <b>manoeuvre</b> or to the Gufoni's <b>manoeuvre.</b> 93 % of patients treated with modified Gufoni's <b>manoeuvre</b> was cured after the first treatment session, of which only 2 % had a conversion into PSC-BPPV, while the Gufoni's <b>manoeuvre</b> led to a symptoms resolution in 88 % of cases, of which 16 % had a conversion into PSC-BPPV.

40|$|This thesis will {{determine}} {{the degree to which}} contemporary <b>Manoeuvre</b> Warfare theory is appropriate at the tactical level of war. In order to arrive at a basic working definition of <b>Manoeuvre</b> Warfare, it will draw mainly on material from the US Marine Corps. Contemporary military doctrine acknowledges the existence of three levels of war, the strategic, operational, and tactical. This was not always the case, as the operational level is a very new construct. <b>Manoeuvre</b> Warfare emerged {{as a response to the}} need to link the tactical and strategic levels that resulted in the inception of the operational level. While conceived at the operational level, <b>Manoeuvre</b> Warfare has been applied to all three levels of war. This thesis examines the context of <b>Manoeuvre</b> Warfare, and looks at how the US Marine Corps defines this doctrine. It then defines the three levels of war and looks at the main examples used to support <b>manoeuvre</b> theory before investigating the application of <b>manoeuvre</b> theory at the tactical level of war.

40|$|Labour {{influences}} the liveability of organic sheep farms and {{the sustainability of}} this activity on rural areas. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse work flexibility of organic suckler sheep farms using the criterion 'room for <b>manoeuvre</b> in time'. A survey about work organisation was conducted on 14 organic sheep farms in the central region of France to quantify work durations and tasks carried out by different categories of workers in order to calculate the room for <b>manoeuvre</b> in time. Statistical analysis was performed to analyse variability in room for <b>manoeuvre.</b> A cluster analysis conducted on four variables describing room for <b>manoeuvre</b> in time over the year classified the farms into three groups. The results show that the room for <b>manoeuvre</b> in time per person displayed a broad variability according to the farms (396 to 1, 199 h per year). The amount of routine work per person of the basic group was one factor explaining the differences. Results show different ways to obtain room for <b>manoeuvre</b> in time and its temporal distribution over the year, among organic suckler sheep farms. Three repartitions were identified. Group 1 was characterised by a low room for <b>manoeuvre</b> in winter, corresponding to the period of lambing in the sheep barn. The high routine workload was carried out self-sufficiently by the basic group. Group 2 had a high room for <b>manoeuvre</b> over the year. The farmers delegated a part of the routine work during holidays. Group 3 had a low room for <b>manoeuvre</b> over the year. These farms had lambings throughout the year due to several different lambing periods. Their low room for <b>manoeuvre</b> was also explained by a farmer's dual jobholding or by diversification of farm activities (slaughter, direct sales).
