The present work involves experimental study of thermo-acoustic instabilities occurring in a Rijke tube and their suppression by means of diverting a very small fraction of the incoming air flow in the form of radial injection from the wall of the tube through <b>micro</b> <b>jets.</b> A horizontal quartz tube with pre-mixed burner is used as the test model of Rijke tube.

Experiments were carried out at the equivalence ratio of phi = 1 for a range of the burner position inside the tube, velocity of <b>micro</b> <b>jets,</b> and total mass flow rate through the tube. The control technique of <b>micro</b> <b>jets</b> was found to completely suppress the thermo-acoustics in a range of jet velocity depending on the burner position and the total air mass flow rate. For complete suppression of the thermos-acoustics, the phase difference between the pressure and chemiluminescence waves was found to significantly increase and the RI was found to reduce to nearly zero. In such case, the flame luminescence was observed to significantly reduce.

40|$|The {{formation}} of stars begins with {{collapse of a}} dense interstellar cloud core to a protostar surrounded by an accretion disk. Materials in the core falls inwards to feed further growth of the protostar through the disk. At certain point during the accretion phase, a jet of gas is generated by the forming protostar along the disk 2 ̆ 7 s rotation axis. Subsequently, protostellar jet drives molecular outflow, and which will destroy the core and will terminate the mass accretion. Such evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs) had been classified into three categories, Class I, II, and III, based on the slope of their infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). Recently, the new fourth class "Class 0 " has been suggested for the youngest protostellar objects which have not been detected in the near-infrared and which display an SED with a peak in the submillimeter wavelength. The jet and outflow are an ubiquitous phenomenon in YSOs ranging from "Class O" to "Class I" sources. Despite the substantial observational progress, it is still uncertain when the jets are ejected during the accretion phase because most of Class 0 sources already posses jets and outflows. The Class 0 source, S 106 FIR (d = 600 pc) is a good candidate to investigate star formation process at an extremely early stage before {{formation of}} outflow. This is because this source {{is known to be}} associated with no extensive molecular outflows, making it unique among all 40 known Class 0 sources. First, we conducted aperture synthesis observations of H 20 maser emission at 22 GHz toward S 106 FIR using the Very Large Array (VLA) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) at 60 mas (milli-arcsecond) resolution on two epochs separated by ～ 3 months. Two compact clusters of the maser spots separated by ～ 50 AU were found {{in the center of the}} submillimeter core of S 106 FIR. The western cluster, which has three maser components, was blueshifted and the eastern cluster, which has a single component, was redshifted with respect to the ambient cloud velocity. Each component was composed of a few spatially localized maser spots and was aligned on a line connecting the two clusters. We found relative proper motions of the components with 〓 30 mas year- 1 along the line. In addition, a series of single-dish observations show that the maser components drifted with an accelerations of ～ 1 km s- 1 year- 1. We conclude that the masers are excited by a 10 AU-scale jetlike accelerating flow ejected from an assumed protostar located between the two clusters. Second, we made the higher resolution observations to reveal the detailed structure of the jetlike flow and to track its motion using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) of the NRAO on four epochs separated by ～ 1 month. The attained angular resolution of ～ 0. 5 mas corresponds to 0. 3 AU. The observations have revealed the presence of a U-shaped distribution of the masers in the western blueshifted cluster, which has a length of 4 AU and a width of 3 AU. Three-dimensional velocity of the U-shape structure was analyzed using the transverse velocities of the masers and line-of-sight velocities. Since the masers are thought to be excited in a "micro bowshock" behind the head of the jetlike flow drilling the ambient cloud medium, we call the jetlike flow as a "micro jet 2 ̆ 7. The U-shaped structure suggests that the micro bowshock does not comprise of interior knots but lies at the head of the <b>Micro</b> <b>jet.</b> The presence of the <b>Micro</b> <b>jet</b> and the absence of extensive molecular outflows together with the cold SED argue that S 106 FIR is an object in the earliest stages of star formation just after the onset of the protostellar jet. In order to investigate the youth of S 106 FIR, we have made deep outflow search by 12 CO (1 - 0) emission using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA), and by the (3 - 2) and (2 - 1) transitions of the molecule using the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory 10. 4 m telescope. We could not identify any evidence for the presence of the molecular outflow driven by the <b>Micro</b> <b>jet.</b> Our attained 10 σ sensitivities are of orders of 10 - 7 M〓 per km s- 1 for the (1 - 0), (2 -l), and (3 - 2) transitions: these sensitivities would have detected any of the CO outflows associated with Class 0 sources. This negative detection suggest that S 106 FIR is too young to sweep up the ambient cloud medium to form the molecular outflow. We discussed its age to be 〓 0. 5 - 1. 0 x 10 3 years from an upper limit of dynamical time scale of outflow, and from the number ratio of sources without and with outflow in Class 0 sources and the lifetime of "Class 0 ". We conclude from these observations that S 106 FIR has not swept up enough ambient gas to generate a large scale molecular outflow. With the original definition, S 106 FIR is certainly categorized into "Class 0 ". However, S 106 FIR is obviously different from the other Class 0 sources in the sense that it has not yet generated a large scale molecular outflows. This fact might mean that the SED classification scheme is inadequate to describe in detail the evolutionary stages, which might be regulated by jets and outflows. In this sense, S 106 FIR is the prototype of the earliest stage, which is characterized by the lack of an extensive molecular outflow, the presence of a <b>Micro</b> <b>jet</b> and a cold SED. Identifying similar protostars and studying their physical properties will be of great importance towards understanding the evolution from cloud cores to protostars.

The area ratio (i. e. ratio between cross sectional area of the sudden expansion duct and the nozzle exit area) and the length-todiameter ratio of the duct are the geometrical parameters considered. The jet Mach numbers at the entry to the suddenly expanded duct, studied are 1. 87, 2. 2 and 2. 58. The nozzle pressure ratio (NPR) used is from 3 to 11, in steps of 2 and experiments are conducted for NPR 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 for all the Mach numbers. The area ratio {{of the present study}} is 4. 84. The L/D ratio of the duct is varied from 10 to 1. Active control in the form of four <b>micro</b> <b>jets</b> of 1 mm orifice diameter located at 90 0 intervals along a pitch circle diameter of 1. 3 times the nozzle exit diameter in the base region are employed. In addition to base pressure, wall pressure field along the duct is also studied. From the present studies it is found that for the given area ratio the base pressure increase with Mach number. When the flow is over expanded the base pressure assumes very high value due the presence of oblique shock at the nozzle lip. It is also found from wall pressure studies that the <b>micro</b> <b>jets</b> do not disturb the flow field in the enlarged duct...|$|R
40|$|Spectroscopies using soft X ray photons allow {{probing the}} valence and the unoccupied {{molecular}} orbitals of light elements e. g., carbon, nitrogen, oxygen through the K edge and of heavier elements like transition metals e. g., iron, cobalt, nickel through the L edge. As {{part of this}} thesis the first membrane free synchrotron based soft X ray absorption XA and high resolution X ray emission XE spectrometer was built for the investigation liquid samples delivered by a liquid <b>micro</b> <b>jet.</b> The Rowland circle based spectrometer can cover an emission energy range from 20 eV to 1000 eV. The first proof of principle spectra were obtained from pure water and aqueous Ni 2 ions. Hydrogen bonding in liquid water was systematically studied by varying the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule upon dilution in organic solvents. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, evidence was provided for the mixing ratio required for obtaining isolated water molecules in different oxygen free solvents. This information {{was used for the}} further X ray studies, where acetonitrile was selected as solvent, since it is a pure hydrogen bond acceptor and completely mixable with water. Oxygen K edge XA and XE spectra of water acetonitrile mixtures were obtained from a <b>micro</b> <b>jet.</b> The XA spectrum of pure liquid water shows the characteristic pre, main and post edge structure. Upon decreasing water concentration a strong relative increase and sharpening of the pre and main edge features is found. For the XE spectra of pure liquid water a vivid debate prevails concerning the physical origin of an additional spectral feature, which is not observed in the gas phase. Upon decreasing the water concentration, a relative attenuation of this additional feature is observed. The XA and XE spectral changes can be unambiguously related to the increasing amount of broken hydrogen bonds, and the hydrogen bond network of liquid water can thus be addressed on purely experimental grounds. The effect of nuclear dynamics on the absorption and emission spectra of the water acetonitrile mixtures was investigated by substituting H 2 O with D 2 O. It has a clearly distinguishable spectral fingerprint compared to the effect of hydrogen bonding. The special role of water in ionic solutions was investigated by studies of sodium ions dissolved in water, alcohol, and the respective mixed solvents. X ray absorption spectroscopy on the Na K edge revealed a shared solvation of the sodium ions in the mixed solvents. Specifically the water component is found to {{play a key role in}} stabilizing the solvation shell in these mixed solvent...|$|E
30|$|CE was {{produced}} under the alternating stress caused by bubble generation and collapsed during ultrasonication. At the initial stage, stress concentrated at the pores and defects of the coating would accelerate the plastic deformation {{of the material}} in the vicinity. Due to the different crystal structure between WC hard phase and CoCr binding phase, deformation was not coordinated at the interface, which generated the local high stress field, and dislocation stress was accumulated at the grain boundary [27, 28]. When the cumulative stress reached the threshold, intergranular microcracks would generate and subsequently extended under repeated cycle of alternating stress, resulting {{in the formation of}} cavitation source. The cavitation source further developed along some preferable angles inside the coating [29, 30]. The formation rate of the cavitation source of the CC coating was higher at the initial stage in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution due to its higher porosity, lower fracture toughness, and electrochemical performance. Under the stress caused by bubble collapse and the repeated impacts of <b>micro</b> <b>jet</b> along with the Cl– penetration in the solution, the further extension of cavitation cracks directly lead to the interlamination detachment and WC particles exfoliation, causing the formation of the large-scale CE. On the other hand, the low porosity of MC coating significantly reduced the amount of CE sources and its high hardness and toughness can effectively obstruct the extension of the CE cracks, which enables micro-nano WC- 10 Co 4 Cr coating to possess excellent CE resistance in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution.|$|E
40|$|Bio-inspired {{studies of}} {{micro-objects}} in microfluidics demand quantitative microflow visualization tools {{to evaluate their}} three-dimensional (3 D) fluid dynamic performance. Experimental fluid dynamic measurements of bio-hybrid systems are employed when non-traditional small-scales, magnetohydrodynamic coupling and nonlinear material properties are involved. In this study a stereoscopic micro- Particle Image Velocimetry(μPIV) system was developed to characterize instantaneous flow fields induced by (1) a micro-robot (280 × 200 × 150 μm 3) and (2) self-assembled magnetically actuated artificial cilia (∼ 50 μm in diameter and 500 μm in depth). A custom built <b>micro</b> <b>jet</b> flow microchannel was tested to provide the quantitative evidence of measurement accuracy with 14 % error compared to theoretical solutions in the out-of-plane velocity component. Followed by these verification experiments, instantaneous in-plane spinning motion was analyzed in conjunction with translational movement and out-of-plane rotational movements of the micro-robot to obtain the induced 2 D- 3 C (two-dimension, three-component) fluid velocity data. The second test case investigated the microscale vortical flow structures that were generated by self-assembled magnetically driven artificial cilia. The strength of this 3 D micro vortex structure was computed based on the 3 D flow measurements. In combination with the asymmetric cyclic motion of the magnetically actuated artificial cilia, {{it is expected that}} these structures can generate transverse flow efficiently in 3 D, and thus provide a potential alternative for mixing in low Reynolds number flows, analogous to a micromixer. The acquired 3 D microflow field, along with the validation tests, further extends the capability of using stereoscopic μPIV technique to evaluate the performance of noninvasive microflow manipulators...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} results of {{experimental}} studies conducted {{to study the}} development of flow from a convergent nozzle in to a suddenly expanded duct and also to quantify the effect of <b>micro</b> <b>jets,</b> on the duct flow field presented. The parameters considered in the present studies are the length to diameter ratio, Mach number and area ratio. The Mach numbers considered are 0. 6, 0. 8 and 0. 9, respectively. The area ratio (ratio of area of suddenly expanded duct to nozzle exit area) studied is 3. 24. The length-to-diameter (L/D) ratio of the sudden expansion duct was varied from 10 to 1. To quantify the quality of flow in the enlarged duct wall pressure was measured and {{it is found that}} the flow field remains the same with and without control. However, oscillations are observed for L/Ds = 10, 8, 6, and 5 for all the Mach numbers which has shown that even for correctly expanded flow the flow is wave dominated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAssembling {{of various}} parts and {{subassembly}} needs the closer {{attention on the}} geometrical accuracy of the part apart from the dimensional tolerances. Micro holes machined through <b>micro</b> abrasive <b>jet</b> machining are tapered, resulting in poor cylindricity. Cylindricity of the machined micro holes can be improved by reducing the taper angle of the hole. This paper presents a novel approach for machining holes on brittle material-quartz, using the in-house developed <b>micro</b> abrasive <b>jet</b> machine, wherein the nozzle is given a feed rate equal to the average rate of change of the workpiece thickness. The experiments are conducted to study {{the effect of this}} novel approach to the shape of the machined hole by measuring the entrance diameter and exit diameter and hence calculated the taper angle. The obtained experimental results reveals that the taper angle of the machined hole is reduced by approximately 58 % using this novel approach and hence achieved the improvement in cylindricity of the machined holes...|$|R

The fluid is treated as potential flow and Boundary Integral Equation Method is used to solve Laplace’s equation for velocity potential. Different ratios of the diameter of the rigid cylinder to the maximum radius of the bubble are considered. Results show that during the collapse phase of the bubble inside a vertical rigid cylinder, two liquid <b>micro</b> <b>jets</b> are developed on the top and bottom sides of the vapour bubble and are directed inward. It is found that by increasing the ratio of the cylinder diameter to the maximum radius of the bubble, the rate of the growth and collapse phases of the bubble increases and the life time of the bubble decreases.
