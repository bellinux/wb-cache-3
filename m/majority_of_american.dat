25|$|Despite the {{recommendation}} that babies be exclusively breastfed {{for the first}} 6 months, less than 40% of infants below this age are exclusively breastfed worldwide. The overwhelming <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> babies are not exclusively breastfed for this period– in 2005 under 12% of babies were breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months, with over 60% of babies of 2 months of age being fed formula, and approximately one in four breastfed infants having infant formula feeding within two days of birth.|$|E
25|$|A revised height law in 1910 did {{away with}} that fixed maximum. The newer legislation, still in effect today, states that no new {{building}} {{may be more than}} 20 feet taller than the width of {{the street in front of}} it. The current law is codified as D.C. CODE ANN. § 6-601.05. Thus, Washington has a relatively modest skyline in comparison to the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> cities.

According to the 2005 Scholastic Book of World Records, Louisiana has the largest alligator population. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> alligators inhabit Florida and Louisiana, with over a million alligators in each state. Southern Florida is the only place where both alligators and crocodiles live side by side.|$|E
25|$|The Model T was {{introduced}} on October 1, 1908. It had {{the steering wheel}} on the left, which every other company soon copied.

The car was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair. It was so cheap at $825 in 1908 ($ today) (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s, a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> drivers had learned to drive on the Model T.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>{{majority}}</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Jews {{today are}} Ashkenazim, in Colonial times Sephardim {{made up the}} majority of the Jewish population. For example, the 1654 Jews who arrived in New Amsterdam fled from the colony of Recife, Brazil after the Portuguese seized it from the Dutch. Through most of the 18th century, American synagogues conducted and recorded their business in Portuguese, even if their daily language was English. It was not until widespread German immigration to the United States in the 19th century that the tables turned and Ashkenazim (initially from Germany but by the 20th century from Eastern Europe) began to dominate the American Jewish landscape.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United States, he and Lovestone, who had also been expelled from the party, formed the Communist Party (Opposition) to further their views. Having expected a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Communists to join them, they were disappointed at only being able to attract a few hundred followers. Wolfe became editor of the CP(O)'s newspaper Worker's Age and its chief theorist. Initially, Lovestone and Wolfe hoped to eventually be welcomed back into the Communist movement but when changes in the Comintern's line failed {{to result in a}} rapprochement, the CP(O) moved further and further away from communism. Wolfe and Lovestone were sympathisers of Nikolai Bukharin and helped found the International Communist Opposition (also known as the International Right Opposition) which for a time had some influence before petering out.|$|E
25|$|During {{the latter}} part of World War II, Polish Americans {{developed}} a strong interest in political activity ongoing in Poland. Generally, Polish American leaders took the position that Polish Prime Minister Władysław Sikorski should make deals and negotiate with the Soviet Union. Maksymilian Węgrzynek, editor of the New York Nowy Swiat, was fiercely anti-Soviet and founded the National Committee of Americans of Polish Descent (KNAPP) in 1942 to oppose Soviet occupation in Poland. His newspaper became an outlet for exiled Polish leaders to voice their distrust and fears of a disintegrating Polish government under Wladyslaw Sikorski. One such leader was Ignacy Matuszewski who opposed any negotiation with the Soviets without safeguards honoring Polish territorial claims. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Poles were in-line with the anti-Soviet views of Wegrzynek.|$|E
25|$|The British {{battle plan}} was {{for an attack}} against the 20-gun west bank battery, which would then both reduce the American {{artillery}} danger and enable those same guns to be turned on the American line which would assist a frontal attack against the defended line. In the early morning of January 8, Pakenham gave his final orders for the two-pronged assault against Jackson's position. Colonel William Thornton (of the 85th Regiment) was to cross the Mississippi during the night with his 780-strong force, move rapidly upriver and storm the battery commanded by Commodore Daniel Patterson on the flank of the main American entrenchments and then open an enfilade fire on Jackson's line with howitzers and rockets. Then, the main attack, directly against the earthworks manned by the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> troops, would be launched in two columns (along the river led by Keane and along the swamp line led by Major General Samuel Gibbs). The brigade commanded by Major General John Lambert was held in reserve.|$|E

The controversy over the war in Vietnam overshadowed their cause. Daley shared he had received 135,000 letters supporting his actions and only 5,000 condemning them. Public opinion polls demonstrated that the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> supported the Mayor's tactics. It was often commented through the popular media that on that evening, America decided to vote for Richard Nixon.|$|R

25|$|While the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> {{merchant}} mariners {{are employed}} by shipping businesses and accordingly wear either uniforms prescribed by their employers or civilian attire, some officers receive commissions in the United States Maritime Service for federal government duty, {{such as the}} faculty of the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the Military Sealift Command's civilian officers manning non-commissioned United States Naval Ships. These officers wear uniforms and rank insignia adopted from the U.S. Navy, albeit with United States Merchant Marine's own button design, cap device, awards, and decorations. The combination covers these officers are identical to those of naval officer with respect to colors, chinstrap and peak ornamentation. The buttons securing the chin strap to the sides of the band are smaller versions of the buttons worn on their coats. The USMS cap device is a rendering of the Merchant Marine device in gold- and silver-colored metal. Like the device worn by naval officers, it features a silver eagle, with wings outstretched, above a gold shield; the shield, however, is defaced with an anchor and surrounded by a wreath.|$|E
25|$|Protestants {{also took}} the {{initiative}} in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised {{separation of church and}} state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews. The United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the American Bill of Rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework. The great <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Protestants, both clergy and laity, strongly supported the independence movement. All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world (e.g., Latin America, Japan, and Germany). The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette, an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette's draft of this document. The United Nations Declaration and Universal Declaration of Human Rights also echo the American constitutional tradition.|$|E

[...] Kurtzman experimented with drawing on blue-lined paper; the blue lines {{were not supposed to}} reproduce visibly when the book was printed, but the gray wash Kurtzman used unintentionally reinforced them.|$|E
