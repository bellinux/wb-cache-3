The enterprise {{should focus on the}} efficient running of the main {{processes and}} risks associated with these procedures. My thesis deals with the risk analysis of selected manufacturing processes particular company from qualitative and quantitative point of view. First, the results are presented from qualitative risk analysis, especially in scope of failures of the machines or in the sequences of production. Second part focus on the problems of optimization sequence batches that the total time required <b>for</b> <b>pre-setting</b> of <b>machines</b> between doses should be minimal. The thesis also takes random waiting period into the consideration and applies wait-and-see approach of stochaistic programming applied in task traveling salesman. Calculations are processed by the GAMS. The results from the GAMS are refered in MS Excel, they are further discussed and interpreted by using descriptive statistics...|$|R
