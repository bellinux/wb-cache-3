We present evidence that the cpx mutations prevent or retard the translocation of these proteins to the outer membrane. The mutations {{had no effect on}} the rate of lipoprotein synthesis. <b>Mutant</b> <b>cells</b> labeled for 5 min with radioactive arginine accumulated as much lipoprotein as otherwise isogenic cpxA+ cpxB+ cells. This lipoprotein accumulated as such; no material synthesized in <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> and reactive with antilipoprotein antibodies had the electrophoretic mobility of prolipoprotein. Hence, the initial stages of prolipoprotein insertion into the inner membrane leading to its cleavage to lipoprotein appeared normal. However, after a long labeling interval, <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> were deficient in free lipoprotein and lacked lipoprotein covalently bound to peptidoglycan, suggesting that little if any of the lipoprotein synthesized in <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> reaches the outer membrane. Immunoreactive OmpF protein could also be detected in extracts of <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> labeled for 5 min, but the amount that accumulated was severalfold less in <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> than in cpxA+ cpxB+ cells. Analysis of beta-galactosidase synthesis from ompF-lacZ fusion genes showed this difference {{to be the result of}} a reduced rate of ompF transcription in <b>mutant</b> <b>cells.</b> Even so, little or none of the ompF protein synthesized in <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> was incorporated into the outer membrane...|$|R

Immunofluorescence studies showed that all the <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> had lost toxin-binding capacity. The cytotoxic activities of various bacterial cultures against the parent and <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> were compared. All samples from 10 strains of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and all three strains of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 tested showed cytotoxicity to the parent cells {{but not to the}} <b>mutant</b> <b>cells.</b> Samples from other organisms, such as Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Clostridium difficile, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria, and other E. coli strains, either had no effect or were cytotoxic on both the parent and <b>mutant</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus, these <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> could be used to identify Shiga-like toxin and distinguish it from other cytotoxins.

40|$|Persistent {{reovirus}} infections of murine L 929 cells select cellular mutations that inhibit viral disassembly {{within the}} endocytic pathway. <b>Mutant</b> <b>cells</b> support reovirus growth when infection is initiated with infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs), which are intermediates in reovirus disassembly formed following proteolysis of viral outer-capsid proteins. However, <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> {{do not support}} growth of virions, indicating that these cells have a defect in virion-to-ISVP processing. To better understand mechanisms by which viruses use the endocytic pathway to enter cells, we defined steps in reovirus replication blocked in <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> selected during persistent infection. Subcellular localization of reovirus after adsorption to parental and <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> was assessed using confocal microscopy and virions conjugated to a fluorescent probe. Parental and <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> {{did not differ in}} the capacity to internalize virions or distribute them to perinuclear compartments. Using pH-sensitive probes, the intravesicular pH was determined and found to be equivalent in parental and <b>mutant</b> <b>cells.</b> In both cell types, virions localized to acidified intracellular organelles. The capacity of parental and <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> to support proteolysis of reovirus virions was assessed by monitoring the appearance of disassembly intermediates following adsorption of radiolabeled viral particles. Within 2 h after adsorption to parental cells, proteolysis of viral outer-capsid proteins was observed, consistent with formation of ISVPs. However, in <b>mutant</b> <b>cells,</b> no proteolysis of viral proteins was detected up to 8 h postadsorption. Since treatment of cells with E 64, an inhibitor of cysteine-containing proteases, blocks reovirus disassembly, we used immunoblot analysis to assess the expression of cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine protease. In contrast to parental <b>cells,</b> <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> did not express the mature, proteolytically active form of the enzyme. The defect in cathepsin L maturation was not associated with mutations in procathepsin L mRNA, was not complemented by procathepsin L overexpression, and did not affect the maturation of cathepsin B, another lysosomal cysteine protease. These findings indicate that persistent reovirus infections select cellular mutations that affect the maturation of cathepsin L and suggest that alterations in the expression of lysosomal proteases can modulate viral cytopathicity...|$|R

50|$|Cancer is {{a classic}} example of what {{evolutionary}} biologists call multilevel selection: at the level of the organism, cancer is usually fatal so there is selection for genes and the organization of tissues that suppress cancer. At the level of the cell, there is selection for increased cell proliferation and survival, such that a <b>mutant</b> <b>cell</b> that acquires one of the hallmarks of cancer (see below), will have a competitive advantage over cells that have not acquired the hallmark.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the intracellular {{role of the}} clathrin heavy chain in living cells, we have used "antisense" RNA to engineer <b>mutant</b> Dictyostelium discoideum <b>cells</b> that are severely deficient in clathrin heavy chain expression. Immunoblots stained with an anti-clathrin heavy chain antiserum revealed that <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> contained undetectable amounts of clathrin heavy chain protein. Similarly, Northern blots showed an absence of clathrin heavy chain mRNA. Clathrin heavy chain- deficient Dictyostelium cells were viable, but exhibited growth rates twofold slower than parental cells. Whereas many morphological features of the <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> were normal, <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> lacked coated pits and coated vesicles. Clathrin-deficient cells were also missing large translucent vacuoles that serve as endosomes and contractile vacuoles. In the absence of clathrin heavy chain, <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> displayed three distinct functional defects: (a) impairment in endocytosis of fluid phase markers, but competence in another endocytic pathway, the phagocytosis of solid particles; (b) defects in osmoregulation; and (c) inability to complete the starvation-induced development cycle...|$|R
40|$|Temperature-sensitive {{mutations}} {{were generated}} in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPH 22 gene that, together with its homologue PPH 21, encode the catalytic subunit of type 2 A protein phosphatase (PP 2 A). At the restrictive temperature (37 °), cells dependent solely on pph 22 (ts) alleles for PP 2 A function displayed a rapid arrest of proliferation. Ts(-) pph 22 <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> underwent lysis at 37 °, showing an accompanying viability loss that was suppressed by inclusion of 1 M sorbitol in the growth medium. Ts(-) pph 22 <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> also displayed defects in bud morphogenesis and polarization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton at 37 °. PP 2 A is therefore required for maintenance of cell integrity and polarized growth. On transfer from 24 ° to 37 °, Ts(-) pph 22 <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> accumulated a 2 N DNA content indicating a cell cycle block before completion of mitosis. However, during prolonged incubation at 37 °, many Ts(-) pph 22 <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> progressed through an aberrant nuclear division and accumulated multiple nuclei. Ts(-) pph 22 <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> also accumulated aberrant microtubule structures at 37 °, while under semi-permissive conditions they were sensitive to the microtubule-destabilizing agent benomyl, suggesting that PP 2 A is required for normal microtubule function.

40|$|The {{role of an}} {{activator}} of flagellar transcription in Escherichia coli, flhD, {{was investigated}} in the regulation of cell division. When grown in tryptone broth, flhD <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> divided exponentially until they reached a cell density of 2. 5 x 10 (9) cells per ml. Wild-type <b>cells</b> and flhC <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> divided exponentially until they reached a cell density of 4 x 10 (7) cells per ml. flhD <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> divided 5 times more than wild-type cells before they reduced their cell division rate and reached a cell density 37 times {{higher than that of}} wild-type or flhC mutant cultures. In stationary phase, the biomasses of all cultures were similar; however, flhD <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> were significantly smaller. Additional tryptone, Casamino Acids, and individual amino acids, added at the beginning of growth, allowed wild-type cells to grow to higher cell densities. Serine was determined to have the greatest effect. In contrast, the addition of Casamino Acids did not exhibit an effect upon flhD <b>mutant</b> <b>cells.</b> flhD <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited normal rates of uptake of serine and other amino acids. In both wild-type and flhD mutant cultures, the concentrations of serine in the media dropped from 140 to 20 microM within the first 2 h of growth. Serine concentrations and cell division rates were highly correlated. Wild-type cells reduced their cell division rate at a medium concentration of 50 microM serine, and the addition of serine at this time caused cells to resume a higher rate of division. We conclude that the reduction of the cell division rate in wild-type cells is caused by the depletion of serine from the medium and that flhD <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> seem to be unable to sense this depletion...|$|R

40|$|A new gene, {{designated}} rcsF, {{was located}} adjacent to drpA at the 5. 2 -min {{position of the}} genetic map of Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by the rcsF gene indicates a small protein of 133 amino acid residues with a calculated pI of 10. 8 that is rich in proline, serine, alanine, and cysteine residues. When overexpressed {{as a result of}} its presence on a multicopy plasmid, rcsF confers a mucoid phenotype and restores colony formation to ftsZ 84 <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> on L agar medium containing no added NaCl. These two phenotypes are not observed in rcsB <b>mutant</b> <b>cells.</b> Ion <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> harboring an rcsF mutation accumulate considerably lower levels of exopolysaccharides, whereas the presence of a multicopy rcsF plasmid not only increases capsule synthesis but also confers a mucoid phenotype at 37 degrees C, a temperature at which ion <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> are known not to form mucoid colonies. RcsF does not stimulate the expression of rcsB, indicating that it exerts its action through the RcsB protein, possibly by phosphorylation. It is also shown that RcsF stimulation of capsule synthesis is RcsA-dependent, whereas colony formation of ftsZ 84 <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> can be restored by RcsF in the absence of RcsA...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} studies with the pgsA mutant of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

This study now shows that PG also {{plays an important role}} in the electron donor side of PSII, namely, the oxygen-evolving system. Analyses of purified PSII complexes indicated that PSII from PG-depleted pgsA <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> sustained only approximately 50 % of the oxygen-evolving activity compared to wild-type cells. Dissociation of the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbV, and PsbU, which are required for stabilization of the manganese (Mn) cluster, followed by the release of a Mn atom, was observed in PSII of the PG-depleted <b>mutant</b> <b>cells.</b> The released PsbO rebound to PSII when PG was added back to the PG-depleted <b>mutant</b> <b>cells,</b> even when de novo protein synthesis was inhibited. Changes in photosynthetic activity of the PG-depleted pgsA <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> induced by heat treatment or dark incubation resembled those of ΔpsbO, ΔpsbV, and ΔpsbU <b>mutant</b> <b>cells.</b> These results suggest that PG {{plays an important role in}} binding extrinsic proteins required for sustaining a functional Mn cluster on the donor side of PSII...|$|R

40|$|The cyclic-dimeric-GMP (c-di-GMP) -binding protein PilZ {{has been}} implicated in {{bacterial}} motility and pathogenesis. Although BB 0733 (PlzA), the only PilZ domain-containing protein in Borrelia burgdorferi, was reported to bind c-di-GMP, neither its role in motility or virulence nor it’s affinity for c-di-GMP has been reported. We determined that PlzA specifically binds c-di-GMP with high affinity (dissociation constant [Kd], 1. 25 M), consistent with Kd values reported for c-di-GMP-binding proteins from other bacteria. Inactivation of the monocistronically transcribed plzA resulted in an opaque/solid colony morphology, whereas the wild-type colonies were translucent. While the swimming pattern of <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> appeared normal, on swarm plates, <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited a significantly reduced swarm diameter, demonstrating a role of plzA in motility.

Immunoblot analysis and cell-by-cell double-label immunofluorescence of these mixtures showed that <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> underproduced several prespore <b>cell</b> markers. <b>Mutant</b> <b>cells</b> tended not to form spores in chimeras unless they exceeded a threshold proportion of ca. 30 %. However, <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> showed no tendency to produce excess prestalk cells when allowed to develop alone. These findings are most simply explained by postulating that reduced glycoantigen expression and intercellular adhesion encourage a more anterior cell localization, which in turn causes differentiation into a prestalk cell. Since normal prestalk cells also show reduced glycoantigen expression and intercellular adhesion, this suggests that a similar mechanism may contribute to pattern formation during normal development...|$|R

One hybrid consisted of the signal peptide and first third of the mature moiety of MBP, followed by the C-terminal two-thirds of RBP (MBP-RBP 112). This hybrid was dependent upon SecB for its efficient export and exhibited a strong export defect in secA <b>mutant</b> <b>cells.</b> A hybrid between RBP and MBP with the same fusion point was also constructed (RBP-MBP 116). The RBP-MBP 116 hybrid remained SecB independent and only exhibited a partial export defect in secA <b>mutant</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, MBP species with specific alterations in the early mature region were less dependent on SecB for their efficient export. The export of these altered MBP species was also less affected in secA <b>mutant</b> <b>cells</b> and in cells treated with sodium azide. These results present additional evidence for the targeting role of SecB...|$|R
