40|$|While public {{relations}} and corporate communication practitioners are under pressure to evaluate their work, particularly in terms of outcomes and Return on Investment, they also point to budget and time pressures which they identify as barriers to undertaking rigorous measurement (Gaunt & Wright, 2004; Watson & Simmons, 2004). Furthermore, senior management constantly pressed for time and with limited understanding of the intricacies of PR and corporate communication, want and often demand simple metrics – sometimes as brief as one or two numbers on a balanced scorecard (Fleisher & Mahaffey, 1997). This paper argues that the response to these budget and time constraints and management pressures to ‘keep it simple’ should not be to undertake measurement using simplistic methods which cannot gain reliable and valid data. Rather, a way forward is a two-tier approach in which practitioners apply rigorous research to provide themselves with reliable data {{on which to base}} strategic planning and advice to <b>management,</b> <b>monitor</b> progress, fine-tune tactics based on feedback, and evaluate outtakes and outcomes thoroughly, and then at a senior reporting level select and summarise the most salient data to provide management with an overview to meet their needs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Between 2004 and 2008, 24 Dutch {{hospitals}} {{participated in}} a two-year multilevel quality collaborative (MQC) comprised of (a) a leadership programme for hospital executives, (b) six quality-improvement collaboratives (QICs) for healthcare professionals and other staff, and (c) an internal programme organisation to help senior <b>management</b> <b>monitor</b> and coordinate team progress. The MQC aimed to stimulate the development of quality-management systems {{and the spread of}} methods to improve patient safety and logistics. The objective {{of this study is to}} describe how the first group of eight MQC hospitals sustained and disseminated improvements made and the quality methods used. Methods The approach followed by the hospitals was described using interview and questionnaire data gathered from eight programme coordinators. Results MQC hospitals followed a systematic strategy of diffusion and sustainability. Hospital quality-management systems are further developed according to a model linking plan-do-study-act cycles at the unit and hospital level. The model involves quality norms based on realised successes, performance agreements with unit heads, organisational support, monitoring, and quarterly accountability reports. Conclusions It is concluded from this study that the MQC contributed to organisational development and dissemination within participating hospitals. Organisational learning effects were demonstrated. System changes affect the context factors in the theory of organisational readiness: organisational culture, policies and procedures, past experience, organisational resources, and organisational structure. Programme coordinator responses indicate that these factors are utilised to manage spread and sustainability. Further research is needed to assess long-term effects. </p...|$|E
40|$|Elizabeth F Sutton, Leanne M Redman Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA Abstract: The {{development}} {{and dissemination of}} smart devices has cultivated a global environment of hyperconnectivity and increased our access to information. The paralleled launch and success of the Mobile Health industry has created a market of commercially available applications or “apps” along with tools or sensors, which allow the user to receive and collect personal health information. Apps and accompanying tools now allow an individual to “self-digitize” and, pertaining to weight <b>management,</b> <b>monitor</b> their body weight, caloric intake, physical activity, and more. These products possess the ability to improve the scalability of traditional in-person weight management services considering their near ubiquity, affordability, and capability to deliver information directly and personally to the user. However, similar to the dietary supplement market, the anecdotal value of these products has driven their popularity and acceptance {{by the general public}} without requirement of scientific validation or, in the area of weight management or diet/exercise, validation of the safety and efficacy by the Food and Drug Administration prior to market launch. By conducting a literature and clinical trial search, we found remarkably few active, completed, or published studies testing the efficacy of smart device applications using randomized controlled trials. Research efforts must be focused on illuminating the efficacy of behavioral interventions and remote self-monitoring for weight loss/maintenance treatment with true, randomized controlled trials.

It analyses features and problems of a competence-aimed approach to be practically used while designing and implementing the study programmes according to FSES HPE. The relevance of the solving problem to monitor and assess the learning outcomes specified by a competence-based format is justified; main problems are defined, aims and objectives are formulated. The paper illustrates features of forming competences as the main learning outcomes (LO) of a studied theoretical course of curriculum; analyses requirements both for the ways to form and for the tools to monitor the parts of competences (discipline competences) and their component structure («knowledge», «skills», «abilities») to be formed and monitored in the concrete disciplines (units) of a curriculum. The paper offers and studies options to find solutions for monitoring and assessing the LO and education (qualification) in the field concerned.

Information systems and technologies are a vital component of successful businesses and organizations. To understand information systems and their functions, company first need to be clear on the concept of a system. In its simplest form, a system is a set of interrelated components, with a cleary defined boundary, working together to achieve a common set of objectives. The problem is.

To be able to follow the development worldwide, some companies develop useful information system in order to help them in understanding their strengths and weaknesses, and also to view the competitors. The system is not only applied to Manufacturing Companies, but also to Service Company. PT "X" is a Shipping Company that chooses to run an Operational Information System as a tool to integrate the divisions and also the branches in the company. This System makes it possible for the management to know the company improvement and to find the idle capacity in the company. If those problems are handled, there would be improvement in internal results of the company including efficiency, effectiveness, quality of service and also efficiency of costs. The problem is "How could the application of the Operational Information System create efficiency in the operational activities of "X" Shipping company ?" The research used in this study is descriptive in nature since there was an analysis of the condition and also the application of the Operational Information System. The data were gathered by doing the direct observation, interview and documentation. The system used in the company includes the input subsystems which were transformed as database, and result in the output subsystems in a form of reports. However, from the analysis, it is found that the system is not perfect enough. Therefore, this study is done as a way to find and analyze the weaknesses of the system so that the company could improve and maximize the use of the system.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the QA best practice model {{for higher education}} transnational education (TNE) programs recently developed at Swinburne, and {{the early stages of}} its implementation. The framework can be conveniently drawn as a four-box model which integrates planning and QA, and emphasises strategic guidelines and the client perspective, as well as academic and administration guidelines (see Table 1, below). The framework operates within the 'fitness for purpose' QA approach adopted by the Australian Universities Quality Agency (AUQA 2005), and is informed by the new 'Provision of education to international students: code of practice and guidelines for Australian universities' recently published by the Australian Vice-Chancellors’ Committee (AVCC), to which all Australian universities are signatories (AVCC 2005). We were given the opportunity to explore QA models and develop a 'conceptual framework' for TNE programs by the award of research funding from the AVCC offshore quality project to Swinburne University in September 2004. The project was completed and a report submitted to the AVCC in June 2005. The function of the framework is to: integrate TNEP planning and QA from the concept proposal stage provide an overview or map to university TNEP procedures and logistics as a tool for collating information essential to strategic <b>management</b> <b>monitor</b> university compliance on regulatory issues (AUQA, AVCC, host country regulations). The planning and QA framework is being applied to the logistics for transnational education programs (TNEP), in the form of guidelines for TNEP project initiation, project management, and project review. The framework and guidelines are part of Swinburne’s Internationalisation Strategic Plan, and are being developed by the Office of the Pro Vice-Chancellor (International), in consultation with university divisions who are managing TNE programs, and with various academic and administrative committees involved in policy affecting TNE programs. The overall context for the discussion is the effort of universities to become multinational organisations with internationalised staff and students. TNE programs are an increasingly significant factor in this process, given significant growth over the last decade (DFAT 2005, p. 56). In turn, the quality of TNE programs is a key strategic issue, as shown by the recent discussion paper from the Department of Education, Science and Training, with a 'Transnational Quality Strategy' under development this year. The more immediate goal is continuing improvement in planning and logistics for TNE programs, an effort that will always be a work in progress as transnational education rapidly evolves and constantly presents new challenges. To meet these challenges, universities need to overcome deficiencies in strategic planning and quality assurance...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The United States {{today has}} become 2 ̆ 2 meeting-conscious. 2 ̆ 2 The {{complexity}} of conducting business {{has led to}} the need for sophisticated coordination of decision-making processes on all levels of the organization. Company meetings have played an increasingly important role in the success and future of many companies. Strategies and decisions are developed at meetings that can determine future policies of crucial importance. Executive training can mean the difference in whether the company will even survive. Large and growing companies have increased their off-premise meeting budgets annually in spite {{of the state of the}} economy. however, the rising costs of travel and lodging have made <b>management</b> <b>monitor</b> these budgets more closely than ever. Thus, the need to use every dollar efficiently has compelled companies to examine newer methods of running meetings and alternatives to the usage of typical off-premise meeting facilities. The importance of off-premise meetings in the United States economy has greatly increased due to the billions of dollars spent annually. These factors make it vital to explore the effectiveness of time and monetary expenditures. Up until the mid- 19602 ̆ 7 s, company meetings were held in facilities of various design and purpose, none of which were specifically designed for the small to medium corporate meeting. Upon gathering information concerning the meetings market and the corporate meeting planner, certain individuals endeavored to change the situation. This study is designed to investigate this new concept, which will hereafter be referred to as 2 ̆ 2 conference center. 2 ̆ 2 For the purpose of this study, the following two definitions will be used. 1. Conference center - that meeting facility primarily marketing its facilities for the small to medium-sized corporate meeting. The center is operated by specialists aware of market needs in as much detail as are those people working for the company involved. On-premise sleeping rooms are not mandatory provided such facilities are within easy access. 2. Meeting planner - that person within an organization who has primary responsibility for arranging off-premise meetings and all other related items necessary for meeting effectiveness. This person may spend anywhere from 10 to 100 l of his time in this capacity. The conference center has effectively satisfied the need for specialized corporate meeting facilities. This study will show the depth of the corporate meetings market and trace the growth and development of this relatively new conference center concept. Information will also be compiled on the top centers in the country. It is hoped that by presenting this research meeting planners will become more aware of the nature and location of these centers, especially for use by the small to medium-sized company. Such exposure of the centers will hopefully increase existing demand and enable the construction of new, innovative centers...|$|E
