500|$|Agnes ended her 10-year {{relationship}} with label Aquarius Musikindo by releasing her first greatest hits album, Agnes Is <b>My</b> <b>Name,</b> <b>on</b> 2 February 2011. The album compiled ten hit singles {{of the past}} decade with two new songs, [...] "Karena Ku Sanggup" [...] and [...] "Paralyzed". The album was sold via Indonesian chains of fast-food restaurant KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), where the CD was bundled with chicken package purchase. This marketing strategy boosted the album sales to one million copies within three months, earning her the Million Award. She followed it with two non-album singles, [...] "Rindu" [...] and [...] "Muda (Le O Le O)"; the later was free to download for simPATI subscribers.|$|E

500|$|The {{short film}} was {{produced}} by Emma Ludbrook, Allan Wachs and Jared Leto, who also directed. Although it is billed as a [...] "Bartholomew Cubbins Film" [...] (Leto's [...] longtime pseudonym), [...] "City of Angels" [...] is the first directorial project directly credited to Jared Leto. He explained, [...] "It {{was the first time}} I'd ever done that. I'd used several different names, but it was just such a personal thing. I thought it was appropriate to put <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> that piece." [...] Previous collaborator Devid Levlin served as director of photography. It was edited by Leto, Benjamin Entrup and Mischa Meyer. The short film included commentary from Kanye West, Christopher Lloyd Dennis, Juliette Lewis, Heather Levinger, Haywood, Lindsay Lohan, Olivia Wilde, Steve Nash, Ashley Olsen, Lily Collins, James Franco, Selena Gomez, Alan Cumming, Anthony Warfield, Jovan Rameau, Holly Beavon, Shaun White, Corey Feldman, and Yosh. [...] "City of Angels" [...] marked the second collaboration of Thirty Seconds to Mars with Kanye West, as they first worked together on the track [...] "Hurricane" [...] (2010).|$|E
500|$|In February 2010, Bernd Schuster {{was asked}} if Raúl did not favour Villa moving to Real Madrid, to which he responded, [...] "I have a cough," [...] which caused many {{to believe that he}} was {{implying}} the rumour to be true. Villa firmly ridiculed that idea by saying, [...] "It is impossible that a player with as much class on and off the pitch as Raúl would speak poorly of me. I have always had a good relationship with Raúl, even though we have hardly met on international duty." [...] Speaking about Raúl's record with the Spanish national team as the nation's leading top scorer, Villa said, [...] "I've got 25 goals but he's got 44 and is still playing. I'd be delighted to reach that tally as I'd help the national team achieve great victories and, in many years' time, I could see <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> a [...] that another young lad was trying to beat. That would be great." [...] On 25 March 2011, two years after making that remark, Villa surpassed Raúl as Spain's all-time top scorer.|$|E
500|$|Wade {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} magazine articles and publications. In 2005, he was featured on People's 50 Most Beautiful People, and in 2006 he was named the NBA's best-dressed player by GQ Magazine. In 2007, Esquire named him to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year. Wade has endorsement deals with companies such as Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials feature him paired with NBA legend Charles Barkley), and Topps. He had his own line of shoes with Converse named [...] "The Wade" [...] and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile. During the 2009–10 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike's Jordan Brand. Wade noted that the partnership ended on good terms, stating, [...] "When I came into the NBA, I didn't have a lot of exposure and Converse gave me an opportunity to head a brand and be the face of a brand. I'm really thankful for six long, good years. I've gotten five shoes out of the deal and my dream came true at the Converse brand because they put <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> a pair of sneakers." [...] Wade was hand-chosen by Michael Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA Playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining fellow players Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul, who have their own signature shoes for the brand. After his Jordan Brand contract expired in 2012, Wade signed with the Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning.|$|E

500|$|Slash's Snakepit's {{music was}} often {{described}} as hard rock and blues rock with elements of southern rock. The band were also {{often described as}} Slash's solo or side project though Slash maintained {{that they were a}} band, stating [...] "everybody wrote, everybody had equal input even though I had <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer J.D. Considine noted the differences between Guns N' Roses and Slash's Snakepit on their first album, stating that [...] "Guns ' Roses typically treat the melody as {{the most important part of}} the song, most of what slithers out of the Snakepit emphasizes the playing." [...] He noted that singer Eric Dover [...] "conveys the raw-throated intensity of a hard-rock frontman" [...] and [...] "he avoids the genre's most obvious excesses." [...] The riff to [...] "Good to Be Alive" [...] drew a comparison to Chuck Berry while the musicianship on the album was praised. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated that [...] "there's little argument that Slash is a great guitarist" [...] who is [...] "capable of making rock and blues clichés sound fresh". Reviewing Ain't Life Grand for Allmusic, Steve Huey described second singer Rod Jackson as [...] "a combination of '80s pop-metal bluster and Faces-era Rod Stewart" [...] with a [...] "touch of Aerosmith", a description that he felt also fitted the band as a whole. He noted, though, that Slash's guitar playing was [...] "tame" [...] and stated that the main problem of the album was the songwriting, though it was [...] "still a passable, workmanlike record that will definitely appeal to fans of grimy, old-school hard rock." [...] Malcolm Dome of Classic Rock stated that [...] "from the moment that [...] "Been There Lately" [...] opens, there's a vibe here that was missing before" [...] and that Ain't Life Grand showed [...] "purpose, direction and individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for Ravenloft were {{generally}} positive. Rick Swan reviewed the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 72. He commented {{that there was}} [...] "so much gothic atmosphere in Ravenloft that if it had any more, it'd flap its pages and fly away", and stated {{that the bulk of}} the adventure involving a search of Castle Ravenloft was [...] "not too interesting" [...] with encounters few and far between, and that the mechanic of using a regular deck of cards to simulate a gypsy fortune teller was [...] "silly and the results are too arbitrary" [...] but concluded that [...] "Ravenloft is such a refreshing change that even with its problems, it's recommended." [...] In the July 1984 issue of White Dwarf magazine, the module was given 8 out of 10 overall, with the reviewer mentioning its presentation as a positive, and its complexity as a negative. It was likened to a Hammer horror production and praised as enjoyable, although the reviewer said the game's puns were tedious and detracted from the spooky atmosphere. White Dwarf reviewer Dave Morris said it [...] "should {{be a lot of fun}} – 'light, relief' of a nerve-wracking and deadly sort" [...] and concluded that Ravenloft is [...] "full of clever touches", and [...] "features some first-class illustration and graphics". In a review for the January 1984 issue of Dragon magazine (published by a subsidiary of TSR), game designer Ken Rolston argued that, despite its design innovations, Ravenloft was still in essence a dungeon-style adventure. Rolston praised the randomization, the maps, and the player text (which is read aloud to the players by the DM). He said the player text [...] "consistently develops an atmosphere of darkness and decay." [...] Despite this, Rolston felt that the adventure has trouble in developing a frightening tone. He singles out its use of common monsters in D, an abundance of traps, and frequent combat interludes as elements that detract from the adventure's spookiness by interrupting the module's flow. Ultimately, he felt that in [...] "AD terms it is a masterpiece", but not a work of [...] "Gothic horror". Tracy Hickman stated in 1998, [...] "I still believe the original Ravenloft modules were perhaps the best that ever had <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> them." ...|$|E

The Jewish Sages stressed {{that although the}} priests are the ones carrying out the blessing, it is not them or the ceremonial practice of raising their hands that results in the blessing, but rather it is God's desire that His blessing should be transferred {{by means of the}} Kohanim's hands.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Village in 2004, Shyamalan had been {{planning}} a film adaptation of Yann Martel's novel Life of Pi with 20th Century Fox, but later backed out {{so that he could}} make Lady in the Water. [...] "I love that book. I mean, it's basically [...] a kid born in the same city as me — it almost felt predestined", Shyamalan said. [...] "But I was hesitant because the book has kind of a twist ending. And I was concerned that as soon as you put <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it, everybody would have a different experience. Whereas if someone else did it, it would be much more satisfying, I think. Expectations, you've got to be aware of them. I'm wishing them all great luck. I hope they make a beautiful movie".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of her first solo release, the live DVD Dreamshow, which reached the No. 1 {{position}} in the UK chart in August 2005, Siouxsie received demos from several composers. Universal soon offered her a new record deal on the label W14, which {{was about to be}} created by John Williams, whom had already previously worked with her for Peepshow and Boomerang. Commenting on the news on her website in July 2006, Siouxsie stated, [...] "At least I didn't have to get someone spray-painting <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the front of the Universal building"! It was a reference to a famous episode which took place in early 1978 in London when record companies had been tagged one morning with the command, [...] "Sign the Banshees, do it now".|$|E

[...] Screenwriter Michael Ferris also appeared to pick his Worst Screenplay award.|$|R
2500|$|Shyamalan {{commented on}} the issues {{regarding}} fans' perceptions of the casting {{in an interview with}} Washington Post columnist Jen Chaney, saying, [...] "Anime is based on ambiguous facial features. It's meant to be interpretive. It's meant to be inclusive of all races, and you can see yourself in all these characters...This is a multicultural movie and I'm going to make it even more multicultural in my approach to its casting. There's African-Americans in the movie...so it's a source of pride for me. The irony that [...] would label this with anything but the greatest pride, that the movie poster has Noah and Dev on it and <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it. I don't know what else to do." [...] In this quote, Shyamalan's reference to Noah Ringer can be explained by Noah's self-identification of his ancestry as [...] "American Indian," [...] although critics of the film's casting have presumed that the actor is simply [...] "white" [...] when making their complaints.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014, former NBC {{facilities}} manager Frank Scotti told the New York Daily News that {{while working on}} The Cosby Show, Cosby funneled regular payments to several women via money orders that Scotti was told to purchase in his own name. Among the women identified in receipts that Scotti preserved for more than 20 years were Shawn Thompson, Cosby's admitted mistress who later accused him of fathering her child, and Angela Leslie, who claimed Cosby made unwanted sexual advances toward her in the early 1990s. Scotti [...] "suspected that [...] was having sex with them". He also noted that Cosby [...] "was covering himself by having <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> [...] It was a coverup". Scotti also claimed that Cosby regularly took aspiring models and actresses into his dressing room and instructed Scotti, [...] "Stand outside the door and don't let anyone in." [...] In a later interview for NBCs Today Show, Scotti said he [...] "felt like a pimp". Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer denied Scotti's accusations and said the walker-bound 90-year-old was merely seeking [...] "his 15 minutes of fame".|$|E
2500|$|With Presley's {{explosion}} in popularity in 1956, pressure {{was put on}} Jones to cut a few rockabilly sides and he reluctantly agreed. [...] His heart was never in it, however, and he quickly regretted the decision; in his autobiography he joked, [...] "During the years, when I've encountered those records, I've used them for Frisbees." [...] He explained to Billboard in 2006: [...] "I was desperate. [...] When you're hungry, a poor man with {{a house full of}} kids, you're gonna do some things you ordinarily wouldn't do. [...] I said, 'Well, hell, I'll try anything once.' [...] I tried 'Dadgum It How Come It' and 'Rock It', a bunch of shit. [...] I didn't want <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the rock and roll thing, so I told them to put Thumper Jones on it and if it did something, good, if it didn't, hell, I didn't want to be shamed with it."
