50|$|In addition, {{when not}} {{operating}} in column-binary mode, the reader indicates an error and stops (if the I/O check <b>stop</b> <b>switch</b> is on) if the punch combination in any {{column does not}} indicate a valid character.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, Turkey {{scrapped}} winter time, {{by switching}} to New Turkey Time. This means permanent UTC+3, {{which was used}} during summer time in Turkey. The switch was on 12:00 am (00:00) on Thursday 8 September, in reality <b>stopping</b> <b>switches</b> between summer and winter time.|$|R
50|$|Multi-master {{replication}} {{can also}} be contrasted with failover clustering where passive slave servers are replicating the master data in order to prepare for takeover {{in the event that}} the <b>master</b> <b>stops</b> functioning. The <b>master</b> is the only server active for client interaction.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>stop</b> <b>switch</b> (not allowed under British regulations) to {{halt the}} {{elevator}} while in motion and often used to hold an elevator open while freight is loaded. Keeping an elevator stopped for too long may set off an alarm. Unless local codes require otherwise, this {{will most likely be}} a key switch.|$|R
6000|$|... "You just hab, you rascal! But I cure you ob dat," [...] {{said the}} negro, {{catching}} {{up a piece}} of cane that was lying on the ground, with which he was about to administer condign chastisement to the idle slave, when his <b>master</b> <b>stopped</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Lion {{did as he}} was ordered, and {{lay down}} licking his mouth and chest. Lion's <b>master</b> <b>stopped</b> for a moment to take breath, and then, {{recovering}} his usual coolness of manner, turned to speak to his frightened wife and her visitors. Probably the whole occurrence had not occupied two minutes.|$|R
60|$|Tallente {{threw off}} his rain and mud-soaked clothes, bathed, changed and descended {{to the dining}} room just as the gong sounded. Robert was in the act of moving the {{additional}} place from the little round dining table which he had drawn up closer to the wood fire, but his <b>master</b> <b>stopped</b> him.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the reader}} and punch {{mechanisms}} {{count the number of}} holes in each column at a separate station. An error is indicated and the mechanism stops (if the I/O check <b>stop</b> <b>switch</b> is on) if the number of holes counted at the read station differs from the number of holes counted at the first, check station (for reading) or punched at the first station (for punching).|$|R
5000|$|A {{two-speed}} motor {{requires more}} electrical connections and switching, adding cost, {{and may have}} to <b>stop</b> to <b>switch.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{instant before}} this {{happened}} I thought I {{heard the sound of}} a rustling dress in the passage outside, as if one of the women servants was stealing up to listen outside the door. I should have gone at once to see whether this was the case or not, but my <b>master</b> <b>stopped</b> me just after he had risen from the chair.|$|R
60|$|When the <b>master</b> <b>stopped</b> at Mrs. Morpher's {{to inquire}} after his errant pupil that night, he found Aristides in bed, smelling {{strongly}} of soap and water, and sinking into a feverish sleep. As he muttered {{from time to}} time some incoherent sentence, tossing restlessly in his cot, the master turned to those about him and asked what it was he said.|$|R
50|$|Eventually Mr. R {{agreed to}} give Henson his freedom papers for $450, with $350 in cash and the {{remainder}} in a note. Henson had enough to produce the cash, so {{all that was left}} was to pay the $100 note. On March 9, 1829, Henson received his papers and began to prepare to return to Kentucky. Upon leaving, his <b>master</b> <b>stopped</b> him.|$|R
2500|$|In 1580, new pupils were reprimanded, {{under the}} penalty of £10, {{if they did}} not show good {{behaviour}} or did not listen to their Magistrates or masters. [...] In 1612, the pupils, many of whom were related to the gentry in the country, rioted with pistols and hagbuts, and took over part of the school. [...] The <b>masters</b> <b>stopped</b> the riot, and 21 pupils were expelled, while some were arrested.|$|R
5000|$|The Late Late Show {{hosted a}} special episode {{dedicated}} to the 125th anniversary of {{the foundation of the}} GAA. The episode, presented by Pat Kenny, was aired on RTÉ One on 9 January 2009 and was planned well in advance as soon as the 2008 Toy Show had ended. The Athlone Advertiser said the show was [...] "a shocker. A genuine shocker. So much of the show lacked élan and panache that it became very difficult to <b>stop</b> <b>switching</b> the bloody thing off".|$|R
5000|$|Introduced as the mil gl (for [...] "militarisiert geländegängig" [...] - military, {{cross country}} mobile), the MAN Kat1 series {{is used by}} all {{branches}} of the Bundeswehr. Militarization includes a full blackout lights circuit completely separated from the standard lights, a military instrument layout with blackout option, an emergency <b>stop</b> <b>switch</b> to cut electrical power, a roof hatch with rotary machine gun mount, and rifle brackets. The vehicles are category I (KAT I) special military developments, and as such fully cross-country mobile.|$|R
6000|$|Ariel {{lifted her}} heavy hand. [...] "You will have it!" [...] she said, and {{advanced}} toward me. At {{the same moment}} the <b>Master's</b> voice <b>stopped</b> her.|$|R
50|$|Between April 26, 1986 and May 24, 1987, the N ran express via the Bridge to 57th Street during evenings, nights, and weekends. Afterwards, N service {{began running}} local via the Broadway Line during evenings, nights, and weekends, {{but they still}} {{operated}} over the Manhattan Bridge. On May 24, 1987, when the N and R swapped routes in Queens, there were additional changes in Broadway service. B service during evenings and weekends, <b>stopped</b> <b>switching</b> to the local track north of 34th Street to serve the Astoria Line. Instead, it skipped 49th Street and terminated at 57th Street.|$|R
50|$|After the Thing {{chooses to}} remain on an alien planet where he could change back to human form, Alicia {{falls in love with}} the dashing Human Torch, another member of the Fantastic Four. The Thing returns to unhappily attend their wedding. In Fantastic Four #300, Johny Storm and Alicia have their wedding, but it is nearly foiled by the Mad Thinker, the Wizard, and Alicia's stepfather, the Puppet Master. These three villains planned to attack the wedding, but at the last moment Puppet <b>Master</b> <b>stopped</b> them, with the (unwilling) help of Dragon Man.|$|R
50|$|On November 30, 2005, the Tom Leykis Show {{was moved}} to KISW from sister station KQBZ (which flipped to country), after nearly 1,000 fans called the station and sent emails to <b>stop</b> the <b>switch</b> through protest sites.|$|R
50|$|Several {{changes to}} the design were {{announced}} in December 2014. The major changes involve revising platform lengths at all stops to support {{an increase in the}} length of the trams from 45m to 67m, redesigning several <b>stops,</b> <b>switching</b> technologies for the delivery of the wire-free section and the removal of a proposed stop at World Square. It was also announced that the projected cost had increased from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion. The government claimed the increase was due to the design modifications, but a 2016 report produced by the Audit Office of New South Wales found that the increase was largely due to Transport for NSW underestimating the cost of the project.|$|R
50|$|Usually the {{contents}} {{of one or more}} hardware registers would be represented by a row of lights, allowing {{the contents}} to be read directly when the machine was <b>stopped.</b> The <b>switches</b> allowed direct entry of data and address values into registers or memory.|$|R
5000|$|In Cangoxima, {{the first}} place Father <b>Master</b> Francisco <b>stopped</b> at, there were {{a good number of}} Christians, {{although}} {{there was no one there}} to teach them; the shortage of labourers prevented the whole kingdom from becoming Christian.|$|R
50|$|One day, Taki {{suddenly}} {{wakes up}} back in his body. After an unsuccessful first date with Okudera, he tries contacting Mitsuha but fails. He later finds that they have <b>stopped</b> <b>switching</b> bodies and eventually decides to visit Mitsuha in her hometown. Without knowing {{the name of her}} village, he travels around the Hida region, relying solely on the sketches of the village's scenery he has drawn from memory. Finally, a restaurant server recognizes the town in Taki's sketch as Itomori. He is then told that a fragment of the comet Tiamat fell to earth three years ago and obliterated Itomori and its surroundings, killing a third of the town's population. As Taki looks through the records of fatalities from the incident, he finds Mitsuha's name.|$|R
40|$|In the {{classical}} one-arm bandit problem, a decision maker receives consecutive payoffs, which are realizations of i. i. d. random variables whose distribution is not known. The decision maker’s {{problem is to}} decide when to stop, where <b>stopping</b> implies <b>switching</b> to a known deterministic payoff. The optima...|$|R
25|$|In May 2009, four {{children}} became ill when the attraction failed {{to stop at}} the end of its cycle. After returning to a horizontal position, a limit switch failed and the ride continued to spin for five to ten minutes. The park's first-aid staff treated the children, while one was transported to an area hospital by his parents; the child was not admitted, however. An investigation determined that the ride operator did not engage an emergency <b>stop</b> <b>switch</b> due to a miscommunication between her and her supervisor; the park's ride operators are trained in how to stop their rides in the event of a malfunction. Since then, additional safety features have been added to ensure that the attraction automatically stops within 15 seconds if the limit switch were to fail.|$|R
25|$|Exception: Engine horn signals {{required}} by rules 14 (b) and 14 (h) {{do not apply}} after momentary <b>stops</b> in continuous <b>switching</b> movements.|$|R
25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given word size, such {{as eight}} bits, {{one in the}} master {{and one in the}} slave; they are connected in a virtual ring topology. Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant bit into the same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is shifted into the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been shifted out and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue for any number of clock cycles. When complete, the <b>master</b> <b>stops</b> toggling the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.|$|R
6000|$|The {{men were}} up again, the Master grimly watchful, Montgomery as alert as a kitten. The Master tried a sudden rush, squattering {{along with his}} awkward gait, but coming faster than one would think. The student slipped aside and avoided him. The <b>Master</b> <b>stopped,</b> grinned, and shook his head. Then he motioned with his hand as an {{invitation}} to Montgomery to come to him. The student did so and led with his left, but got a swinging right counter in the ribs in exchange. The heavy blow staggered him, and the Master came scrambling in to complete his advantage; but Montgomery, with his greater activity, kept out of danger until the call of [...] "time." [...] A tame round, and the advantage with the Master.|$|R

25|$|The driverless tractor is {{considered}} controversial {{in terms of}} safety and public acceptance. A tractor operating without a driver makes some people nervous. Creating technology that stays safe in all scenarios where failure could possibly occur {{takes a lot of}} programming and time. In terms of motion detection, the tractors have sensors to stop them if they detect objects in their path such as people, animals, vehicles or other large objects. In 2004, researchers from the Danish Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University published a paper in which they examined the safety of a driverless tractor in detail. With their driverless tractor, they had one person designated as a safety operator. This operator controlled a switch which could immediately shut down and halt the tractor. They also wired four emergency <b>stop</b> <b>switches</b> on each corner of the tractor.|$|R
5000|$|The EF 800mm 5.6L IS USM is a {{professional}} L series lens released June 2008. This lens is constructed with a magnesium alloy body and mount and with plastic extremities and switches. Features of this lens are: a wide rubber focus ring that is damped, a focus distance window, the ability to limit the focus range, a focus-preset mechanism, an image stabilizer that is effective up to four stops and is tripod sensing, an AF <b>stop</b> <b>switch,</b> and weather sealing. A maximum aperture of 5.6 gives this lens {{the ability to create}} depth of field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains two fluorite lens elements, and [...] "Super UD" [...] (Ultra low dispersion) and UD Lens elements. This lens uses an inner focusing system powered by a ring type USM motor. This lens is compatible with the Canon Extender EF teleconverters.|$|R
30|$|A further {{advantage}} of the electronic traction control is that the speed of applying and releasing the traction force can be adjusted. In addition to the electronic safety system, the unit is also provided with a mechanical traction limiting system and the patient can <b>stop</b> the <b>switch</b> which enables the patient to terminate the session.|$|R
60|$|<b>Master</b> Lionel <b>stopped</b> {{and faced}} the other squarely, his {{shoulders}} to his horse. They were quite alone in as lonely a spot as any conspirator could desire. Behind him stretched the empty beach, ahead of him the ruddy cliffs that rise gently to the wooded heights of Arwenack.|$|R
