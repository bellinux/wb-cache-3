Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, how to use them to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E
500|$|References to {{the fact}} that Gregory House was based on the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appear {{throughout}} the series. Shore explained that he was always a Holmes fan and found the character's indifference to his clients unique. The resemblance is evident in House's reliance on deductive reasoning and psychology, even where it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> obviously applicable, and his reluctance to accept cases he finds uninteresting. His investigatory method is to eliminate diagnoses logically as they are proved impossible; Holmes used a similar method. Both characters play instruments (House plays the piano, the guitar, and the harmonica; Holmes, the violin) and take drugs (House is dependent on Vicodin; Holmes uses cocaine recreationally). House's relationship with Dr. James Wilson echoes that between Holmes and his confidant, Dr. John Watson. Robert Sean Leonard, who portrays Wilson, said that House and his character—whose name is very similar to Watson's—were originally intended to work together much as Holmes and Watson do; in his view, House's diagnostic team has assumed that aspect of the Watson role. Wilson even has a dead-beat brother who may be dead, like Watson's dead alcoholic brother. (season 1, episode 10) Shore said that House's name itself is meant as [...] "a subtle homage" [...] to Holmes. House's address is 221B Baker Street, a direct reference to Holmes's street address. Wilson's address is also 221B.|$|E

60|$|That {{night was}} an eventful one to Eustacia's brain, {{and one which}} she hardly ever forgot. She dreamt a dream; and few human beings, from Nebuchadnezzar to the Swaffham tinker, ever dreamt a more {{remarkable}} one. Such an elaborately developed, perplexing, exciting dream was certainly never dreamed by a girl in Eustacia's situation before. It had as many ramifications as the Cretan labyrinth, as many fluctuations as the Northern Lights, as much colour as a parterre in June, and was as crowded with figures as a coronation. To Queen Scheherazade the dream <b>might</b> have <b>seemed</b> <b>not</b> far removed from commonplace; and to a girl just returned from all the courts of Europe it <b>might</b> have <b>seemed</b> <b>not</b> more than interesting.

40|$|The cartographic {{history of}} Japan is {{remarkable}} for the sophistication, variety, and ingenuity of its maps. It is also remarkable for its many modes of spatial representation, which <b>might</b> <b>not</b> immediately <b>seem</b> cartographic but {{could very well}} be thought of as such. To understand the alterity of these cartographic modes and write Japanese map history for what it is, rather than what it is not, scholars need to be equipped with capacious definitions of maps not limited by modern Eurocentric expectations. This article explores such classificatory flexibility through an analysis of the mapping function of meisho zue, popular multivolume geographic encyclopedias published in Japan during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The article’s central contention is that the illustrations in meisho zue function as pictorial maps, both as individual compositions and in the aggregate. The main example offered is Miyako meisho zue (1780), which is shown to function like a map on account of its instrumental pictorial representation of landscape, virtual wayfinding capacity, spatial layout as a book, and biased selection of sites that contribute to a vision of prosperity. This last claim about site selection exposes the depiction of meisho as a means by which the editors of meisho zue recorded a version of cultural geography that normalized this vision of prosperity...|$|R
6000|$|Whenever {{they walked}} towards Kitty, this woman, whose quick eye had {{detected}} Mr. Arbuton {{at her side}} as she {{came up to the}} inn, bent upon the young girl's face a stare of insolent curiosity, yet with a front of such impassive coldness that to another she <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>seemed</b> aware of her presence. Kitty shuddered at the thought of being made acquainted with her; then she remembered, [...] "Why, how stupid I am! Of course a gentleman can't introduce ladies; and the only thing for him to do is to excuse himself to them as soon as he can without rudeness, and come back to me." [...] But none the less she felt helpless and deserted. Though ordinarily so brave, she was so beaten down by that look, that for a glance of not unkindly interest that the young lady gave her she was abjectly grateful. She admired her, and fancied that she could easily be friends with such a girl as that, if they met fairly. She wondered that she should be there with that other, not knowing that society cannot really make distinctions between fine and coarse, and could not have given her a reason for their association.|$|R

2500|$|I soon {{got used}} to this singing; for the sailors never touched a rope without it.

[...] And then some {{one of them would}} begin, and if every man's arms were as much relieved as mine by the song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a cheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath expended on it. It is a great thing in a sailor to know how to sing well, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal of popularity among his shipmates. Some sea-captains, before shipping a man, always ask him whether he can sing out at a rope.|$|R
40|$|The string is a stark data structure, and {{everywhere}} it is passed {{there is much}} duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information. End users often validate and reuse short, human-readable data such as phone numbers, state names, and product identifiers, each of which may appear in multiple formats. For some categories of data, it is usually clear whether a particular value is a valid instance of that category. Other categories are more ambiguous, and in these cases, values might appear to be “slightly invalid. ” As an example, although email addresses technically can be fairly long, any value longer than 40 characters {{would seem to be}} of questionable validity. In addition, for some categories, certain exceptional values <b>might</b> <b>not</b> immediately <b>seem</b> to be valid instances of a category yet turn out to be valid {{in the context of a}} particular task. End users sometimes accept and use slightly invalid data, though they may take extra steps to double-check the values if using invalid data might imperil the task at hand. Traditional software types are unsuitable for representing these categories of data. First, end-user programmers (and some professional programmers) find typed languages confusing and hard to use. Second, type-checking algorithms rely on the fact that a value either is or is not a valid instance of a type and therefore do not support a non-binary scale of validity. Finally, exceptional inputs are often discovered and treated as valid at runtime...|$|R
