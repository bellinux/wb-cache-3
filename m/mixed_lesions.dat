40|$|Diabetic {{nephropathy}} (DN) {{has become}} {{the leading cause of}} end-stage renal disease worldwide. Non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD), is known to occur in diabetic patients. The renal and retinal relationship in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) with nephropathy is not uniform. This study was carried to study the histological spectrum of nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria and its relationship with diabetic retinopathy (DR). Total 31 (males - 26; females - 5) proteinuric type 2 diabetic patients were studied. Average age of patients was 50. 7 years. Nephrotic syndrome was noted in 21 (67. 7 %) patients. Overall, isolated DN, NDRD and NDRD superimposed on DN (<b>mixed</b> <b>lesion)</b> were observed in 12 (38. 7 %), 13 (41. 9 %) and 6 (19. 4 %) cases, respectively. DR was absent in 21 / 31 (67. 7 %) cases. The spectrum of nephropathy in patients without DR included: DN in 6 (28. 57 %), NDRD in 12 (57. 14 %) and <b>mixed</b> <b>lesion</b> in 3 (14. 29 %). Kidney histology in patients with DR (n- 10) revealed DN in 6 (60 %), NDRD in 1 (10 %) and <b>mixed</b> <b>lesion</b> in 3 (30 %) patients. Thus, absence of DR favors NDRD but does not exclude DN because isolated DN was noted in 28. 57 % cases in absence of DR. Similarly biopsy proven NDRD (pure NDRD; 10 % and mixed lesion; 30 %) was noted in 40 % of cases in presence of DR. In summary, patients with T 2 DM had higher incidence of NDRD. DR is less frequent (32. 3 %) in type 2 diabetes and is a poor predictor of type of nephropathy. Hence, renal biopsy is essential for precise diagnosis of nephropathy in patients with T 2 DM...|$|R

All animals were challenged intradermally at multiple sites with T. pallidum alone, BCG alone, and both organisms {{into the same}} sites. The resulting lesions were followed clinically and histologically. BCG lesions enlarged more rapidly in sensitized rabbits, but they were otherwise no different {{from those in the}} controls. T. pallidum lesions enlarged and regressed simultaneously in both groups, but in the BCG-sensitized animals they became twice as large as those in the unsensitized rabbits. Mixed BCG-T. pallidum lesions showed the greatest differences in the two groups of animals. Like the pure BCG lesions, they enlarged more rapidly in the sensitized rabbits but began to recede after 1 week. The corresponding lesions in the controls enlarged more slowly and reached their maximum size after 3 weeks when the receding lesions in the sensitized animals were much smaller. The most marked histological-histochemical {{difference between the two groups}} of animals was in the number and activation of macrophages. These cells were more numerous in the <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> of BCG-sensitized animals than in similar lesions of the controls and more activated as determined by beta-galactosidase staining. Although sparsely distributed, activated macrophages were more numerous in the pur T. pallidum lesions of sensitized animals than in those of control animals.

40|$|Bone metastases are a {{frequent}} occurrence with cancer, and early detection can guide the patient's treatment regimen. Metastatic bone disease can present in density extremes as sclerotic (high density) and lytic (low density) or in a continuum with an admixture of both sclerotic and lytic components. We design a framework {{to detect and}} characterize the varying spectrum of presentation of spine metastasis on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) data. A technique is proposed to synthesize CT and PET images to enhance the lesion appearance for computer detection. A combination of watershed, graph cut, and level set algorithms is first run to obtain the initial detections. Detections are then sent to multiple classifiers for sclerotic, lytic, and <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions.</b> The system was tested on 44 cases with 225 sclerotic, 139 lytic, and 92 <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions.</b> The results showed that sensitivity (false positive per patient) was 0. 81 (2. 1), 0. 81 (1. 3), and 0. 76 (2. 1) for sclerotic, lytic, and <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions,</b> respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Up to 80 % of {{patients}} dying from prostate carcinoma have developed bone metastases that are incurable. Castration {{is commonly used}} to treat prostate cancer. Although the disease initially responds to androgen blockade strategies, it often becomes castration-resistant (CRPC for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer). Most of the murine models of <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> derived from prostate cancer cells are androgen sensitive. Thus, we established {{a new model of}} CRPC (androgen receptor (AR) negative) that causes <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> in bone. METHODS: PC 3 and its derived new cell clone PC 3 c cells were directly injected into the tibiae of SCID male mice. Tumor growth was analyzed by radiography and histology. Direct effects of conditioned medium of both cell lines were tested on osteoclasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes. RESULTS: We found that PC 3 c cells induced <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> 10 weeks after intratibial injection. In vitro, PC 3 c conditioned medium was able to stimulate tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive osteoclasts. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and endothelin- 1 (ET 1) were highly expressed by PC 3 c while dikkopf- 1 (DKK 1) expression was decreased. Finally, PC 3 c highly expressed bone associated markers osteopontin (OPN), Runx 2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP) and produced mineralized matrix in vitro in osteogenic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: We have established a new CRPC cell line as a useful system for modeling human metastatic prostate cancer which presents the mixed phenotype of bone metastases that is commonly observed in prostate cancer patients with advanced disease. This model will help to understand androgen-independent mechanisms involved in the progression of prostate cancer in bone and provides a preclinical model for testing the effects of new treatments for bone metastases.

40|$|Background/PurposeCentral ossifying fibroma (COF) is {{the most}} common benign fibro-osseous lesion of the jaw. This {{retrospective}} study evaluated the clinical and histopathologic features of 28 COFs in Taiwanese patients. MethodsTwenty-eight consecutive cases of COF were collected from 1988 to 2006. The clinical data and microscopic features of these cases were reviewed and analyzed. ResultsThe mean age of patients at the time of diagnosis was 34 years. There were six male and 22 female patients. Twenty-six (93 %) cases were found in the mandible and two (7 %) in the maxilla. The most common sites for COFs were the molar region (17 cases, 61 %), followed by the premolar (8 cases, 28 %), and incisor/canine (3 cases, 11 %) regions. Bone swelling or expansion (96 %, 26 / 27) was the most frequent clinical presentation. Six (21 %) COFs presented as a radiolucent lesion, 17 (61 %) as a <b>mixed</b> <b>lesion,</b> and five (18 %) as a radio-opaque lesion. No recurrence of the lesion was found after surgical excision in this series. Microscopically, COFs showed trabeculae of woven bone (25 cases) and/or lamellar bone (5 cases) and/or spherules of cementoid (19 cases) in a cellular fibrous connective tissue stroma. The stromal component was highly cellular in 21 cases, moderately cellular in seven cases, prominently vascular in 11, and collagenous in six. ConclusionCOFs occur more frequently in female patients and in those in the second to fourth decades of life. The most commonly affected site is the mandible, especially the molar region. The majority of COF lesions present as a well-defined, <b>mixed</b> <b>lesion</b> radiographically. Most COFs can be treated by conservative surgical excision without subsequent recurrence...|$|R
40|$|Background: Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) -related {{anal cancer}} lesions are often found {{adjacent to the}} squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). We have assessed the histopathology and associated HPV genotypes in anal SCJ lesions in surgically excised anal warts in HIV-negative and âpositive patients. Methods: Histopathology identified 47 squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) adjacent to the SCJ amongst a total of 145 cases of clinically diagnosed anal condylomata. The anal SCJ lesions were further analyzed with p 16, CK 7 and p 63 immunohistochemistry and HPV genotyping. Results: Sixteen (16 / 47) of the excised anal wart lesions contained HSIL; Three were HSIL and exclusively associated with oncogenic HPVs. A further thirteen (13 / 47) were <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions.</b> Of these eight were HSILs with LSIL and six were HSILs with papillary immature metaplasia (PIM); Ten of the <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> were associated {{with one or more}} oncogenic HPVs, while three cases were exclusively associated with HPV 6. Conclusions: Clinically diagnosed anal warts cannot be assumed to be limited to low-grade lesions as anal warts of the SCJ often show heterogeneous lesions, with coexistence of LSIL, PIM, and HSIL. Lesions showing PIM, however, may mimic HSIL, because they are hypercellular, but lack the nuclear atypia and conspicuous mitotic activity of HSIL; and are p 16 negative.

Some variation was noted in the in vivo response of two different streptococcal M Types to the bactericidal effect of phage Type 71 staphylococci. Bacterial antagonism is more pronounced when staphylococci and streptococci are injected simultaneously into animals than when staphylococci are superimposed on preexisting streptococcal lesions. Marked variations were found in the numbers of viable streptococci (colony-forming units) recovered from individual lesions containing identical mixtures of streptococci and phage Type 71 staphylococci. The frequency of a demonstrable bactericidal effect was related to the number of streptococci injected. With small inocula of streptococci, the tendency towards an all-or-none effect was particularly striking. No evidence of selection of streptococcal or staphylococcal mutants which might explain this phenomenon was obtained. These observations suggest that the bactericidal effect of phage Type 71 staphylococci on other Gram-positive organisms, previously demonstrated in vitro, appears to operate also in vivo...|$|E

In order to re-examine this issue, 25 uremic patients treated by intermittent hemodialysis underwent 99 m-Technetium Methylene Diphosphonate (99 mTc-MDP) bone scan. They were subdivided into three groups according to quantitative bone histology. Group 1 (N = 8) had pure dialysis osteomalacia, group 2 (N = 7) <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions,</b> and group 3 (N = 10) pure osteitis fibrosa. The scintigraphic studies were interpreted {{by means of a}} five point semiquantitative scale. Using this quantification, all but one group 1 patients had decreased bone tracer uptake, and all patients of group 3 had an increased uptake (chi square test of Yates, P < 0. 001). Among patients of group 2, bone uptake was decreased in the three patients with clearly reduced mineralization front and moderate osteitis fibrosa, but it was increased in all patients with severe osteitis fibrosa and subnormal mineralization front. A quantitative analysis of regional tracer uptake into bone was performed in two patients: one of group 2 and one of group 3. The results obtained clearly corroborated the semi-quantitative findings. Thus, in hemodialysis patients with symptomatic bone disease, the 99 mTc-MDP bone scan provides useful information for the differential diagnosis between dialysis–related osteomalacia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. In patients with <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions,</b> the importance of bone tracer uptake appears to depend on the extent of the mineralization front and on the intensity of osteitis fibrosa...|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed among 50 patients of acute (less than 24 hours) cases of craniocerebral trauma {{over a period of}} four months. The patient’s level of consciousness (GCS) was determined and a brain CT scan without contrast media was performed. A sixth generation General Electric (GE) CT scan was utilized and 5 mm and 10 mm sections were obtained for infratentorial and supratentorial parts respectively. RESULT The age range of the patients was 1 to 75 years (mean age 35. 6 ± 21. 516 years) and male: female ratio was 3. 1 : 1. The most common causes of head injury were road traffic accident (RTA) (60 %), fall injury (20 %), physical assault (12 %) and pedestrian injuries (8 %). The distribution of patients in accordance with consciousness level was found to be 54 % with mild TBI (GCS score 12 to 14), 28 % with moderate TBI (GCS score 11 to 8) and 18 % with severe TBI (GCS score less than 7). The presence of <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> and midline shift regardless of the underlying lesion on CT scan was accompanied by lower GCS.

We report a case of desmoplastic ameloblastoma in a 45 -year-old female with a painless swelling in the left anterior maxillary region. Fine needle aspiration yielded no fluid. Periapical and panoramic radiographs as well as computer tomography scan showed a <b>mixed</b> <b>lesion</b> with multilocular appearance. The present case deserves special importance because of its unfamiliar appearance, potentially aggressive nature and high chances of misdiagnosis. Moreover, the radiographic features of this lesion rarely point towards ameloblastoma. A partial maxillectomy for tumor resection was performed and the involved teeth were removed. This report is an attempt to help the dental community in developing familiarity with the clinical presentation and at the same time advocating to develop a high index of suspicion in recognizing such cases...|$|R
40|$|Gastric teratomas are {{extremely}} rare tumors. A 15 -day-old neonate presented with abdominal mass. Ultrasound of abdomen showed <b>mixed</b> echogenicity <b>lesion.</b> CT scan showed a mass with solid and cystic components and internal calcifications. At operation a tumor {{arising from the}} posterior wall of the stomach found. It was exogastric as well as endogastric in location. Biopsy report was suggestive of mature teratoma...|$|R
40|$|Giant cell tumor of {{tendon sheath}} (GCTTS) and Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) are rare {{conditions}} both characterized by polyclonal cellular proliferation and multinucleated giant cells formation. Here, we report {{the case of}} a 27 -year-old Caucasian woman affected by WG who experienced the metachrone appearance of two different GCTTSs at the right hand within a time of 3 years. To our knowledge, the combination of GCTT with WG is exceptional and this could probably be the first case reported. The subsequent appearance of two rare diseases both characterized by giant cell formation apparently points to similarities in their pathogenesis. However, at present no pathogenic relationship between GCTTS and WG is demonstrable and their simultaneous occurrence has to be considered coincidental. Actually, an emerging opinion is to consider GCTTS as a <b>mixed</b> <b>lesion</b> in which both tumoral and non-tumoral inflammatory cells play a central pathogenic action. On this view, the proposed case could support the evidence about the crucial role of a chronic inflammatory injury in enhancing GCTTS appearance...|$|R
