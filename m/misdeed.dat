25|$|According to Lewis, the {{outstanding}} {{characteristic of the}} classical Islamic view of Jews is their unimportance. The religious, philosophical, and literary Islamic writings tended to ignore Jews and focused more on Christianity. Although, the Jews received little praise or even respect, and were sometimes blamed for various <b>misdeed</b> {{but there were no}} fears of Jewish conspiracy and domination, nor any charges of diabolic evil nor accusations of poisoning the wells nor spreading the plague nor were even accused of engaging in blood libels until Ottomans learned the concept from their Greek subjects in the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|However, Adam {{forfeited}} the King's favour and {{was either}} effectively banished or chose to leave England for Rome in February 1402 with the sanction of the Crown, having begged for the King's pardon for the Westminster <b>misdeed,</b> which pardon was granted in January 1403. There Adam realised he could impress other influential people. Once in Rome he met Pope Boniface IX and Pope Innocent VII, {{both of whom}} were sufficiently impressed to offer him English bishoprics in 1404. He was later successively nominated to the sees of Hereford and St. David's, but was unable to obtain possession of either. Antipope Benedict XIII also nominated him to Llandaff.|$|E

If they drew suspicion, they were prepared to [...] "sing at a moment's notice." [...] It was his loyalty to America, he claimed, which caused him to desert the Kaiser's singing invasion force.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly Alfred divided his code into 120 {{chapters}} because 120 was the age {{at which}} Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law. The link between the Mosaic Law and Alfred's code is the [...] "Apostolic Letter" [...] which explained that Christ [...] "had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic Law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods [...] "established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every <b>misdeed</b> at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed".|$|E

2500|$|Rats are {{frequently}} blamed for damaging food supplies and other goods, or spreading disease.

Writer/director Preston Sturges created the humorous alias [...] "Ratskywatsky" [...] for a soldier who seduced, impregnated, and abandoned the heroine of his 1944 film, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek. It is a term (noun and verb) in criminal slang for an informant – [...] "to rat on someone" [...] is to betray them by informing the authorities of a crime or <b>misdeed</b> they committed. Describing a person as [...] "rat-like" [...] usually implies he or she is unattractive and suspicious.|$|E
2500|$|Contrasting the {{original}} Todd and Marty rape storyline, the Todd and Marty romance was criticized as lacking in sense {{and not having}} a point. It was argued that Todd would not initiate or engage in a <b>misdeed</b> which would not benefit him, {{and that he was}} haunted by his gang rape of Marty for years. [...] "He would have immediately seen the win-win situation in heroically saving Marty and giving her back to her friends and family." [...] Carlivati's Todd and Marty scenes resembled a daily therapy session, with Marty as the patient. As Marty asks about the details of her rape, Todd reluctantly recounts the gang rape moment by moment to Marty as a storm brews outside, just as it had on the night he raped her, but leaves left out {{the fact that he is}} one of the men who raped her. Todd having been raped by Margaret Cochran also does not seem to induce any awareness on Todd's part for unfairly holding Marty captive.|$|E
2500|$|Elissa's brother, Pygmalion of Tyre, {{had murdered}} Elissa's husband, the high priest. Elissa escaped {{the tyranny of}} her own country, {{founding}} the [...] "new city" [...] of Carthage and subsequently its later dominions. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but the following can be deduced from various sources. According to Justin, Princess Elissa {{was the daughter of}} King Belus II of Tyre. When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her brother, Pygmalion, and her. She married her uncle Acerbas, also known as Sychaeus, the High Priest of Melqart, a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. This led to increased rivalry between the religious elite and the monarchy. Pygmalion was a tyrant, lover of both gold and intrigue, who desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acerbas. Pygmalion assassinated Acerbas in the temple and kept the <b>misdeed</b> concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single sovereign.|$|E

2500|$|The Use and {{application}} of maxims is clearly a location where the principles of Irish law could be recorded. Any number of maxims may be found within the Early Irish Laws and perhaps {{the reason why we}} are unable to derive a coherent theory of law from them is because there are a great many different topics. Some do seem to represent a legal theory, such as the maxim in Bechbretha that [...] "no-one is obliged to give something to another for nothing" [...] and that in Bretha Crólige that [...] "the <b>misdeed</b> of the guilty should not affect the innocent". These maxims do say more than one might think since legal systems often have problems balancing the interests of all. The majority of maxims, however, treat with more specific problems. The main problem, however, with our understanding of maxims is that while one law text tells us that they were used as a basis of judgment we know little else about them; we do not even know how exactly maxims could be used for judgment. A further complication is that we know very little about the origin of maxims (or even what the jurists thought was the origin) and similarly we do not know whether jurists were introducing new maxims regularly or whether all maxims were supposed to be from time immemorial.|$|E
2500|$|Warner Sallman {{stated that}} The Head of Christ {{was the result}} of a [...] "miraculous vision that he {{received}} late one night", proclaiming that [...] "the answer came at 2 A.M., January 1924" [...] as [...] "a vision in response to my prayer to God in a despairing situation." [...] The Head of Christ is venerated in the Coptic Orthodox Church, after twelve-year-old Isaac Ayoub, who diagnosed with cancer, saw the eyes of Jesus in the painting shedding tears; Fr. Ishaq Soliman of St. Mark's Coptic Church in Houston, on the same day, [...] "testified to the miracles" [...] and on the next day, [...] "Dr. Atef Rizkalla, the family physician, examined the youth and certified that there were no traces of leukemia". With episcopal approval from Bishop Tadros of Port Said and Bishop Yuhanna of Cairo, [...] "Sallman's Head of Christ was exhibited in the Coptic Church", with [...] "more than fifty thousand people" [...] visiting the church to see it. In addition, several religious magazines have explained the [...] "power of Sallman's picture" [...] by documenting occurrences such as headhunters letting go of a businessman and fleeing after seeing the image, a [...] "thief who aborted his <b>misdeed</b> when he saw the Head of Christ on a living room wall", and deathbed conversions of non-believers to Christianity. As an extraordinarily successful work of Christian popular devotional art, it had been reproduced over half a billion times worldwide by the end of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Most often, kobolds remain {{completely}} invisible. Although King Goldemar (or Goldmar), {{a famous}} kobold from Castle Hardenstein, had hands [...] "thin {{like those of}} a frog, cold and soft to the feel", he never showed himself. The master of Hundermühlen Castle, where Heinzelmann lived, convinced the kobold to let him touch him one night. The kobold's fingers were childlike, and his face was like a skull, without body heat. One legend tells of a female servant taking a fancy to her house's kobold and asking to see him. The kobold refuses, claiming that to look upon him would be terrifying. Undeterred, the maid insists, and the kobold tells her to meet him later—and to bring along a pail of cold water. The kobold waits for the maid, nude and with a butcher knife in his back. The maid faints at the sight, and the kobold wakes her with the cold water. In one variant, the maid sees a dead baby floating in a cask full of blood; years before, the woman had born a bastard child, killed it, and hidden it in such a cask. Legends tell of those who try to trick a kobold into showing itself being punished for the <b>misdeed.</b> For example, Heinzelmann tricked a nobleman into thinking that the kobold was hiding in a jug. When the nobleman covered the jug's mouth to trap the creature, the kobold chided him: ...|$|E
