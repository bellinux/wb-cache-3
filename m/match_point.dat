40|$|Given the {{influences}} of illumination, imaging angle, and geometric distortion, among others, false <b>matching</b> <b>points</b> still occur in all image registration algorithms. Therefore, false <b>matching</b> <b>points</b> detection {{is an important step}} in remote sensing image registration. Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is typically used to detect false <b>matching</b> <b>points.</b> However, RANSAC method cannot detect all false <b>matching</b> <b>points</b> in some remote sensing images. Therefore, a robust false <b>matching</b> <b>points</b> detection method based on Knearest- neighbour (K-NN) graph (KGD) is proposed in this method to obtain robust and high accuracy result. The KGD method starts with the construction of the K-NN graph in one image. K-NN graph can be first generated for each <b>matching</b> <b>points</b> and its K nearest <b>matching</b> <b>points.</b> Local transformation model for each <b>matching</b> <b>point</b> is then obtained by using its K nearest <b>matching</b> <b>points.</b> The error of each <b>matching</b> <b>point</b> is computed by using its transformation model. Last, L <b>matching</b> <b>points</b> with largest error are identified false <b>matching</b> <b>points</b> and removed. This process is iterative until all errors are smaller than the given threshold. In addition, KGD method can be used in combination with other methods, such as RANSAC. Several remote sensing images with different resolutions and terrains are used in the experiment. We evaluate the performance of KGD method, RANSAC + KGD method, RANSAC, and Graph Transformation Matching (GTM). The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the KGD and RANSAC + KGD methods...|$|R

5|$|The film's soundtrack {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work {{as an indicator of}} social class, such as in Husbands and Wives (1992). In <b>Match</b> <b>Point,</b> the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime.|$|E
5|$|At the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Murray lost at the quarterfinal {{stage to}} Juan Martín del Potro in three sets. At the Miami Masters, Murray {{made it through}} his first four matches without {{dropping}} a set, and after overcoming Richard Gasquet in the semifinals, faced David Ferrer in the final. After losing the first set, and facing <b>match</b> <b>point</b> in the decider at 5–6, Murray eventually took the match in a third set tiebreaker to win his second Miami Masters title, and leapfrog Roger Federer into {{second place in the}} rankings, ending a near-decade long time period in which neither Federer or Rafael Nadal were ranked in the top two. Murray briefly fell back to No. 3 in the world, following a third round defeat by Stanislas Wawrinka in Monte-Carlo, but reclaimed the No. 2 ranking as a result of Federer failing to defend his title at the Mutua Madrid Open. Later, Murray lost at the quarterfinal stage to Tomáš Berdych in straight sets.|$|E

5|$|Kuznetsova and Agnieszka Radwańska {{have played}} each other {{eighteen}} times since 2007, with Kuznetsova leading the head-to-head 14–4. Their first meeting was at Wimbledon in 2007 with Kuznetsova winning in straight sets. Kuznetsova won their first three meetings, {{but in the}} four meetings that eventuated in 2008, Kuznetsova lost three of them, including {{in the third round}} of the Australian Open and in the fourth round of Wimbledon. Additionally, she also lost against her at the year-end championships later in the year, after Radwańska replaced an injured Ana Ivanovic. Kuznetsova subsequently dominated Radwańska in future meetings, winning six meetings between the pair between 2009 and 2012, including an upset victory at the 2012 French Open, until Radwańska stopped the rot at the 2014 Mutua Madrid Open, saving a <b>match</b> <b>point</b> in the process. Prior to 2014, Kuznetsova's two most recent titles came by defeating Radwańska in the championship match, first at Beijing in 2009 and then at San Diego in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova rebounded at the Wuhan Open, {{reaching}} the semifinals which boosted her hopes {{to qualify for}} the WTA Finals {{for the first time since}} 2009. This run included defeating defending champion Venus Williams and Agnieszka Radwańska, after saving <b>match</b> <b>point.</b> She then lost to fellow Singapore contender Dominika Cibulková in a tight three set match. At the China Open, Kuznetsova received a bye into the second round due to her impressive performance at Wuhan. She defeated Misaki Doi but lost to yet another Singapore Contender Madison Keys in the third round. Being the favourite for the title in Tianjin after top seed Agnieszka Radwańska withdrew from her Quarterfinal match, Kuznetsova disappointingly lost to Alison Riske in the semifinals. This would have kept her out of Singapore, until Serena Williams withdrew from Singapore and that left a spot up to grabs.|$|E

40|$|Multi-temporal high {{resolution}} satellite images are essential data for efficient city analysis and monitoring. Yet even when acquired {{from the same}} location, identical sensors as well as different sensors, these multi-temporal images have a geometric inconsistency. <b>Matching</b> <b>points</b> between images, therefore, must be extracted to match the images. With images of an urban area, however, {{it is difficult to}} extract <b>matching</b> <b>points</b> accurately because buildings, trees, bridges, and other artificial objects cause shadows over a wide area, which have different intensities and directions in multi-temporal images.

5|$|<b>Match</b> <b>Point</b> is a 2005 British-Luxembourgish {{psychological}} thriller film {{written and}} directed by Woody Allen and starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton. In the film, Rhys Meyers's character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Johansson. The film treats themes of morality, greed, and the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set in New York, for a British setting.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, {{his poor}} grass-court form {{from the past}} continued, as {{he went down to}} unseeded Lleyton Hewitt in the second round. In the Davis Cup quarter-final against the Czech Republic, del Potro won his matches against Ivo Minář and Berdych in {{straight}} sets, but Argentina still lost the tie 2–3, eliminating them from the competition. A few weeks later, he defeated Hewitt and Fernando González en route to the Washington final. He successfully defended his title against top-seeded Wimbledon finalist Andy Roddick to win his second tournament of the year and become the first player since Andre Agassi to win back-to-back Washington titles. Del Potro played the following week at the Masters 1000 in Montreal, where he was seeded sixth, defeating world No. 2 Nadal in the quarterfinals, his second win in a row over Nadal. He then defeated Roddick in the semifinals, saving a <b>match</b> <b>point,</b> to advance to his first Masters 1000 final, and to improve his head-to-head record against Roddick to 3–0. In the final, he lost against Murray in three sets. He later withdrew from the next Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati due to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|The film is {{a debate}} with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, which Wilton is seen reading early on, {{identifying}} him with the anti-hero Raskolnikov. That character is a brooding loner who kills two women {{to prove that he}} is a superior being, but is racked by guilt and eventually admits all to a dogged sleuth, and he is finally redeemed by punishment, the love of a poor girl, and the discovery of God. Wilton is a brooding loner who kills a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little guilt, and avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both killers attempt to cover their crime by faking a robbery, both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance in the stairwell, and both sleuths play cat and mouse with the suspect. Allen argues, unlike Dostoyevsky, that there is neither God, nor punishment, nor love to provide redemption. The theme of parody and reversal of Dostoyevsky's motifs and subject matter has been visited by Allen before, in his film Love and Death. In Love and Death, the dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Gambler, The Idiot, and War and Peace. In <b>Match</b> <b>Point,</b> Allen moves the theme from parody to the more direct engagement of Dostoyevsky's motifs and narratives.|$|E
