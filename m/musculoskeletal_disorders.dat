One could argue that without a thorough understanding of the root causes of a disorder we are only interpreting MSD symp-toms in our efforts to reduce risk.

In Europe MSDs are the most often reported workplace health problem. [...] The development of musculoskelelatal problems cannot be solely explained in the basis of biomechanical factors (e.g., repetitive motion) although such factors are important contributors.

Occupational stress {{accounts for more than}} 10% of work-related health claims. [...] Many studies suggest that psychologically demanding jobs that allow employees little control over the work process increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [...] Research indicates that job stress increases the risk for development of back and upper-extremity <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> Other disorders that can be caused or exacerbated by occupational stress include sleep disorders, headache, mood disorders, upset stomach, hypertension, high cholesterol, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety.

2500|$|Accidents {{and safety}} in the {{workplace}} have become areas of interest to I/O psychology. Examples of psychosocial injury hazards of interest to I/O psychology include fatigue, workplace violence, workplace bullying, and working night shifts. I/O researchers conduct [...] "stress audits" [...] that can help organizations remain compliant with various occupational safety regulations. Psychosocial hazards can affect <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> A psychosocial factor related to accident risk is safety climate, which refers to employees' perceptions {{of the extent to}} which their work organization prioritizes safety. By contrast, psychosocial safety climate refers to management's [...] "policies, practices, and procedures" [...] aimed at protecting workers' psychological health. Research on safety leadership is also relevant to I/O psychology. Research suggests that safety-oriented transformational leadership is associated with a positive safety climate and safe worker practices.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRapid {{technological}} {{development in the}} use of electronic data has affected both the employees and workplace. In recent years rapid use of computers has changed the work environment drastically. Various factors like personal factors, work related factors (WRF), psycho-social factors (PSF) can result in many health hazards like <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorder</b> (MSD). From the literature review it is observed that the <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorder</b> is very common among computer user's bank office employees. Objective: The purpose of this paper was to examine the prevalence of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorder</b> among Computer User Bank Office employees. Material and Method: A self-designed questionnaire based on Nordic <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorder</b> was delivered to sixty computer users employees of state bank of India district Nawanshahr Punjab. Out of which fifty questionnaires were found completely filled and ten questionnaires were found partially filled and thus not included in the study. Association of risk factor was accessed by Logistics regression and ANOVA analysis using SPSS 21. Results: Participants suffering from MSD during the last 12 months reported problem in the low-back pain (40. 4 %), upper back (39. 5), Neck (38. 6 %), hand/wrist (36. 8 %) and shoulder (15. 2 %). In the present study it was found that age, smoking/drinking habits, bad work postures, job insecurity, unhealthy working conditions also contribute to increase MSD in bank employees. Conclusion: the study showed a high prevalence of disorders in the low- back, upper back neck, hand/wrist, shoulder etc. It is recommended that proper work posture; healthy working conditions must be provided which can make the work easier and more relaxed...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Although the <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorder</b> {{has been}} known as a serious, {{fundamental}} and costly problem among the nurses, few studies have conducted to determine the underlying causes in Iran. The {{aim of this study}} was to inspect the outbreak of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorder</b> and the ergonomic factors related to it among the nurses. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 400 samples of nurses in Amol hospitals (a city in Mazandaran province, Iran) with census method were studied. To obtain the required information and distinction of the <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorder</b> outbreak the changed Nordic questionnaires and Yip study were used. Results: 81 % of the nurses experienced backache, 29. 5 % had wrist ache, 50 % had pain round their neck, 35. 5 % had pain in their shoulders, and 63. 5 %had painful knee at least once during the last year. Females have neck ache and backache 122 % and 203 % more than males, respectively. Among the investigated ergonomic factors, bending over the patients’ bed in order to do the nursing job enhances the wrist pain in nurses; the neck pain is also increased by moving and lifting the wards instruments and raising the hands higher than the shoulder level. Another factor that amplifies the back ache is bending to lift something from the floor. Conclusion: One of the most serious problems in nursing job is <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorder</b> which is directly related to different factors such as bending, patient and wards instrument displacement, helping the patients to bathe them; so instructing the nurses in order to teach them how to use the movement aid items in wards can be effective in reducing the arisen factors...|$|R
