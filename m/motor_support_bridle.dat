40|$|The {{excessive}} vibration of <b>motor</b> <b>support</b> in container crane’s machine room affects lifespan {{of the structure}} and driving comfort of the operators. According to {{the result of the}} vibration site test, the main causes of the machine room vibration in container crane were found out. In order to reduce the vibration response, based on simplifying the system as a single degree of freedom vibration system model and finite element method, two kinds of rapid vibration analysis software were compiled respectively by using Visual Basic (VB), which can parameterize the <b>motor</b> and its <b>support.</b> Meanwhile, their advantages and disadvantages were compared. By analyzing the effects of different <b>motor</b> <b>support</b> structure layouts on its natural frequency and maximum vibration velocity response, it is concluded that increasing and improving the <b>motor</b> <b>support’s</b> cross-sectional moment of inertia and lateral stiffness can reduce the system vibration response. The rapid analysis software’s computing results are almost the same as ANSYS computing results. Furthermore, <b>motor</b> <b>support</b> structure of the container crane machine room was optimized through the original software. The accordance of vibration test data and analysis results prove the credibility and the reliability of the rapid analysis software and methods...|$|R

This paper {{gives an}} {{impression}} of the language modest, a modelling and description language for stochastic and timed systems, and reports on applications of this language {{to a variety of}} industrial case studies. The language and its accompanying tool environment, <b>motor,</b> <b>support</b> the modular description and analysis of reactive systems while covering both functional and non-functional system aspects such as hard and soft real-time, and quality-of-service aspects. This unique expressiveness has been exploited in three recent industrial case studies of rather different nature, ranging from (i) schedule synthesis and evaluation for a lacquer production plant, to (ii) device detection in a plug-and-play infotainment protocol, and to (iii) dependability assessment of an emerging standard for future high-speed cross-European trains. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{bridle shiner}} (Notropis bifrenatus) is {{believed}} to have once been an important prey item throughout its native range; however, recent reports suggest populations have declined significantly and the species is now widely considered as imperiled. Habitats that are associated with this species are typically difficult to sample using traditional methods, making it unclear how much of the observed range reduction could be actual or perceived. My objectives were to estimate detection probability of bridle shiner, evaluate the importance of habitat on their distribution, and determine patterns of movement among habitat patches. I employed a repeated surveys design to estimate detection probability based on capture history and to draw inferences about sites where the species was never encountered. Bridle shiner were batch marked to evaluate among-patch movement distances and frequencies. Movement was infrequent and overall detection probability was high. Detectability was negatively associated with mean water velocity and positively associated with abundance. Occupied habitats tended to have higher springtime macrophyte cover, stable flows over time, and were connected by short distances to similar areas. Among occupied patches, those with shallower mean depths <b>supported</b> <b>bridle</b> shiner in high abundance later in the year, which may be an indication of habitat that is important for recruitment and survival. My findings suggest that false absences are not likely the cause of reported declines in Connecticut and that habitat degradation may be a leading cause of extirpations throughout the state...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} modelling theory of switched reluctance motors in which simultaneous excitation of two phase windings can occur. The theory and design principles presented apply primarily to four- and five-phase machines. The modelling theory presented includes mutual interaction effects between adjacent phases in the switched reluctance motor. Experimental results and extensive finite-element analysis of four- and five-phase <b>motors</b> <b>support</b> the design theory. The design of four-phase motors for reduced torque ripple is proposed. A winding configuration for five-phase 10 / 8 motors is also described which uses mutual coupling to encourage short flux paths, linking adjacent stator poles via the approaching rotor teeth. It is shown that short flux path excitation leads to significantly improved machine performance...|$|R
