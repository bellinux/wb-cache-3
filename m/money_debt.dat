6000|$|This is the Kaiser Sigismund {{who held}} the Council of Constance; and [...] "blushed visibly," [...] when Huss, about to die, alluded to the Letter of Safe-conduct granted him, which was issuing in such fashion. [15th June, 1415.] Sigismund blushed; but could not {{conveniently}} mend the matter,--so many matters pressing on him just now. As they perpetually did, and had done. An always-hoping, never-resting, unsuccessful, vain and empty Kaiser. Specious, speculative; given to eloquence, diplomacy, and the windy instead of the solid arts;--always short of money for one thing. He roamed about, and talked eloquently;--aiming high, and generally missing:--how he went to conquer Hungary, and had to float down the Donau instead, with an attendant or two, in a most private manner, and take refuge with the Grand Turk: this we have seen, {{and this is a}} general emblem of him. Hungary and even the Reich have at length become his; but have brought small triumph in any kind; and instead of ready <b>money,</b> <b>debt</b> on debt. His Majesty has no money, and his Majesty's occasions need it more and more.|$|E

In Goodbye America Rowbotham argues that Third World debt is immoral, invalid, and inherently unrepayable. He argues that this 'unjust' debt should be canceled immediately.|$|E

Through a model of endogenous growth, the growth rates of all sectors are characterized in the perfect foresight equilibrium. Moreover, the impact on economic welfare of taxes and government spending to impulse technological change is assessed. Finally, in a simulation exercise, the initial optimal level of government spending (which maximizes welfare), in which the government should incur to adequately address technological change, is examined. endogenous growth, government spending, technological change, <b>money,</b> <b>debt.</b> ...|$|E

It also includes inside debt, which increases the likelihood of inflation being unstable. The paper further expands Tobin’s model and incorporates borrowing, debt repayment, and endogenous money.

50|$|In {{this book}} Soddy {{points out the}} {{fundamental}} difference between real wealth (consumables such as buildings, equipment, energy, food) and virtual wealth, {{in the form of}} <b>money</b> and <b>debt.</b> Soddy contends that real wealth is subject to entropy and will rot, rust, wear out, or be consumed over time, while <b>money</b> and <b>debt</b> (as artificial accounting devices) are subject only to the laws of mathematics, not the laws of thermodynamics. As debt compounding at some rate of interest, virtual wealth will grow effortlessly over time and without limit, instead of diminishing with use as does real wealth. Soddy uses actual occurring examples to demonstrate what he considers a major flaw of prevailing economic theory.|$|R
