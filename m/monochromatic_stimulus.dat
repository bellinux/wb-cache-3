Velocity judgments were also made for similar stimuli moving at the same average speed but without head movement. Both measures decreased to a minimum of about 30 – 40 % of the veridical values when the stimuli were equiluminous. Perceived depth and speed also decreased for a <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> {{as a function of}} luminance contrast but much more abruptly than for the chromatic stimuli. The results indicate that equiluminous color stimuli contribute to the perception of depth from motion parallax and that the contribution is not mediated by residual luminance...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the potential for}} the third-order aberrations coma and trefoil to provide a signed cue to accommodation. It is first demonstrated theoretically (with some assumptions) that the point spread function is insensitive to the sign of spherical defocus in the presence of odd-order aberrations. In an experimental investigation, the accommodation response to a sinusoidal change in vergence (1 – 3 D, 0. 2 Hz) of a <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> was obtained with a dynamic infrared optometer. Measurements were obtained in 10 young visually normal individuals with and without custom contact lenses that induced low and high values of r. m. s. trefoil (0. 25, 1. 03 μm) and coma (0. 34, 0. 94 μm). Despite variation between subjects, we did not find any statistically significant increase or decrease in the accommodative gain for low levels of trefoil and coma, although effects approached or reached significance for the high levels of trefoil and coma. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the presence of Zernike third-order aberrations on the eye does not seem to {{play a crucial role in}} the dynamics of the accommodation response...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhile the {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio) {{continues to}} become an important animal model for {{the investigation of the}} genetic and physiological bases of visual processing of the vertebrate retina, its visual behavior, particularly regarding color processing, has received little attention. The {{purpose of this study was}} to obtain behavioral spectral sensitivity functions from adult zebrafish using an appetitive instrumental conditioning procedure. A three-chamber maze was implemented to train light-adapted adult zebrafish to swim into the chamber that contained a suprathreshold <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> for a food reward. Visual threshold was determined by varying the stimulus irradiance using a ‘two-down one-up’ staircase procedure. Threshold values were obtained for wavelengths from 340 to 640 nm. Spectral sensitivity functions obtained show contributions from two nonopponent cone mechanisms (UV and S) and two opponent mechanisms (M–S and L–M). These cone mechanisms are qualitatively similar to those obtained via physiological measures from the On-responses of the zebrafish retina and optic tectum. However, the functions are not quantitatively similar suggesting that further visual processing takes place beyond the processing of the retinal circuitry and processing of the initial stages of the optic tectum. These results demonstrate that the zebrafish is an excellent model to examine and compare the relationship between physiological and behavioral color processing...|$|E

40|$|The {{difference}} between integral and separable interaction of dimensions {{is a classic}} problem in cognitive psychology (Garner, 1970; Shepard, 1964) and remains {{an essential component of}} most current experimental and theoretical analyses of category learning (e. g. Ashby & Maddox, 1994; Goldstone, 1994; Kruschke, 1993; Melara, Marks & Potts, 1993; Nosofsky, 1992). So far the problem has been addressed through post-hoc analysis in which empirical evidence of integral and separable processing is used to fit human data, showing how the impact of a pair of dimensions interacting in an integral or a separable manner enters into later learning processes. In this paper, we argue that a mechanistic connectionist explanation for variations in dimensional interactions can provide a new perspective through exploration of how similarities between stimuli are transformed from physical to psychological space when learning to identify, discriminate, and categorize them. We substantiate this claim by demonstrating how even a standard backpropagation network combined with a simple image-processing Gabor filter component provides limited but clear potential to process <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> that are composed of integral pairs of dimensions differently from <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> that are composed of separable pairs of dimensions. Interestingly, the responses from Gabor filters are shown to already capture most of the dimensional interaction, which in turn can be operated upon by the neural network during a given learning task. In addition, we introduce a basic attention mechanism to backpropagation that gives it the ability to selectively attend to relevant dimensions and illustrate how this serves the model in solving a filtration vs. condensation task (Kruschke, 1993).

40|$|Abstract Photoreception in the {{mammalian}} retina is {{not restricted}} to rods and cones but extends to {{a small number of}} intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells expressing the photopigment melanopsin.

40|$|In this article, a tetrachromatic {{colorimetric}} {{model is}} proposed. Four <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> {{are used as}} primaries instead of three to achieve colorimetric matches in mesopic vision. Tetrachromatic colorimetric matches are assumed {{in such a way}} so as to hold in both the photopic and the scotopic levels of adaptation. The fourth primary helps to balance the rod contribution in mesopic vision. The proposed model is based on the experimental observations that (a) trichromatic matches can be achieved in any light level and (b) once a tetrachromatic match is made, it holds at all radiances. The main outcome is that (a) only three channels in human vision system are important for color matching at mesopic and photopic levels and (b) additivity can be preserved at all levels once rod input is taken into account.

40|$|ABSTRACT (1) The {{spectral}} sensitivity function for the compound {{eye of the}} crayfish has been determined by recording the retinal action potentials elicited by <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Its peak lies at approximately 570 m/z.

(3) The crayfish sensitivity function, since it is unaffected by selective monochromatic light adaptation, must be determined by a single photosensitive pigment. The absorption maximum of this pigment may be inferred with reasonable accuracy from the sensitivity data. (4) The visual pigment of the crayfish thus has its maximum absorption displaced by 50 to 60 m ~ towards the red end of the spectrum from that of the lobster and other marine crustacea.

In this study, we investigated the wavelength dependency of the phototactic behavior of the parasitoid fly Exorista japonica and its possible mechanism. Multiple-choice tests with six <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> revealed that the flies were specifically attracted to violet light peaking at 405 nm, which was unexpected because insects are generally attracted to ultraviolet or green light. We measured the spectral sensitivity of the compound eye, and found that the sensitivity peaked at 340 nm, as in other brachyceran flies. We used statistical modeling and optimization of the process parameters to predict the type of photoreceptor contributing to the violet preference. The analysis revealed that the wavelength preference could be explained by linear models of the quanta received by photoreceptors, including the R 1 - 6 broadband receptors. The broadband receptors appear to contribute positively, whereas the R 7 - 8 narrowband receptors contribute negatively to achieve the violet preference; i. e., spectral opponency might be involved...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{spectral}} mechanism of color constancy (Part I of this series), the remaining nonspectral mechanism is formulated here in Part II by the constraint of correlation with known spectral illuminant–invariant functions, i. e., invariant wavelength ratios between constant hues, which plot straight parallel {{lines in the}} plane of wavelength and reciprocal illuminant color temperature (MK 21). The same is assumed to apply to nonspectral constant hues in the same plane and dominant wavelength scale extended to cover the nonspectrals (see accompanying article ‘‘Relative wavelength metric for the complete hue cycle [...] . ’’). To simplify analysis, stimuli are optimal aperture colors; their <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> lie between 442 and 613 nm, common boundaries with optimal compound stimuli (nonspectrals). It is shown that the wavelengths and invariant ratios of spectral constant hues can be formulated exactly (60. 5 %) from the ratios of an harmonic period, which shifts wavelength with MK 21. The formula implies this color-constant hue cycle is isomorphic across illuminants and allows prediction of nonspectral constant hues. To identify these colorimetrically, their spectral complementary wavelengths are specified for various illuminants. This completes the global color constancy mechanism for the illuminant color temperature range 2800 to 25, 000 K. 11 page(s...|$|R

Three different psychophysical tests, based on an operant conditioning paradigm, were used to confirm that colour perception in the wallaby can be predicted and conclusively explained by the existence of only two cone types.

Nine field sizes were tested, ranging from 0. 0096 to 0. 96 deg in diameter. The subjects used a percentage scale to judge the saturation of the flashed stimulus presentations (2 s on, 5 s off). The data analysis demonstrated that older observers require larger field sizes than younger observers to perceive hue as well as larger field sizes to reach the same level of scaled saturation. The spatial dependency of color appearance for younger and older observers was not correlated with senescent losses in retinal cells reported for the different retinal locations.

40|$|The {{instrumental}} {{spectral response}} function (ISRF) {{is a key}} quantity in DOAS analysis, as it is needed for wavelength calibration and for the convolution of trace gas cross sections to instrumental resolution. While it can generally be measured using <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimuli,</b> it is often parameterized in order to merge different calibration measurements and to plainly account for its wavelength de- pendency. For some instruments, the ISRF can be described appropriately by a Gaussian function, while for others, dedicated, complex parameterizations with several parameters have been developed. Here we propose to parameterize the ISRF as a “super-Gaussian”, which can reproduce a variety of shapes, from point-hat to boxcar shape, by just adding one parameter to the “classical” Gaussian. The super-Gaussian turned out to describe the ISRF of various DOAS instruments well, including the satellite instruments GOME- 2, OMI, and TROPOMI. In addition, the super-Gaussian allows for a straightforward parameterization {{of the effect of}} ISRF changes, which can occur on long-term scales as well as, for example, during one satellite orbit and impair the spectral analysis if ignored. In order to account for such changes, spectral structures are derived from the derivatives of the super-Gaussian, which are afterwards just scaled during spectral calibration or DOAS analysis. This approach significantly improves the fit quality compared to setups with fixed ISRF, without drawbacks on computation time due to the applied linearization. In addition, the wavelength dependency of the ISRF can be accounted for by accordingly derived spectral structures in an easy, fast, and robust way...|$|R

The corresponding color volumes for abnormal color vision were computed using models simulating for normal trichromatic observers the appearance for dichromats and anomalous trichomats. The number of colors perceived in each case was then computed from the color volumes enclosed by the optimal colors also known as MacAdam limits. It was estimated that dichromats perceive less than 1 % of the colors perceived by normal trichromats and that anomalous trichromats perceive 50 %– 60 % for anomalies in the medium-wavelength-sensitive and 60 %– 70 % for anomalies in the long-wavelength-sensitive cones. Complementary estimates obtained similarly for the spectral locus of <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> suggest less impairment for color-deficient observers, a fact that is explained by the two-dimensional nature of the locus.

Blue (shortest wavelength) light is scattered in fog to the greatest extent, causing deterioration of vision quality especially for the <b>monochromatic</b> blue <b>stimuli.</b> However, for the color stimuli presented on a white background, visual acuity in fog for blue Landolt-C optotypes was higher than for red and green optotypes on the white background. The luminance of color Landolt-C optotypes presented on a LCD screen was chosen corresponding to the blue, green, and red color contributions in achromatic white stimuli (computer digital R, G, or B values for chromatic stimuli equal to RGB values in the achromatic white background) that results in the greatest luminance contrast for the whiteblue stimuli, thus advancing the visual acuity for the white-blue stimuli. Besides such blue stimuli on the white background are displayed with a uniform, spatially unmodulated distribution of the screen blue phosphor emission over the entire area of the screen including the stimulus C optotype area.

In both the principal eyes and all of the secondary eyes, the spectral response curves show a prominent green peak at 520 or 540 nm and a shoulder in the ultraviolet between 340 and 380 nm. The largest response in the ultraviolet measures between 65 % and 80 % of the green peak. Selective chromatic adaptation to either green or ultraviolet monochromatic light does not change these relative response levels and fails to indicate the presence of more than one spectral type of receptor. In the range 450 – 500 nm, however, the Dartnall curve clearly deviates from the spectral sensitivity (SS) curve. Since the SS curves of all eyes have a small shoulder in the blue at 480 nm, the existence of two or even three visual pigments is a possibility.

To understand the mechanisms that drive the evolution and design of such visual signals, {{it is important to understand}} the visual systems and potential response biases of signal receivers. Here, we provide raw data on the spectral capabilities of a coral reef fish, the Picasso triggerfish Rhinecanthus aculeatus, which is potentially trichromatic with three cone sensitivities of 413 nm (single cone), 480 nm (double cone, medium sensitivity) and 528 nm (double cone, long sensitivity), and a rod sensitivity of 498 nm. The ocular media have a 50 % transmission cut off at 405 nm. Behavioural experiments confirmed colour vision over their spectral range; triggerfish were significantly more likely to choose coloured stimuli over grey distractors, irrespective of luminance. We then examined whether response biases existed towards coloured and patterned stimuli to provide insight into how visual signals - in particular, aposematic colouration - may evolve. Triggerfish showed a preferential foraging response bias to red and green stimuli, in contrast to blue and yellow, irrespective of pattern. There was no response bias to patterned over <b>monochromatic</b> non-patterned <b>stimuli.</b> A foraging response bias towards red in fish differs from that of avian predators, who often avoid red food items.

In particular, the aim was to explore a possible role of melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) in visual processes and to assess their role in modulating brain responses during cognitive tasks, as in LHON patients {{it has been shown that}} mRGCs are relatively spared despite the general RGCs degeneration. Eleven LHON patients, and eleven matched healthy controls, underwent an fMRI protocol (1. 5 T MR scanner) that included purely visual stimulation and the combination n of a sustained attention task and light stimulation, both with blue (480 nm) and red (620 nm) light exposures of equivalent photon flux (5 x 1013 ph cm− 2 s− 1). Overall, lower activations of primary visual cortex in response to purely visual stimuli were observed in LHON compared to healthy subjects, and this is in line with the disease. When considering sustained brain response to <b>monochromatic</b> light <b>stimuli</b> (of 10 and 50 s of duration), a higher cortical activity was found in LHON in response to blue rather than to red light, and only when considering blue light no differences between the two groups were observed. Moreover, a prominent modulation of brain responses to a cognitive sustained attention task was found under blue light exposure compared to the red one, both in cortical and subcortical areas. These results provide support to the relatively new hypothesis of melanopsin role in visual processes, and they give a confirmation of the maintained functionality of mRGCs in modulating brain activity during cognitive engagement for LHON patients, as it was previously shown for healthy subjects...|$|R
40|$|Intrinsically {{photosensitive}} retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), whose photopigment melanopsin has a peak {{of sensitivity}} in the short wavelength range of the spectrum, constitute a common light input pathway to the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), the pupillary light reflex (PLR) regulatory centre, and to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the major pacemaker of the circadian system. Thus, evaluating PLR under short wavelength light (λmax ≤ 500 nm) and creating an integrated PLR parameter, as a possible tool to indirectly assess {{the status of the}} circadian system, becomes of interest. Nine <b>monochromatic,</b> photon-matched light <b>stimuli</b> (300 s), in 10 nm increments from λmax 420 to 500 nm were administered to 15 healthy young participants (8 females), analyzing: i) the PLR; ii) wrist temperature (WT) and motor activity rhythms (WA), iii) light exposure (L) pattern and iv) diurnal preference (Horne-Östberg), sleep quality (Pittsburgh) and daytime sleepiness (Epworth). Linear correlations between the different PLR parameters and circadian status index obtained from WT, WA and L recordings and scores from questionnaires were calculated. In summary, we found markers of robust circadian rhythms, namely high stability, reduced fragmentation, high amplitude, phase advance and low internal desynchronization, were correlated with a reduced PLR to 460 - 490 nm wavelengths. Integrated circadian (CSI) and PLR (cp-PLR) parameters are proposed, that also showed an inverse correlation. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of a close relationship between the circadian system robustness and the pupillary reflex response, two non-visual functions primarily under melanopsin-ipRGC input...|$|R

After hatch, 120 day-old male chicks from each group were housed under white light with an intensity of 30 lx at bird-head level. Compared with the dark condition, chicks incubated under the green light showed significantly higher growth hormone (GH) levels from 19 d of embryogenesis (E 19) to 5 d of posthatch (H 5), and higher plasma insulinlike growth factor (IGF-I) levels from both E 17 to E 19 and H 3 to H 35. No significant differences were found in plasma thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and testosterone in embryos or hatched birds between the 2 groups. These results indicate that somatotropic axis hormones (GH and IGF-I) {{may be the most important}} contributor to chicken growth promoted by green light stimuli during embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Eyes with distant {{objects in}} focus in {{daylight}} {{are thought to}} become myopic in dim light. This phenomenon, often called "night myopia" has been studied extensively for several decades. However, despite its general acceptance, its magnitude and causes are still controversial. A series of experiments were performed to understand night myopia in greater detail. METHODS: We used an adaptive optics instrument operating in invisible infrared light to elucidate the actual magnitude of night myopia and its main causes. The experimental setup allowed the manipulation of the eye's aberrations (and particularly spherical aberration) {{as well as the}} use of <b>monochromatic</b> and polychromatic <b>stimuli.</b> Eight subjects with normal vision monocularly determined their best focus position subjectively for a Maltese cross stimulus at different levels of luminance, from the baseline condition of 20 cd/m(2) to the lowest luminance of 22 × 10 (- 6) cd/m(2). While subjects performed the focusing tasks, their eye's defocus and aberrations were continuously measured with the 1050 -nm Hartmann-Shack sensor incorporated in the adaptive optics instrument. The experiment was repeated for a variety of controlled conditions incorporating specific aberrations of the eye and chromatic content of the stimuli. RESULTS: We found large inter-subject variability and an average of - 0. 8 D myopic shift for low light conditions. The main cause responsible for night myopia was the accommodation shift occurring at low light levels. Other factors, traditionally suggested to explain night myopia, such as chromatic and spherical aberrations, have a much smaller effect in this mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: An adaptive optics visual analyzer was applied to study the phenomenon of night myopia. We found that the defocus shift occurring in dim light is mainly due to accommodation errors...|$|R
40|$|EN]In {{the present}} thesis, {{composed}} of four chapters, we studied {{different aspects of}} the visual system of two pollinator species: Bombus terrestris (bumblebee) and Macroglossum stellatarum (hummingbird hawkmoth). Some studies have already investigated the visual system, behaviour and cognition of both species at different levels. Yet, much information is missing. In the four chapters of this thesis we studied the behaviour of both species, with differences concerning the sensorial system and the applied methodology. In the first two chapters we investigated the behaviour of Bombus terrestris while performing tasks related with discrimination and detection of artificial flowers. In in the last two chapters we studied basic and fundamental aspects of the visual system of Macroglossum stellatarum: the spectral sensitivity and the colour discrimination capacity. Despite the fact that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and honeybees (Apis mellifera) are related species, comparative studies have shown differences in many aspects of their behaviour related with the use of visual information. Flowers are diverse and so is the foraging behaviour of pollinators. These can employ different strategies and modulate their behaviour to select, detect and discriminate the most rewarding flowers. Macroglossum stellatarum has been considered as an important pollinator of many plants in Europe; yet, basic information about its visual system remained unknown until the development of this thesisFloral visitors are often required to make comparative judgments between flowers, based on, mainly, visual differences between them. Models of colour vision attempt to predict the ease with which animals can discriminate between colours with different spectral properties. The predictions of models are based on the perceptual distance between two colours, where small perceptual distances indicate that discrimination will be difficult, while large perceptual distances mean that discrimination will be easy. There is, in principle, no obvious reason to use one model over the other, but due to models’ formulation and assumptions, predictions can diverge. In the first chapter, we focused on the predictions of different colour vision models and tested how well they adjust to the bumblebee behaviour during a flower discrimination task. We selected four pairs of artificial flowers differing in their perceptual distances (chromatic information) according to two models, while being similar according to a third one. Achromatic contrasts (brightness and green contrast) between flowers were also measured and incorporated into the analyses. Bumblebees were divided between pairs of artificial flowers and trained to discriminate between the two colours of the pair. One of the colours carried the reward (sucrose solution), while the other a punishment (quinine). We measured the time bumblebees took to find the rewarding flowers, as well as the accuracy (measured as the proportion of correct choices). The time that bees required to select a flower and the proportion of correct choices differed between pairs: decision times decreased as achromatic contrast increased, and the proportion of correct choices increased with achromatic contrast and perceptual distance. First, these results suggest that both chromatic and achromatic contrasts affected the discriminability of colour pairs and second, that model predictions are not always in agreement with the animal behaviour. Since flower colour affects the foraging choices of bees and foraging choices affect the reproductive success of plants, a better understanding of which model is more accurate is required to predict bee behaviour and the ecological implications of flower choice and colour. As well as colour, the size of the flowers constrains bumblebee behaviour during the foraging activity when flowers are presented in homogeneous backgrounds. When flowers are big, search time correlates with the colour contrast between flowers and background. When colour contrast or flowers are small, bees take longer to detect these flowers against a homogeneous green background and adjust their behaviour in several ways. Besides vision, olfaction is another important sensory modality that bees use during the foraging activity. Therefore, in the second chapter we studied the effect of colour, size, training and {{the presence or absence of}} a second cue (odour) on bumblebee behaviour while detecting and discriminating flowers presented against a complex background. Bumblebees looking for blue flowers were more accurate, flew faster, followed more direct paths between flowers (travelling less distances) and needed less time to find them, than bumblebees looking for red flowers. When exploiting red flowers they made more errors and required more time to find flowers, although performance increased with experience and with the presence of odour. The size of flowers alone did not directly affect the bumblebee behaviour; however, when combined with colour it had an effect. Bumblebees took longer to find big red flowers. These flowers, had the smallest chromatic contrast with the background, and although the achromatic contrast exceeded that of the blue flowers, the efficiency in detection is not comparable between channels (chromatic and achromatic). The perception of stimuli was mainly affected by the chromatic contrast between the flowers and the complex background, but the difficulty imposed by this combination could be compensated by the presence of a second cue (odour), or the amount of received training. Our results differ from those found in a similar experiment using homogeneous green background and we present possible reasons in the discussion of the chapter. In recent years many studies have been done on the visual system of some floral visitors (especially bees and to some extent butterflies and Syrphids), raising the understanding about mechanisms and functions involved in visual perception. Nevertheless, for most species many basic aspects remain unclear. Macroglossum stellatarum is a diurnal floral visitor – of the otherwise mainly crepuscular Sphingidae family – with demonstrated learning abilities. Macroglossum stellatarum can easily be raised in laboratory, which makes this moth an excellent candidate for studies in environments under controlled conditions. Previous experiments have suggested that M. stellatarum possesses true colour vision, with receptors sensitive in the ultraviolet (UV), blue and green areas of the spectrum. The moth has demonstrated innate preferences and broad colour discrimination capacity over some ranges of the hypothetical visible spectrum. However, the spectral sensitivity of the retinal photoreceptors remains unknown, as well as their peak absorbance. If we aim to understand an animal’s behaviour by carrying out colour vision experiments, we first have to comprehend how animals perceive their environment and distinguish different visual stimuli. In the third chapter we therefore characterised the spectral sensitivity of the hummingbird hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum and established the peak absorbance of its photoreceptors, using behavioural tests and electroretinogram (ERGs) analyses. By measuring ERGs we determined that M. stellatarum has ultraviolet (UV), blue and green receptors maximally sensitive at 349, 440 and 521 nm. To determine the behavioural spectral sensitivity (action spectrum), we trained moths to associate an illuminated disk with a food reward, and a dark disk with no reward. While the spectral positions of sensitivity maxima found in behavioural tests agree with model predictions based on the ERG data, the sensitivity to blue light was 30 times higher than expected. We relate this higher sensitivity with the moth’s innate preference for blue colour and present a general discussion about results within the chapter. Despite the innate preference for particular colours, M. stellatarum feeds from a variety of flower species and prefers colour over scent when given the opportunity to choose. Given the importance of the spectral properties of flowers for this moth, and knowing the spectral sensitivity of its photoreceptors, the moth’s capacity to discriminate between similar wavelengths is of interesting. Wavelength discrimination is defined as the ability of an organism to discriminate between perceptually close <b>monochromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> In the context of foraging, this capacity can result advantageous, especially for insects demanding high energy intakes such as M. stellatarum due to its hovering behaviour while feeding. In the fourth chapter we tested the capacity of M. stellatarum to discriminate between similar wavelengths. We trained moths to associate specific monochromatic lights with a reward. Wavelength selection was based on the moth’s photoreceptors peaks and overlapping areas, determined in the chapter three. Once a monochromatic light was associated with a reward, moths were tested in a dual choice experiment, in which the rewarding wavelength was presented together with an unrewarding wavelength, initially 20 nm longer or shorter than the trained wavelength. Besides two expected pronounced minima (where photoreceptors overlap), M. stelattarum presented a third minimum between the peak of blue receptor and the inflexion curve of the green receptor. We used a colour vision model to predict the discrimination capabilities of the moth and to compare it with the behavioural data. Moth´s behavioural minima were similar to those predicted by the colour vision model, but the model did not predict a third less pronounced minimum of discrimination found during the behavioural tests. Minima of wavelength discrimination in M. stellatarum were smaller than those found for the honeybees (Apis mellifera), approaching values found for a tetrachromatic butterfly (Papilio xuthus). In that chapter, we discuss the differences in the discrimination capacity of those floral visitors tested so far, while integrating new perspectives for this type of experiments: the use of achromatic information. The sensory capacity of floral visitors has helped to shape and increase the variability of the flower signals. However, for many floral visitors, the sensorial system capacity and also its limits are not well understood, and for many others, it remains largely unexplored. It results difficult to interpret the behaviour of a floral visitor within a plant community if we do not properly understand the mechanisms modulating this relationship. The results of the present thesis raise the understanding of the visual systems of two important pollinator species in Europe, the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) and the diurnal hummingbird hawkmoth (Macroglossum stellatarum). For years, experiments using the honeybee helped to build an understanding of insect vision, but similar information for the vast majority of floral visitors remains unknown. The present thesis shows that the visual capacity of each species is unique. The evolutionary processes that have shaped the sensory ability of floral visitors are unclear, but the importance of behavioural studies in the plant-pollinator context is essential, not only because of the economic value of the pollination service, but also to properly understand the mechanisms linking the plant-pollinator relationship.
