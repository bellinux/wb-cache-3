On Earth, the <b>main</b> <b>jet</b> streams are {{located near the}} altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape. Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to {{the direction of the}} remainder of the jet.|$|E

30|$|To {{solve that}} problem, the {{coherent}} jet {{technology has been}} applied to electric arc furnace steelmaking process (Liu et al. 2005; Mathur 1999 a), which could prolong the length of potential core and increase the kinetic energy of the <b>main</b> oxygen <b>jet.</b> The key of this technology is suppressing the ambient gas to interact with <b>main</b> oxygen <b>jet</b> by a shrouding flame. Therefore, the oxygen jet could keep original diameter and velocity over long distance, and remain the stirring ability. Moreover, with the greater penetration capacity, the supersonic oxygen jet could deliver greater amounts of oxygen into the molten bath and decrease the splash of liquid slag, comparing with the traditional supersonic oxygen lance (Nordquist et al. (2006); Mahoney (2008)).|$|R

An extensive experimental program has been conducted on a model simulating Assuite Barrages in Hydraulic Research Institute (HRI). It is found that the percentage area of reverse flow is dependent on the expansion ratio and the Froude number under gates, but the major effect is on the expansion ratio. Statistical model was developed, to predict the percentage area of reverse flow. It is recommended to control the area of reverse flow by control facilities which distribute the flow uniformly in lateral direction...|$|R
