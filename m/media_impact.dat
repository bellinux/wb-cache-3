According to Vatican spokesman Father Thomas Rosica, the Pope met with several dozen other people, and rosaries were also given to others in attendance; Davis was not invited by the Pope to the Nunciature and [...] "the meeting may have been manipulated by her and her lawyer". The only audience given by the Pope while in Washington was with a former student of his, an openly gay Argentine named Yayo Grassi and Grassi's same-sex partner of 19 years. Observers speculated whether the Pope had not been informed of Davis' controversy or if the Vatican had underestimated the <b>media</b> <b>impact</b> that such a meeting would cause.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of social <b>media</b> poses tremendous <b>impact</b> on brand equity. Yet, systematic studies regarding how social <b>media</b> <b>impacts</b> brand equity is limited. As a result, managers and executives cannot make {{full use of}} the branding opportunities or mitigate risks. This paper is devoted to closing this gap. As the major reason why many executives are reluctant or unable to develop effective social media strategies {{is due to a}} lack of understanding about it, thus this paper illustrates in detail what social media is. In order to find out how social <b>media</b> <b>impacts</b> brand equity, a quantitative research is conducted to study brand equity factors based on Aaker’s brand equity model, find out each factor’s individual contribution to brand equity and social <b>media’s</b> <b>impact</b> on those individual factors. A clear understanding of how social <b>media</b> <b>impacts</b> brand equity is formed at the end of the research. Based on these insightful findings, recommendations are provided for organizations with a vision to enhance brand equity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} mass <b>media’s</b> <b>impact</b> on citizens’ {{confidence}} in political institutions.

The model explains how the relationship between political reality perceptions that trace back to media coverage and political preferences derived by socialization in a political culture accounts for variations in political confidence at the individual level. The paper also develops a distinct set of specific media frames that correspond to a variety of political preferences as well as aspects of political legitimation. The model contributes to further specifications of the relationship between mediated political information and political attitudes...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic, ubiquitous, {{and often}} {{real-time}} interaction enabled by social media significantly changes the landscape for brand management. A {{deep understanding of}} this change is critical since it may affect a brand's performance substantially. Literature about social <b>media's</b> <b>impact</b> on brands is evolving, but lacks a systematic identification of key challenges related to managing brands in this new environment. This paper reviews existing research and introduces a framework of social <b>media's</b> <b>impact</b> on brand management. It argues that consumers are becoming pivotal authors of brand stories due to new dynamic networks of consumers and brands formed through social media and the easy sharing of brand experiences in such networks. Firms {{need to pay attention}} to such consumer-generated brand stories to ensure a brand's success in the marketplace. The authors identify key research questions related to the phenomenon and the challenges in coordinating consumer- and firm-generated brand stories...|$|R

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of communication media and technologies available, {{it is important for}} teams to understand the influence of these media on the performance of their communications. Additionally, it is important for researchers to understand how teams choose and use media. Literature on communication <b>media</b> <b>impacts</b> and communication performance has been somewhat fragmented, and researchers have used different theories and paradigms to study this problem. Researchers still do not have a full understanding of how media influences communication, whether teams recognize and select appropriate media for their communication needs, and what makes some communication more effective, irrespective of the communication media. The overall objectives of this research are to help managers and teams achieve greater communication performance and fill gaps in and strengthen <b>media</b> <b>impacts</b> and communication performance literature. The specific purposes of this research are to determine how well teams understand and select communication media, to consolidate and refine <b>media</b> <b>impacts</b> theory, and to better recognize and understand factors that contribute to superior performance. This research consists of three essays. In the first essay, we study teams 2 ̆ 7 media choices when they are faced with specific communication needs. We found that teams base their media choices on convenience and ease of use rather than on the needs of the communication. We also found that communication performance was not as affected by the medium as prevailing theories would predict. In the second essay, we take a deeper look at <b>media</b> <b>impacts</b> and outcomes of media use. In an effort to evaluate, consolidate, and refine existing media theory, we conducted team experiments where teams used several types of media. We did not find significant performance effects of the communication media. We argue that the medium may not matter as much as previously supposed. The third essay involves a qualitative analysis of communication and communication performance. We use a case-study approach to identify factors that contribute to superior performance. We find that other individual process factors play a role in communication performance and decision quality. We also find that the media does not have much of an effect on communication processes...|$|R
