40|$|Nowadays, due to {{excellent}} {{advantages of}} permanent magnet brushless (PMBL) motors {{such as high}} efficiency and high torque/power density, they are used in many industrial and variable-speed electrical drives applications. If the fabricated PMBL motor has neither ideal sinusoidal nor ideal trapezoidal back-EMF voltages, it is named nonideal (or nonsinusoidal) PMBL motor. Employing conventional control strategies of PMSMs and BLDCMs lowers the efficiency and leads to unwanted torque ripple, vibration, and acoustic noises. Moreover, in many applications {{to reduce the cost}} and enhance the reliability of drive, sensorless control techniques are used. This paper proposes a novel sensorless control for a nonsinusoidal PMBL motor with minimum torque ripple. To develop smooth torque, the selected torque harmonic elimination strategy is employed. Furthermore, to estimate the rotor position and speed, a novel full-order sliding mode observer is designed. Proposed observer estimates the position and speed of <b>motor</b> from <b>standstill</b> to final speed. The proposed observer is robust to uncertainty of harmonic contents in phase back-EMF voltage and able to run the <b>motor</b> from <b>standstill</b> with closed-loop control scheme. The capabilities of torque ripple minimization and sensorless strategies are demonstrated with some simulations...|$|R

The influence of geometrical and physical parameters on the operating conditions of a TLIM are investigated by means a quasi-analytic model.

5000|$|The {{shape and}} depth of the rotor bars {{can be used to}} vary the speed-torque {{characteristics}} of the induction <b>motor.</b> At <b>standstill,</b> the revolving magnetic field passes the rotor bars at a high rate, inducing line-frequency current into the rotor bars. Due to the skin effect, the induced current tends to flow at {{the outer edge of the}} winding. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency decreases and induced current flows at greater depths in the winding. By tapering the profile of the rotor bars to vary their resistance at different depths, or by constructing a double squirrel cage, the motor can be arranged to produce more or less torque at standstill and near its synchronous speed.|$|R

40|$|Sensorless {{control of}} {{permanent}} magnet (PM) <b>motors</b> at <b>standstill</b> and low speed is very challenging to implement. In this paper, a methodology {{to design and}} optimize the position detection strategy of PM motors using transient finite-element analysis (FEA) of magnetic field is presented. It addresses effects arising from both the iron core saturation and the transient characteristics of signals. A combined inductance which is sensitive to the rotor position throughout the complete cycle is proposed for the realization of position detection. The advantage of the proposed novel algorithm is that the rotor's position at low speeds down to standstill can be easily and robustly detected.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the sensorless selfcommissioning of {{synchronous}} reluctance <b>motors</b> at <b>standstill.</b> Previous work demonstrated that the injection of high test voltage pulses can be successfully {{used to determine the}} flux linkage maps of the Synchronous Reluctance machine without position transducer and with no need of rotor locking. In this work, the tuning aspects of the above self-commissioning technique are analyzed for making it self-tuning. A method for detecting unwanted rotor movement during the test is introduced and used to assess the test's end and to maximize the id, iq area of inspection. Furthermore, the paper analyzes a number of theoretical and practical implementation issues, first mathematically and then in experiments. The effects of possible error sources are evaluated, including imprecise estimation of the stator resistance and of the inverter voltage distortion, and iron loss.

40|$|Abstract. Load-commutated {{inverters}} (LCIs) {{are the key}} {{starting device}} of wound-field synchronous motor. By detecting the rotor position and inputting a variable frequent current to the stator windings, the LCI can drive the <b>motor</b> from <b>standstill</b> to a given speed. Thus, rotor position detecting method comes {{to be the key}} techniques, but at the ultra-low speed period, the motor’s terminal voltage is too low to accurately sampling and is vulnerable to the interference, which brings risks to the variable frequency driving. In this paper, through analyzing the principles of LCIs and synchronous machine, a constant frequency electrical angle control methods is introduced to solve the difficulty of detecting the rotor position in the low speed period. A 98 MW synchronous machine driven with an 18 MW LCI are experimented in MATLAB and RTDS systems, the results show that the proposed control strategy can realize soft-start of the wound-field synchronous motor without detecting rotor’s position...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} novel method designed to detect rotor position by decoding received information in two different techniques for switched reluctance <b>motor</b> at <b>standstill</b> and also low speeds. These decoding techniques are namely, digital pulse width modulation (DPWM) decoder and digital pulse position modulation (DPPM) decoder. This method begins by connecting a small capacitor in series with each motor phase winding. The supply voltage {{in conjunction with the}} drive transistor produces a short pulse for each phase capacitor. Since the phase inductance varies with the rotor position, the rise time of the voltage produced on each capacitor changes as well. Next, the capacitor voltages are compared with some pre-set voltage values and the rotor position is detected at standstill mode. The number of pre-set voltage values varies for each technique. It then continues to sense the rotor position while the motor is running by applying the same procedure, but only to the un-energized phases windings. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the method...|$|R

The paper starts by addressing the issue of the parameter identification in a PWM inverter-fed IM at standstill. Then the solution which makes the identification free from the inverter voltage drop is illustrated and the procedure built upon it is formulated. At last, the equipment arranged for executing the identification tests is described and the results obtained from the experiments are shown...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a complete self-tunable method for detecting the rotor position at low, high, and standstill speeds under different motor power ratings in a switched reluctance motor (SRM). In this method, high frequency diagnostic pulses with different pulse widths are applied to the three-stator pole windings and then the proper size pulse width is determined for that particular <b>motor</b> at <b>standstill.</b> At low speeds, the rotor positions are then sensed with the selected pulse width by applying the pulse to the un-energized phase winding while sensing the rotor position from the resulting phase winding current magnitude. At high speeds (beyond motor rated speed) the rotor position is detected by the current magnitude produced by the injected pulse {{and at the same time}} advancing the phase on time according to the motor speed. The designed controller is tested on different motor ratings ranging from 20 W to 2 KW. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the method, this controller is applied in a vacuum cleaner with a switched reluctance motor.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} detect the rotor position of permanent-magnet <b>motors</b> at <b>standstill,</b> which is suitable to avoid temporary reverse rotation at startup or starting failure. The approach {{is based on the}} investigation of the stator inductance variation {{as a function of the}} rotor magnets position and the stator current space vector. It involves the application of a proper sequence of voltage pulses to the stator windings, and the measurement of the peak values of the resulting current in order to achieve the rotor position estimation. Actually, the current measurements show significant uncertainties which affect the rotor position detection. In order to avoid these problems, the authors propose a novel procedure which combines an iterative sequence of voltage pulses with a fuzzy logic processing of the current responses and phase currents derivation based on the DC-link current measurements. The proposed method has been implemented on a μC digital signal processor (TMS 320 F 240). The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution. It can be applied in sensorless drives, in drives equipped with nonabsolute position transducers, with a wide range of motors, and it does not require the knowledge of any of the motor parameters...|$|R

40|$|As {{with all}} motors, the {{performance}} of an induction <b>motor</b> while at <b>standstill,</b> whether {{in the course of}} a normal starting sequence or as a result of stall, is of crucial importance to a designer. Since the motor is under full voltage, a fast temperature rise may occur in different parts of the motor before the power source is isolated, or substantial acceleration occurs. This may damage some parts of the motor, or cause a premature aging of the electric insulation in various parts of the motor, in particular the stator winding. In addition, in applications where the motor is surrounded by a potentially explosive atmosphere, an unexpected temperature rise at any point in a motor may be enough to ignite the existing mixture of gases. To avoid such phenomena, the temperature distribution in the motor should be predicted as accurately as possible to ensure reliable protection of the motor against overheating in critical points. This work is an attempt to improve the accuracy of prediction of transient temperature distribution in an induction motor, with particular attention to the modelling of deep-bar cage motors.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} modeling, {{simulation}} {{and implementation of}} Load Commutated SCR based current source Inverter (LCI) fed squirrel cage induction motor drive with sinusoidal voltage and sinusoidal current. In the proposed system, the induction motor is fed by an LCI. A three level diode clamped voltage source inverter (VSI) is connected at the motor terminal with ac chokes connected in series with it. The VSI currents are controlled {{in such a manner}} that it injects the reactive current demanded by the induction motor and the LCI for successful commutation of the SCRs in the LCI. Additionally, it absorbs the harmonic frequency currents to ensure that the induction motor draws sinusoidal current. As a result, the nature of the motor terminal voltage is also sinusoidal. The concept of load commutation of the SCRs in the LCI feeding an induction motor load is explained with necessary waveforms and phasor diagrams. The necessity of reactive compensation by the active filter connected at the motor terminal for the load commutation of the thyristors, is elaborated with the help of analytical equations and phasor diagrams. The requirement of harmonic compensation by the same active filter to achieve sinusoidal motor current and motor voltage, is also described. Finally, to achieve the aforementioned induction motor drive, the VA ratings of the active filter (VSI) and the CSI with respect to VA rating of the motor, are determined theoretically. The proposed drive scheme is simulated under idealized condition. Simulation results show good steady state and dynamic response of the drive system. Load commutation of the SCRs in the LCI and the sinusoidal profile of motor current and voltage, have been demonstrated. As in LCI fed synchronous motor drives, a special mode of operation is required to run up the induction <b>motor</b> from <b>standstill.</b> As the SCRs of the LCI are load commutated, they need motor terminal voltages for commutation. At standstill these voltages are zero. So, a starting strategy has been proposed and adopted to start the motor with the aid of the current controlled VSI to accelerate until the motor terminal voltages are high enough for the commutation of the SCRs in the LCI. The proposed drive is implemented on an experimental setup in the laboratory. The IGBT based three level diode clamped VSI has been fabricated following the design of the standard module in the laboratory. A generalized digital control platform is also developed using a TMS 320 F 2407 A DSP. Two, three phase thyristor bridges with necessary firing pulse circuits have been used as the phase controlled rectifier and the LCI respectively. Appropriate protection scheme for such a drive is developed and adopted to operate the drive. Relevant experimental results are presented. They are observed to be in good agreement with the simulation results. The effect of capacitors connected at the output of the LCI in the commutation process of the SCRs in the LCI is studied and analyzed. From the analysis, it is understood that the capacitors form a parallel resonating pair with filter inductor and the motor leakage inductance, which results in an undesired oscillation in the terminal voltage during each of the commutation intervals leading to commutation failure. So, in the final system, the capacitors are removed to eliminate any chance of commutation failure of the SCRs in the LCI. It is shown by experiment that the commutation of the SCRs takes place reliably {{in the absence of the}} capacitors also. The commutation process is studied and analyzed without the capacitors to understand the motor terminal voltage waveform of the experimental results...|$|R
