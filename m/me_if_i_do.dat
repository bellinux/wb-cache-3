500|$|One day, whilst {{working on}} On the 6, Jennifer Lopez [...] "happened to be" [...] {{recording}} {{at the same}} recording studio where American recording artist Marc Anthony was recording. Anthony, who had become intrigued by Lopez after seeing her in Selena (1997), came into her studio {{and asked her to}} appear in the music video for his song [...] "No Me Conoces". She agreed, but only if he recorded a song with her, to which he in turn agreed. Lopez recalled the events on her [...] video album by stating: [...] "So at that time I called Tommy [...] and I'm like 'Look, so Marc Anthony said he would do a song and I really don't want to do a duet with just anybody, I want to do a duet with him. So can you force him to sign something, so he has to do a record with <b>me?</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this video!'". The two first shot the video and then began working on the song.|$|E
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. You {{mean you}} can tell Bentley about <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{is quite}} well, thank you,' said Painted Jaguar; 'but you must forgive <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not at this}} precise moment recall your name.' ...|$|E
60|$|An oath, and {{a threat}} to set Throttler on <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not 'frame off' rewarded my perseverance.|$|R
6000|$|... "For one thing, I was curious; then it wasn't worth {{while to}} spoil her plan. I didn't think Ellen would persuade <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not approve." ...|$|R
60|$|EDITH [austerely] I {{never said}} {{anything}} of the sort. I never stoop to mere vituperation: what would my girls say of <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did?</b> <b>I</b> chose my words most carefully. I said they were tyrants, liars, and thieves; and so they are. Slattox is even worse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems like I've {{got some}} push to <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it, don't it?" [...] Master Plummer replied, complacently, {{and there the}} {{conversation}} came to an end.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{say what}} I meant to. I have reasons for--" [...] (he paused again)--"Then you are pleased {{with the way the}} people treat you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hillo! lad," [...] cried Amyas; [...] "come hither {{and deliver}} {{me out of}} the hands of this fire-eater, who I verily believe will kill <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not let him kill some one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the meantime. I can't go {{home until}} I'm {{able to run}} the farm without your sister's help. There's some risk of her despising <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> go." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{are very}} right, I have {{neglected}} my absent friends, but <b>do</b> not think <b>I</b> have forgot them, and indeed {{it would be}} ungrateful in <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not write to them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} had more faith in my old friend Gratiot," [...] he said; [...] "but you will pardon <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{recognize}} at once the statesman he had sent me, Mr. Ritchie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I look {{a little}} upset?" [...] asked Allan, taking his arm, and leading him on again. [...] "Don't make {{yourself}} nervous about <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> My head feels wild and giddy, but I shall soon get over it." ...|$|E
60|$|HIGGINS. Well, dash <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do!</b> I've {{had to work}} at {{the girl}} every day for months to get her to her present pitch. Besides, she's useful. She knows where my things are, and remembers my {{appointments}} and so forth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{it is your}} gift! But I am frightened--it {{must have}} cost--!' began Genevieve, still a little on her guard. 'Dear, dear Miss Sophy, forgive <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> seem ungrateful, but indeed I ought to ask--if--if it is all your own gift?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Ebbo, I {{was very}} angry {{that he should have}} half killed you when he could so easily have spoken one word. Heaven forgive <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> wrong, but <b>I</b> could not help it." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time Captain Hannock was letting forth {{a flood of}} vile {{language}} at everything and everybody. He {{wanted to know who}} had aided me to escape and he threatened to shoot <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not turn around and swim back.|$|R
60|$|Just at the {{conclusion}} of the dessert, madame, who had bouded Berry during dinner-time, became particularly gracious to her lord and master, and tenderly asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think the French custom was a good one, of men leaving table with the ladies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not agree}} with you, King Kaliko," [...] {{answered}} the boy. [...] "However difficult and dangerous my task may be, I cannot leave your dominions until every effort to release my parents has failed and left me completely discouraged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, Monsieur Clayton," [...] he said, in French. [...] "You will pardon <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not speak to}} you in English. I am just {{learning}} it, and while I understand it fairly well I speak it very poorly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank ye," [...] cried Thorpe, [...] "but I did {{not come}} to Bath to drive my sisters about, and look like a fool. No, if you do not go, d---- <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I only go for the sake of driving you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you {{can speak}} thus {{of such a}} risk!" [...] said Foster. [...] "You keep a stout heart, Master Varney. For <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hope to live many years, and to have time for the great work of repentance, I would not go forward with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yessum," [...] Mrs. Barmberry contributed, [...] "he told <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> catch you, <b>I</b> was to {{have some}} new-killed {{chickens}} ready to fry, and some whipped cream---- Jim Barmberry, you go right out and finish whipping that cream, and don't stand there gawping and gooping, and you children, you scat!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he won't kill min," [...] I said reassuringly, [...] "and he's {{going too}} fast to hear <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> call him. <b>If</b> you can stop the dog, Mr. Bennett, I'll {{guarantee}} to make William Adolphus listen to reason, but there's no use trying to argue with a lightning flash." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha!--What, veechy," [...] exclaimed Cuffe, laughing--"you unearth {{them like}} so many foxes to-night. Now, Griffin, hang <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think I've seen that chap before! Isn't he the very man we found {{at the wheel of}} la Voltigeuse, when we boarded her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not in}} your power, nor in that of all London, to disgrace <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not feel}} disgraced. It is useless {{to say that you}} cannot. If you say 'I will not,' then that will settle it. What is the other reason?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait here, and I {{will go up}} gently {{towards the}} window. She may see me. She will see me as I step into the moonlight. At least I know an air by which she will {{recognize}} <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> but hum a stave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little or nothing, only {{smiled at}} each other, and at length, when it grew dark {{and we could}} see no more, asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{think that it was}} time to go--me! whom they had kept there all that while to be the witness of my own shame." ...|$|R
6000|$|Confound his suspicion! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to}} tell on him I should have told long ago. I don't tell and I don't tell, and he ought to feel at his ease. As if {{anything}} so gross and fat as he could feel at ease! Who would believe <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> tell? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{see very}} much of <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> come," [...] <b>I</b> replied a little tartly. Possibly it was his [...] "we" [...] that had fretted me. It seemed needlessly egotistical. [...] "On the other hand," [...] I added, [...] "wouldn't there be a risk of the {{congregation}} seeing nothing else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I guessed!" [...] commented Shackleby. [...] "Now, I don't want to {{hurt your}} feelings, but you can't afford to quarrel with <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You're coming {{straight}} {{with me to the}} depot to find out where Mrs. Leslie bought a ticket to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{wants you}} to go on? Not I, I'm sure; nor anybody {{belonging}} to <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hate anything, it's them mercenary ways. There's one who really loves me, who'd be above asking for a shilling, if I'd only put out my hand to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do you run, then?" [...] {{she asked}} him coolly, {{standing}} slim and straight before him, all in white and very maidenly save in her unnatural composure. [...] "I am pressed," [...] she informed him. [...] "So you will forgive <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{man that}} made me come here with him. Mamma let me {{go out in the}} street to play <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't go away from the block; but that man came up an' asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want a real live pony, an' <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> an' <b>I</b> went with him to get it" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are welcome, then, {{to return}} to our hotel. I cannot promise to receive you as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> of old; you would despise <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> can promise, however, to think no more of all that has passed between us, and yield up my own {{happiness}} for that of the daughter of my dear husband.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did not pay}} that, and I {{shall never}} tell what it cost, for you wouldn't believe <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> It was a good bargain, I assure you--for Shylock," [...] I added to myself, and kept my secret jealously, knowing I never should hear the last of it if the awful truth was known.|$|R
