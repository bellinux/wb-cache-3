25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the apparent variations in <b>marine</b> <b>biodiversity</b> may actually be an artifact, with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time periods. However, statistical analysis shows that this can only account for 50% of the observed pattern, and other evidence (such as fungal spikes) provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are real. A quantification of the rock exposure of Western Europe indicates that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation has been sought are most readily explained by sampling bias.|$|E
25|$|Most of Western Australia has a hot arid and {{semi-arid}} climate. However, the south-west {{corner of}} the state has a Mediterranean climate. The area was originally heavily forested, including large stands of the karri, one of the tallest trees in the world. This agricultural region of Western Australia is in the top nine terrestrial habitats for terrestrial biodiversity, with a higher proportion of endemic species than most other equivalent regions.

25|$|The {{scientific}} and natural interest of this tiny group of islands {{lies in its}} <b>marine</b> <b>biodiversity,</b> its unique flora and many avian species that breed annually on its rock cliffs or use them on their stopover on normal migratory patterns. About 3% of the 9000 species of birds are marine species, the remaining are migratory species. The abundance of birds on the islands, at one time, made the islands an attractive hunting area for peoples of the region. At {{the end of the}} 19th century the German naturalist Ernst Schmitz noted that 20–22,000 Cory's shearwaters were hunted in September or October in the islands; the hunts continued until 1967. Madeiran expeditions to the islands were responsible for the killing of juvenile birds for food, while their down was used to stuff pillows and comforters. Presently the islands are home or stopover for: Cory's shearwaters (approximately 14,000), white-faced storm-petrel (12,000), Bulwer's petrel (500), North Atlantic little shearwater (500), Madeiran storm-petrel (1000), yellow-legged gull, the roseate tern and Berthelot's pipit; which are subjects of annual scientific expeditions. Many of theses species are vulnerable to local predators, primarily from populations of brown rat and predatory bird species, like the yellow-legged gull, which will consume both eggs and chicks (the white-faced storm-petrel and Bulwer's petrel are primarily susceptible). These islands also have many endemic fauna species, including local snails and the unique gecko Tarentola boettgeri bischoffi.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany {{studies have}} implied {{significant}} {{effects of global}} climate change on marine life. Setting these alterations into the context of historical natural change has not been attempted so far, however. Here, using a theoretical framework, we estimate the sensitivity of <b>marine</b> pelagic <b>biodiversity</b> to temperature change and evaluate its past (mid-Pliocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)), contemporaneous (1960 – 2013) and future (2081 – 2100; 4 scenarios of warming) vulnerability. Our biodiversity reconstructions were highly correlated to real data for several pelagic taxa for the contemporary and the past (LGM and mid-Pliocene) periods. Our results indicate that local species loss will be a prominent phenomenon of climate warming in permanently stratified regions, and that local species invasion will prevail in temperate and polar biomes under all climate change scenarios. Although a small amount of warming under the RCP 2. 6 scenario is expected to have a minor influence on <b>marine</b> pelagic <b>biodiversity,</b> moderate warming (RCP 4. 5) will increase by threefold the changes already observed over the past 50 years. Of most concern is that severe warming (RCP 6. 0 and 8. 5) will affect <b>marine</b> pelagic <b>biodiversity</b> {{to a greater extent than}} temperature changes that took place between either the LGM or the mid-Pliocene and today, over an area of between 50 (RCP 6. 0 : 46. 9 – 52. 4 %) and 70 % (RCP 8. 5 : 69. 4 – 73. 4 %) of the global ocean...|$|R
