25|$|Following {{the mixed}} {{success of the}} earlier Monospar family of aircraft, the company {{designed}} a ten-seat light transport, the ST-18 (later named Croydon). Due to the longer-span wing, {{it was not a}} cantilever <b>monospar</b> <b>wing</b> but had to be fitted with bracing struts. The ST-18 was a low-wing monoplane, with a conventional tail unit and tailwheel landing gear, and hydraulically retractable main gear. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior radial engines mounted on the wing leading edges. It had a crew of three, and a cabin for ten passengers, a toilet and baggage compartment.|$|E
5000|$|The A.33 was a four-engined flying-boat with a parasol <b>monospar</b> <b>wing,</b> {{the wing}} was {{supported}} by two angled N-struts which connected the wing to hull-mounted sponsons. The hull-mounted sponsons were used rather than wingtip floats and were also used as fuel tanks. A Saro Cloud was modified with a <b>monospar</b> <b>wing</b> and sponsons to test the design concepts. The A.33 serial number K4773 first flew on 14 October 1938. However, the A33 prototype was written off after structural failure sustained during high-speed taxi trials on 25 October 1938 and development was abandoned. [...] A production contract for eleven aircraft was cancelled.|$|E
50|$|Based on this design, The Monospar Company {{designed}} a twin-engined low-wing aircraft designated the Monospar ST-3, {{that was built}} and flown in 1931 by the Gloster Aircraft Company at Brockworth, Gloucestershire. After successful testing of the Monospar ST-3, a new company General Aircraft Ltd was formed to produce aircraft that used the new <b>Monospar</b> <b>wing</b> designs.|$|E

5000|$|The Ezhik design {{begun in}} 1999 and first {{exhibited}} in August 2005 and flew some time after. [...] The Ezhik is a conventional low-wing cantilever monoplane {{powered by a}} Walter Minor M-337A engine. It first appeared with a conventional single fin but was later modified with twin rectangular fins. It has a raised and enclosed cockpit with two tandem-seats and a conventional landing gear with a tailwheel. The Ezhik has a welded steel tube fuselage with aluminium skin forward of the cockpit {{with the rest of}} the fuselage and tail fabric covered. It has a <b>monospar</b> <b>wing</b> and a chemical hopper in the fuselage feeds eight rotary atomisers fitted beneath the wings.|$|E
