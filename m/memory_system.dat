Research examining such <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> in romantic couples largely focuses on remembering word lists or performing lab-based tasks, but these types of activities do not capture the processes underlying couples' transactive <b>memory</b> <b>systems,</b> {{and may not be}} representative {{of the ways in which}} romantic couples use their shared <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> in everyday life. We adapted an existing measure of transactive <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> for use with romantic couples (TMSS-C), and conducted an initial validation study. In total, 397 participants who each identified as being a member of a romantic relationship of at least 3 months duration completed the study.

40|$|Transactive <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> {{refers to}} the idea that people in {{continuing}} close relationship develop a shared system for encoding, storing and retrieving information from different substantive domains (Wegner, 1987). Previous studies provide both direct and indirect evidence of the positive impact of transactive <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> on group performance, such as efficient storage and recall of the knowledge, development of trust in a group, and the benefits of training people together. Although transactive <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> influence groups through multiple processes, such as the directory updating, information allocation, and retrieval coordination, in this paper we examine only its impact on the retrieval process and the recognition of expertise during decision making. Using simulation and object-oriented programming techniques, we demonstrate that the existence of transactive <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> in groups helps to improve not only the decision speed but also the decision accuracy of groups. Groups are modeled using PCANSS representation scheme, which is presented by Carley and Krackhardt. By simulating different kinds of groups under different task environments, it suggests that the impact of transactive <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> on group performance is contingent on both organizational features and task environment.

40|$|The {{existence}} of multiple <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> {{has been proposed}} {{in a number of}} areas, including cogni-tive psychology, neuropsychology, and the study of animal learning and memory. We examine whether the {{existence of}} such multiple systems seems likely on evolutionary grounds. Multiple sys-tems adapted to serve seemingly similar functions, which differ in important ways, are a common evolutionary outcome. The evolution of multiple <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> requires <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> to be specialized {{to such a degree that}} the functional problems each system handles cannot be handled by another system. We define this condition as functional incompatibility and show that it occurs for a number of the distinctions that have been proposed between <b>memory</b> <b>systems.</b> The distinction be-tween memory for song and memory for spatial locations in birds, and between incremental habit formation and memory for unique episodes in humans and other primates provide examples. Not all <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> are highly specialized in function, however, and the conditions under which <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> could evolve to serve a wide range of functions are also discussed.

40|$|Recent {{theories}} postulate {{that memory}} {{can be divided}} into multiple brain <b>memory</b> <b>systems.</b> Although <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> depend on the function of variables based on the level of analysis and are subserved by different neural substrates, current definitions of <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> have categorized them as psychological and biological entities. Under such context, the studies of different <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> have shown that complex interactions take place during perfor-mance of any memory task. Such interactions among multiple <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> are based on dynamic interactive independent neural networks which make possible the better understanding of how <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> work in the brain of mammals. Both behavioral and electrophysiological studies over the last decades demonstrate that learning and memory are encoded through activity dependent changes of the strength of synaptic connections between neurons, as experimentally demonstrated by Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) in mammalian synapses. LTP is a form of synaptic plasticity, and is considered as an accepted cellular model for stabilization of synapses involved in the expression of several neurobiological phenomena. Most of the understanding of the neurochemical, pharmacological, and molecular mechanisms involved in LTP induction, expression, and maintenance, have been demonstrated through the involvement of glutamate neurotransmission system, as well as through the different glutamate recep-tor subtypes, known to be expressed widely in different neural networks of the brain of mammals...|$|R

25|$|Amnesia {{is seen in}} {{patients}} who, for the reason of preventing another more serious disorder, have parts of their brains known {{to be involved in}} memory circuits removed, the most notable of which is known as the medial temporal lobe (MTL) <b>memory</b> <b>system,</b> described below. Patients with seizures originating in the MTL may have either side or both structures removed (there is one structure per hemisphere). In addition, patients with tumors who undergo surgery will often sustain damage to these structures, as is described in a case below. Damage to any part of this system, including the hippocampus and surrounding cortices, results in amnesic syndromes. This is why people who suffer from strokes have a chance of developing cognitive deficits that result in anterograde amnesia, since strokes can involve the temporal lobe and the temporal cortex, and the temporal cortex houses the hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|The {{changes in}} {{quantity}} {{of a certain}} neurotransmitter {{as well as how}} the post-synaptic terminal responds to this change are underlying mechanisms of brain plasticity. During sleep there are remarkable changes in modulatory neurotransmitters throughout the brain.Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter that is seen to increase to near waking levels during REM sleep while compared to lower levels during slow-wave sleep. Evidence has shown that functioning of the hippocampus dependent <b>memory</b> <b>system</b> (episodic memory and autobiographical memory) is directly affected by cholinergic changes throughout the wake-sleep cycle. High levels of ACh would promote information attained during wakefulness to be stored in the hippocampus. This is accomplished by suppressing previous excitatory connections while facilitating encoding without interference from previously stored information. During NREM sleep, and especially slow-wave sleep, low levels of Ach would cause the release of this suppression and allow for spontaneous recovery of hippocampal neurons resulting in the facilitation of memory consolidation.|$|E
25|$|VSTM {{is thought}} to be the visual {{component}} of the working <b>memory</b> <b>system,</b> and as such it is used as a buffer for temporary information storage during the process of naturally occurring tasks. But what naturally occurring tasks actually require VSTM? Most work on this issue has focused on the role of VSTM in bridging the sensory gaps caused by saccadic eye movements. These sudden shift of gaze typically occur 2–4 times per second, and vision is briefly suppressed while the eyes are moving. Thus, the visual input consists of a series of spatially shifted snapshots of the overall scene, separated by brief gaps. Over time, a rich and detailed long-term memory representation is constructed from these brief glimpses of the input, and VSTM {{is thought to}} bridge the gaps between these glimpses and to allow the relevant portions of one glimpse to be aligned with the relevant portions of the next glimpse. Both spatial and object VSTM systems may play important roles in the integration of information across eye movements.|$|E
