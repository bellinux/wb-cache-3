25|$|When a law {{or other}} act of {{government}} is challenged {{as a violation of}} individual liberty under the Due Process Clause, courts now use two forms of scrutiny or judicial review. The inquiry balances the importance of the governmental interest being served and the appropriateness of the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> against the resulting infringement of individual rights. If the governmental action infringes upon a fundamental right, the highest level of review, strict scrutiny, is used. To pass strict scrutiny, the law or the act must be both narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.|$|E
2500|$|FIFA's supreme body is the FIFA Congress, an {{assembly}} {{made up of}} representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. The congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> and application. Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections.

2500|$|Fletcher and Hurd {{state that}} unions may also face issues of {{resistance}} by pre-existing [...] "staff," [...] {{who may be}} hesitant or even suspicious at {{the adoption of the}} organizing model. Dealing with resistant staff would be a major disadvantage of using the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, to which the staff are both accustomed and familiar with. Fletcher and Hurd assert that, {{based on the fact that}} unions employing the organizing model have to reassign tasks and take time to train people, [...] "...following the organizing model creates more work than sticking to the servicing model." [...] Richard Hurd argues that the organizing model can, at times, create [...] "...continual warfare..." [...] between the workers and the employer, which is a disadvantage because there is a trend of workers [...] "...preferring stability rather than on-going class struggle." [...] If this is really the mindset of the workers, then it would be hard to actually maintain the organizing model for long periods of time. Fred Glass says that [...] "...an organizing model of unionism requires an organizing model of labor communications" [...] because the organizing model requires an effective way to share information with workers quickly and efficiently. Bob Carter, in regard to the organizing model [...] in British unions, is concerned with the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> and whether or not workers consent to switching from servicing to organizing. Carter says that [...] "A model which is premised on debate and involvement cannot be successfully introduced without discussion..." [...] Carter worries about whether or not workers are a part of the transition process and whether they consent to all of the implications that come with the organizing model.|$|E

Then we implemented two kinds of encryption circuit (MISTY 1 and AES) by 4 different types of substitution table on an FPGA using Vivado HLS which is a high-level synthesis tool provided by Xilinx. As a result, the fastest <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> are 1. 9 and 37. 6 times faster than the slowest <b>methods,</b> in cases <b>of</b> MISTY 1 and AES respectively.
