5|$|Flick {{was married}} to Rosa Ella (née Gates). The couple had five daughters. Flick died of {{congestive}} heart failure in 1971, at the age of 94, in his hometown of Bedford. He had also suffered from <b>mycosis</b> fungoides.|$|E
25|$|Diseases {{considered}} for or {{known to be}} used as a weapon include anthrax, ebola, Marburg virus, plague, cholera, typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, brucellosis, Q fever, machupo, Coccidioides <b>mycosis,</b> Glanders, Melioidosis, Shigella, Psittacosis, Japanese B encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and smallpox.|$|E
25|$|Systemic E. dermatitidis infections {{can include}} {{cerebral}} metastases. The fatality rate for such infections {{is reported to}} be over 90%. Central nervous system phaeohyphomycosis is rare, and for unknown reasons primarily arise in East Asia, despite a cosmopolitan distribution of the fungus. Within East Asian populations, young and otherwise healthy people have developed cerebral infections. Lung infections in European CF patients and neurotropic <b>mycosis</b> in East Asia are caused by E. dermatitidis strains that are genetically similar, and host factors such as immunological differences may be responsible for the different infection patterns. Exophiala dermatitidis occurs at very high frequency in both Asian and European saunas, and absence of neurotrophic <b>mycosis</b> in Europe isn't explained by reduced exposure to the fungus.|$|E
25|$|As of yet, {{there have}} not been any {{reported}} cases of <b>mycosis</b> associated with M. plumbeus. However, studies have revealed that the spores of M. plumbeus {{have the ability to}} activate the complement system in humans via the alternative pathway. In addition, studies involving various complement proteins on fungal surfaces suggest that M. plumbeus spores can activate all pathways of the complement system. Mucor plumbeus is not known to produce any mycotoxins.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, Jane C. Wright {{demonstrated}} {{the use of}} methotrexate in solid tumors, showing remission in breast cancer.

Min Chiu Li and his collaborators then demonstrated complete remission in women with choriocarcinoma and chorioadenoma in 1956, and in 1960 Wright et al. produced remissions in <b>mycosis</b> fungoides.|$|E

2500|$|Djan Madruga competed at the 1982 World Aquatics Championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador {{where he}} {{finished}} 7th in the 4×200-metre freestyle final, 10th in the 200-metre backstroke, and 12th in the 400-metre freestyle. Unfortunately he had competed while {{suffering from a}} serious health problem. Djan had contracted typhoid. Ricardo Prado was critical of their accommodation and the food. [...] "The hotel we stayed at was not well attended. It was directly across [...] the Guayaquil bus station. I managed to reach {{the final of the}} 200-metre individual medley, but I was weak because food there was terrible, and finished the race in eighth place."

2500|$|On 8 August 1982, at the 1982 World Aquatics Championships in Guayaquil, Prado won a {{gold medal}} in the 400-metre {{individual}} medley, with a time of 4:19.78, establishing a new world record that stood until 23 May 1984. Prado was also in four other finals: placing fourth in the 200-metre butterfly (beating the South American record), and eighth in the 200-metre individual medley, the 200-metre backstroke, and the 4×100-metre medley. Prado had chances to earn a good result also in the 200-metre individual medley, but the conditions were adverse in Ecuador. [...] "The hotel we stayed at was not well attended.

2500|$|The {{cancer is}} {{classified}} into {{low and high}} grade types. [...] Classification is also based on location. [...] The four location types are multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, and extranodal (involving the kidney, central nervous system, skin, heart, or eye). [...] Multicentric lymphoma, {{the most common type}} (by greater than 80 percent), is found in the lymph nodes, with or without involvement in the liver, spleen, or bone marrow. [...] Mediastinal lymphoma occurs in the lymph nodes in the thorax and possibly the thymus. [...] Gastrointestinal lymphoma occurs as either a solitary tumor or diffuse invasion of the stomach or intestines, with or without involvement in the surrounding lymph nodes, liver or spleen. [...] Classification is further based on involvement of B-lymphocytes or T-lymphocytes. [...] Approximately 70 percent are B-cell lymphoma. [...] Cutaneous lymphoma can be classified as epitheliotropic (closely conforming to the epidermis) or non-epitheliotropic. [...] The epitheliotropic form is typically of T-cell origin and is also called <b>mycosis</b> fungoides. [...] The non-epitheliotropic form is typically of B-cell origin.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s a lawsuit led by Ecuadorian {{government}} officials of 1.5 billion dollars was presented against the Texaco company with claims {{that there was}} an immense pollution epidemic that led to the demise of many natural environments as well as an increase in human illnesses. A cancer study was conducted in 1994 by the Centre for Economic and Social Rights which found a rise in health concerns in the Ecuadorian region. [...] it was found that there was a notably higher incidence of cancer in women and men in the countries where there was oil production present for over 20 years. Women also reported increased rates in a copious amount of physical ailments such as skin <b>mycosis,</b> sore throat, headaches and gastritis. The primary argument against these findings were that they were weak and biased. Texaco decided on jurisdiction in Ecuador. The case put against Texaco remained in the works for some time. In 2001, Texaco was taken over by Chevron, another oil company, which assumed the liabilities left by the previous production. On February, 2011 Chevron was found guilty after inheriting the case left by Texaco and was said to be required to pay 9 billion dollars in damages. This is known {{to be one of the}} largest environmental lawsuits award recorded.|$|E
