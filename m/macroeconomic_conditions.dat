25|$|However, some {{obstacles}} remain. ASEAN currently trades {{more with}} other countries (80%) than among its member countries (20%). Therefore, ASEAN economies {{are more concerned about}} currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions,</b> ASEAN member countries have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration however implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions</b> is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency. On the other hand, there are also constraints on the adoption of one currency, such as the following: diversity in the level of economic development across countries, weaknesses in the financial sectors of many countries, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required for forming and managing a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.|$|E

Paternal education, access to safe drinking water, information access, and other utilities like electricity have positive impact on child survival. It has also been found that there is regional variation in mortality rate.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of modern market economy, {{in order to}} safeguard the comprehensive competitiveness, enterprises adjust their capital structure based on the external and internal environment. In the selection of enterprises’ financing policies, especially the debt decisions, the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>condition</b> {{will be an important}} factor (Korajczyk and Leny). Studies suggest that <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>condition</b> has great impact on the pace and scale of the capital structure adjustment and the companies’ liabilities (Dirk Hackbarth ect. 2006; Douglas O, Cook and Tian Tang, 2009). The capital structure determines structures of long-term debts and equity capital. The analysis on debt structure and benefits and risks of enterprises is of great importance to maximize the value of enterprises. On the basis of introducing the development of the capital structure theory, this article investigate an important issue in the area of financial economics by analyzing the main factors affecting capital structure and focusing on system environment which has not been fully studied. This article employed empirical method to analyze data of private enterprises in different areas during 2007 - 2009 which had been listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange markets. The conclusion is that changes of the following five factors, government intervention degree, non-state-owned economic structure, market structure, financial structure of commercialization combine with legal system, have great impacts on the capital structure and the development of private enterprises...|$|R

25|$|A {{review of}} the {{evolution}} and structural changes of the industrial sector {{since the end of}} World War II reveals four broad periods. The postwar period to 1962 was a phase of intense import substitution, especially of consumer goods, with basic industries growing at significant but lower rates. The 1968 to 1973 period was one of very rapid industrial expansion and modernization (between 1962 and 1967, the industrial sector stagnated as a result of adverse <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions).</b> The 1974 to 1985 phase was highlighted by import substitution of basic inputs and capital goods and by the expansion of manufactured goods exports.

25|$|Since the ACU {{is being}} {{considered}} to be a precursor to a common currency in the future, it has a dynamic outlook of the region. The overall goal of a common currency is to contribute to the financial stability of a regional economy, including price stability. It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of currency risk for the members of the monetary union. Greater flows of intra-regional trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling within the union, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders. However, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions.</b> Substantial intra-ASEAN trade and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Intra-ASEAN trade is growing, {{partly as a result of}} the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} feature of the CGE model is its macro closure. The <b>macroeconomic</b> equilibrium <b>condition</b> states that aggregate investments must be equal to aggregate savings. The neoclassical closure, {{which is the most}} frequently used in general equilibrium models, implies that investments are then savings-driven, i.e., the <b>macroeconomic</b> equilibrium <b>condition</b> determines the aggregate investment. The use of the neoclassical closure implies that a shock which increases the value of a component of the aggregate demand produces a strong and unreasonable effect on investments, while the effect on the GDP is negligible since GDP is determined by the supply of production inputs that are assumed to be fully employed in the economy.|$|R

The main conclusion of the paper is that the primary targets of stabilization programs are not implemented during the program years. Even though program years are associated with improvements in balance of payments and reserves, such improvements disappear during the post-program years. The fact that Turkey has received subsequent programs from the IMF despite the overall lack of implementation of the Fund's conditionality may be consistent with the existence of moral hazard.

Moreover, when foreign banks operate in a host country with lower growth rates of GDP, higher interest and inflation rates, and more stringent regulatory compliance with Basel risk weights, their margins increase. Specifically, changes in bank supervision of a parent bank's ownership restrictiveness in the home country significantly increases foreign bank margins, while supervisory changes in regulatory compliance with Basel risk weights in the host country enhances foreign bank margins.

Property industry has a bigger cash conversion cycle and net working capital needed per rupiah of sales than another industry (SSKI Bank Indonesia 2015; and financial report). Profitability trend in property industry and GDP growth was decreased at 2013 until 2015, {{it was a problem}} for management and investor in property industry. Therefore it {{is important for}} manager or CFO to manage a working capital efficiently to increase profitability but still maintain liquidity steady. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the impact of working capital management and macroeconomics indicator on profitability and liquidity of public listed propety industry in Indonesia. The firm’s profitability is measured by ROA and ROE, while the firm’s liquidity measured by CR and QR. Working capital components include CCC, CATAR, and CLTAR with control variables which include of SIZE, SLGR,and DER. While macroeconomics indicator include GDP growth, interest rate, and inflation. This study used data from quarter financial report of 19 property firms listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange over the periode 2011 - 2015 quaterly,while GDP, inflation, and interest rate from Statistic Indonesia and Bank of Indonesia. The data was analyzed using panel data regression analysis. The result showed that Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) has negative relationship with Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Quick Ratio (QR). While CCC is positive relationship with Current Ratio (CR). These study find there is a trade off in working capital policy between profitability and liquidity. Furthermore the result showed when GDP growth increase property firms performance would increase. Strict monetary policy would decrease firm's profitability in property industry. Inflation have positive relationship on profitability and negative relationship on liquidity. Furthermore firm size, sales growth, and capital structure have significant effect on the profitability and liquidity. As a result of this reasearch, these study recommends management to accelerating the cash conversion cycle to improve firm performance. Manager can decrease cash conversion cycle by accelerating days inventory outstanding and days sales outstanding and extend days payable outstanding. Manager should use more aggresive working capital policy to improve profitability but still maintain their liquidity.
