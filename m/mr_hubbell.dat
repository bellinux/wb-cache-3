The {{audience}} hurled {{things at}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell,</b> {{and these were}} the only volatile objects. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> therefore brought Esther back to her family at Amherst, where, in Esther's absence, his umbrella and a large carving knife flew at him with every appearance of malevolence. A great arm-chair next charged at him like a bull, {{and to say that}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> was awed [...] "would indeed seem an inadequate expression of my feelings". The ghosts then thrice undressed little Willie in public, in derision of his tears and outcries. Fire-raising followed, {{and that would be a}} hard heart which could read the tale unmoved. Here it is, in the simple eloquence of Mr. Hubbell:-- ...|$|E

She wears it that night to a charity ball where Melinda sees her and candidly remarks to Tom that the coat had originally been meant for her. Tom misinterprets her statements, and the two quarrel bitterly. Although Jessica has been released from the hospital, she fears Melinda's reaction to her present state and refuses to meet with her.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> himself now {{came on the}} scene, and, not {{detecting}} imposture, {{thought that}} [...] "there was money in it". He determined to [...] "run" [...] Esther as a powerful attraction, he lecturing, and Esther sitting on the platform.|$|E
60|$|His destiny, if tragical, {{presented}} itself with an aspect which {{he might have}} found comic {{if it had been}} another's destiny. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> brought March's removal, softened {{in the guise of a}} promotion. The management at New York, it appeared, had acted upon a suggestion of Mr. Hubbell's, and now authorized him to offer March the editorship of the monthly paper published in the interest of the company; his office would include the authorship of circulars and leaflets in behalf of life-insurance, and would give play to the literary talent which <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> had brought to the attention of the management; his salary would be nearly as much as at present, but the work would not take his whole time, and in a place like New York he could get a great deal of outside writing, which they would not object to his doing.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> {{seemed so}} sure of his {{acceptance}} of a place in every way congenial to a man of literary tastes that March was afterward sorry he dismissed the proposition with obvious irony, and had needlessly hurt Hubbell's feelings; but Mrs. March had no such regrets. She was only afraid {{that he had not}} made his rejection contemptuous enough. [...] "And now," [...] she said, [...] "telegraph Mr. Fulkerson, and we will go at once." ...|$|E

It ended with his {{answering}} March's telegram in person. They were so glad of his coming, and so touched by his satisfaction with his bargain, that they laid all {{the facts of the case}} before him.

5000|$|One of {{the most}} notorious murders in Nodaway County was {{committed}} by Hezekiah [...] "Hez" [...] Rasco, a farmer's son, who was hanged on March 26, 1912 for the murder of Oda Hubbell. Rasco and Hubbell took part in an all-night poker game in a boxcar at the Barnard Depot. Hubbell returned to his family on the morning of November 20, 1910. The next day, Hubbell and his family were all found dead. Hubbell had been killed with a shotgun and his body dragged into the house. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> was beaten to death with the shotgun butt. After killing the children, the murderer set fire to the Hubbell home, which almost incinerated the children's corpses. Little {{more than half of the}} torso of Hubbell was found after a passing neighbor had extinguished the blaze. Hez Rasco was arrested and charged with the murder of Hubbell, his wife, and their children Welton, 4, and Jessie, 6. Rasco was tried and convicted only for Oda Hubbell's murder. Rasco maintained his innocence to his death. More information can be found in the book Hezekiah Rasco: Child of Woe - Man of Sorrow by Susan Cronk.|$|R
6000|$|He found {{a letter}} {{on his desk}} from the secretary, [...] "Dictated," [...] in typewriting, which briefly {{informed}} him that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell,</b> the Inspector of Agencies, would be in Boston on Wednesday, and would call at his office during the forenoon. The letter was not different in tone from many that he had formerly received; but the visit announced {{was out of the}} usual order, and March believed he read his fate in it. During the eighteen years of his connection with it--first as a subordinate in the Boston office, and finally as its general agent there--he had seen a good many changes in the Reciprocity; presidents, vice-presidents, actuaries, and general agents had come and gone, but there had always seemed to be a recognition of his efficiency, or at least sufficiency, and there had never been any manner of trouble, no question of accounts, no apparent dissatisfaction with his management, until latterly, when there had begun to come from headquarters some suggestions of enterprise in certain ways, which gave him his first suspicions of his clerk Watkins's willingness to succeed him; they embodied some of Watkins's ideas. The things proposed seemed to March undignified, and even vulgar; he had never thought himself wanting in energy, though probably he had left the business to take its own course in the old lines more than he realized. Things had always gone so smoothly that he had sometimes fancied a peculiar regard for him in the management, which he had the weakness to attribute to an appreciation of what he occasionally did in literature, though in saner moments he felt how impossible this was. Beyond a reference from <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> to some piece of March's which had happened to meet his eye, no one in the management ever gave a sign of consciousness that their service was adorned by an obscure literary man; and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> himself had the effect of regarding the excursions of March's pen as a sort of joke, and of winking at them; as he might have winked if once in a way he had found him a little the gayer for dining.|$|E
6000|$|Phil Goodrich {{had once}} said that Mr. Plimpton's {{translation}} of the national motto E pluribus unum, was [...] "get together," [...] {{and it was true}} that not the least of Mr. Plimpton's many gifts was that of peace making. Such was his genius that he scented trouble before it became manifest to the world, and he stoutly declared that no difference of opinion ever existed between reasonable men that might not be patched up before the breach became too wide--provided that a third reasonable man contributed his services. The qualifying word [...] "reasonable" [...] is to be noted. When Mr. Bedloe Hubbell had undertaken, in the name of Reform, to make a witch's cauldron of the city's politics, which Mr. Beatty had hitherto conducted so smoothly from the back room of his saloon, Mr. Plimpton had unselfishly offered his services. Bedloe Hubbell, although he had been a playmate of Mr. Plimpton's wife's, had not proved [...] "reasonable," [...] and had rejected with a scorn only to be deemed fanatical the suggestion that Mr. Hubbell's interests and Mr. Beatty's interests need not clash, since <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> might go to Congress! And Mr. Plimpton was the more hurt since the happy suggestion was his own, and he had had no little difficulty in getting Mr. Beatty to agree to it.|$|E
6000|$|In 1879 he {{was acting}} with a strolling company, and came to Amherst, in Nova Scotia. Here he heard of a haunted house, known to the local {{newspapers}} as [...] "The Great Amherst Mystery". Having previously succeeded in exposing the frauds of spiritualism <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> determined to investigate the affair of Amherst. The haunted house was inhabited by Daniel Teed, the respected foreman in a large shoe factory. Under his roof were Mrs. Teed, [...] "as good a woman as ever lived"; little Willie, a baby boy; and Mrs. Teed's two sisters, Jennie, a very pretty girl, and Esther, remarkable for large grey eyes, pretty little hands and feet, and candour of expression. A brother of Teed's and a brother of Mrs. Cox made up the family. They were well off, and lived comfortably in a detached cottage of two storys. It began when Jennie and Esther were in bed one night. Esther jumped up, saying {{that there was a}} mouse in the bed. Next night, a green band-box began to make a rustling noise, and then rose a foot in the air, several times. On the following night Esther felt unwell, and [...] "was a swelling wisibly before the werry eyes" [...] of her alarmed family. Reports like thunder peeled through her chamber, under a serene sky. Next day Esther could only eat [...] "a small piece of bread and butter, and a large green pickle". She recovered slightly, in spite of the pickle, but, four nights later, all her and her sister's bed-clothes flew off, and settled down in a remote corner. At Jennie's screams, the family rushed in, and found Esther [...] "fearfully swollen". Mrs. Teed replaced the bed-clothes, which flew off again, the pillow striking John Teed in the face. Mr. Teed then left the room, observing, in a somewhat unscientific spirit, that [...] "he had had enough of it". The others, with a kindness which did them credit, sat on the edges of the bed, and repressed the desire of the sheets and blankets to fly away. The bed, however, sent forth peels like thunder, when Esther suddenly fell into a peaceful sleep.|$|E
5000|$|In 1874, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> donated $500 in pew scrip and {{declared}} her intention of placing {{a window in}} memory of her husband, Ferdinand Wakefield Hubbell, adjacent to the Twenty-First Street tower door. In the better financial times of 1889, the Trustees acknowledged her intention. The date of this window is thus fixed no earlier than 1889. Although the window {{is reminiscent of the}} style of the American artist John LaFarge, there is no documentation that this window is a work of that artist - neither in church records nor in those of the LaFarge Studio. When the artist's son, Henry, viewed the window in 1974, he remained skeptical that his father designed it, but others can point out the stylistic similarities. Further research may clarify the origin of this window. Nonetheless, the window is striking in its bold colors. In the trefoil above, an angel holds the legend, [...] "An Honorable Counselor". This is not a scriptural text, but probably reflects Hubbell's profession. On the left, the standing figure of St. Paul, portrayed as is customary as a short, bald, bearded man, holds the sword of the spirit in his right hand and the scroll of the epistles in his left hand. On the right, the figure of Moses, who alone appears twice in these windows, holds the tablets of the Law. This panel was once damaged and repaired.|$|R

50|$|Built with juniper logs {{upright in}} the ground, the corrals of the trading post held lambs and sheep {{purchased}} from Navajo stockmen by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell.</b> The flocks {{stayed in the}} corral complex until they could be herded to the railroad. From time to time <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> kept beef cattle as well. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> homesteaded 160 acre before {{they were part of}} the reservation and territory. When the reservation expanded, it surrounded the Hubbell property. Through an act of Congress <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> got permission to keep his home. Freight wagons brought supplies fifty-six miles to the store from the little railroad town of Gallup, New Mexico, two to four days' travel in good weather. Going back to Gallup, freight wagons hauled huge sacks of wool.|$|E
50|$|The {{cone-shaped}} hill located {{northwest of}} the trading post is Hubbell Hill. The family cemetery is at the top. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell,</b> his wife, three of his children, a daughter-in-law, a granddaughter, and a Navajo man named Many Horses are buried there. Many Horses {{was one of the}} local herdsmen and the son of Ganado Mucho. He and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> were close friends for many years. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> maintained a friendship with many of his customers until his death in 1930. Then his younger son Roman operated the business. When Roman died in 1957, his wife Dorothy managed the store for another ten years, until 1967 when the National Park Service acquired the site.|$|E
5000|$|The {{guest house}} {{was built in the}} early 1930s by Roman and Dorothy Hubbell, Mr. Hubbell's son and daughter-in-law, as a tribute to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell.</b> Dorothy Hubbell carved the inner wooden door. Visitors stayed in the Hubbell home, such as artists who were {{interested}} in the color and shapes of the land; anthropologists who came to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> for information; statesmen; friends of the family; and ordinary travelers in need of a place to stay. Architecturally, the guest house is in the Hogan (pronounced hoe-gone) (Navajo for home) style. Most hogans are built of logs, and the door always faces the east. Hogans are one-room dwellings and usually have six or eight sides. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> built several traditional hogans on the grounds for the Navajos who came long distances to trade. The guest house was originally called Pueblo Colorado (the inscription over the door) but often was confused with the town of Pueblo, Colorado. There was an important Navajo leader named totsohnii Hastiin (pronounced Toe-so-knee haaus-teen) (Navajo for [...] "man of the big water clan"). He was also called Ganado Mucho (pronounced gah-nah-doe-moo-cho) (Spanish for [...] "many cattle") and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> renamed this place Ganado for him. Ganado Mucho had a son, Many Horses, who is buried on the property.|$|E
50|$|In the {{scientific}} community, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> {{is known for}} his evaluations, computations and compilations of photon cross sections and attenuation (and energy-absorption) coefficients used in medicine, engineering and other disciplines. He is also known for his computationally tractable solutions of problems associated with the predictions of radiation fields.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell</b> {{married a}} Spanish woman named Lina Rubi. They had {{two sons and}} two daughters. Additions to the family home to {{accommodate}} the growing family were finished in 1902. It {{started out as a}} plain adobe building which the Hubbell family gradually made into a comfortable, and in some ways, luxurious home. Paintings and artifacts and many large Navajo rugs still decorate the interior. Unlike other traders who left their families “back home” in the east, the entire Hubbell family spent most {{of the year in the}} village of Ganado. The Hubbells lived in the house until 1967.|$|E
5000|$|Right {{before the}} show opens, Mrs. Hubbell learns {{the truth about the}} fur, and names Melinda in a divorce suit against <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hubbell.</b> Tom offers to [...] "forgive" [...] the shocked Melinda, and she realizes that he, too, thought she was romantically {{involved}} with Adolph. Shortly afterward, an aggressive reporter recognizes Jessica's picture and tells Melinda the truth about her mother. Completely shattered, Melinda decides to return to England and begs Lefty to pay for her ticket. Gloria and Lefty meet Melinda at the ship and escort her to a stateroom where Jessica is waiting. Mother and daughter are tearfully reunited, and Lefty informs them that Mrs. Hubbell now knows that there was nothing between Melinda and Adolph. They all leave together for the theater, where opening night is a success, and Tom and Melinda are free to pursue their romance.|$|E
