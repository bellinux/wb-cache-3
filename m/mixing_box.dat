50|$|A good {{image to}} have in mind is a typical fluid {{mechanics}} experiment such as a <b>mixing</b> <b>box.</b> Imagine a million mixing boxes, distributed over the earth; at a predetermined time, a million fluid mechanics engineers each start one experiment, and monitor the flow.

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid excess {{sweeping}} of coal from the mill, {{only part of the}} primary air, directly proportional to the boiler load demand, is passed through the mill. Furthermore, to ensure sufficient velocity of pulverized fuel to avoid settling in the pipes, an additional quantity of primary air is fed into a <b>mixing</b> <b>box</b> on the raw coal circuit. This by-pass air tapped from the primary air duct going into the mill makes an appreciable contribution to the drying of raw coal, by a flash drying effect, in addition to picking up the pulverized fuel from the mill outlet for its transportation towards the classifiers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} an air coil freeze stat {{is to keep the}} refrigerant-to-air heat {{exchanger}} (commonly called air coils) from freezing. This kind of freeze stat is typically used for heating coils which are exposed to outside air and is usually installed on the supply air side of the coil. [...] To accomplish this, they typically shut down the flow of outside air to a <b>mixing</b> <b>box</b> when the temperature reaches a predetermined setpoint. The setpoint for air coil freeze stats is typically about 38 degrees Fahrenheit which is approximately when the dew point temperature of the air starts to drop below freezing point.|$|E
5000|$|The Gittler guitar has six strings. Each string {{has its own}} pickup. Later {{versions}} have {{a plastic}} body. The steel frets, consisting of stainless steel bars pressure fitted into the stainless steel neck, give the instrument a sitar-like feel, as {{it is possible to}} bend the strings downward past where a wooden fretboard would prohibit the movement in a conventional guitar. The six individual pickups can be routed to divided outputs via D-sub-9-pin. or be mixed to a 1/4" [...] TS connector. The built in pre-amps are powered by a 9 V battery or via D-sub connector. The New York version came without a pre-amp section; the individual pickups' signals were led into single cables, which could then be plugged into a <b>mixing</b> <b>box</b> or each separately amplified.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{work in this}} thesis is subdivided to providing the initial results of the experimental work followed by simulation work at the end. The experimental work proposes a new measurement technique for measuring total and local leakages in ducts. The experimental work in this research tries to focus effort on finding the approximate locations of leaks in the HVAC residential duct systems to direct better the effort of duct sealing. This technique can provide several advantages over existing techniques. It will eventually have a greater potential to locate leaks so that retrofitting in ducts can be focused on leaky locations. Field studies were performed in 11 houses in Las Vegas. Out of these, 4 houses were selected for fixing the leakages in them and the tests were repeated on these houses to verify the duct leakage reduction and benefits. The proposed method can offer a more cost effective approach {{when compared to other}} methods in the future. It reduces the total leakage for different houses by 14. 4 % to 46. 5 % of the total initial leakage rate. The second part of this thesis consists of performing a CFD study of HVAC <b>Mixing</b> <b>box.</b> Return air is supplied {{from the top of the}} box and outside air supplied from the back of <b>mixing</b> <b>box.</b> The temperature and velocity profiles of air in the HVAC <b>mixing</b> <b>box</b> were analyzed. The effects of carbon dioxide concentration in the <b>mixing</b> <b>box</b> were also analyzed. The current CFD simulation results were compared to previous field measurements of temperature stratification in a <b>mixing</b> <b>box</b> published in the International Journal of Energy Research in 2001. The CFD results showed that within the experimental error given in the previous paper the CFD temperature distribution predictions were reasonably close to the experimental results indicating that a detailed CFD approach can be used for predictive purposes...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Though {{much has}} been learned about the {{dynamics}} of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence that is uniformly forced, in many physical systems turbulence is generated at a localized source and {{is affected by the}} presence of rigid boundaries. The decay with distance from a source is examined in wind tunnel experiments ("grid generated" turbulence) (Tennekes and Lumley 1972) and <b>mixing</b> <b>box</b> experiments ("oscillating grid" turbulence) (Turner 1973). In wind tunnel experiments, a uniform mean flow passing through a mesh creates locally isotopic turbulence. Averaged over planes, the turbulence parallel to the grid decays in time and, by the Taylor hypothesis, with distance as it is transported by the mean flow away from the source. Examination of the statistical properties of turbulence in these experiments is useful, for example, in examining turbulent wakes behind moving objects. <b>Mixing</b> <b>box</b> experiments are useful in understanding the properties of turbulence in circumstance...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} a simple probabilistic diagnostic {{system for a}} fanpowered <b>mixing</b> <b>box.</b> Several types of electrical and damper failures are diagnosed. Empirical data is available for modeling the normal operation of the <b>mixing</b> <b>box,</b> but no empirical data is available for failure states and models of failure states must be constructed from expert knowledge. The distribution over operational states (normal or otherwise) is derived from generative models via Bayes' rule. A general misclassification cost matrix is specified, {{and the risk of}} outputting various diagnostic messages is calculated; the message with least risk is output. The results of laboratory tests of this diagnostic scheme on three mixing boxes are described. 1 Introduction This article 1 describes an automated fault detection and diagnosis scheme for HVAC equipment, the Real-Time Diagnostic System (RTDS).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this quarter of study was to prepare fuel pellets containing PVC, newspaper and plastics to be co-fired with coal in the AFBC combustor. The Western Kentucky University atmospheric fluidized bed combustion system requires the fuel to fall from a bunker into a lock-hopper, and from there into a <b>mixing</b> <b>box</b> where the fuel is auger-fed under pressure {{into the bottom of}} the fluidized bed. The fuel must flow freely out of the bunker and through the lock- hopper for proper feeding into the combustor. In order for the fuel to continuously fall through these units and into the <b>mixing</b> <b>box</b> during combustion, the density of the fuel and the size of the particles must meet certain requirements. The particles must be no larger than 3 / 8 inches in diameter and must have a density approaching that of coal. Loose materials such as sawdust, shredded paper products and most shredded plastics do not feed properly in the WKU AFBC system. Bridging and blockage of feed chutes result, even with constant vibration of parts of the feed mechanism. It is not possible to run the AFBC system powered solely by these loose materials...|$|E

40|$|In recent {{publications}} {{from our}} laboratories, a technique using dual {{pulse height analyzer}} count rate systems has been described for electronic subtraction of one gamma photopeak from another allowing unhindered visualization of a second photopeak. By this method, subtraction of the 198 Auphotopeak from the 75 Se photopeak permits elimination of the liver scan from the pancreatic scan (1 - 3). Applying similar circuitry to a commercially available color scanner, 2 the instrument may be modified to simultaneously scan two isotopes which emit photons of two different energy levels and display on the recording paper the distribution of each isotope in a different color. The overlying parts are displayed in intermediate colors or shades of two colors. Combining the â€œSubtractâ€•and the â€œTwo-Colorâ€•circuits to the color scanner, a variety of modes of operation for multi-isotope scanning is possible.
