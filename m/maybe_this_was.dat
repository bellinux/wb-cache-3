500|$|Lachlan Kanoniuk, {{music critic}} for The Guardian, noted the [...] "bawdy" [...] jokes and anecdotes shared onstage by Madonna. He {{went on to}} {{describe}} the show as [...] "a weird mix of old vaudevillian-style, M15+, smut humour and bad wordplay; some jokes about clowns, sex jokes that were really quite bad but she had such great comedic delivery". Kanoniuk also compared the show to Prince's Piano & A Microphone Tour, and complimented her singing during [...] "Between the Bars", describing it as [...] "no costume changes, no highly synchronised dance moves, just Madonna playing an acoustic guitar and baring her soul on stage." [...] Francis Gibb from The Times found Madonna's performance during [...] "Intervention" [...] as an intimate and [...] "naked" [...] moment for the singer due to the legal battle. Jon Lisi from PopMatters observed that unlike the Rebel Heart Tour, Madonna had [...] "something to say" [...] with Tears of a Clown show. However he was confused whether Madonna was being vulnerable as a clown or {{it was a case}} of the singer [...] "trolling us". Citing the instance of singing [...] "Intervention" [...] for Rocco, Lisi explained that [...] "Of course she loves her son, but <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> less about her pain and more about the press’ exploitation of her pain. As the show got more intimate with each song and personal anecdote, a disturbing thought crept into my mind: what if it was meant to be a joke?" [...] Lisi concluded that the show had the ability [...] "represent a transitional point in [...] career", although the purpose was still unclear.|$|E

2500|$|Ted {{was a man}} of moods, often {{caught up}} in theories, keen when the action was hot, {{seemingly}} uninterested when the game was dull...a big-time player, one who responded to atmosphere, liked action and enjoyed the chase and gamble. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the reason he was drawn to horse racing; a dull day stalking the covers might be enlivened for him by thoughts of how his money was faring on the 3:15 at Ascot or Goodwood.|$|E

2500|$|At the 2006 {{commemoration}} of the massacre of Babi Yar, Lau pointed out that if the world had reacted, perhaps the Holocaust might never have happened. Implying that Hitler was emboldened by this impunity, Lau speculated: [...] "Maybe, say, this Babi Yar was also a test for Hitler. If on 29 September and 30 September 1941 Babi Yar may happen and the world did not react seriously, dramatically, abnormally, <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a good test for him. So {{a few weeks later}} in January 1942, near Berlin in Wannsee, a convention can be held with a decision, a final solution to the Jewish problem. Maybe if the very action had been a serious one, a dramatic one, in September 1941 here in Ukraine, the Wannsee Conference would have come to a different end, maybe".|$|E

He seed me comin' towards him, and readin' my intention frae my look maybe, or frae the stick in my hand, he pu'ed oot a lang knife frae his pocket and swore wi' the most awfu' oaths that if I didna stan' back he'd be the death o' me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a very greatly exaggerated {{statement}} put by {{the author}} and his Spanish authorities, nevertheless there was enough truth in it to prove very conclusively to the bold minds of the age that tremendous profits--"purchases" [...] they called them--were to be made from piracy. The Western World {{is filled with the}} names of daring mariners of those old days, who came flitting across the great trackless ocean in their little tublike boats of a few hundred tons burden, partly to explore unknown seas, partly--largely, perhaps--in pursuit of Spanish treasure: Frobisher, Davis, Drake, and a score of others.|$|E
30|$|Among the academics, the {{difference}} between American and non-American <b>is</b> curious. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because the food supply system, food culture and consequently academic research in the USA {{are very different from}} those in other countries.|$|R

5000|$|While {{working with}} Ian Watson {{on the story}} for A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Kubrick asked Watson for a pre-print copy of his Warhammer 40,000 tie-in novel Inquisitor. Watson quotes Kubrick as saying, [...] "Who knows, Ian? <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> my next movie?" ...|$|R
50|$|Friday August 12, 1932: Ernst Küppers {{who seems}} to be the main rival of the Japanese {{swimmers}} committed a false start, <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the reason why he was only able to finish fifth.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{there were}} people who were {{predicting}} catastrophe. Ominous were the words of the director of PZPN, Colonel Kazimierz Glabisz, who during the after-game banquet said: [...] "Who knows - <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the last game before another war?" ...|$|E

5000|$|In his 15-hour {{documentary}} The Story of Film: An Odyssey, Mark Cousins says: [...] "Performance was {{not only}} the greatest seventies film about identity, if any movie in the whole Story of Film should be compulsory viewing for film makers, <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> it." ...|$|R

5000|$|According to Jeff Terich of Treble Media, digital {{hardcore}} is [...] "on {{the verge}} of reaching speeds incompatible with popular music, as if the rapid acceleration of BPMs would render the idea of rhythm irrelevant or, at the very least, unpredictable. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> music for dancing; definitely <b>this</b> <b>is</b> music for screaming and breaking things." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{interesting}} inscription, embedded on {{the eastern}} side of the support wall, is that forbidding to take out the wine destined for sacred rituals. The inscription has attracted the interest of epigraphists, but it has been proposed that <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not its original place and that it is actually in second use.|$|E
50|$|The elegant facade {{with its}} twin towers {{provides}} a strong vertical accent {{was designed as}} the terminal feature of a street to the inner city which was never built. It is the only church of Fischer which was decorated in the rococo style with rich rocaille, <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to François de Cuvilliés the Elder, {{who served as a}} building inspector for this church.|$|E
50|$|Casimir, {{the sixth}} but fourth {{surviving}} son of Bolesław III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland, by {{his second wife}} Salomea, daughter of Count Henry of Berg, was born in 1138, probably {{on the brink of}} his father's death. It's however also possible that he was born shortly after, and in consequence was posthumous. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the reason that in the Bolesław III's Testament, he was omitted and left without any land.|$|E

5000|$|His father, {{speaking}} {{of the fact that}} he has two sons playing in the National Football League, said: [...] "I just kvell." [...] His mother, commenting on having two sons play football, said: I started out worrying that they were going to get hurt—but then I realized it was the other players I should be worrying about. They were like trucks hitting small cars. And I started to kind of feel like <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> their destiny.|$|E
5000|$|I didn't {{have enough}} time to prepare for this fight, but I think I did do a good job for my first time. It was really good that my {{opponent}} is not so strong…..If he was a really strong fighter, I would have had had a hell of a time.Why I am smiling a lot? Even though I lost this fight, I don't have any feelings that I really lost a realistic fight. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> as expected.|$|E
5000|$|The Quickmix toy {{came with}} a Cyber Key with the code VE37 on it. When typed in on the {{official}} Transformers web site this code reveals the following secret information: Those Giant Planet Transformers MUST have come from Cybertron originally, because there is an ancient Transformer (actually he’s from 1988) that was named Quickmix too! The ‘original’ Quickmix was an Autobot chemist and he also turned into a cement mixer! <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the Gigantion Quickmix’s great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather!? ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Daynant said: [...] "That is a {{very strange}} story, that a naked madman should take the sword {{out of the hands}} of an armed knight and treat that knight as ye tell me.

5000|$|There {{was found}} an entry in Chet's journal written nearly 2 {{years before his}} death that read. [...] "The {{situation}} in Nicaragua is getting worse. If Nicaragua falls, I guess the rest of Central America will too. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> just some kind of self-inflicted Martyr complex, but I find this recurring thought that perhaps God will call me to be martyred in His service in Colombia.

5000|$|Just as the Dukes’ {{management}} {{were coming}} to terms with dropping the home point against one set of ‘Tigers’, the trip north to face the Glasgow Tigers in the return match a few days later brought the smiles back on their faces. With Jay getting a couple of wins in his last match for the Dukes, a rare away win from Kentwell and a solid 5 paid 6 from Les Sharpe, there was finally some support for the heat leaders and the Dukes came away with a solid 44-34 victory. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a turning point? ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{was some}} {{speculation}} about why Yoshikubo might {{have chosen to}} die by walking into the bush around Yellowknife. Simon Hatcher, a {{professor of psychiatry at}} the University of Ottawa, said that most long wilderness sojourns are a form of temporary suicide, from which people return feeling better. [...] "People who are suicidal can have this fantasy where they can have a temporary escape—a temporary suicide," [...] he told the National Post. [...] "And maybe that way they will stand out, and somebody will come along and save them. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> some form of this woman testing fate." ...|$|E
5000|$|Anupama Chopra from NDTV gave it 1/2 star out of {{five and}} stated that [...] "Hisss has {{marginally}} better special effects and much more nudity but the script is so deliriously inept that, in comparison, the average Ramsay horror film looks like a class act." [...] Mayank Shekhar from Hindustan Times gave it 1 star {{out of five}} and stated that [...] "This is pornography for the hormonally demented teen.

"This song {{means a lot}} to me, so it's {{amazing to}} hear that it's already touched {{a lot of other people}} too", Cass said, [...] "It's such a simple message, to say 'I Love You' but it's {{something}} that sometimes gets lost in the everyday madness and distractions around us, that we forget the true power and meaning of the words - <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a song that can help people remember".|$|R
