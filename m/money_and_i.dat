500|$|Fey was {{an extra}} in a 1998 episode, and after {{watching}} herself, decided to diet and lost 30pounds. She told The New York Times, [...] "I {{was a completely}} normal weight, but I was here in New York City, I had <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't buy any clothes. After I lost weight, there was interest in putting me on camera." [...] In 1999, McKay stepped down as head writer, which led Michaels to approach Fey for the position. She became SNLs first female head writer.|$|E
500|$|Among Bottomley's {{principal}} biographers, Hyman {{suggests that}} his financial fecklessness and disregard for consequences may have originated from his deprived background and sudden acquisition of {{wealth in the}} 1890s. [...] "Success went to his head and he started spending money like a drunken sailor and could never break the habit." [...] It was a wonder, says Hyman, that he stayed out of prison {{as long as he}} did. Searle speculates that Bottomley was protected from prosecution because of his knowledge of wider scandals in the government, particularly after Lloyd George's coalition assumed power in 1916. Symons acknowledges Bottomley's [...] "wonderfully rich public personality" [...] but suggests that there was no substance behind the presentation: throughout his adult life, Bottomley was [...] "more a series of public attitudes than a person". Matthew Engel in The Guardian notes his ability to charm the public even while swindling them; one victim, cheated of £40,000, apparently insisted: [...] "I am not sorry I lent him the <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would do it again". If London had had a mayor in those days, says Engel, Bottomley would have won in a landslide.|$|E
500|$|Critics panned Glitter, {{as well as}} its {{accompanying}} soundtrack; {{both were}} unsuccessful commercially. The accompanying soundtrack album, Glitter, became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch dismissed it as [...] "an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that, while not always critically heralded, was at least nearly consistently successful." [...] Following the negative cloud that was ensuing Carey's personal life at the time, as well as the project's poor reception, her unprecedented $100million five-album record deal with Virgin Records America (EMI Records) was bought out for $50million. Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year. Carey later said that her time at Virgin was [...] "a complete and total stress-fest [...] I made a total snap decision which was based on <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that." [...] Later that year, she signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24million, and launched the record label MonarC. To add further to Carey's emotional burdens, her father, with whom she had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Carey parted from Columbia Records {{and signed}} a record-breaking $100 million five-album {{recording}} contract with Virgin Records America (EMI Records). She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Tommy Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. However, in July 2001, Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. Due to this situation, Virgin and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of Carey's film Glitter, {{as well as its}} soundtrack of the same name. Both the releases received negative feedback and were commercially unsuccessful. This also resulted in her deal with Virgin being bought out for $50million. Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year.

2500|$|Although Miranda's U.S. {{popularity}} {{continued to}} increase, {{she began to}} lose favor with some Brazilians. On 10 July 1940, she returned to Brazil and was welcomed by cheering fans. Soon after her arrival, however, the Brazilian press began criticizing Miranda for accommodating American commercialism and projecting a negative image of Brazil. Members of the upper class felt that her image was [...] "too black", and she was criticized in a Brazilian newspaper for [...] "singing bad-taste black sambas". Other Brazilians criticized Miranda for playing a stereotypical [...] "Latina bimbo" [...] in her first interview after her arrival in the U.S. In the New York World-Telegram interview, she played up her then-limited knowledge of English language: [...] "I say money, money, money. I say twenty words in English. I say money, money, <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say hot dog!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Last Train to Paris {{is officially}} {{credited}} to Diddy – Dirty Money. The group was formed when Diddy asked former Danity Kane member, Dawn Richard, and singer-songwriter Kalenna Harper to perform alongside {{him on the}} album. In an interview with All Hip-Hop, Diddy said that Dirty Money is [...] "not about no drug money, illegal money, or anything negative". Instead he described it as [...] "a sound, a movement, [...] a crew", something fresh and unique for his new album. He explained that [...] "he wanted to tell a love story" [...] but needed Dirty Money because [...] "he couldn’t just tell the male’s point of view." [...] Further elaborating on the group's name, Diddy told Slant Magazine that its origins are dated back to 2005 when the group was at [...] "a strip club in Jacksonville, Florida, during the Super Bowl. People heard I was there, {{and all of a}} sudden so many people came in that I had to rush outside to my truck. I was sitting there with a bunch of <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was like, 'Damn, this is some dirty money.' A light bulb went off that day." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly described the group's role on the album as [...] "fleshing out Last Trains skeletal storyline, playing jealous lovers, disappointed partners, and commanding divas to his conflicted playboy." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News said that Dirty Money [...] "sing loudly, often and well -- a good thing", on the disk. [...] Henry Yanney of Soulculture said that Last Train to Paris was vocally-led Harper and Richard, who give the album [...] "attitude and style". He said [...] "the duo sing harmoniously and break into solos with much precision and pace, remaining in sync at all times with the abrasive club influenced beats on hand." [...] David Jeffries said that at times Dirty Money came off as [...] "fine background singers or part of Diddy’s Fashion Week posse." [...] Matt Sayles disagreed, stating that on the record, [...] "Diddy takes a backseat" [...] which allowed [...] "Kaleena and Dawn to do a lot of the heavy lifting (and breathing) on a wide range of songs." [...] Dirty Money was inspired by the 1980s bands Soul II Soul and Loose Ends though Diddy pointed out that he [...] "wanted to flip things" [...] by having two girls and one guy in the band. [...] "Two bad divas, one for the left and one for the right side of me". He told Amos Barshad from New York that [...] " [...] diamonds in the rough. These girls got a certain flavor and swagger, which is rare in this marketplace." ...|$|E
