The {{article is}} devoted to {{problems}} of hydrodynamic simulations <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> friction in the liquid.

For this purpose developed a technique and algorithm for determining the carrying capacity of the bearing with arbitrary profile <b>of</b> the <b>sliding</b> sleeve, and developed recommendations for obtaining rational profiles of sleeve of bearing. On the basis of this methodology developed a system for calculating the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> bearing with the use of package of computer algebra Mathcad. Developed calculation system was used to search for variants of rational profiling <b>of</b> sleeve <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> bearings. Were found variants <b>of</b> profile <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> sleeves that provide an increase in carrying capacity compared with the supports that use traditional (round) profile of the sleeve.

40|$|The heat generation, contact state, {{material}} flow and friction coefficient are all intertwined during {{friction stir welding}} (FSW) because of the fully thermomechanical coupling nature of FSW.

This work detailedly clarified how to roughly estimate the fraction <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> and friction coefficient at the tool/workpiece interface. Results showed that friction coefficients in FSW of various materials were in a range of 0. 2 - 0. 56. The fraction <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> was significantly affected by friction coefficient. The fraction <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> was in a range of about 73 - 88 % for FSW of Al 1100 -H 14 alloy and about 38 - 65 % for FSW of Al 7050 -T 7451 alloy.
