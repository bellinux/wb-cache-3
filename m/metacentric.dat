40|$|Abstract. Among common shrews {{from the}} hybrid zone between the Moscow and Seliger {{chromosomal}} races, we found an adult male characterised by two <b>metacentrics</b> {{not found in}} either race (hm, nq). These <b>metacentrics</b> apparently arose by a whole-arm reciprocal translocation (WART) {{of two of the}} Seliger <b>metacentrics</b> (hn, mq). Although such rearrangements have been postulated previously to explain racial dif-ferences, this is the first direct evidence of a WART in the common shrew. Apart from the unusual <b>metacentrics,</b> the karyotype of the male shrew was that of an F 1 hybrid, i. e. this individual was a complex heterozygote that formed a chain-of- 11 configura-tion at meiosis. Regular synapsis was demonstrated at pachytene, complete configura-tions were scored at diakinesis, and mature sperm were observed within the meiotic preparations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Paedocypris is a newly {{established}} genus {{of fish in}} Southeast Asia. Paedocypris is characterized by several unique features, including a tiny adult size (thus named miniature fish or minifish), fragmentary habitats of acidic peat blackwater swamps, an unusual reproduction mode and truncated development. These peculiarities lend themselves excellent for studying chromosome evolution and rapid speciation in vertebrates but also make them highly controversial for the phylogenetic position. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have established an organ procedure to prepare chromosome spreads from tiny organs of minifish and performed a cytogenetic study on two species of the genus Paedocypris, namely P. carbunculus (Pc) and P. sp. "Singkep" (Ps). We found 30 and 34 chromosomes in diploid cells of Pc and Ps, respectively, which are unusual in teleost fishes. The diploid metaphase has 5 pairs of <b>metacentrics</b> and 7 pairs of subtelocentrics in Pc compared to 3 pairs of <b>metacentrics</b> and 11 pairs of subtelocentrics in Ps, whereas the haploid metaphase contains 5 <b>metacentrics</b> and 7 subtelocentrics in Pc compared to 3 <b>metacentrics</b> and 11 subtelocentrics Ps. Chromosome behavior in first meiosis revealed {{the presence of a}} chromosomal ring consisting of 2 <b>metacentrics</b> in Pc, suggesting that centric fusion rather than fission was responsible for the karyotypic evolution from Ps to Pc. Flow cytometry revealed that Pc had a 45 % nuclear staining intensity relative to medaka whose genome is 700 Mb in size and contains 0. 81 pg DNA. The Pc genome should have 315 Mb in length and 0. 36 pg of DNA, which represent one of the smallest values in vertebrates, suggesting genome miniaturization in this organism. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that gross chromosome rearrangements and genome miniaturization have accompanied the evolution of Paedocypris fishes. Our data also place Paedocypris outside currently described taxa of the Cypriniformes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the karyotype of the yellow-bellied sea snake, Pelamis platurus from Costa Rica. The diploid number is 38 chromosomes, with 20 macrochromosomes and 18 microchromosomes. The pairs 1 and 2 are <b>metacentrics,</b> pair 3 is subtelocentric and pairs from 4 to 9 have the centromere in a terminal position. Females have a pair of slightly heteromorphic chromosomes identified as sex chromosomes Z and W; both are <b>metacentrics</b> but have different centromeric index and W is slightly smaller. The pattern of heteromorphism in sex chromosomes and the secondary constriction present in some sea snake karyotypes could be useful parameters in determining evolutionary relationships between the sea snakes.

5|$|The {{karyotype}} generally includes 56chromosomes with a {{total of}} 54major arms (2n=56, FN=54) in specimens from both Bolivia and Brazil; a poorly prepared Paraguayan specimen seems to have a similar karyotype. In this karyotype, all autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible). However, in two specimens from the Brazilian states of Tocantins and São Paulo, one pair of autosomes contains both an acrocentric and a <b>metacentric</b> chromosome (with two equally long arms), yielding an FN of 55. One arm of the <b>metacentric</b> chromosome consists entirely of heterochromatin. Apparently, a whole heterochromatic arm was added to this chromosome; cases of similar variation are known from the rodents Peromyscus, Clyomys, and Thaptomys. Both sex chromosomes are acrocentric, and X is larger than Y. In addition to heterochromatin near the centromere, the Y chromosome contains two large blocks of heterochromatin on its long arm. The karyotype is closely similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large <b>metacentric</b> height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} includes 80 chromosomes with a {{total of}} 86 major arms (2n=80; FN=86). The X chromosome is subtelocentric (with one pair of long arms and one pair of short arms) and the Y chromosome is acrocentric (with only one pair of arms, or with a minute second pair). Among the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the four <b>metacentric</b> or submetacentric (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of those have a minute second pair of arms and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90. This karyotype is similar to other known karyotypes of members of Euryoryzomys.|$|E
40|$|The {{chromosomes}} (2 n = 2 x = 24) of Larix principis-rupprechtii {{are composed}} of six pairs of large <b>metacentrics</b> and six pairs of medium-sized submetacentrics. The identification of homologous pairs is hampered by their high degree of similarity at the morphological level in each group. As {{one of the most}} extensively used methods in molecular cytogenetics producing chromosome landmarks, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has significantly facilitated karyotype construction, especially in species with morphologically similar chromosomes. This study developed a simple but effective use of combinatorial labeling probes to distinguish chromosomes of Larix principis-rupprechtii by multicolor FISH. Three highly repetitive sequences in Larix were selected: 25 S rDNA hybridized at all of the secondary constrictions of two pairs of <b>metacentrics</b> and the largest pair of submetacentrics; 5 S rDNA hybridized at subtelomeric sites of one pair of <b>metacentrics</b> that also harboured 25 S rDNA on different arms; LPD family sequences are tandem repeats hybridized at proximal regions of 22 chromosomes. The three different probes were labeled with only two different labels, hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of Larix principis-rupprechtii, simultaneously visualized, and unequivocally distinguished in a single FISH experiment. These multicolor FISH marks largely improved the karyotype analysis of Larix principis-rupprechti...|$|R

40|$|Immunocytochemical and {{electron}} {{microscopic analysis}} of synaptonemal complexes (SCs) {{was carried out}} for the first time in homozygotes and complex Robertsonian heterozygotes (hybrids) of the common shrew, Sorex araneus Linnaeus, 1758, from a newly discovered hybrid zone between the Moscow and the Neroosa chromosomal races. These races differ in four monobrachial homologous <b>metacentrics,</b> and closed SC tetravalent is expected to be formed in meiosis of a hybrid. Indeed, such a multivalent was found at meiotic prophase I in hybrids. Interactions between multivalent and both autosomes and/or the sex chromosomes were observed. For the first time we have used immunocytochemical techniques to analyse asynapsis in S. araneus and show that the multivalent pairs in an orderly fashion with complete synapsis. Despite some signs of spermatocytes arrested in the meiotic prophase I, hybrids had large number of active sperm. Thus, Moscow – Neroosa hybrid males that form a ring-of-four meiotic configuration are most likely not sterile. Our results support previous demonstrations that monobrachial homology of <b>metacentrics</b> of the common shrew does not lead to complete reproductive isolation between parapatric chromosomal races of the species...|$|R
5|$|The {{karyotype}} of Drymoreomys albimaculatus is 2n=62, FN=62: {{the animal}} has 62 chromosomes, and 29 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short {{as to be}} almost invisible) and one small pair is <b>metacentric</b> (with two equally long arms). Both sex chromosomes are submetacentric (with one arm noticeably longer than the other), and X is larger than Y. Blocks of heterochromatin are present on all autosomes and the long arm of Y. Telomeric sequences are found near the centromeres of the sex chromosomes. Aspects of this karyotype—with {{a high number of}} mostly acrocentric chromosomes and the presence of heterochromatin on the Y chromosome—are consistent with the pattern seen in other oryzomyines. However, no other oryzomyine has exactly the same karyotype as D. albimaculatus. Other species in clade D have fewer chromosomes, down to 16 in Nectomys palmipes, although the karyotype of Eremoryzomys polius is unknown. This suggests an evolutionary trend of decreasing chromosome number within the clade.|$|E

40|$|The common shrews, Sorex araneus Linnaeus, 1758, inhabiting the {{territory}} of Belarus, are characterized by a significant variation {{in the frequency of}} Robertsonian (Rb) translocations. The frequency clines for translocations specific of three chromosome races: the West Dvina (gm, hk, ip, no, qr), Kiev (g/m, hi, k/o, n, p, q, r), and Białowieża (g/r, hn, ik, m/p, o, q) have already been studied in this territory. In this communication we report new data on polymorphic populations with Rb <b>metacentrics</b> specific of the Neroosa race (go, hi, kr, mn, p/q) in south-eastern Belarus, analyse the distribution of karyotypes in southern and central Belarus and draw particular attention to the fixation of the acrocentric variants of chromosomes in this area. The results show that certain Rb <b>metacentrics</b> specific of the Neroosa, West Dvina, Kiev, and Białowieża races (namely, go and pq; ip; ko; hn and ik, respectively) are absent in many polymorphic populations. Thus, the karyotypic differentiation of S. araneus in the studied area is determined by unequal spread of different Rb translocations and by fixation of acrocentric variants of specific chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A {{group of}} trout that reside in streams of the desiccating lake basins of southeastern Oregon differ {{markedly}} from other known Salmo. Known commonly as the red-band trout, this fish {{was subjected to}} chromosome analysis for comparison with other species of western North American Salmo. The karyotype of the red-banded trout is 2 n = 58 composed of 44 <b>metacentrics,</b> 2 <b>metacentrics</b> with satallites, 2 sub-metacentrics and 10 acrocentrics to give 104 chromosome arms. This karyotype is identical {{to that of the}} California golden trout, S. a. guabonita. A similar karyotype has been found, for trout from the Deschutes River and summer-run steelhead from the Siletz and Clearwater rivers. The chromosomal and distributional data is believed to indicate a widespread golden trout complex composed of the red-band trout, the California golden trout, and the Kern River trout inhabiting the Pacific Coast drainage from British Columbia to southern California. In the course of this study, a new karyotype was discovered for the Alvord cutthroat trout of 2 n = 64 with 40 <b>metacentrics</b> and 24 acrocentrics to give 104 chromosome arms. Nineteen enzyme systems were analysed by starch-gel electrophoresis in two populations of the red-band trout. The Bridge Creek population displayed very low variability for only malate dehydroge, nase (MDH) and phosphoglucomutase (PGM). No variability was found in the Three-Mile Creek population. A new allele, not previously reported was found for MDH in the Bridge Creek population. The high degree of genetic similarity among and between these populations is thought {{to be the result of}} selection pressure rather than stochastic processes. The isolated populations of the red-banded trout appear to be well adapted to their present environment, but without the genetic variability to meet future environmental changes, they may face extinction. Their most immediate threat is man' s use of the environment...|$|R
