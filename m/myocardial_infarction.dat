5|$|In 1999, Khan {{was visiting}} {{his family in}} the United States when he {{suffered}} from kidney failure. He died of <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction</b> on 9 October in Indianapolis {{at the age of}} 85. His body was flown to Karachi on 15 October, where he was buried {{on the grounds of the}} OPP office compound.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> are {{generally}} clinically classified into ST elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). These {{are based on}} changes to an ECG. STEMIs make up about 25 - 40% of <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions.</b> A more explicit classification system, based on international consensus in 2012, also exists. This classifies <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> into five types: ...|$|R

5|$|In general, for adults, doses {{are taken}} {{four times a}} day for fever or arthritis, with doses near the maximal daily dose used {{historically}} for the treatment of rheumatic fever. For the prevention of <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction</b> (MI) in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is an {{important}} part of the treatment of those who have had a <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction</b> (heart attack). One trial found that among those likely having an ST-segment elevation MI, aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%. There was no difference in major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction.</b> These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> with {{pathological}} Q {{waves are}} referred to as ST elevation MIs.|$|R

5000|$|In 2010, a Phase III study {{entitled}} VISTA-16 {{was initiated}} {{to evaluate the}} safety and efficacy of short-term treatment with varespladib methyl in subjects with ACS. The trial was halted in March 2012 due to insufficient efficacy. [...] On November 18, 2013, an excess of <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions,</b> and of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> and stroke in the VISTA-16 study were reported.|$|R
5|$|Prostaglandins, local hormones {{produced}} in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes {{are responsible for the}} aggregation of platelets that form blood clots. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction.</b>|$|E
5|$|The drug {{strontium}} ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and {{lessen the}} incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also {{increases the risk of}} venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction.</b> Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of cTnI {{in adult}} cardiomyocytes {{is estimated to}} be ~3.2 days and there is a pool of unassembled cardiac TnI in the cytoplasm. Cardiac TnI is exclusively expressed in the myocardium and is thus a highly specific diagnostic marker for cardiac muscle injuries, and cTnI has been universally used as indicator for <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction.</b> An increased level of serum cTnI also independently predicts poor prognosis of critically ill patients in the absence of acute coronary syndrome.|$|E

50|$|How {{to prevent}} {{postoperative}} myocardial injury remains unknown. Beta blockers prevent <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions,</b> {{but at the}} cost of devastating strokes.|$|R
50|$|A {{small but}} {{significantly}} {{increased risk of}} <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> (heart attacks) has been noted when combining the safety outcome data from multiple trials.|$|R
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction</b> (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|Because aortic {{dissection}} {{may present}} {{to the emergency room}} physician similar to a <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction,</b> the physician must be careful to make the proper diagnosis prior to initiating treatment for <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction</b> since the treatment regimen for <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction</b> can be lethal to an individual presenting with aortic dissection.|$|E
25|$|While {{the pain}} may be {{confused}} with the pain of a <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction</b> (heart attack), aortic dissection is usually not associated with the other signs that suggest <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction,</b> including heart failure and ECG changes.|$|E
40|$|No {{evidence}} for a reduction of <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> by acarbose With great interest we read the article of Hanefeld et al., in which a meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials was presented. This meta-analysis compared acarbose with placebo in pa-tients with type 2 diabetes {{with respect to the}} incidence of cardiovascular events. 1 The conclusion that acarbose can prevent <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> sur-prised us because, currently finishing a Cochrane systematic review on the topic, 2 we found only scarce outcomes regarding diabetes-related morbidity s...|$|R
25|$|While supplementation {{does not}} appear to affect the risk of death, there is an {{increased}} risk of <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> with calcium supplementation, kidney stones, and stomach problems.|$|R
25|$|Ischemia or non-ST {{elevation}} <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> may manifest as ST {{depression or}} inversion of T waves. It may also affect the high frequency {{band of the}} QRS.|$|R
25|$|The Belfast {{system was}} {{established}} to reach patients with acute <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction.</b> The resuscitated patients were those whose hearts fibrillated after the ambulance was at the scene or en route. The system reacted too slowly to resuscitate persons who fibrillated before the call was placed. In 1966, {{it was assumed that}} most cardiac deaths in the community were the result of acute <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction.</b> It was not appreciated that ventricular fibrillation can occur without <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction</b> and have only seconds of warning—or none at all.|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be used as a marker of <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction.</b> Following a <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction,</b> levels of LDH peak at 3–4 days and remain {{elevated}} for up to 10 days. In this way, elevated levels of LDH (where the level of LDH1 is higher than that of LDH2, i.e. the LDH Flip, as normally, in serum, LDH2 is higher than LDH1) can be useful for determining whether a patient has had a <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction</b> if they come to doctors several days after an episode of chest pain.|$|E
25|$|These micro RNAs have pivotal {{roles in}} {{development}} and physiology of muscle tissues including the heart. MiR-1 {{is known to}} be involved in important role in heart diseases such as hypertrophy, <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction,</b> and arrhythmias. Studies have shown that MiR-1 is an important regulator of heart adaption after ischemia or ischaemic stress and it is upregulated in the remote myocardium of patients with <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction.</b> Also MiR-1 is downregulated in myocardial infarcted tissue compared to healthy heart tissue. Plasma levels of MiR-1 {{can be used as a}} sensitive biomarker for <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... "Silent" [...] <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> {{can happen}} without any {{symptoms}} at all. These cases can be discovered later on electrocardiograms, using blood enzyme tests, or at autopsy after {{a person has}} died. Such silent <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> represent between 22 and 64% of all infarctions, and are {{more common in the}} elderly, in those with diabetes mellitus and after heart transplantation. In people with diabetes, differences in pain threshold, autonomic neuropathy, and psychological factors have been cited as possible explanations for the lack of symptoms. In heart transplantation, the donor heart is not fully innervated by the nervous system of the recipient.|$|R
