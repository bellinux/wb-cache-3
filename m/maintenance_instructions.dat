500|$|As CAS, one of Scherger's first tasks was {{investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} a nuclear arsenal for the Air Force. During visits to Britain and the US he explored the possibility of weapons being delivered by the RAAF's Sabre fighters or its Canberra bombers. In 1958, he held discussions with the Chief of Staff of the USAF, General Thomas D. White, about storing nuclear weapons in Australia under USAF control. In 1959 and 1960, Scherger had information sent out, including manuals and <b>maintenance</b> <b>instructions,</b> regarding equipping the Canberras with Mark 7 nuclear bombs, the same type that the British Canberras used. For a time, Scherger championed {{the purchase of a}} force of British-built Vulcan heavy bombers but excessive cost and a governmental determination to remain [...] "under the shelter of the American nuclear umbrella" [...] put paid to the proposal. Instead, in 1963, the decision was taken to purchase the General Dynamics F-111 swing-wing bomber [...] "on the understanding that it could carry nuclear weapons".|$|E

These systems are dedicated to several applications where the operator needs a natural (hands free) access to information, to carry out measurements and/or operate on a devices (e. g. <b>maintenance,</b> <b>instruction).</b> These systems merge live images acquired by a video camera with synthetic data (multimedia documents including CAD models and text) and present the result properly registered in the real world.

5000|$|In 1993, the Private Eye {{was used}} in Thad Starner's wearable, based on Doug Platt's system and built from a kit from Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display on loan from Devon Sean McCullough, and the Twiddler chording {{keyboard}} made by Handykey. Many iterations later this system became the MIT [...] "Tin Lizzy" [...] wearable computer design, and Starner {{went on to become}} one of the founders of MIT's wearable computing project. 1993 also saw Columbia University's augmented-reality system known as KARMA (Knowledge-based Augmented Reality for Maintenance Assistance). Users would wear a Private Eye display over one eye, giving an overlay effect when the real world was viewed with both eyes open. KARMA would overlay wireframe schematics and <b>maintenance</b> <b>instructions</b> on top of whatever was being repaired. For example, graphical wireframes on top of a laser printer would explain how to change the paper tray. The system used sensors attached to objects in the physical world to determine their locations, and the entire system ran tethered from a desktop computer.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{weeks after}} the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Truly {{returned}} to NASA to become NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight on February 20, 1986.
