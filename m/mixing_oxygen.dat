40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether central venous oxygen saturation can be used as an alternative to <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation in patients with cardiogenic and septic shock. Design: Prospective clinical study. Setting: A tertiary intensive care unit in a university hospital. Participants: Twenty patients with cardiogenic or septic shock requiring a pulmonary artery catheter and inotropic support. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The central venous oxygen saturation overestimated the <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation by a mean bias (or an absolute difference) of 6. 9 %, and the 95 % limits of agreement were large (- 5. 0 % to 18. 8 %). The difference between central and <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation appeared to be more significant when <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation was < 70 %. The changes in central and <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation did not follow the line of perfect agreement closely in different clinical conditions. The central or <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation had a significant ability to predict the status of cardiac output state, but this ability was reduced when the effect of hyperoxia was not considered. Conclusion: Central and <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation measurements are not interchangeable numerically...|$|R

50|$|Mixing {{arises when}} the energy {{gap between the}} 2s and 2p orbitals is not very large. This leads to a mixing of the two orbitals that end in a {{repulsion}}. This repulsion causes a large enough shift in energy that the 2s σ* energy is lowered and the 2p σ energy is raised considerably. This is only a trend with the early elements, after oxygen the mixing ceases. The underlying cause for the mixing is the similarity in energies of the 2s and 2p orbitals {{in tandem with the}} same symmetry(gerade/ungerade). The early elements have such a low effective nuclear charge that they become prone to <b>mixing.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> is the first diatomic where the energy difference between the 2s and 2p orbitals is significant enough to neglect mixing.

The assumption that a low <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation (normal = 60% except for the coronary sinus where it approximates 40% reflecting the high metabolic rate of the myocardium) represents less than adequate oxygen delivery is consistent with physiological and metabolic observations. High oxygen extraction is associated with low cardiac output and decreased <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) dry-etching method that uses microwave plasma. The {{applicability of the}} method for fabricating microstructures and removing residual PDMS is also verified. The etch rate of PDMS was dominantly influenced by the gas flux ratio of CF 4 /O 2 and the microwave power. While the PDMS etch rate increased as the flux ratio of CF 4 was increased, the etch rate decreased as the flux ratio of O 2 was increased. The maximum etch rate of 4. 31 μm min− 1 was achieved when <b>mixing</b> <b>oxygen</b> (O 2) and tetrafluoromethane (CF 4) at a 1 : 2 ratio at 800 W power. The PDMS etch rate almost linearly increased with the microwave power. The ratio of the vertical etch rate to the lateral etch rate was {{in a range of}} 1. 14 – 1. 64 and varied with the gas fluxes. In consideration of potential applications of the proposed PDMS etching method, array-type PDMS microwells and network-type microprotrusion structures were fabricated. The contact angle was dramatically increased from 104 ◦ (non-etched PDMS surface) to 148 ◦ (etched PDMS surface) and the surface was thereby modified to be superhydrophobic. In addition, a thin PDMS skin that blocked holes and PDMS residues affixed in nickel microstructures was successively removed.

40|$|This Perspective covers {{sustainable}} oxidation processes using doped cerias, ceria-supported catalysts and ceria-based mixed oxides. Firstly, {{we consider}} the general properties of ceria-based catalysts. We outline {{the advantages of the}} ceria redox cycle, and explain the dynamic behaviour of these catalysts in the presence of metal additives and dopants. We then review three types of catalytic oxidation processes: preferential CO oxidation (PROX), oxidative dehydrogenation and the selective oxidations of hydrocarbons and inorganics. The preferential oxidation of CO from hydrogen-rich mixtures is interesting for fuel cell applications. Copper-ceria catalysts, where the copper species are well dispersed and interact strongly with the ceria surface, show good selectivity and activity. The oxidative dehydrogenation of small alkanes is another important potential application. To avoid <b>mixing</b> <b>oxygen</b> and hydrocarbons at high temperatures, one can run the dehydrogenation over a conventional Pt/Sn catalyst while burning the hydrogen formed using the ceria lattice oxygen. This safer redox process allows separate tuning of the dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion stages. A combinatorial screening showed good results for ceria doped with Pb, Cr or Bi, amongst others. Finally, we also discuss the catalytic selective oxidation of various hydrocarbons, oxygenates and inorganic molecules (H 2 S, H 2 and NH 3). The goal here is either product valorisation or waste stream purification. Ceria-based materials show promise in a variety of such selective oxidations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: In the United States, venovenous extracorporeal {{life support}} has {{traditionally}} been performed with atrial drainage and femoral reinfusion (atrio-femoral flow). Although flow reversal (femoro-atrial flow) may alter recirculation and extracorporeal flow, no direct comparison of these 2 modes has been undertaken. Objective: Our goal was to prospectively compare atrio-femoral and femoro-atrial flow in adult venovenous extracorporeal life support for respiratory failure. Methods: A modified bridge enabling conversion between atrio-femoral and femoro-atrial flow was incorporated in the extracorporeal circuit. Bypass was initiated in the direction that provided the highest pulmonary arterial <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation, and the following measurements were taken: (1) maximum extracorporeal flow, (2) highest achievable pulmonary arterial <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation, and (3) flow required to maintain the same pulmonary arterial <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation in both directions. Flow direction was then reversed, and the measurements were repeated. Data were compared with paired t tests and are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Results: Ten patients were studied, and 9 {{were included in the}} data analysis. Femoro-atrial bypass provided (1) higher maximal extracorporeal flow (femoro-atrial flow = 55. 6 ± 9. 8 mL/kg per minute, atrio-femoral flow = 51. 1 ± 11. 1 mL/kg per minute; P =. 04) and (2) higher pulmonary arterial <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation (femoro-atrial flow = 89. 9 % ± 6. 6 %, atrio-femoral flow = 83. 2 % ± 4. 2 %; P =. 006); (3) furthermore, it required less flow to maintain an equivalent pulmonary arterial <b>mixed</b> venous <b>oxygen</b> saturation (femoro-atrial flow = 37. 0 ± 12. 2 mL/kg per minute, atrio-femoral flow = 46. 4 ± 8. 8 mL/kg per minute; P =. 04).

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} stress {{evolution}} in thin sputtered metal and oxide films. To achieve this, a deposition system for reactive direct-current sputtering with integrated in-situ wafer curvature setup {{has been developed}} and is presented here. At first, metal films (zinc, zirconium, niobium and titanium) have been deposited and analyzed during growth. By <b>mixing</b> <b>oxygen</b> into the sputter gas, the corresponding oxide films have been obtained. The stress evolution during {{the growth of the}} metals depends strongly on the mobility of the deposited material and therefor on its melting point. Zinc with a low melting point exhibits the same stress development which has been observed during growth of evaporated films of high mobility. Due to its high mobility, all defects, which occur due the bombardment by reflected argon during sputtering can anneal. In the case of the low mobility metals, effects of the grain boundaries leading to tensile stress and of the bombardment leading to compressive stress have been observed. The analysis of the stress changes upon change of stoichiometry from metallic to oxidic films reveal that these changes cannot be explained by a single effect only. On the one hand, the target oxidizes, which changes the bombardment of the growing film and on the other hand, the growth of the film is affected directly. Adding small amounts of oxygen into the sputter gas leads to nano-crystalline films by immobilizing the grain boundaries of the growing metallic film. This causes high tensile stresses even if the same metallic film grown at the same deposition conditions just without addition of oxygen contained compressive stresses. The oxygen also influences the sputter target, which oxidizes increasingly upon increasing oxygen flow, until the whole target is covered with an oxide layer. In this growing oxide layer, an increasing number of oxygen ions is created, which is accelerated towards the substrate and causes high compressive stresses. Changes between the different oxides have also been found in the beginning of growth. The amorphous oxides niobium oxide and titanium oxide exhibit tensile stresses in the beginning of growth, while the crystalline oxides zinc oxide and zirconium oxide no tensile stresses can be found. Here, the compressive stresses dominate already {{in the beginning of the}} growth process. This behavior has been related to the structure and therefor to the different amount of grain boundaries in the material...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of the physical and chemical limnology of Hagelseewli (2339 m a. s. l.) to local meteorological forcing was investigated from 1996 to 1998 using an automatic weather station, thermistor chains, water samples and sediment traps. On-site meteorological measurements revealed the paramount importance of local topographic shading for the limnology of the lake. A high cliff to the south diminishes incident radiation by 15 % to 90 %, resulting in {{a long period of}} ice cover. Hence, the spring and summer seasons are extremely condensed, allowing only about 2 months per year for <b>mixing,</b> <b>oxygen</b> uptake, nutrient inflow, water exchange and phytoplankton growth. Regular measurements of water temperature, chemistry and diatom composition show that Hagelseewli responds very rapidly to changes in nutrient concentrations and light conditions. This response is restricted mainly to an extremely short productivity pulse, which takes place as soon as the lake is completely free of ice. Ice-free conditions are indicated by the occurrence of planktonic diatoms. In contrast to most low-altitude lakes, maximum productivity occurs {{in the middle of the}} water column (6 - 9 m), where first light, and then soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), are the limiting factors. During the period of thawing, large amounts of ammonium enter the lake. Nevertheless, allochthonous nutrient input is not important because SRP, the limiting nutrient for algal growth, originates from the sediments. Water chemistry data and data from sediment traps show that, although autochthonous calcite precipitation does occur, the calcite crystals are redissolved completely in the bottom waters during the extended period of ice cover. Thus, the most important factor for changes in the nutrient budget, primary production and preservation of calcite is the bottom water oxygen status, which is governed by the occurrence of an ice-free period. We hypothesise that the duration of the ice-free period is of minor importance for the generation of particles that might be archived in the sedimentary rec??ord as proxy climate indicators. Such particles are produced mainly during times of peak primary production, which last only for a few days before production decreases again to very low levels. Therefore, with respect to the type of climatic signal that might be recorded in Hagelseewli, we presume that what is most likely to be archived in the sedimentary record is the mere occurrence, rather than the duration of the ice-free period...|$|E
