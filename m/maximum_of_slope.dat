40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the impact of the mesh size of the digital elevation model (DEM) on terrain attributes within an Annualized AGricultural NonPoint Source pollution (AnnAGNPS) Model simulation at watershed scale and provide a correction of slope gradient for low resolution DEMs. The effect of different grid sizes of DEMs on terrain attributes was examined by comparing eight DEMs (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 m). The accuracy of the AnnAGNPS stimulation on runoff, sediments, and nutrient loads is evaluated. The results are as follows: (1) Rnoff does not vary much with decrease of DEM resolution whereas soil erosion and total nitrogen (TN) load change prominently. There is little effect on runoff simulation of AnnAGNPS modeling by the amended slope using an adjusted 50 m DEM. (2) A decrease of sediment yield and TN load is observed with an increase of DEM mesh size from 30 to 60 m; a slight decrease of sediment and TN load with the DEM mesh size bigger than 60 m. There is similar trend for total phosphorus (TP) variation, but with less range of variation, the simulation of sediment, TN, and TP increase, in which sediment increase up to 1. 75 times compared to the model using unadjusted 50 m DEM. In all, the amended simulation still has a large difference relative to the results using 30 m DEM. AnnAGNPS is less reliable for sediment loading prediction in a small hilly watershed. (3) Resolution of DEM has significant impact on slope gradient. The average, minimum, <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> from the various DEMs reduced obviously with the decrease of DEM precision. For the grade of 0 similar to 15 A degrees, the slopes at lower resolution DEM are generally bigger than those at higher resolution DEM. But for the grade bigger than 15 A degrees, the slopes at lower resolution DEM are generally smaller than those at higher resolution DEM. So it is necessary to adjust the slope with a fitting equation. A cubic model is used for correction of slope gradient from lower resolution to that from higher resolution. Results for Dage watershed showed that fine meshes are desired to avoid large underestimates of sediment and total nitrogen loads and moderate underestimates of total phosphorus loads even with the slopes for the 50 m DEM adjusted to be more similar to the slopes from the 30 m DEM. Decreasing the mesh size beyond this threshold does not substantially affect the computed runoff flux but generated prediction errors for nitrogen and sediment yields. So the appropriate DEM will control error and make simulation at acceptable level...|$|E

Methods: Patients with diabetes lower extremity arterial disease accepting 3 D-CEMRA examination in our hospital between May 2013 and December 2015 were selected as the pathology group, and the enhancement <b>maximum</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> increase was measured; healthy volunteers receiving physical examination in our hospital {{during the same period}} were selected as control group, and serum levels of endothelial oxidative stress injury-related molecules of two groups of subjects were determined. Results: The enhancement <b>maximum</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> increase of the lesion-side anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery, peroneal artery and dorsalis pedis artery of pathology group were significantly lower than those of the unaffected-side; serum CyPA, ERK 1, ERK 2, Akt, JAK, HO- 1 and CO content of pathology group were significantly higher than those of control group and negatively correlated with the enhancement <b>maximum</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> increase of lower extremity while Prdx 6, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, eNOS and NO content were significantly lower than those of control group and positively correlated with the enhancement <b>maximum</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> increase of lower extremity.

The restitution properties of action potential duration (APD) are important determinants of electrical {{stability in the}} myocardium. Steepening <b>of</b> the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> APD restitution {{has been shown to}} promote wave break and ventricular fibrillation. The effect of adrenergic stimulation on APD restitution in humans is unknown. Methods and Results—Monophasic action potentials were recorded from the right ventricular septum in 18 patients. Standard APD restitution curves were constructed at 3 basic drive cycle lengths (CLs) of 600, 500, and 400 ms under resting conditions and during infusion of isoprenaline (15 patients) or adrenaline (3 patients). The <b>maximum</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the restitution curves was measured by piecewise linear regression segments of sequential 40 -ms ranges of diastolic intervals in steps of 10 ms. Under control conditions, the maximum slope was steeper at longer basic CLs; eg, mean values for the maximum slope were 1. 0530. 092 at CL 600 ms and 0. 7110. 049 at CL 400 ms (SEM). Isoprenaline increased the steepness <b>of</b> the <b>maximum</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> APD restitution, eg, from a <b>maximum</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> 0. 9230. 058 to a <b>maximum</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> 1. 2020. 121 at CL 500 ms.
