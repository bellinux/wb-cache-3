25|$|A {{provisional}} Protocol 14bis {{had been}} opened for signature in 2009. Pending the ratification of Protocol 14 itself, 14bis was devised {{to allow the}} Court to implement revised procedures in respect of the states which have ratified it. It allowed single judges to reject <b>manifestly</b> <b>inadmissible</b> applications made against the states that have ratified the protocol. It also extended the competence of three-judge chambers to declare applications made against those states admissible and to decide on their merits where there already is a well-established case law of the Court.

Steinberg said that [...] "for over 10 years the EU has been keeping the information regarding funding of NGOs in complete secrecy. My conclusion is that they have something to hide. In addition to a violation of basic principles of government transparency, the secret funding is trying to manipulate the democratic process in Israel." [...] Michael Sfard, a lawyer specializing in international human rights law said Steinberg [...] "invents demons and then chases them.... All the data about the donations of foreign countries to Israeli human rights organizations are published on the Web sites of the organizations, as required by law." ...|$|E
