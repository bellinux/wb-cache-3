2500|$|Anderson {{started to}} get ideas for Magnolia during the long editing period of Boogie Nights (1997). [...] As he got closer to {{finishing}} the film, he started writing down material for his new project. After the critical and financial success of Boogie Nights, New Line Cinema, who backed that film, told Anderson {{that he could do}} whatever he wanted and the filmmaker realized that, [...] "I was in a position I will never ever be in again". Michael De Luca, then Head of Production at New Line, made the deal for Magnolia, granting Anderson final cut without hearing an idea for the film. Originally, Anderson had wanted to make a film that was [...] "intimate and small-scale", something that he could shoot in 30 days. He had the title of [...] "Magnolia" [...] in his head before he wrote the script. As he started writing, the script [...] "kept blossoming" [...] and he realized that there were many actors he wanted to write for and then decided to put [...] "an epic spin on topics that don't necessarily get the epic treatment". He wanted to [...] "make the epic, the all-time great San Fernando Valley movie". Anderson started with lists of images, words and ideas that [...] "start resolving themselves into sequences and shots and dialogue", actors, and music. The first image he had for the film was the smiling face of actress Melora Walters. The next image that came to him was of Philip Baker Hall as her father. Anderson imagined Hall walking up the steps of Walters' apartment and having an intense confrontation with her. Anderson also did research on the <b>magnolia</b> <b>tree</b> and discovered a concept that eating the tree's bark helped cure cancer.|$|E

People would say to one another, ‘Have you seen the Smith-Jenkins’ magnolia? It is a perfect mass of flowers,’ or else ‘Smith-Jenkins tells me there won’t be a single blossom on their magnolia this year; the east winds have turned all the buds black.’ Now if, when we had gone, people still associated our names with the <b>magnolia</b> <b>tree,</b> no matter who temporarily possessed it, if they said, ‘Ah, that’s the tree on which the Gurtleberrys hung their cook because she sent up {{the wrong kind of}} sauce with the asparagus,’ that would be something really due to our own initiative, apart from anything east winds or magnolia vitality might have to say in the matter.” ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then came}} the Goths. My face was in a lather, {{the time of the}} first invasion, and I {{suspended}} my razor in mid-air to gaze out on my beloved field. At the far end I saw a little girl and a little boy, their arms filled with yellow spoil. Ah, thought I, an unwonted benevolence burgeoning, what a delight to me is their delight! It is sweet that children should pick poppies in my field. All summer shall they pick poppies in my field. But they must be little children, I added as an afterthought, and they must pick from the lower end--this last prompted by a glance at the great golden fellows nodding in the wheat beneath my window. Then the razor descended. Shaving was always an absorbing task, and I did not glance out of the window again until the operation was completed. And then I was bewildered. Surely this was not my poppy field. No--and yes, for there were the tall pines clustering austerely together on one side, the <b>magnolia</b> <b>tree</b> burdened with bloom, and the Japanese quinces splashing the driveway hedge with blood. Yes, it was the field, but no wave of poppy-flame spilled down it, nor did the great golden fellows nod in the wheat beneath my window. I rushed into a jacket and out of the house. In the far distance were disappearing two huge balls of colour, orange and yellow, for all the world like perambulating poppies of cyclopean breed.|$|E
