40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was based on visual rhetoric theory to examine how design {{agencies}} experience the design of over-the-counter drug packaging, what challenges they face, and with which rhetorical appeals they convince consumers, while {{they relate to the}} non-art-related conditions, the Swedish <b>Medical</b> <b>Products</b> <b>Agency’s</b> regulations (SMPA). The objective was based on previous research that has begun a discourse on the phenomenon and that designers previously has expressed a lack of dialogue in the graphic expression of over-the-counter drug packaging with the SMPA. To investigate the phenomenon semi-structured interviews was conducted with six professions of five different design agencies whose area of expertise was health and pharmaceutical communication. The results showed that the designers' biggest challenges was to find the balance between the visually attractive as well as the patient safe and reliable graphic expression. The results also showed a challenge in the absence of direct communication with the SMPA in the design process. Such communications had facilitated the process as a dialogue for the graphic expression and its effect on a patient safe packaging, had been possible. The elements in the design process that the respondents considered most essential to persuade the consumers were colors and illustrations. These elements could be widely applied without violating the rules...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) {{are common}} {{bacterial}} infections dominated by lower UTI in women (LUTIW). Symptoms only are insufficient for diagnosis and accordingly, near patient diagnostic tests confidently confirming significant bacteriuria are desirable. The nitrite test (NIT) has low sensitivity, while bacterial and leukocyte counts disjunctively paired in urine sediment microscopy (SED) have high sensitivity. Similar symptomatic cure rates are found post antibiotic vs. placebo therapy {{in patients with}} negative cultures. Consequently, prescription on symptoms only implies unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Aims: to evaluate the diagnostic outcomes of NIT, SED and NIT disjunctively paired with SED (NIT+SED) vs. urine culture, with special focus on bladder incubation time (BIT), and to assess if NIT+SED can reduce unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Methods: A diagnostic, primary care, multicentre study including 1070 women with symptoms suggestive of lower UTI. Results: Significant bacteriuria was found in 77 %. The BIT highly influenced the diagnostic outcomes and the optimal duration was 4 h with sensitivity of 66, 90 and 95 % for NIT, SED and NIT+SED, respectively. SED performed only in NIT negative specimens could reduce unnecessary antibiotics by 10 % vs. prescription on symptoms only. The number needed to test with SED to reduce one unnecessary antibiotic course was five patients at BIT 4 h and six patients at 3 h or overall. Conclusion: The BIT highly influences the diagnostic outcomes with the highest accuracy of NIT+SED. Diagnosis of LUTIW with NIT+SED can reduce unnecessary antibiotic therapy and subsequently decrease antimicrobial resistance.

40|$|To {{identify}} the prevalence and preventability of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) {{in an emergency}} ward setting in a tertiary hospital in Sweden {{and to what extent}} the detected ADRs were reported to the <b>Medical</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Agency</b> (MPA). In this prospective cross sectional observational study, 706 patients admitted to one of the Emergency Wards, at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Stockholm during September 2008 -September 2009, were included. The electronic patient records were reviewed for patients' demographic parameters, prevalence of possible ADRs and assessment of their preventability. In addition, the extent of formal and required ADR reporting to national registers was studied. Approximately 40 percent of the patient population had at least one possible ADR (n = 284). In the multivariable regression model, age and number of drugs were significantly associated with risk of presenting with an ADR (p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 001, respectively). Sex was not identified as a significant predictor of ADRs (p = 0. 27). The most common ADRs were cardiovascular, followed by electrolyte disturbances, and hemorrhage. In 18 percent of the patient population ADRs were the reason for admission or had contributed to admission and 24 % of these ADRs were assessed as preventable. The under-reporting of ADRs to the MPA was 99 %. ADRs are common in Emergency Medicine in tertiary care in Sweden, but under-reporting of ADRs is substantial. The most frequent ADRs are caused by cardiovascular drugs, and significantly associated with age and number of drugs. However, only a minority of the detected serious ADRs contributing to admission could have been avoided by increased risk awareness...|$|R
2500|$|A {{link between}} GlaxoSmithKline's H1N1 flu vaccine Pandemrix and {{childhood}} narcolepsy was investigated {{due to increased}} prevalence of narcolepsy in Irish, Finnish and Swedish children after vaccinations. Finland's National Institute of Health and Welfare recommended that Pandemrix vaccinations be suspended pending further investigation into 15 reported cases of children developing narcolepsy. [...] In Finland in mid-November 2010, 37 cases of children's narcolepsy had been reported by doctors. This {{can be compared to}} the normal average of 3 cases of children's narcolepsy per year. [...] "The incidence of narcolepsy with cataplexy in children/adolescents in the Swedish population increased during the pandemic and vaccination period, with a rapid decline in incidence during the post pandemic period." [...] They concluded that these results [...] "provide strengthened evidence that vaccination with Pandemrix during the pandemic period could be associated with an increase in the risk for narcolepsy with cataplexy in predisposed children/adolescents 19 years and younger." [...] In 2013, the link between Pandemrix and narcolepsy was confirmed by a registry study by the Swedish <b>Medical</b> <b>Products</b> <b>Agency,</b> with a three-fold increase in risk for people under the age of 20.|$|E
