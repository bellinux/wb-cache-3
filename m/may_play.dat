5|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that nonpathogenic strains of H. pylori may be beneficial, e.g., by normalizing stomach acid secretion, and <b>may</b> <b>play</b> a role in regulating appetite, since its presence in the stomach results in a persistent but reversible reduction {{in the level of}} ghrelin.|$|E

5|$|Though {{their effects}} on human populations are often devastating, {{tropical}} cyclones can relieve drought conditions. They also carry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes, which <b>may</b> <b>play</b> {{an important role in}} modulating regional and global climate.|$|E

5|$|Another {{element is}} a {{powerful}} attack substitution that occasionally appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later Final Fantasy titles {{under a variety of}} different names, including Limit Breaks, Desperation Moves, Trances, and Overdrives. Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with experience points and money, called gil (Gold Piece (GP) in the original North American localization). When characters attain a certain amount of experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. An additional player <b>may</b> <b>play</b> during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.|$|E
5|$|Extirpation {{of prairie}} dogs can also {{contribute}} to regional and local biodiversity loss, increased seed depredation, and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs. Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of fungi and spread spores through their feces, thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants (which usually cannot thrive without them). As such, these rodents <b>may</b> <b>play</b> a role in maintaining healthy forests.|$|E
5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind <b>may</b> <b>play</b> a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E

5|$|Genetics <b>may</b> <b>play</b> {{a role in}} {{the risk}} that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found {{usually in}} the stomach. It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who {{found that it was}} present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it <b>may</b> <b>play</b> {{an important role in the}} natural stomach ecology.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{an article}} written by Diana C. Mutz compares the {{politics}} of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign. She states that 3 themes throughout the books are widely predominant '1) the value of tolerance and respect for difference; 2) opposition to violence and punitiveness; and 3) the dangers of authoritarianism.' She suggests that these themes are also present {{in the presidential election}} and it <b>may</b> <b>play</b> a significant role in how Americans have responded to the campaign.|$|E

5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors <b>may</b> <b>play</b> some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Models of the {{evolution}} of the planet's orbit over time suggest that heating resulting from this tidal locking <b>may</b> <b>play</b> {{a major role in the}} planet's geology. Models proposed by scientists predict that tidal heating could yield a surface heat flux about three times greater than the Jupiter's moon Io's, which could result in major geological activity such as volcanoes and plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Seasons <b>may</b> <b>play</b> {{a role in}} some regions. A {{dramatic}} change in colour and texture is created by seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E

5|$|The {{mathematical}} biologist Stuart Kauffman {{has suggested}} that self-organization <b>may</b> <b>play</b> roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, Kauffman {{does not take into}} account the essential role of energy (for example, using pyrophosphate) in driving biochemical reactions in cells, as proposed by Christian DeDuve and modelled mathematically by Richard Bagley and Walter Fontana. Their systems are self-catalyzing but not simply self-organizing as they are thermodynamically open systems relying on a continuous input of energy.|$|E
5|$|The next ring {{is named}} the Le Verrier ring after Urbain Le Verrier, who {{predicted}} Neptune's position in 1846. With an orbital radius of about 53,200km, it is narrow, with a width of about 113km. Its normal optical depth is 0.0062±0.0015, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.7±0.2km. The dust fraction in the Le Verrier ring ranges from 40% to 70%. The small moon Despina, which orbits just {{inside of it}} at 52,526km, <b>may</b> <b>play</b> {{a role in the}} ring's confinement by acting as a shepherd.|$|E
5|$|Water quality: It may be fair {{to presume}} that clean water is {{necessary}} to maintain essential habitat and a healthy population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, {{just as it is}} to the survival of many other invertebrates; however, since Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a terrestrial snail, the effects of water quality are expected to be somewhat indirect. While water quality <b>may</b> <b>play</b> a potential role in the success or decline of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, this relationship has not been clearly defined to date.|$|E
