5000|$|The {{process of}} {{carburization}} works via {{the diffusion of}} carbon atoms into the surface layers of a metal. As metals {{are made up of}} atoms bound tightly into a <b>metallic</b> <b>crystalline</b> <b>lattice,</b> the carbon atoms diffuse into the crystal structure of the metal and either remain in solution (dissolved within the metal crystalline matrix — this normally occurs at lower temperatures) or react with elements in the host metal to form carbides (normally at higher temperatures, due to the higher mobility of the host metal's atoms). If the carbon remains in solid solution, the steel is then heat treated to harden it. Both of these mechanisms strengthen the surface of the metal, the former by forming pearlite or martensite, and the latter via the formation of carbides. Both of these materials are hard and resist abrasion.|$|E

Electric voltage is applied between the electrode- and counter electrode surfaces in which a layer is formed within the electrolyte fluid with a layer thickness. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for producing <b>metallic</b> <b>crystalline</b> surface structure by galvanic metal deposition on an electrode surface that is arranged within an electrolyte fluid (3) against a counter electrode containing metal to be deposited, comprises horizontally arranging the electrode surface and a surface associated to the counter electrode {{in such a way that}} the electrode- and counter electrode surfaces rest relative to the electrolyte fluid. Electric voltage is applied between the electrode- and counter electrode surfaces in which a layer is formed within the electrolyte fluid with a layer thickness extending itself orthogonal to electrode surface, adjacent to the electrode surface. A convection flow forms within the electrode surface and is initiated subsequently through a concentration gradient induced by metal ions and oriented orthogonal to electrode surface, and through a density gradient. Depletion induced through deposition on the electrode surface adjusts on metal ions directly at the electrode surface adjacent within the electrolyte fluid. The metal ion concentration uniformly increases with increasing orthogonal interval to electrode surface within the layer. The concentration gradient is uniformly distributed over the total electrode surface. The electrolyte fluid and/or electrode and/or counter electrode are held respectively at same temperature. The convection flow forms itself exclusively under gravity condition, and the electrode surface is oriented vertically to gravity vector. The surface of semiconductor wafer, a glass substrate or a film is used as electrode surface. A layer from electrically insulated materials is section-wisely applied on the electrode surface. The metal is heavy metal and/or its alloy, non-ferrous metal and element of subgroup such as gold and silver. The <b>metallic</b> <b>crystalline</b> surface structure rises as rib-like and steep-edge like crystallite over the planar electrode surface. The crystallite has a length of maximum 100 mu m, and a width of maximum 25 mu m on its base. The crystallite has two crystallite edges that cut itself on a crystal point or a crystalline ridge under an angle of smaller than 60 degrees C. USE - The method for producing <b>metallic</b> <b>crystalline</b> surface structure by galvanic metal deposition on an electrode surface useful for producing bonded connection.

40|$|Finding new ionic {{conductors}} {{that enable}} significant advancements {{in the development}} of energy-storage devices is a challenging goal of current material science. Aside of material classes as ionic liquids or amorphous ion conductors, the so-called plastic crystals (PCs) {{have been shown to be}} good candidates combining high conductivity and favourable mechanical properties.
