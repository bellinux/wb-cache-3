25|$|General Juan Lavalle was {{initially}} neither federalist nor unitarian, but {{after his return}} he began {{to be influenced by}} the unitarians, who tried to gain him for their side. The bulk of the army arrived to Buenos Aires on November 26, being in a bad shape: they lacked clothing and food, they had unpaid wages since <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> resented the peace treaty. There were rumors in the city that the army would revolt against the governor Dorrego, but he dismissed those rumors. The leaders of the revolution met on December 1 to organize the coup, and Dorrego began to reconsider it. But according to the memoirs of Tomás de Iriarte, the minister Tomás Guido prevented the government from organizing a proper resistance. Lavalle’s forces gathered in La Recoleta, and began to march at 3:30 in the morning, once he got the horses for the cavalry. The admiral William Brown supported the operation and prepared a naval siege of the Fort (modern Casa Rosada), but it was not needed. Lacking any means of defense, Dorrego escaped to the countryside. A group of soldiers occupied the Buenos Aires Cabildo and another secured the police. It was unclear if the Fort would begin a resistance, but once the departure of Dorrego was known, the revolutionaries claimed victory and played a military march.|$|E

According to a brand manager for the company, [...] "Over the past six years, the Tour DuPont has been an excellent vehicle for promoting our products. However, we need to focus more on strategic markets {{in other parts of the}} world, where a sustained annual program versus a two-week event can better leverage the DuPont brand equity for profitable growth". Race organizer Mike Plant explained that [...] "I talked to them a couple of <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> they had to make a hard decision. They don't have hundreds of millions of dollars to put into worldwide advertising. They put a ton of money into this event and they built up a valuable franchise, but, like Motorola, corporations change the way they do business". Plant reported that polling had showed that public recognition of the event had grown significantly, but also that awareness of who sponsored it had declined.|$|E

Of her return, Anderson explained [...] "I told my mum and dad that I was coming back, and they almost fell off their chairs. They said: 'Hang on, didn't Charlie die?' It's hilarious, because this time twelve months ago I was keeping it the biggest secret from everyone as to whether Charlie would live or die, and now I'm {{in the same boat}} again as far as not giving anything away."

500|$|With the 2012 {{continuation}} of Dallas, {{there was talk}} of some Knots Landing characters returning to air. Rumors began surfacing that both Van Ark and Shackelford would reprise their roles as Valene and Gary. Ted Shackelford passed on the small role the producers offered him to reprise his role as Gary Ewing on the new series. [...] Van Ark refuted the claims, saying: [...] "Well, rumor has it… I’m having lunch with Ted tomorrow. They asked him to come down and be part of it. It was several <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> he’s deeply into filming The Young and the Restless, the daytime soap for CBS. But if they asked Gary, maybe they’ll ask [...]" [...] She would, however, love to be involved if the producers asked her, especially to torment fellow cast-member Larry Hagman. [...] "There is no doubt about it. This man I loved so much, Larry Hagman… I was just at his birthday party several months ago… I would kill, that if Val came back, if it was trouble for J.R.. Because they were always at odds." [...] However, Gary and Valene's daughter, Lucy Ewing, along with Ray Krebbs have made appearances in the new series. Although both Shackleford and Van Ark appeared in the 1991 series finale of Dallas playing [...] "alternative" [...] versions of Gary and Valene (the episode depicted a fantasy world in which J.R. had never been born), there have been no real crossovers of story or characters from Knots Landing to Dallas or vice versa since the 1985-86 season of each show (which, on Dallas, {{turned out to be a}} dream had by Pamela Ewing).|$|E

You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few <b>months</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>And</b> suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back.
