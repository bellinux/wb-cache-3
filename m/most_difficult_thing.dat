Jackman said, [...] "There’s no doubt that the most {{important}} relationship in his life is — we’ve seen through the movies — is his relationship with Jean Grey. Yes, we saw her die at the end of ‘X-Men: The Last Stand,’ but in this movie, she has a presence, which I think is vital to the movie, particularly for him confronting the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> within himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Friedrich Körner (36 victories) also {{recognised}} this as unique: [...] "Shooting {{in a curve}} (deflection shooting) is the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> a pilot can do. The enemy {{flies in}} a defensive circle, that means they are already lying in a curve and the attacking fighter has to fly into this defensive circle. By pulling his aircraft right around, his curve radius must be smaller, {{but if he does}} that, his target disappears in most cases below his wings. So he cannot see it anymore and has to proceed simply by instinct." ...|$|E
500|$|Carlos Baeza {{served as}} {{animation}} {{director for the}} episode. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening said animating horses is [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to do." [...] The animators used Eadweard Muybridge's famous [...] and other photo references as models for Princess. In the talent show scene, Lisa is lit up by a spotlight when she performs with her saxophone. After the episode {{came back from the}} animation studio in Korea, the staff noticed that the light was colored blue, making Lisa look like [...] "a Smurf." [...] The scene had to be re-animated in the United States, and the spotlight effect was reduced.|$|E

500|$|Director Rob Bowman {{was worried}} that the episode's monster would not appear [...] "scary" [...] and that the story would not be [...] "compelling". By {{utilizing}} unique camera angles and quick action Bowman {{was able to make}} the episode feel [...] "a hell of a lot better than [...] was afraid it might". The monster was created by special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich, a task he considered [...] "the single <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> [...] did all season". The tentacles were created out of a combination of silicone and urethane to make them translucent, but give them a flexible feel. The [...] "octopus bite marks" [...] numbered in the hundreds and required 90 minutes to apply. The episode's title, [...] "Agua Mala", means bad water in Spanish. [...] Aguamala is also the slang name for the Portuguese Man o' War, a venomous jellyfish similar in form to the episode's primary antagonist.|$|E
500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

60|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> {{to portray}} by written words is that {{peculiar}} mixture of moods {{expressed in a}} woman's countenance when, after having been sedulously engaged in establishing another's position, she suddenly suspects him of undermining her own. It was thus that Miss Aldclyffe looked at the steward.|$|R

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E
2500|$|Jon Dunham, the {{director}} of the film, was inspired to make a documentary about the marathon because of the impact running marathons had on his life. [...] He said that running a marathon was the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> he had done in his life, until he started to make a documentary about it. [...] Following storylines of runners training all over the world, and filming the subjects in the crowded Chicago Marathon are some of the challenges Dunham encountered when making the film.|$|E
2500|$|Keats {{wrote his}} last letter on 30 November 1820 to Charles Armitage Brown; [...] "Tis the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> {{in the world}} to me to write a letter. My stomach {{continues}} so bad, that I feel it worse on opening any book – yet I am much better than I was in Quarantine. Then I am afraid to encounter the proing and conning of any thing interesting to me in England. I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past, and that I am leading a posthumous existence".|$|E
50|$|Brian was {{a passionate}} {{advocate}} for {{the appointment of a}} Minister for Children, who he felt would be in an ideal position to encourage liaison and the combining of services to ensure the best care and protection for children.

50|$|I {{really wanted}} to write a {{political}} song, a song that reflected the way I felt about everything. It's one of the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> in the world to do without coming off as a total arse and preachy - all the things that I hate about a lot of songwriting. So I didn't want to overtly say it. I just wanted to allude to it.|$|R
5000|$|Nigel Williams has praised his interviews: [...] "Robert Crampton's work I really like. Somehow, he {{combines}} showmanship {{with something}} like self-effacement in a very entertaining way. To me he sounds like he's telling the truth, {{which is one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> to pull off in journalism. His opinions sound hard-won and thought through, and that's to do with his prose style, which puts me in mind of what Orwell said about good prose being like a window".|$|R
2500|$|On 17 November 2010 Green met American BJ Flores in Perth {{to defend}} his IBO cruiserweight world title. At the time, Flores {{did not have any}} world titles, however he was undefeated and {{formerly}} boxed as a heavyweight. Green said of his opponent [...] "The <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> about this is not his size, it's his speed coupled with his power and size; not only is he a big unit, he's a fast slick unit." [...] Green entered the ring at [...] which was the heaviest he had fought to that time, however Flores had an [...] reach advantage. Flores was described as a [...] "credible opponent", and the bout was seen as a means of answering Green's critics (arising from the Briggs fight).|$|E
2500|$|Rouvas' second film (the indie Duress) was a Hollywood {{psychological}} thriller {{in which}} he played a serial killer, against type for Greek audiences, and said the film was the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> he had done in his career until that point. Giannis Zoumboulakis of To Vima found Rouvas convincing in the film's cat-and-mouse plot: [...] "You accept the proposal from the first moments, forgetting completely that the 'bad' guy in the story {{is the host of}} X-Factor", concluding that [...] "Going against his own image, Rouvas creates a very exceptional psycho killer. With his gray-beige, old wool coat and grimy, parted hair and without his bright smile he creates from scratch a hero that is all his." [...] Panagiotis Timogiannakis contended that Rouvas began showing a different side of himself in Alter Ego, noting that the lighting in both films did not flatter him. Timogiannakis wondered if Rouvas had deglamourized himself to receive serious roles: [...] "He needs to clear up whether he wants to have a career of a star or of a role player. A born role player he does not seem to be. A born star he is." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{leader of}} the revolution. About the {{character}} of Curtis, Evans said, [...] "I mean, for me, the tail section is, I think that's Curtis. I think that's who he is. The tail section is hard; it's grinding; it's tough; it's real. So that's where I had the most fun. Back there." [...] Casting directors suggested Evans to Bong, who initially had misconceptions of Evans before they met due to the [...] "caricature of the American all muscle", but quickly departed from that notion and described Evans as [...] " [...] he's actually very sensitive and has a quiet and introverted side. He's a very, very smart person, and he's a director." [...] Bong {{was introduced to the}} films Puncture and Sunshine where he described Evans' performances as showing his [...] "sensitive acting abilities". Bong and Evans spent months talking about the dialogue, and Bong received help from the cast and crew including Evans due to it being his first English language film. Bong said that for the role of Curtis, hiding Evans' muscular physique was the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> about working with the actor. Explaining, [...] "He's supposed to be in the poor tail section for 17 years, eating only protein blocks, and it was tricky to hide all of that muscle mass with costume and make-up." [...] On whether he was surprised by the fan response, Evans said, [...] "I've been surprised about everything about this movie. Every movie you make, you hope people will enjoy it, but this movie has surpassed all of my expectations across the board." ...|$|E

40|$|The actual {{process of}} composing, and {{deciding}} {{how to go about}} it, {{can be one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>difﬁcult</b> <b>things</b> about using SuperCollider. People often ﬁnd it hard to make the jump from modifying simple examples to producing a full-scale piece. In contrast to Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software such as Pro Tools, for example, SC doesn’t present the user with a single “preferred” way of working. This can be confusing, but it’s an inevitable side effect of the ﬂexibility of SC, which allows for many different approaches to generating and assembling material...|$|R
5000|$|Spribille credits Goward {{with having}} [...] "a huge {{influence}} on my thinking. essays gave me license {{to think about}} lichens in unorthodox way and freed {{me to see the}} patterns I worked out in Bryoria with my co-authors." [...] Even so, [...] "one of the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> was allowing myself to have an open mind to the idea that 150 years of literature may have entirely missed the theoretical possibility that there would be more than one fungal partner in the lichen symbiosis." [...] Spribille says that academias emphasis on the canon of what others have established as important is inherently limiting.|$|R
