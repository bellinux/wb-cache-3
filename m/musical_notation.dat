5|$|Field {{released}} his debut album, Sub-Conscious, in 2006. It featured orchestral {{music from the}} Northwest Sinfonia. He created the album {{as a way to}} branch out from theatrical trailer composition into work as a solo artist. Field utilizes Logic Pro and MIDI for his musical composition; after this process he delivers these files along with an MP3 to the individual in charge of orchestration, who uses Finale software to convert this to <b>musical</b> <b>notation.</b> The album was made available on iTunes, CD Baby, Amazon.com, and for retail sale].|$|E
5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up the basics of <b>musical</b> <b>notation</b> from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening {{at the door of}} the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex chordal structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.|$|E

5|$|In 1882, Stainer {{was offered}} the post of Inspector of Music in Schools and Colleges, a {{position}} he took with great seriousness and which he occupied for six years. He worked towards raising standards in music teaching and toured the country, visiting schools and colleges and examining candidates. He advocated the use of <b>musical</b> <b>notation</b> and tonic sol-fa rather than the learning-by-ear method previously used. He was by now treated with the greatest respect in musical circles, but his many activities diminished the time available for composition. The flow of new anthems and service music slowed down, but in 1883 he completed his oratorio Mary Magdalen. This was followed in 1887 by The Crucifixion, the work {{for which he is}} most remembered.|$|E
5|$|Python {{has been}} {{successfully}} embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and <b>musical</b> <b>notation</b> programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as {{the best choice for}} writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go. Python is also used in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance. Python can also be implemented in APIs of online brokerages that run on other languages by using wrappers.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the earliest Western <b>musical</b> <b>notation,</b> in the form of neumes in campo aperto (without staff-lines), was created at Metz around 800, as a result of Charlemagne's desire for Frankish church musicians to retain the performance nuances used by the Roman singers.|$|E

25|$|Gregorian Chant, an {{outgrowth}} of Roman plain chant, strongly influenced both liturgical and secular music during the Middle Ages. An Italian monk, Guido of Arezzo (born in 991), developed the form of <b>musical</b> <b>notation</b> that became the basis of Western music and, subsequently, of music worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The first extant sources with <b>musical</b> <b>notation</b> {{were written}} around 930 (Graduale Laon). Before this, plainchant had been {{transmitted}} orally. Most scholars of Gregorian chant {{agree that the}} development of music notation assisted the dissemination of chant across Europe. The earlier notated manuscripts are primarily from Regensburg in Germany, St. Gall in Switzerland, Laon and St. Martial in France.|$|E
25|$|Slashes {{are used}} in <b>musical</b> <b>notation</b> as an {{alternative}} to writing out specific notes where it is easier to read than traditional notation or where the player can improvise.
