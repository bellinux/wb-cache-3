2500|$|In {{descriptive}} statistics, {{the mean}} may {{be confused with}} the median, mode or mid-range, as any of these may be called an [...] "average" [...] (more formally, a measure of central tendency). The mean of a set of observations is the arithmetic average of the values; however, for skewed distributions, the mean is not necessarily the same as the <b>middle</b> <b>value</b> (median), or the most likely value (mode). For example, mean income is typically skewed upwards by a small number of people with very large incomes, so that the majority have an income lower than the mean. By contrast, the median income is the level at which half the population is below and half is above. The mode income is the most likely income, and favors the larger number of people with lower incomes. While the median and mode are often more intuitive measures for such skewed data, many skewed distributions are in fact best described by their mean, including the exponential and Poisson distributions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Middle</b> class <b>values</b> {{have long}} been {{perceived}} as drivers of social cohesion and growth. In this paper we investigate the relation between class (measured by the position in the income distribution), values, and political orientations using comparable values surveys for six Latin American countries. We find that both a continuous measure of income and categorical measures of income-based class are robustly associated with values. Both income and class tend to display a similar association to values and political orientations as education, although differences persist in some important dimensions. Overall, we do not find strong evidence of any "middle class particularism": values appear to gradually shift with income, and <b>middle</b> class <b>values</b> lay between the ones of poorer and richer classes. If any, the only peculiarity of <b>middle</b> class <b>values</b> is moderation. We also find changes in values across countries to be of much larger magnitude than the ones dictated by income, education and individual characteristics, suggesting that individual values vary primarily within bounds dictated by each society. <b>middle</b> class, income, <b>values,</b> political orientations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract An urban {{health index}} (UHI) {{was used to}} {{quantify}} health inequalities within Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the years 2002 - 2010. Eight main health indicators were generated at the ward level using mortality data. The indicators were combined to form the index. The distribution of the rank ordered UHI-values provides information on inequality among wards, using {{the ratio of the}} extremes and the gradient of the <b>middle</b> <b>values.</b> Over the decade the ratio of extremes in 2010 declined relative to 2002 (1. 57 vs. 1. 32) as did the slope of the <b>middle</b> <b>values</b> (0. 23 vs. 0. 16). A spatial division between the affluent south and the deprived north and east is still visible. The UHI correlated on an ecological ward-level with socioeconomic and urban environment indicators like square meter price of apartments (0. 54, p < 0. 01), low education of mother (- 0. 61, p < 0. 01), low income (- 0. 62, p < 0. 01) and proportion of black ethnicity (- 0. 55, p < 0. 01).
