40|$|In {{a recent}} report, a robotic {{spacecraft}} mission is {{proposed for the}} purpose of collecting a small asteroid, or a small part of a large one, and transporting it to an orbit in the Earth-Moon system. Such an undertaking will require solutions to many of the engineering problems associated with deflection of an asteroid that poses a danger to Earth. In both cases, it may be necessary for a spacecraft to approach an asteroid from a nearby position, hover for some amount of time, move with the same <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> as the asteroid, descend, perhaps ascend, and finally arrest the <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> of the asteroid. Dynamics and control in each of these activities is analyzed {{in order to determine the}} velocity increments and control torque that must be provided by a reaction control system, and the mass of the propellant that will be consumed. Two attitude control algorithms are developed, one to deal with synchronizing the spacecraft <b>s</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> with that of the asteroid, and the other to arrest the asteroid <b>s</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity.</b> A novel approach is proposed for saving fuel in the latter case...|$|R

40|$|Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are {{electronic}} devices that return a craft 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> and translational accelerations. They {{are used in}} many industries, such as underwater and aviation robotics. There is a large variation in IMU cost, and when considering the dependability of different IMUs, generally their manufacturers provide completely different metrics to quantify their performance. Because of this, {{it is very difficult}} to decide which sensor has a more reasonable cost-to-performance ratio for any particular project. To solve this dilemma, research and experimentation at IOT began. First a specialized apparatus was created to mount all IMUs to the same rigid body. MATLAB 4 applications were then written to simultaneously record data from all of the IMUs, while they were experiencing motion. Unfortunately a series of issues continued to occur, and after many trials, it was decided that a solution other than these MATLAB applications had to be designed. The Data Logger application is data acquisition software written in Java and is designed to be as lightweight and robust as possible. This application was created as a solution to the issues experienced with the formerly mentioned MATLAB applications. Once Data Logger was finished, experimentation was much more simple and the testing could begin again. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare three {{different}} intervals for a between sets rest period during a common isokinetic knee extension strength-testing protocol of twenty older Brazilian men (66. 30 ± 3. 92 yrs). The volunteers underwent unilateral knee extension (Biodex System 3) testing to determine their individual isokinetic peak torque at 60, 90, and 120 °·s- 1. The contraction speeds and the rest periods between sets (30, 60 and 90 s) were randomly performed in three different days with a minimum rest period of 48 hours. Significant differences between and within sets were analyzed using a One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. Although, at <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> of 60 °·s- 1 produced a higher peak torque, there were no significant differences in peak torque among any of the rest periods. Likewise, there were no significant differences between mean peak torque among all resting periods (30, 60 and 90 <b>s)</b> at <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> of 90 and 120 °·s- 1.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} enhancing {{the performance of a}} four-phase switched reluctance motor by using capacitors to produce additional supply voltage during the rise and fall periods of a motor phase current. The voltage rating of the inverter components increases and extra capacitor/diode combinations are needed. The operation and analysis of a series voltage boost circuit are detailed for different modes of operation with a study of the effect of the boost capacitor voltage on the current waveform. Different voltage boost circuit configurations are compared. The predicted and measured results show that the boost circuit increases both torque and output power and, improves the efficiency of the machine, especially at high speeds.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present study was to {{quantify}} and compare selected kinematic variables and their timing during the tennis forehand of different skill levels. An eight-camera 400 Hz, Vicon motion analysis system recorded kinematic data of six ATP- professionals (elite) and seven high performance (HP) players when shots were played cross court and down the line. Timing of the maximum angles, linear and <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> was measured prior to and after impact. A total of twelve strokes per subject were analyzed from the beginning to the end of horizontal racquet movement. Significant differences (p < 0. 01) and large effect sizes were observed between elite and HP players in the timing of maximum pelvis (- 0. 075 ± 0. 008 vs. - 0. 093 ± 0. 012 <b>s)</b> and trunk <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> (- 0. 057 ± 0. 004 vs. - 0. 075 ± 0. 011 s) before impact. The elite group showed a tendency (p < 0. 05) towards higher peak horizontal shoulder (3. 0 ± 0. 4 vs. 2. 5 ± 0. 4 m·s- 1) and racquet velocities (33. 1 ± 2. 4 vs. 31. 1 ± 1. 9 m·s- 1) compared to the HP players. Depending on the situation (cross court vs. down the line), different peak hip, racquet and separation angles were found for both groups. Similar peak values were detected between groups for maximum <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> and displacement of key variables that had been selected for analysis. The findings of this study can be vital for successful player development, improved performance or injury prevention.
