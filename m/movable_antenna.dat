40|$|Abstract. The basic {{requirement}} for the BEPC beam position monitor is the measurement of the beam orbit with 0. 1 mm precision near the collision point. To improve the measurement accuracy, {{the response of the}} beam position monitor pickups was mapped in the laboratory before they were installed in the BEPC ring. The microcomputer-controlled test set consists of high frequency coaxial switches to select each pickup electrode, a <b>movable</b> <b>antenna</b> to simulate the beam, a signal source, a spectrum analyzer to measure the pickup signals, and analysis software. The signal source operates well below the- 3 dB cutoff frequency of the pickups (buttons). We believe that the low-frequency measurement yields the same information as the real beam. The button signals were clear. This calibration technique is satisfactory for BEPC operation...|$|E
40|$|The thermal-control {{philosophy}} of the spacecraft currently under development by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is design by passive means to maintain all components {{within the tolerances specified}} by cognizant engineers. Due to the complexity of the configurations, calculations are) of necessity, fairly generalized and final design is based upon tests in an environmental chamber. The Ranger series spacecraft is designed with a basic structure which is common to all models, with additional hardware to suit the individual mission. This basic structure of Rangers A- 1 and A- 2 is seen as the hexagonal instrument section, the erectable solar panels, the <b>movable</b> <b>antenna,</b> and the omniantenna. The Ranger A- 1 and A- 2 configuration is for engineering tests and space-exploration, with the scientific instrumentation isolation requirement dictating the spread-out design. The spacecraft stands 12 feet high, weighs 700 to 800 pounds, and has an internal power of 150 watts. Rangers A- 3, A- 4, and A- 5 are designed to rough land a capsule on the moon. For these, a capsule and retrorocket replace the scientific instruments, occupying the space inside the tower structure. The spacecraft must survive many environments. Chronologically they are: 1) Folded configuration inside an aerodynamic shroud on the pad. 2) Thermal flux from shroud aerodynamically heated during boost phase. 3) Coasting up to 30 minutes attached to Agena stage after booster and shroud are separated. 4) Agena stage burning. 5) Coasting and tumbling after separation from Agena until it passes from earth's shadow. 6) Upon reaching sunlight, panels open and begin sun acquisition. 7) Antenna seeks earth after spacecraft locks onto sun. 8) Space phase- "steady state" with vehicle's vertical axis locked on sun, communicating with earth. The philosophy is to design for the sun-acquired mode, making allowances for the transient conditions...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, modern {{communication}} means are nearly permanently available. However, {{in exceptional circumstances}} (e. g. disaster scenarios), {{this is not necessarily}} true. A successful operation of rescue forces depends substantially on sufficient communication capabilities via satellite. Fast <b>movable</b> <b>antennas</b> on vehicles may offer a good option. In the paper, a solution for satellite tracking of antennas on vehicles for mobile satellite communication is introduced. Two different systems are considered, which are selectively suitable for different driving modes (vehicle's standstill, driving along a road, driving off-road). Three modes of operation (initialization, open loop, closed loop) and appropriate controller structures are introduced. The controllers' concrete layout depends on the input quantities (measurement, estimation) available at the relevant mode of operation. Selected simulation results are given...|$|R

40|$|The {{stellarator}} Wendelstein 7 -X {{is being}} built in Greifswald, Germany, by the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Plasmaphysik. Initially, the heating system will consist of 10 MW ECRH and 4 MW ICRF heating (both cw) and 5 MW NBI (for 15 s every 3 min). ECRH is the principal heating method at a magnetic field of B= 2. 5 T. At other magnetic fields or densities higher than the ECRH cutoff, ICRF heating will sustain the plasmas. The ICRF system is planned to consist of two radially <b>movable</b> <b>antennas</b> powered by two generators with an output power of 2 MW each. The antenna plasma load will be matched in real time to the generator impedance using ferrite loaded transmission line elements. In addition, 3 dB couplers will passively protect the generators from RF power reflections during rapid changes of the antenna plasma load that are too fast for the ferrite matching system...|$|R

40|$|The nominal design {{gradient}} in {{the main}} linacs of the International Linear Collider (ILC) is 31. 5 MV/m for a beam current of 9. 0 mA. However, the superconducting cavities built to date have demonstrated a range in sustainable gradient extending well below this goal, being limited by Q drop-off and quenching. Thus, an economically feasible cavity acceptance rate will include {{a certain percentage of}} sub-performing cavities. An important question {{that needs to be addressed}} is, For a string of cavities rated to various levels of gradient and powered from a common source how can we optimize the overall gradient? Along with adjustable cavity coupling [...] or loaded Q factor [...] we assume adjustable RF power so that gradient can be leveled in nonnominal cavities, to avoid quench-inducing overshoots. In the ILC an RF unit comprises three cryomodules containing a total of 26 nine-cell cavities, which are fed by one klystron that nominally feeds equal power to all cavities. One simple way of running such a unit is to set RF power, beam arrival time, and all loaded Q's so that the power is matched and the gradient in all cavities equals the gradient limit in the poorest performing cavity. This conservative strategy, however, sacrifices gradient and can be improved upon. One improvement strategy is to adjust the cavity couplings individually (possible, since circulators are assumed in the baseline ILC design) or in pairs (when circulators are not needed) using the <b>movable</b> <b>antennae</b> of the fundamental mode couplers. Another strategy is to use variable power tap-offs (VTO's) [1] by which the RF power to succeeding pairs of cavities can be made to differ. These solutions will not be matched, resulting in power inefficiency and a gradient variation along the beam that needs to be limited. In this report we study the effect on overall gradient for various combinations of these ideas. Deciding which strategy is best can then be done by balancing gradient with the cost and complexity of hardware such as circulators and variable power tap-offs...|$|R

40|$|Using 10 {{monopole}} antennas {{reaching into}} a rectangular multi mode waveguide we shape the incident wave to create specific transport even after scattering events. Each antenna {{is attached to}} an IQ-Modulator, which allows the adjustment of the amplitude and phase in a broad band range of 6 - 18 GHz. All of them are placed in the near field of the other, thus the excitation of an individual antenna {{is influenced by the}} presence of the other antennas. Still these 10 antennas are sufficient to generate any combination of the 10 propagating modes in the far field. At the output the propagating modes are extracted using a <b>movable</b> monopole <b>antenna</b> that is scanning the field.

Furthermore, the influence of the Rx horn antenna used for scan-ning the signal is investigated and a calibration method is presented for adequate compensation...|$|R
50|$|In {{the life}} of an insect the pupal stage follows the larval stage and precedes {{adulthood}} (imago). It is during the time of pupation that the adult structures of the insect are formed while the larval structures are broken down. The adult structures, imaginal discs, then grow to become the adult structures. Pupae are inactive, and usually sessile (not able to move about). However, the pupae may be exarate (have <b>movable</b> legs, wings, <b>antennae,</b> etc.) or obtect (covered in a hard case with the legs and wings attached immovably against the body). They have a hard protective coating and often use camouflage to evade potential predators.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a 3 D {{microwave}} imaging method is developed for a {{microwave imaging}} system with an arbitrary background medium. In the previous {{study on the}} breast cancer detection of our research group, a full wave inverse method, the Diagonal Tensor approximation combined with Born Iterative Method (DTA-BIM), was proposed to reconstruct the electrical profile of the inversion domain in a homogenous background medium and a layered background medium. In order to evaluate {{the performance of the}} DTA-BIM method in a realistic microwave imaging system, an experimental prototype of an active 3 D microwave imaging system with <b>movable</b> <b>antennas</b> is constructed. For the objects immersed in a homogenous background medium or a layered background medium, the inversion results based on the experimental data show that the resolution of the DTA-BIM method can reach finely to a quarter of wavelength of the background medium, and the system's signal-noise-ratio (SNR) requirement is 10 dB. Moreover, the defects of this system make it difficult to be implemented in a realistic application. Thus, another active 3 D microwave imaging system is proposed to overcome the problems in the previous system. The new system employs a fix patch antenna array with electric switch to record the data. However, the antenna array makes the inversion system become a non-canonical inhomogeneous background. The analytical Greens' functions used in the original DTA-BIM method become unavailable. Thus, a modified DTA-BIM method, which use the numerical Green's functions combined with measured voltage, is proposed. This modified DTA-BIM method can be used to the inversion in a non-canonical inhomogeneous background with the measured voltages (or $S_{ 21 }$ parameters). In order to verify the performance of this proposed inversion method, we investigate a prototype 3 D microwave imaging system with a fix antenna array. The inversion results from the synthetic data show that this method works well with a fix antenna array, and the resolution of reconstructed images can reach to a quarter wavelength even {{in the presence of a}} strongly inhomogeneous background medium and antenna couplings. A time-reversal method is introduced as a pre-processing step to reduce the region of interest (ROI) in our inversion. In addition, a Multi-Domain DTA-BIM method is proposed to fit the discontinue inversion regions. With these improvements, the size of the inversion domain and the computational cost can be significantly reduced, and make the DTA-BIM method more feasible for rapid response applications.

40|$|Wireless channel {{data was}} {{collected}} in Cambridge, Massachusetts for diverse propagation environments over distances ranging from tens of meters to several kilometers using mobile 2. 4 -GHz transmitters and receivers. The 20 -MHz bandwidth signals from eight individually <b>movable</b> van-top <b>antennas</b> were Nyquist sampled simultaneously with 12 -bit accuracy. Although path-loss variance for any given link length within single residential/urban neighborhoods was large, single streets typically exhibited path-loss, L(dB) =- 10 log 10 (Pr/Pt) ?? 10 ?? log 10 r + C, where P is the received or transmitted power, r the link-length, ?? the street-dependent path-loss coefficient, and C the loss incurred at street intersections. Measurements yielded ?? ?? 1. 5 + 3. 2 ?? ?? 0. 27 for 2 < ?? < 5; ?? is the fraction of the street length having a building gap on either side. Experiments over links as short as 100 meters indicate a 10 -dB advantage in estimating path loss for this model compared to optimal linear estimators based on link length alone. Measured air-to-ground links were well modeled by ?? = 2 for the elevated LOS path, and by stochastic log-normal attenuation for the ground-level scattering environment. These models permit path-loss predictions based on readily accessible environmental parameters, and lead to efficient nodal placement strategies for full urban coverage.

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the keyhole {{problems}} associated with present antenna mounting systems and to meet the requirements of acquisition and tracking for high gain and narrow beamwidth antennas, a novel antenna mount system is developed. The antenna is mounted on a microprocessor controlled robotic platform with six degrees of freedom. The mechanism is based on the principles of Stewart platform, which employes six variable length actuators constrained between a fixed base and a <b>movable</b> platform. This <b>antenna</b> mount is especially suitable for high gain antennas using high frequency band widths for marine satellite communications. The kinematics and geometry of the parallel link mechanism has been studied in detail. The kinematic analysis for the parallel manipulator consists of developing a set of kinematic equations for the six linear actuators in terms of the "world coordinates" (–§,Œ∏,Œ±,x,y,z). These kinematic equations are then solved for the "machine coordinates'" (L 1,L 2,L 3,L 4,L 5,L 6), which are the six actuator lengths. A computer simulation has been done to model the motion of the platform. The simulation has simplified the task of examining various mechanism configurations, the range of motion and the mechanism mechanical constraints. A six motor controller board based on the motion controller microprocessors has been developed. Limited unipolar pulse width modulated servo drives are used to drive the permanent magnet DC motors of the linear actuators. A desktop computer is used as the host processor to generate the command data. The motion control microprocessors generate the velocity and acceleration profiles and drive the six axes simultaneously. The main control programme residing in the host processor schedules the overall operation. The orbital satellite bearings are calculated on a minicomputer and downloaded to the control desktop computer. A prototype antenna mount based on the descriptions above was designed, constructed and tested for tracking a high pass and low pass of an orbiting weather satellite, (the NOAA- 7). A microwave antenna mounted on the platform was found to be capable of tracking an orbital satellite throughout the visible hemisphere, although the reception tracking has not been inplemented. This antenna mount offers a light weight, structurally strong and fast dynamic response tracking system for land and marine applications. This parallel robotic mechanism has potential for further applications such as a prepackaged portable communications system which can be deployed rapidly at remote construction sites or during civil defence emergencies. In addition it may be employed as a stabilized platform which can be used for marine VTOL aircraft recovery during rough weather. The application of this antenna mount in a low cost marine satellite communications system is emphasized since the fast dynamic response of the system will eliminate the need for an expensive stabilized platform...|$|R
