Unlike paramagnetic host material, magnetic susceptibility measurements of intercalated nanodiamond revealed distinct ferromagnetic behavior at 5 K. This is essentially different from results of potassium intercalation in graphite or C60 fullerene, and shows that sp3 bonding promotes <b>magnetic</b> <b>ordering</b> in carbon. The measurements presented first experimental evidence of intercalation-induced spin-glass state in a nanocrystalline diamond system.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{presence}} of valence 5f electrons, neptunium and its alloys exhibit very interesting magnetic behavior, like many other actinides. These can range from the itinerant band-like character characteristic of the transition metals to the local moment behavior typical of scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides. This stems from 5f-orbital hybridization with the orbitals of the metal ligands, {{and the fact that the}} 5f orbital is relativistically destabilized and extends outwards. For example, pure neptunium is paramagnetic, NpAl3 is ferromagnetic, NpGe3 has no <b>magnetic</b> <b>ordering,</b> and NpSn3 behaves fermionically. Investigations are underway regarding alloys of neptunium with uranium, americium, plutonium, zirconium, and iron, so as to recycle long-lived waste isotopes such as neptunium-237 into shorter-lived isotopes more useful as nuclear fuel.|$|E

40|$|In {{this letter}} we study the Haldane model with on-site repulsive {{interactions}} at half-filling. We {{show that the}} mean-field Hamiltonian with <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> effectively modifies parameters in the Haldane Hamiltonian, such as sublattice energy difference and phase in next nearest hopping. As interaction increases, increasing of <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> corresponds to varying these parameters and consequently, drives topological transitions. At the mean-field level, one scenario is that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> continuously increases, and inevitably, the fermion gap closes at the topological transition point with nonzero <b>magnetic</b> <b>order.</b> Beyond the mean-field, interaction between fermions mediated by spin-wave fluctuations can further open up the gap, rendering a first-order transition. Another scenario is a first-order transition at mean-field level across which a canted <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> develops discontinuously, avoiding the fermion gap closing. We find that both scenarios exist in the phase diagram of the Haldane-Hubbard model. Our predication is relevant to recent experimental realization of the Haldane model in cold atom system.

Zn substitution induces static <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> at low temperatures and triggers a large-scale spectral-weight redistribution from the magnetic resonant mode at 38 meV into uniaxial, incommensurate spin excitations with energies well below the spin-pseudogap. These observations indicate a competition between incommensurate <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> and superconductivity close to a quantum critical point. Comparison to prior data on La$_{ 2 -x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{ 4 }$ suggests that this behavior is universal for the layered copper oxides and analogous to impurity-induced <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> in one-dimensional quantum magnets...|$|R

500|$|As {{molten iron}} cools past its {{freezing}} point of 1538°C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, {{which has a}} body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure. As it cools further to 1394°C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, or austenite. At 912°C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope, or ferrite. Finally, at 770°C (the Curie point, Tc) iron's <b>magnetic</b> <b>ordering</b> changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, {{but there is a}} change in [...] "domain structure", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation; however, the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about 10micrometres across. This happens because the two unpaired electrons on each iron atom are in the dz2 and dx2 − y2 orbitals, which do not point directly at the nearest neighbors in the body-centered cubic lattice and therefore do not participate in metallic bonding; thus, they can interact magnetically with each other so that their spins align.|$|E

40|$|The {{coupling}} between <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> and ferroelectricity {{has been}} under intense investigation {{in a wide range}} of transition metal oxides. The strongest coupling is obtained in so-called magnetically induced multiferroics where ferroelectricity arises directly from <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> that breaks inversion symmetry. However, it has been difficult to find non-oxide based materials in which these effects occur. Here we present a study of copper dimethyl sulfoxide dichloride (CDC), an organometallic quantum magnet containing S = 1 / 1 Cu spins, in which a switchable electric polarization arises from field-tuned <b>magnetic</b> <b>order.</b> Fast <b>magnetic</b> field pulses allow us to perform sensitive measurements of the electric polarization and demonstrate that the electric state is present only if the <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> is non-collinear. Furthermore, we show that the electric polarization can be switched in a stunning hysteretic fashion. Because the <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> in CDC is mediated by large organic molecules, our study shows that magnetoelectric interactions can exist in this important class of materials, opening the road to designing magnetoelectrics and multiferroics using large molecules as building blocks. Further, we demonstrate that CDC undergoes a magnetoelectric quantum phase transition -the first of its kind, where both ferroelectric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>order</b> emerge simultaneously as a function of magnetic field at very low temperatures...|$|R
