The group also played at the Sounds of the Underground festival along with Amon Amarth, Chimaira, Gwar, and Shadows Fall. In October, Job for a Cowboy co-headlined the 2007 Radio Rebellion Tour, teaming up with Behemoth, Gojira, and Beneath the Massacre. The band featured on the 2008 Gigantour with headliners Megadeth, Children of Bodom, In Flames, and High on Fire. In addition, they confirmed {{for a number of}} festivals during 2008, including Wacken Open Air in Germany and a second appearance at England's Download Festival. Job for a Cowboy embarked on a U.S. headlining tour in November and December 2008 with supporting acts Hate Eternal and All Shall Perish. In late 2008, guitarist Ravi Bhadriraju left Job for a Cowboy to return to school because he wanted to pursue a <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> career in the medical field. He was replaced with former Despised Icon guitarist Al Glassman.|$|E
5|$|Koji Sugimoto, main {{programmer}} for characters, {{said that}} {{the complexities of the}} PlayStation 2 hardware made mastering it difficult, but <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> because the details on Yuna's sleeves to the depiction of shine and shadow could be rendered more realistically. Final Fantasy X was the first game that allowed for 3-D model rendering of backgrounds that increased the presentation, including small details like grass blowing in the wind and cloud movement. Takayoshi Nakazato decided to abandon the typical world map concept for a more realistic depiction. Final Fantasy Xs spatial presentation of Spira is tied to progression; with a player's progress being marked through the panoramic introduction and depiction of the area upon first entry. Chiharu Minekawa, the supervising sound editor, commented that the transition in sound from one environment to the next was done seamlessly in order to mimic the natural surroundings of these environments as the player moved through them.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Orsini was the Prince of Taranto and Ferdinand's fiercest rival. He had been, however, Alfonso's {{faithful}} {{ally and}} had developed an admiration for Skanderbeg and his campaigns in Albania. After Skanderbeg had sided with his rival, Orsini {{allied with the}} Angevins and refused to recognize Ferdinand as King of Naples. He then {{sent a letter to}} convince Skanderbeg to pull his men out of Italy arguing that Ferdinand's fortunes were hopeless, that Skanderbeg's fame would die out after his supposed debacle, and that an alliance with René would be much <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> than an alliance with Ferdinand. Skanderbeg's letter in response, dated to 10 October 1460, stated that he was not a condottieri looking for fortune, but a mature man looking to help his ally. Furthermore, he sent another letter to Ferdinand assuring him his loyalty. Another letter was sent to Pius assuring him that the Albanians were fit for battle in Italy, something the Italian rulers did not believe. The letters elucidate Skanderbeg's political motives behind his Italian expedition, presenting himself as a noble ally, and also illustrate the influence of the Renaissance in Skanderbeg's court. They also served a psychological purpose to intimidate Ferdinand's rivals: Skanderbeg compared himself to Pyrrhus of Epirus of antiquity who marched into Italy to defend the Greek city-states from Roman expansion.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, the BUA {{group of}} {{companies}} underwent a major reorganisation to improve its financial performance. This included adoption of a new strategy for BUA that aimed to replace the dwindling number of unprofitable trooping flights with growing engagement in the <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> European inclusive tour (IT) and transatlantic affinity group charter markets. It also resulted in relocation of the head office and concentration of engineering activities at Gatwick. Successful implementation of these organisational and strategic changes enabled BUA to make the loss-making South American routes profitable by late-1968 and to become the UK's only profitable mainline scheduled domestic operator by 1969.|$|E

The 'Crowd' ad emphasizes that things designed to draw a crowd are good, but leaving the crowd behind is <b>more</b> <b>rewarding.</b> The 'Color Shift' ad shows it's more fun and exciting to blend out than blend in. The Two additional ads (This is Your Move, Intense) were created by Lexus' multicultural agency, Walton Isaacson, {{as part of the}} campaign. 'This is Your Move' was geared to the African-American audience, features Los Angeles Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp as he searches for something that matches his ambitious and driven personality. 'Intense' is targeted to the Hispanic audience and follows a young couple as they experience the thrills of driving the redesigned IS 250.|$|E
500|$|According to Charles Isherwood of The New York Times, {{not only}} are the {{character}} names derived from Chekhov, but also [...] "The country-house setting is also borrowed from the work of that Russian master, as are the self-delusions and self-pity that plague the central characters, all of whom have reached the difficult age when life’s path has narrowed uncomfortably, and there is little point in turning around and looking to take another, <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> course." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1930, {{with his}} {{impending}} marriage in mind, Olivier earned some extra money with small roles in two films. In April he travelled to Berlin to film the English-language version of The Temporary Widow, a crime comedy with Lilian Harvey, and in May he spent four nights working on another comedy, Too Many Crooks. During {{work on the}} latter film, {{for which he was}} paid £60, he met Laurence Evans, who became his personal manager.

500|$|In July 2015, Greg Berlanti, {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer on both series, said: We've just been breaking into it {{over the last week}} or so actually ... so we're, really, excited about it. We've got a great story lined up for towards the end of the fall, early winter. This year our real hope is to make a crossover that's even bigger, and even <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> for the audience than the last years. The scripts for the [...] "Heroes Join Forces" [...] crossover were written in September 2015. Berlanti created the story for the event, and Kreisberg and Guggenheim helped to craft the story of The Flash and Arrow episodes, respectively. The teleplay for The Flash was written by showrunners Aaron and Todd Helbing; Arrows was written by Brian Ford Sullivan and Guggenheim.|$|E
500|$|Her second children's book is {{the story}} of a pit bull, named after Peters' dog Stella. The {{character}} would rather be a pig ballerina, but she learns to accept herself. Titled Stella is a Star, the book includes a CD with an original song written and performed by Peters and was released in April 2010 by Blue Apple Books. [...] According to Publishers Weekly, [...] "Turning the pages to Peters' spirited narration, which is provided in an accompanying CD, makes for a <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> reading experience. The story and disc end with a sneakily affecting self-esteem anthem, which, like the familiar tale itself, is buoyed by the author's lovely vocals."

[...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end of}} Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was just too much fun.

500|$|During {{the period}} Busoni {{undertook}} teaching at [...] masterclasses at Weimar, Vienna and Basel. In 1900 {{he was invited}} by Duke Karl-Alexander of Weimar to lead a masterclass for fifteen young virtuosi. This concept was more amenable to Busoni than teaching formally in a Conservatory: the twice-weekly seminars were successful and were repeated in the following year. Pupils included Maud Allan, who later became famous as a dancer and remained a friend. His experience in Vienna in 1907 was less satisfactory, although amongst his <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> pupils were Ignaz Friedman, Leo Sirota, Louis Gruenberg, Józef Turczyński and Louis Closson; the latter four were dedicatees of pieces in Busoni's 1909 piano album An die Jugend. But arguments with the Directorate of the Vienna Conservatoire, under whose auspices the classes were held, soured the atmosphere. In the autumn of 1910 Busoni gave masterclasses and also carried {{out a series of}} recitals [...] in Basel.|$|E
500|$|The {{giant otter}} is an apex predator, and its {{population}} status reflects the overall health of riverine ecosystems. It feeds mainly on fish, including cichlids, characins (such as piranha), and catfish. One full-year study of giant otter scats in Amazonian Brazil found fish {{present in all}} fecal samples. Fish from the order Perciformes, particularly cichlids, were seen in 97% of scats, and Characiformes, such as characins, in 86%. Fish remains were of medium-sized species that seem to prefer relatively shallow water, {{to the advantage of}} the probably visually oriented giant otter. Prey species found were also sedentary, generally swimming only short distances, which may aid the giant otter in predation. Hunting in shallow water has also been found to be <b>more</b> <b>rewarding,</b> with water depth less than [...] having the highest success rate. The giant otter seems to be opportunistic, taking whatever species are most locally abundant. If fish are unavailable, it will also take crabs, snakes, and even small caimans and anacondas.|$|E
500|$|All {{characters}} {{are designed to}} speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world. The Atlantic pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters {{on both sides of}} the Lannister–Stark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices. Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the Ice and Fire {{characters are}} vulnerable so that, according to The Atlantic, the reader [...] "cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances where it does all the more exulting." [...] Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters' lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write. Seeing the world through the characters' eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains, all of whom he has said he loves as if they were his own children. Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> for him.|$|E

[...] He {{explained}} that each Marvel project is intended to stand alone first before there is any interweaving, and noted that the series has to work with the film division and be aware of their plans so as not to interfere when introducing someone or something to the universe. Bell elaborated that this was preferable so that people who do not watch the films can still follow the series, and vice versa. He stated that [...] "ABC and Marvel both want the series {{to be able to make}} sense on its own", but that it was beneficial for the films to have the series fill in any [...] "gaps" [...] for them, due to having to be [...] "big" [...] and moving [...] "quickly through a lot of huge pieces", unlike television which has time to deal with more nuances.|$|E
500|$|Vlambeer {{developed}} Radical Fishing, an Adobe Flash-based {{game where}} a fisherman {{sits in a}} boat and casts his line into the water, pulls up fish into the air, and shoots them with a gun. It was built to take [...] "everything good" [...] from habit-forming browser games without artificially extending its length just to hook players. The game was designed with a feedback loop, where performance in one minigame led to a <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> experience in the next minigame. Vlambeer designer Jan Willem ("JW") Nijman developed the idea based on a television show about tuna fishermen {{that led him to}} consider an intersection between catching big fish, slow-motion photography, and Duck Hunts game mechanics. Nijman immediately drafted the design, which never changed. The company sold the Flash game to a browser games website in 2010 but kept the rights to produce an iOS version, which they would call Ridiculous Fishing. They began production on the iOS version on December 7, 2010, with the intention of a [...] "2012/2013 equivalent" [...] of the original.|$|E
500|$|According to The Globe and Mail John Barber, Martin manages {{simultaneously}} to master and transcend the genre so that [...] "Critics applaud {{the depth of}} his characterizations and lack of cliché in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons". Publishers Weekly gave favorable reviews to the first three Ice and Fire novels at their points of release, saying that A Game of Thrones had [...] "superbly developed characters, accomplished prose and sheer bloody-mindedness", that A Clash of Kings was [...] "notable particularly for the lived-in quality of [...] for the comparatively modest role of magic", and that A Storm of Swords was one [...] "of the <b>more</b> <b>rewarding</b> examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy". However, they found that A Feast For Crows as the fourth installment [...] "sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying."
