50|$|In {{competitive}} table tennis, effective {{command of}} topspin is indispensable, {{not only in}} order to be able to execute an attack shot counter to a backspin ball, but also {{in order to be}} able to execute a speed shot when the ball is already lower than the net. In table tennis the best defense for a top spin loop is a block close to the table which involves a firm fixation of the paddle and a slight <b>movement</b> <b>forwards</b> with an angle less than 90 degrees. Another way of defending the topspin is to counterattack with a topspin or slice the ball.|$|E
5000|$|The alliterative phrase rocking {{and rolling}} was {{originally}} used by s {{at least as}} early as the 17th century, to describe the combined rocking ( [...] and [...] ) and rolling (side to side) motion of a ship on the ocean.

[...] As the term referred to <b>movement</b> <b>forwards,</b> backwards and from side to side, it acquired sexual connotations from early on; the sea shanty [...] "Johnny Bowker" [...] (or [...] "Boker"), probably from the early nineteenth century, contains the lines [...] "Oh do, my Johnny Bowker/ Come rock and roll me over".|$|E

40|$|Study design: Keeping {{physically}} active {{is important for}} people who mobilize using a wheelchair. However, current tools to measure physical activity in the wheelchair are either not validated or limited in their application. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop and validate a monitoring system to measure wheelchair movement. Methods: The system developed consisted of a tri-axial accelerometer placed on the wheel of a wheelchair and an analysis algorithm to interpret the acceleration signals. The two accelerometer outputs in the plane of the wheel were used to calculate the angle of the wheel. From this, outcome measures of wheel revolutions, absolute angle and duration of movement were derived and the direction of <b>movement</b> (<b>forwards</b> or backwards) could be distinguished. Concurrent validity was assessed in comparison with video analysis in 14 people with spinal cord injury using their wheelchair on an indoor track and outdoor wheelchair skills course. Validity was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC(2, 1)) and Bland–Altman plots. Results: The monitoring system demonstrated excellent validity for wheel revolutions, absolute angle and duration of movement (ICC(2, 1) &# 62; 0. 999, 0. 999, 0. 981, respectively) in both manual and powered wheelchairs, when the wheelchair was propelled forwards and backwards, and for movements of various durations. Conclusion: This study has found this monitoring system to be an accurate and objective tool for measuring detailed information on wheelchair movement and manoeuvring regardless of the propulsion technique, direction and speed...|$|E

40|$|We've seen a {{whole range}} of {{legislation}} to support the equality of LGBT people going through Parliament {{over the past few years}} - Civil Partnerships, Gender Recognition, legislation supporting the right of same-sex couples to adopt and so on. Those of us who are (sadly) old enough to remember the horrors of the Tory section 28 drew an anxious breath when the ConDem Alliance got in, but when it comes to supporting the rights of lesbians and gay men, they have come out quite well. What does this strange new world mean? It's great, of course that we have got citizenship rights, but when we look a little more closely, we see that some LGBT people are indeed more equal than others. Sometimes the inequalities are to do with other sorts of inequalities, including global ones - for example if you are a LGBT person living in a repressive regime, trying to get asylum here, its not going to be a walk in the park - especially if you are bisexual, and therefore unrecognised as facing persecution by the Home Office. Sometimes there are 'in-house' inequalities, those of lookism, agism, racism, hatred of bisexuals or gender-diverse people, oh and even sexism amongst certain sections of the gay community. We need to be vigilent to understand when we are privileged citizens, now and not imagine that the battle has been won. This often happens when social movements are (partly) successful - everyone parties endlessly or settles down with their cats, and forgets about the people who don't feel safe, happy and able to be themselves. The equalities territory has shifted, and we are into a new chapter now, where those of us who feel solid in our citizenship rights need to help push the <b>movement</b> <b>forwards</b> for the others who are still marginalised and excluded...|$|E
