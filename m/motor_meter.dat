50|$|In 1885 Ferranti {{offered a}} mercury <b>motor</b> <b>meter</b> with a {{register}} similar to gas meters; this {{had the advantage}} that the consumer could easily read the meter and verify consumption.The first accurate, recording electricity consumption meter was a DC meter by Dr Hermann Aron, who patented it in 1883. Hugo Hirst of the British General Electric Company introduced it commercially into Great Britain from 1888. Unlike their AC counterparts, DC meters did not measure energy. Instead they measured charge in ampere-hours. Since the voltage of the supply should remain substantially constant, {{the reading of the}} meter was proportional to actual energy consumed. For example: if a meter recorded that 100 ampere-hours had been consumed on a 200-volt supply, then 20 kilowatt-hours of energy had been supplied. Aron's meter recorded the total charge used over time, and showed it on a series of clock dials.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{one particular}} {{issue that the}} authors came across when developing a DC <b>Motor</b> Duty <b>Meter</b> - a comprehensive condition monitoring tool for large DC motors based on flux density measurement inside the motor air gap. This particular issue crucial for the project was how to calibrate, with high accuracy, {{a large number of}} flux density sensors to be used to measure the flux density distribution along the surface of the motor poles. From available literature and IEEE standards, the recommended and most common way to generate a calibration magnetic field is based on Helmholtz coil principle, which in practice is limited to small flux density magnitudes. A method used by the authors and described in this paper utilizes a step test and simple calculations based on Faraday's Law. The novelty of the described method is in particularities of the system, measurements and calculations, which make the method highly immune to typical sources of errors. The method can be used to produce a very accurate and uniform magnetic field with densities ranging from fractions of Tesla to above one Tesla to calibrate flux sensors in this flux range. Its accuracy is only limited by that of a current source, a current probe and a digital oscilloscope. Uniformity of the generated field is discussed and experimentally confirmed. Experimental results obtained within the DC <b>Motor</b> Duty <b>Meter</b> project are included to illustrate correctness of the sensor calibration. Conditions that guarantee the maximum efficiency of the method are discussed. The paper is concluded by a step by step calibration procedure that other researchers may find useful...|$|R

50|$|A modern digital {{electronic}} wattmeter/energy meter samples {{the voltage}} and current thousands of times a second. For each sample, the voltage is multiplied by the current at the same instant; the average over at least one cycle is the real power. The real power divided by the apparent volt-amperes (VA) is the power factor. A computer circuit uses the sampled values to calculate RMS voltage, RMS current, VA, power (watts), power factor, and kilowatt-hours. The readings may be displayed on the device, retained to provide a log and calculate averages, or transmitted to other equipment for further use. Wattmeters vary considerably in correctly calculating energy consumption, especially when real power is much lower than VA (highly reactive loads, e.g. electric <b>motors).</b> Simple <b>meters</b> may be calibrated to meet specified accuracy only for sinusoidal waveforms. Waveforms for switched-mode power supplies as used for much electronic equipment may be very far from sinusoidal, leading to unknown and possibly large errors at any power. This may not be specified in the meter's manual.|$|R

40|$|Challenges {{presented}} by the minerals boom can be addressed by improved utilisation of mining equipment and automated mining systems development. For both objectives, {{it is important to}} have condition monitoring systems in place to provide real-time information about the equipment condition and prevent it from a catastrophic failure.

50|$|Distinct {{skeletal}} {{muscles are}} controlled by groups of individual motor units. Such motor units {{are made up of}} a single motor neuron and the muscle fibers that it innervates. Motor neurons are located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and the brainstem. These neurons innervate skeletal muscle fibers through the propagation of action potentials down their axons (through ventral roots and cranial nerves), and they stimulate skeletal muscle fibers at neuromuscular junctions where they synapse with the motor end plates of muscle fibers. In humans, these axons can be as long as one <b>meter.</b> <b>Motor</b> neurons themselves fall into three main classes: alpha-motor neurons control extrafusal muscle fibers, meaning that they innervate skeletal muscles leading to movement; gamma-motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers, controlling the sensitivity of muscle spindles to stretch; beta-motor neurons are capable of synapsing on either type of muscle fiber. Alpha-motor neurons can further be divided into three separate subclasses, distinguished according to the contractile properties of the motor units that they form: fast-twitch fatigable (FF), fast-twitch fatigue-resistant (FR), and slow-twitch fatigue-resistant (S). The composition of a motor pool may consist of multiple classes and subclasses of motor neurons.|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} {{estimating}} grain storage and monitoring in granary {{had been developed}} in this study. The system consists of a lifting mechanism and a measurement platform.

The laser beam of laser meter is projected consecutively {{on the surface of}} the grain storage to obtain the distance for each point. A data cloud with spatial coordinates of points {{on the surface of the}} grain storage can be constructed. The volume of the grain storage can be further estimated. To verify the function of the system, the system had estimated the volume of some piled cardboard boxes with known volumes. The average relative error of the measurements was 2. 5 % when the increment of rotation of laser beam is 2 �. We also tested the system at a granary of one local agricultural association. The difference between the estimated volumes by using our system and the data from the agricultural association were among 1. 6 % to- 7. 6 % for processed grain storage. 本研究開發一套穀倉穀堆儲量估算與監測系統，系統由爬升機構與量測平台所組成。系統可以爬升至 7. 0 m高度，以便俯視穀倉內穀堆的頂部。量測平台上裝設有由兩組微步進馬達組成之旋轉台、雷射測距儀、紅外線照射器、以及CCD攝影機。雷射測距儀的雷射光束連續投射在穀堆表面，並取得該點距離。經密集打點後，可以建立穀堆表面的點雲資料，進一步估算穀堆的體積。為驗證本系統的功能，先利用多個已知體積之紙箱，整齊堆疊後，利用系統量測與估算體積；在旋轉台掃描角度變量為 2 °時，所估算的體積之平均相對誤差值為 2. 5 %。進一步實際估算穀倉內穀堆在不同時期之加工體積，所估算結果與農會實際加工之體積相差率分布在 1. 6 %至- 7. 6 %之間...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} physical training combined with growth hormone (GH) on muscle thickness and its relationship with muscle strength and motor development in infants with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 22 infants with PWS (12. 9 +/- 7. 1 months) were followed over 2 years to compare a treatment group (n = 10) with a waiting-list control group (n = 12). Muscle thickness of 4 muscle groups was measured by using ultrasound. Muscle strength was evaluated by using the Infant Muscle Strength <b>meter.</b> <b>Motor</b> performance was measured with the Gross Motor Function Measurement. Analyses of variance were used to evaluate between-group effects of GH on muscle thickness at 6 months and to compare pre- and posttreatment (after 12 months of GH) values. Multilevel analyses were used to evaluate effects of GH on muscle thickness over time, and multilevel bivariate analyses were used to test relationships between muscle thickness, muscle strength, and motor performance. RESULTS: A significant positive effect of GH on muscle thickness (P <. 05) was found. Positive relationships were found between muscle thickness and muscle strength (r = 0. 61, P <. 001), muscle thickness and motor performance (r = 0. 81, P <. 001), and muscle strength and motor performance (r = 0. 76, P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: GH increased muscle thickness, which was related to muscle strength and motor development in infants with PWS. Catch-up growth was faster in muscles that are most frequently used in early development. Because this effect was independent of GH, it suggests a training effect...|$|R
