The main characters comprise a royal family that includes King Ploobis, Queen Peuta, and a <b>male</b> <b>child</b> named Wiss. There are also a male servant named Scred, a female servant named Vazh, and a rock prophet named the Mighty Favog. Scred acts like a fervent supporter of dim-witted King Ploobis, while Vazh displays flirtatious qualities.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been born}} after the {{recognition}} of Brazilian independence, he was considered a foreigner under Portuguese law. However, his elder sister, having been born prior to independence, was able to ascend the throne of Portugal as Maria II upon the abdication of their father (Pedro I, who was also Pedro IV of Portugal) on 28 May 1826. As the only legitimate <b>male</b> <b>child</b> of Pedro I to survive infancy, he became heir to his father's Brazilian crown as Prince Imperial and was officially recognized as such on 6 August 1826.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{frequency}} of specific disfluencies in 3 year old and 5 year old normal <b>male</b> <b>children</b> in terms of part-word repetitions, word repetitions, phrase repetitions, interjections, revision-incomplete phrases, disrhythmic phonations and tense pauses. The disfluencies were observed while each child spontaneously interacted with an investigator in a clinical room. Two questions were addressed: 1. Do three-year-old <b>male</b> <b>children</b> exhibit a higher overall frequency of disfluencies than five-yearold <b>male</b> <b>children?</b> 2. Do three-year-old <b>male</b> <b>children</b> exhibit a greater frequency of certain disfluencies than five-year old <b>male</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{roots of}} the {{collapse}} of the monarchy can be traced as far back as 1850, upon the death of Pedro II's youngest <b>male</b> <b>child.</b> From that point onward, the Emperor ceased to believe in the monarchy as a viable form of government for Brazil's future, as his remaining heir was a daughter. Although constitutionally permitted, a female ruler was considered unacceptable by both Pedro II and the ruling circles. This issue was deferred for decades, during which the country became more powerful and prosperous. So long as the Emperor enjoyed good health, the matter of succession could be ignored.|$|E
5|$|The eldest generational Avatar {{within a}} House is {{dominant}} {{and called the}} Prophet. He possesses blue blood, also called Vitae Divina. The next in line is the Ascendant Prince. Any additional Avatara within the House are Princes ranked by generation. Although Avatara form blood dynasties from father to son, House affiliations can be mixed within a dynasty. If the youngest Prince in a dynasty dies, the dynasty is ended. Most dynasties only last on average three generations, since typical Avatara can be killed by any means. When a dynasty ends, the first <b>male</b> <b>child</b> born {{elsewhere in the world}} with the most Avataric blood will be a new Prince starting a new dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The only {{legitimate}} <b>male</b> <b>child</b> of PedroI {{to survive}} infancy, he was officially recognized as heir apparent to the Brazilian throne {{with the title}} Prince Imperial on 6 August 1826. Empress Maria Leopoldina died on 11 December 1826, {{a few days after}} a stillbirth, when Pedro was a year old. Two and a half years later, his father married Amélie of Leuchtenberg. Prince Pedro developed an affectionate relationship with her, whom he came to regard as his mother. PedroI's desire to restore his daughter MariaII to her Portuguese throne, which had been usurped by his brother MiguelI, as well as his declining political position at home led to his abrupt abdication on 7 April 1831. He and Amélie immediately departed for Europe, leaving behind the Prince Imperial, who became Emperor Dom PedroII.|$|E

40|$|Assessment of {{skeletal}} {{maturity and}} dental {{development is a}} common clinical practice in many health professions. Aims of this investigation were: 1) to test {{the applicability of the}} Demirjian 46 method and the Greulich and Pyle 47 atlas to the Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children.</b> 2) to study the relationship between dental maturity, skeletal maturity and chronological age in Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children,</b> and 3) to study the association between the dental maturity markers and the skeletal maturity stages in Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children.</b> Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of panoramic and hand-wrist radiographs of 148 Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children</b> between 9 and 15 years of age. Demirjian 46 method was used to estimate the dental age through the assessment of different calcification stages of the left mandibular dentition. Skeletal age was determined using Greulich and Pyle 47 atlas and skeletal maturity stage was established utilizing Björk’s 21 skeletal maturity indicators. Results: Paired sample T-test revealed {{no significant difference between the}} mean dental, skeletal and chronological age. Tendency toward late skeletal maturation and early dental maturation was observed. Spearman rank order test showed high correlation between skeletal maturity markers and dental maturity markers of the 1 st premolar (r= 0. 729) and 2 nd molar (r= 0. 720). Conclusion: chronological age is a reasonable indicator of the dental and skeletal maturation in Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children.</b> The dental maturation stage of the left mandibular 1 st premolar and 2 nd molar can be used to predict the skeletal maturity stage in Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children.</b> The skeletal maturity rate of Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children</b> is analogous to previously reported rates in other groups with different ethnic backgrounds.

5|$|According to the legend, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, {{was on a}} hunting {{expedition}} {{when he had a}} nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to a fight mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the <b>male</b> <b>child.</b> The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who smells like fish"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful"). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father, the fisherman, in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.|$|E
5|$|In a {{parallel}} universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the terrible rule {{of a powerful}} coven of wicked witches. Their queen, who managed to surpass the rest in her boundless cruelty and depravity, frantically seeks a live <b>male</b> <b>child</b> from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers {{from all the other}} witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in our world in the 1990s, an American young teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish in a flash of light. The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. But the boy soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who just might break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of twenty years, Maria Theresa gave birth to sixteen children, {{thirteen}} of whom survived infancy. The first child, Maria Elisabeth (1737–1740), was born {{a little less than}} a year after the wedding. Again, the child's gender caused great disappointment and so would the births of Maria Anna, the eldest surviving child, and Maria Carolina (1740–1741). While fighting to preserve her inheritance, Maria Theresa gave birth to a son named after Saint Joseph, to whom she had repeatedly prayed for a <b>male</b> <b>child</b> during the pregnancy. Maria Theresa's favourite child, Maria Christina, was born on her 25thbirthday, four days before the defeat of the Austrian army in Chotusitz. Five more children were born during the war: Maria Elisabeth, Charles, Maria Amalia, Leopold and Maria Carolina (1748–1748). During this period, there was no rest for Maria Theresa during pregnancies or around the births; the war and child-bearing were carried on simultaneously. Five children were born during the peace between the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War: Maria Johanna, Maria Josepha, Maria Carolina, Ferdinand and Maria Antonia. She delivered her last child, Maximilian Francis, during the Seven Years' War, aged 39. Maria Theresa asserted that, had she not been almost always pregnant, she would have gone into battle herself.|$|E

40|$|This paper summarises {{the results}} of a {{small-scale}} study into the online interactions of suspected paedophiles with undercover Australian police officers posing as <b>male</b> <b>children.</b> The study provides insight to an under-researched area of how persons with a sexual interest in <b>male</b> <b>children</b> interact with potential victims and whether these interactions differ from online engagements with female children. The findings provide an interesting and persuasive case to further examine online strategies used by persons wishing to exploit <b>male</b> <b>children,</b> as it highlights potential differences in approaches when compared with interactions between suspected offenders and female children. The differences include less aggressive online behaviour and language, with an emphasis on the <b>male</b> <b>child’s</b> sexuality and sexual experience. These strategies appear to assist the formation of an online friendship which precedes sexual topics, rather than the reverse as is largely reported in literature. These findings are likely to have implications for law enforcement and child protection initiatives...|$|R

5|$|Villani {{states that}} the whole {{population}} of Florence—men, women, and children—in reference to the years 1336 to 1338, {{was estimated to be}} 90,000 due to the amount of bread needed daily. Villani recorded an exact figure of 94,000 residents (which he says was very reliable data that included even the poor) in April 1347, a year before the Black Death. A black bean was deposited for every <b>male</b> <b>child</b> baptized and a white bean deposited for every female child baptized in the Florence Baptistry—from these baptisms the average annual birth rate was figured at 5,500 to 6,000. Villani pointed out that the newborn males often outnumbered the newborn females by 300 to 500 on each count. He noted that in his day the adult, male citizen population of the city was about 25,000 (those between the age of fifteen and seventy who could bear arms); 1,500 of these were noble and upper class citizens. Giovanni Villani stated that at all times there were about 1,500 foreigners, transients, and soldiers in the city.|$|E
