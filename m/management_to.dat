40|$|This study {{examines}} the interactive relationship between three dimensions of safety climate (<b>management</b> commitment <b>to</b> safety, priority of safety, and pressure for production), {{and their impact}} on risk behavior reported by employees. The sample consisted of 623 employees from a chemical manufacturing organization in South Africa. Hierarchical regression analyses were carried out to test the direct effects and the interaction effect of the three safety climate dimensions on risk behavior. The results showed that, as expected, employees’ risk behavior was negatively related <b>to</b> <b>management</b> commitment <b>to</b> safety and priority of safety and positively related to pressure for production. Moreover, as expected, the three-way interaction between <b>management</b> commitment <b>to</b> safety, priority of safety and pressure for production was significant. When pressure for production was high, <b>management</b> commitment <b>to</b> safety was positively related to risk behavior, regardless of level of priority of safety on plant. When pressure for production was low, the effect of <b>management</b> commitment <b>to</b> safety on risk behavior was nullified under conditions of high, as compared to low priority of safety on plant. These findings highlight the importance of managerial commitment to safety in contexts where employees experience tensions between production deadlines and safety procedures...|$|R

Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E

5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable.

It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires design <b>management</b> <b>to</b> know how to get there.|$|E
