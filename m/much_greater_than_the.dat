5|$|Sacred groves {{exist in}} China, India, Africa and elsewhere. They {{are places where}} the deities live and where all the living things are either sacred or are companions of the gods. Folklore lays down the supernatural {{penalties}} that will result if desecration takes place for example by the felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves {{may be the only}} relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|Observers {{hoped that}} the impacts would give them a first glimpse of Jupiter beneath the cloud tops, as lower {{material}} was exposed by the comet fragments punching through the upper atmosphere. Spectroscopic studies revealed absorption lines in the Jovian spectrum due to diatomic sulfur (S2) and carbon disulfide (CS2), the first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S2 in any astronomical object. Other molecules detected included ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The amount of sulfur implied by the quantities of these compounds was <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> amount that would be expected in a small cometary nucleus, showing that material from within Jupiter was being revealed. Oxygen-bearing molecules such as sulfur dioxide were not detected, {{to the surprise of}} astronomers.|$|E

25|$|The Schwarzschild solution, which {{describes}} spacetime surrounding a spherically symmetric non-rotating uncharged massive object. For compact enough objects, this solution generated {{a black hole}} with a central singularity. For radial distances from the center which are <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Schwarzschild radius, the accelerations predicted by the Schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by Newton's theory of gravity.|$|E
25|$|The {{minimization}} {{of radiation}} dose {{to the subject}} is an attractive feature {{of the use of}} short-lived radionuclides. Besides its established role as a diagnostic technique, PET has an expanding role as a method to assess the response to therapy, in particular, cancer therapy, where the risk to the patient from lack of knowledge about disease progress is <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> risk from the test radiation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{commonly}} adopted in limit equilibrium analyses where {{the rate of}} loading is very <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rate at which pore water pressures, that are generated due to the action of shearing the soil, may dissipate. An {{example of this is}} rapid loading of sands during an earthquake, or the failure of a clay slope during heavy rain, and applies to most failures that occur during construction.|$|E

25|$|From 1941 on, United States {{aircraft}} {{production was}} <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> combined output of Japan and Germany, {{and the force}} of 3,305 combat planes in December 1941 grew to 41,000 in August 1945. Not all of these aircraft were of self-powered metal construction: in March 1942, Echols told the joint Senate-House committee that the Army Air Corps had ordered 1000 wooden gliders, each capable of carrying 50 soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Far field methods achieve longer ranges, often {{multiple}} kilometer ranges, {{where the}} distance is <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> {{diameter of the}} device(s). The main reason for longer ranges with radio wave and optical devices {{is the fact that}} electromagnetic radiation in the far-field can be made to match the shape of the receiving area (using high directivity antennas or well-collimated laser beams). The maximum directivity for antennas is physically limited by diffraction.|$|E
25|$|Exposure {{assessments}} {{must also}} {{take into consideration}} sensitive subgroups of the population such as infants, children, nursing women and the elderly who may be more susceptible to adverse health effects of exposure. A sensitive population could also be {{one in which the}} exposure level is <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> average for reasons such as geography, culture, or traditional diets. When characterizing exposure, it is necessary to evaluate {{it in the context of}} these more susceptible populations as well as the general public.|$|E
50|$|Questions {{concerning}} {{the authenticity of}} the Middle High German texts attributed to Eckhart are <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> for <b>the</b> Latin texts. The problems involve not only whether a particular sermon or treatise is to be judged authentic or pseudonymous, but also, given the large number of manuscripts and the fragmentary condition of many of them, whether it is even possible to establish the text for some of the pieces accepted as genuine. Eckhart's sermons are versions written down by others from memory or from notes, meaning that the possibility for error was <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> for <b>the</b> carefully written Latin treatises.|$|R
30|$|Viscous {{fingering}} {{occurs in}} both miscible and immiscible displacements. This happens when mobility ratio (M) is <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> one. <b>The</b> micromodel used was a resin micromodel. The fingering appeared at around M valued to ten.|$|R

25|$|A {{bass drum}} is {{typically}} cylindrical with the drum's diameter <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> drum's depth. There is normally a struck head {{at both ends}} of the cylinder. The heads may be made of calf skin or plastic. There is normally a means of adjusting the tension either by threaded taps or by strings. Bass drums are built in a variety of sizes, but size has little to do with the volume produced by the drum. The size chosen being based on convenience and aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|Mars has an axial tilt of 25.2°. This {{means that}} there are seasons on Mars, just as on Earth. The {{eccentricity}} of Mars' orbit is 0.1, <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Earth's present orbital eccentricity of about 0.02. The large eccentricity causes the insolation on Mars to vary as the planet orbits the Sun. (The Martian year lasts 687 days, roughly 2 Earth years.) As on Earth, Mars' obliquity dominates the seasons but, {{because of the large}} eccentricity, winters in the southern hemisphere are long and cold while those in the North are short and warm.|$|E
25|$|A common {{understanding}} exists {{that in the}} national level HOV model fits well. In fact, Davis and others found that HOV model fitted extremely well with the regional data of Japan. Even when the HOV formula fits well, {{it does not mean}} that Heckscher–Ohlin theory is valid. Indeed, Heckscher–Ohlin theory claims that the state of factor endowments of each country (or each region) determines the production of each country (respectively of each region) but Bernstein and Weinstein found that the factor endowments have little predictive power. The factor-endowments-driven model (FED model) has errors <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> HOV model.|$|E

50|$|Conversely, lowland {{reservoirs}} drawing {{water from}} nutrient rich rivers, may show exaggerated eutrophic characteristics because the residence time in <b>the</b> reservoir is <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> {{river and the}} biological systems have a <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> opportunity to utilise the available nutrients.|$|R
25|$|In Singapore, local {{distributor}} Maxsoft said that 2,000 consoles {{were sold in}} the first two days of retail, <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> for <b>the</b> launches of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and that many preorders remained unfulfilled due to a low stock inventory.|$|R
25|$|Although {{cellulose}} forms {{a distinct}} crystalline structure, cellulose fibers in nature are not purely crystalline. In {{addition to the}} crystalline and amorphous regions, cellulose fibers contain various types of irregularities, such as kinks or twists of the microfibrils, or voids such as surface micropores, large pits, and capillaries. Thus, the total surface area of a cellulose fiber is <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> surface area of an ideally smooth fiber of the same dimension. The net effect of structural heterogeneity within the fiber is that the fibers are at least partially hydrated by water when immersed in aqueous media, and some micropores and capillaries are sufficiently spacious to permit penetration.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{explanation}} of optical trapping behavior {{depends upon the}} size of the trapped particle relative to the wavelength of light used to trap it. In cases where the dimensions of the particle are <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> wavelength, a simple ray optics treatment is sufficient. If the wavelength of light far exceeds the particle dimensions, the particles can be treated as electric dipoles in an electric field. For optical trapping of dielectric objects of dimensions within an order of magnitude of the trapping beam wavelength, the only accurate models involve the treatment of either time dependent or time harmonic Maxwell equations using appropriate boundary conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Prince {{takes his}} time {{dressing}} for {{his meeting with}} Don Calogero, and when he finally goes downstairs, he has {{a vision of the}} two of them as animals. Their conversation is, for the most part, polite, with both men making occasional slips into tactlessness but both ultimately making the truths of the situation quite apparent. For the Prince, that truth involves Tancredi's excellent lineage but extreme poverty, while for Calogero the truth involves his wealth, which is <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Prince ever realized, and the fact that Don Calogero is in final negotiations to purchase the title of Baroness for his daughter. An agreement is reached that the marriage is to proceed.|$|E
