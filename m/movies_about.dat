5|$|In 1963, Egyptian {{director}} Youssef Chahine {{produced the}} film El Nasser Salah El Dine ("Saladin The Victorious"), which intentionally drew parallels between Saladin, considered {{a hero in}} the Arab world, and Nasser and his pan-Arabist policies. Nasser is played by Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel's 1996 Nasser 56. The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis. It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film to dramatize {{the role of a}} modern-day Arab leader. Together with the 1999 Syrian biopic Gamal Abdel Nasser, the films marked the first biographical <b>movies</b> <b>about</b> contemporary public figures produced in the Arab world.

25|$|The 20th century grafted {{still further}} details {{on to the}} {{original}} legends. The 1938 film, The Adventures of Robin Hood, starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, portrayed Robin as a hero on a national scale, leading the oppressed Saxons in revolt against their Norman overlords while Richard the Lionheart fought in the Crusades; this movie established itself so definitively that many studios resorted to <b>movies</b> <b>about</b> his son (invented for that purpose) rather than compete {{with the image of}} this one.|$|E

25|$|Several {{track and}} field movies have used Eugene as a setting and/or a filming location. Personal Best, {{starring}} Mariel Hemingway, was filmed in Eugene in 1982. The film centered {{on a group of}} women who are trying to qualify for the Olympic {{track and field}} team. Two track and field <b>movies</b> <b>about</b> the life of Steve Prefontaine, Prefontaine and Without Limits were released within a year of each other in 1997–1998. Kenny Moore, Eugene-trained Olympic runner and co-star in Prefontaine, co-wrote the screenplay for Without Limits. Prefontaine was filmed in Washington because the Without Limits production bought out Hayward Field for the summer to prevent its competition from shooting there. Kenny Moore also wrote a biography of Bill Bowerman, played in Without Limits by Donald Sutherland back in Eugene 20 years after he had appeared in Animal House. Moore had also had a role in Personal Best.|$|E

There are a lot of really, really, really big <b>movies</b> <b>about</b> robots and things—and there's not a part for a 34-year-old woman in a robot movie." [...] Witherspoon returned with three films released in 2010, 2011 and 2012, all centered on her as a woman caught in a love triangle between two men.

500|$|Daniel D'Addario from Time {{called the}} movie [...] "clunky and ridiculous", but also called it [...] "a rare movie about women" [...] and [...] "the Bad Movie Hollywood Needs Right Now," [...] adding that: [...] "Lopez's new [...] project {{represents}} an earnest attempt {{to capitalize on}} a very real public [...] hunger to see {{a woman at the}} center of a mainstream movie—not an indie, but an old-fashioned popcorn flick. Can either the boy-centric Best Picture nominees or the elusive Best Actress pictures say that?

He says of war that it [...] "has many more nuances, it is grayer, less defined. When an enemy may stop being one at any time and a friend can become an enemy overnight, things become less clear". Ella Taylor of The Village Voice commented, [...] "Flame & Citron is less about the battle between good and evil than about losing one's way in the fog of war, which makes it hard to tell friend from foe and harder yet to sort through the rules of engagement, and complicates the heroic honor codes of <b>movies</b> <b>about</b> the 'good war.'" [...] Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post asserted that the violence in the film is double-edged: [...] " [...] takes its toll on the perpetrator as well as the victim." [...] Similarly, The Irish Timess Derek Scally stated the film analyses [...] "the dehumanising effect of assassinations on assassin".|$|E

After the New York premiere, Evangeline Earl, a student, announced that Green's book, from which the film was adapted, had been inspired by her sister Esther Earl, who had also been an author. Esther suffered from thyroid cancer and died in 2010. Evangeline said Esther had met Green at LeakyCon, a Harry Potter convention held in Boston in 2009. Green said, [...] "I could never have written The Fault in Our Stars without knowing Esther. Every word on that book depends on her." [...] Green said {{he used the word}} [...] "okay" [...] in the book and the film because Hazel and Augustus used it to express their love for each other; it becomes a special word between them.

500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} legacy {{aspects of the}} film for Scorsese and {{compared}} Scorsese to such established directors as Ingmar Bergman.

[...] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out London gave the film five stars out of five, saying, [...] "Scorsese has hit the rare heights of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Carl Theodor Dreyer, artists who find in religion a battleground that leaves even the strongest in tatters, compromised and broken." [...] Emma Green of The Atlantic gave the film high praise, stating, [...] "This is what makes Scorsese's film so radical and so unlike many <b>movies</b> <b>about</b> religion: It's actually art." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film five stars out of five, stating, [...] "Scorsese's brutal spiritual epic will scald, and succor, your soul." [...] Collin further added, [...] "It's the kind of work a great filmmaker can only pull off with a lifetime's accrued expertise behind him". Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3 stars and a half out of four, stating, [...] "With the religious historical drama Silence, Martin Scorsese proves he’s as masterful a filmmaker with men of God as he is with gangsters." [...] Truitt also argued that the film [...] "marks one of the deeper and most thoughtful projects in Scorsese’s career." ...|$|E
