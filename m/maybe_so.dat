2500|$|In {{response}} to the leaks, Chen officially confirmed during a September 2015 earnings call that BlackBerry would release a high-end Android-based device, {{now known as the}} Priv (standing for both [...] "privilege" [...] and [...] "privacy"), in late 2015. [...] Chen felt that the decision to produce an Android phone was to help BlackBerry's device business sustain itself, saying that [...] "we have some really committed diehards. I respect that there's a lot of heritage here, a lot of pride. If the math doesn't add up, the math doesn't add up. We could keep the pride and die hungry or we can eat well and not so proud, <b>maybe.</b> <b>So</b> I chose to eat well. It’s good for the company to continue to have a shot at building handsets." [...] He also argued that the decision was meant to [...] " [...] advantage of what the industry can offer", whilst continuing to leverage BlackBerry's [...] "core strength".|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I reckon <b>maybe</b> that's <b>so.</b> Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But say, Tom, now's {{a mighty}} {{good time to}} get that box, if Injun Joe's drunk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No say eeder lie," [...] {{answered}} the Onondago; [...] "but many forked tongue about, and <b>maybe</b> hear <b>so,</b> and t'ink so. Chainbearer stop ear; nebber listen to crooked tongue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather a nice old bit; <b>maybe</b> useful, <b>so</b> I'll book it;" [...] and, {{whipping}} out a sketch-book, {{the stranger}} took a hasty likeness of the griffin's {{head on the}} knocker.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] says I, [...] "maybe he is; but, if he is, I 'm mistaken {{the worst}} sort. <b>Maybe</b> <b>so,</b> maybe so; but, if I am, I'll suffer by it; I'll be a Democrat {{if it turns}} out that Shields is a Whig, considerin' you shall be a Whig if he turns out a Democrat." ...|$|E
5000|$|Garcia {{aimed to}} prove that serious {{literature}} and science-fiction themes and memes are not incompatible, and that “novels {{can be just as}} true — in some ways, <b>maybe</b> more <b>so,</b> than non-fiction books.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Before the game, the Indianapolis News {{reported}} that the Hoosiers had [...] "a quiet confidence that they will win it. Of course, Iowa feels the same, <b>maybe</b> more <b>so.</b> And Indiana doesn't have a Kinnick." ...|$|R

I think him sail in one, two hour. Verree nice day {{we shall be}} goin' have. You hear some talkee 'bout big battle, <b>maybe</b> <b>so?</b> You think catchee General De Vega, señor? Yes? No?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Welcome, ladies," [...] he said, {{holding out}} a big, hard, but {{scrupulously}} clean hand. [...] "I thought you'd be feeling a bit tired and hungry, <b>maybe,</b> <b>so</b> when I came over to open up I put on a fire and brewed you up a cup of tea. I just delight in being neighbourly and 'tain't often I have the chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not then. We laid {{there all}} day, {{and at night}} some of our fellers came {{to look after the}} missing ones. They nat'rally wanted to take me fust, but I knew I could wait, and the rebel had but one chance, <b>maybe,</b> <b>so</b> I made them carry him off right away. He had jest {{strength}} enough to hold out his hand to me and say, 'Thanky, comrade!' and them was the last words he spoke, for he died an hour after he got to the hospital-tent." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{north of}} the Spanish state is a rich area for mythology. From Galicia to the Basque Country, passing by Asturias and Cantabria, there are rites, stories and {{imaginary}} or impossible beings (or <b>maybe</b> not <b>so).</b>|$|R

50|$|The lucky Black Team, meanwhile, are {{off on a}} hike with Bob. Or, <b>maybe</b> not <b>so</b> lucky. He informs them a hike {{with him}} isn't just a normal hike - he's going to work them super hard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>so.</b> I guess she's {{good enough}} looking, if that's what you mean. But I think it's always {{a kind of}} a mistake for three persons to come off together, I don't care who they are. Then there's three opinions. She's a nice girl, and a good girl, and she don't put herself forward. But when you've got a young lady on your hands, you've GOT her, and you feel bound to keep doin' {{something}} for her all the time; and if you don't know what to do yourself, and your wife can't tell--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True enough, my lad. But {{while the}} armorer is {{thrusting}} in his devil's-dust, and dropping his ball, and lighting his flambeau, I can very easily loose six shafts, or eight <b>maybe,</b> <b>so</b> he hath no great vantage after all. Yet I will {{not deny that}} at the intaking of a town it is well to have good store of bombards. I am told that at Calais they made dints in the wall that a man might put his head into. But surely, comrades, some one who is grievously hurt hath passed along this road before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Years ago. I {{was with}} the Philadelphia Institute {{expedition}} in the Bad Lands under Professor Cope, hunting mastodon bones, and I overheard him say, his own self, that any plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium that hadn't wings and was uncertain was a reptile. Well, then, has this dog any wings? No. Is he a plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium? <b>Maybe</b> <b>so,</b> maybe not; but without ever having seen him, and judging only by his illegal and spectacular parentage, I will bet {{the odds of a}} bale of hay to a bran mash that he looks it. Finally, is he uncertain? That is the point--is he uncertain? I will leave it to you if you have ever heard of a more uncertainer dog than what this one is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cinnamon," [...] {{declared}} Copple, {{and turning}} him over {{he pointed to}} a white spot on his breast. [...] "Fine bear. About four hundred pounds. <b>Maybe</b> not <b>so</b> heavy. But he'll take some packin' up to the rim!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... a bit {{darker and}} <b>maybe</b> not <b>so</b> complex as 2007's [...] "Unia". Nevertheless, it's {{definitely}} not a back-to-the-roots album with fast power metal. All the trademark SONATA stuff is on there, solos, lots of singing andsome slower songs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Maybe</b> using <b>so</b> many non-Persian and Mongolian {{vocabulary}} {{is why he}} is not famous nowadays. Most of his Qasidas (odes) are sociologically important rather literary {{because the}} words used in these poems reflect the violent environment of the Ilkhanate era.|$|R
5000|$|On June 18, 2008, he stated: [...] "Should {{the people}} of the United States own refineries? <b>Maybe</b> <b>so.</b> Frankly, I think that's a good idea," [...] but conceded that it was {{unlikely}} the government would do so, and suggested putting national pressure on the oil companies.|$|E
5000|$|Due to not {{receiving}} domestic theatrical distribution, few critics reviewed the film. From BZ Film: There are movies that can simply {{be put into}} “forgettable” category. ESCAPEE falls right in there. Supposedly ESCAPEE was based on true events {{that took place in}} one of the producer's hometown of Alexandria, Louisiana. <b>Maybe</b> <b>so,</b> however this doesn’t make this film any different, as one has to really think hard and work even harder to make a serial killer movie worth watching.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{discusses}} {{this issue}} in his review: [...] "Miss May is reportedly dissatisfied with the present version; newspaper reports indicate that her original cut was an hour longer and included two murders. Matthau, who likes this version better than the original, has suggested that writer-director-stars {{should be willing to}} let someone else have a hand in the editing. <b>Maybe</b> <b>so.</b> I'm generally prejudiced in favor of the director in these disputes. Whatever the merits of Miss May's case, however, the movie in its present form is hilarious, and cockeyed, and warm." ...|$|E
5000|$|JEROME: I {{have never}} met him, but there is good wine here, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> he has drunk here.|$|R
5000|$|It {{definitely}} has that sharp, chick-lit {{look and feel}} ... You look at {{the photo of the}} authors on the back, and they are both drop-dead gorgeous. If you look at the photos of authors on the crunchy granola books — <b>maybe</b> not <b>so</b> much.|$|R

5000|$|Sean and Wendy {{try to be}} a [...] "normal" [...] couple, but {{the group}} quickly tests the relationship: Billie puts the box of memorabilia in Sean's locker. Wendy claims she is not scared; she knows that Sean loves her. <b>Maybe</b> <b>so,</b> but when he sees the photos that {{document}} a lifetime of sexual experimentation, he is fed up and offers an ultimatum: Wendy can burn the box, leave the group, and be a normal girl, or they can break up. Wendy has gone from one ultimatum to another.|$|E
5000|$|.....the {{bombs are}} falling. They whistle to earth with ear-shattering explosions. You {{can see the}} morning {{sunlight}} glisten on the bombs as they fall - silvery flashed like trout or mackerel jumping out of the water. Who said the Japs were cross-eyed, second-rate pilots who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn door? <b>Maybe</b> <b>so,</b> but I'm standing on our Navy Yard parade ground looking up at them, while they're making a sandpile out of the yard. They're kicking {{the hell out of}} Pearl Harbor, and it's enough to turn your stomach." [...] —Smith describing the attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E
50|$|The {{confusion}} {{surrounding the}} claim to {{invention of the}} telescope and the microscope arises {{in part from the}} (sometimes conflicting) testimony of Zacharias Janssen's son, Johannes Zachariassen. Johannes claims include that his father invented the telescope in 1590, that his father invented the telescope in 1604, that he and his father invented the telescope in 1618, and that Jacob Metius and Cornelis Drebbel bought a telescope from him and his father in 1620 and copied it. Johannes also seems to have lied about his own date of birth, <b>maybe</b> <b>so</b> he could stake his own claim as inventor of the telescope along with his father.|$|E
5000|$|... "Liberal Arts is {{an almost}} {{unreasonable}} pleasure about a jaded New Yorker who returns to his alma mater in Ohio and finds that his heart would like to stay there. It's the kind of film that appeals powerfully to me; to others, <b>maybe</b> not <b>so</b> much.|$|R
5000|$|I {{think people}} should die without their dreams being fulfilled, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> they can have an excuse for coming around again.|$|R
