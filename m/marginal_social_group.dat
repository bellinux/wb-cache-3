40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the motives {{underpinning}} the formation and (re) production of a <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>group</b> residing in houseboats within Shoreham-by-Sea, South-east England. It is contended that the 'boat-people' represent a unique example of going back-to-the-water, which is tied to a predilection for a self-sufficient and sustainable lifestyle, anti-consumerism, a sense of community, and closeness to nature and natural elements. The discussion points {{to the importance of}} idyllic rural representations of the South Downs, which render positive cultural readings of the river, coast, water and tides. It is also noted that the houseboats provide an economic 'loop-hole' into the wider gentrified housing markets of Brighton and Hove. Focusing on recent socio-cultural and economic transformations, and linked to the regulation and commodification of the alternative lifestyles and living arrangements, the case study provides an example of the 'purification' of manufactured, atypical gentrified spaces. The findings therefore disrupt ideas of gentrification being synonymous with conventional residential spaces, and extend understandings of the diversity of 'other' geographies of gentrification to more fully embrace sociocultural marginality.

40|$|The PhD thesis {{deals with}} the ways of how {{constructing}} representation of otherness develops discursively. The theoretical starting points encompass {{the knowledge of the}} importance of language, discourses and discursive practice for social practice as well as for creating images of various <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> and of <b>social</b> categorization and construction of social groups’ identity. They represent critical discourse analysis and its approaches as a means of research and understanding of social relations and the position of social minorities. The thesis highlights the basic notions and concepts connected with different approaches of critical discourse analysis namely, discourse, ideology, social power, representation, construction of social minorities. Critical discourse analysis is defined as a theory and method together with its theoretical and methodological starting points whilst Fairclough’s three-dimensional model of the discourse’s understanding and analysis is described in detail. The concept of “the other” as a concept of demarcation and distinction is represented by means of general society’s attitude to minorities or <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> and power relations. “The others” are most frequently marked by stereotypes and prejudice. However, in current postmodern societies there has been a quality breakthrough concerning their expression, so it is necessary to speak out about the new racism, discrimination and tolerance. The thesis describes the role of media in constructing reality’s images in modern societies and represents key findings of researching characteristics of media reporting about <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> In the starting point of the research issue is the individualization of subjects and pluralisation of society within the field of social problems. Social pedagogical work within the local context triggers special dilemmas on how to combine the expert development with the performance in the local environment and how to surpass possible incoherence between theory and practical work. The issue brings out the question of who "the others" in the local environment are and how they are represented in the local media. Such research interest has so far only rarely been the focus in research additionally accompanied by the lack of literature. There have been discourse analyses of representations of <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> but {{there has not been a}} research carried out which would combine the analysis of representations of <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> in the local media with the use of critical discourse analysis and would there-by be included in the field of social pedagogy. The fundamental goal in the empirical part of this study was to establish how the majority constructs itself discursively and how deviant groups are constructed and represented as well as to see which agents appear and establish themselves. This was carried out on the basis of two cities with different historical and social development through discourse analysis of two local newspapers in three selected years within a period of two decades. The results indicate that the two analysed local media perform the role of representatives of the current social organization in the specific historical period. Within the local context it is possible to analyse individual <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> which are also recognized by literature globally. The transition is reflected in the articles of the two newspapers since the trend of even greater individualization of subjects is indicated in the selected period of time. Greater social inequality brings the appearance of social margin that is to say <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> The general image of <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> in both local contexts is reflected through most frequent topics reported on by the two local media. In this sense, both newspapers deal with the topics of employing, unemployment and the state among workers, social hardships, delinquency and crime, addictions, illnesses and treatments, mental issues, migrations and tolerance, religious background, youth, aging and dying. The newspaper from Celje also {{deals with the}} topics of country life, gay equality, family violence and foster families. In the articles the members of <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> are mostly related to trouble. Positive aspects are rarely represented and in most cases in connection with narrow segment of an individual’s or a <b>social</b> <b>group’s</b> life. What is also rarely present is the critical view of the <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> groups’ position, which would alert to the inequality and contribute to social changes. In all periods and in both newspapers the key sources on <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> are official, institutional and expert sources. There is some sort of general discourse on otherness creating and firming the distinction us-them. Therefore, the two media by means of reproducing features and roles form and sustain the existing representations as well as power relations. The work is completed with a critical reflection about the characteristics of discourses and representations of <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> within a local context, which is aimed at spreading knowledge about constructing images of <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> in (local) public and at understanding the problem of social exclusion. The work would also like to emphasize the possibilities of professional practice with the purpose of improving the situation of <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> in the field of social pedagogy and other related sciences, and suggest the guidelines for further research in this area with a wish for greater critical thinking in science, professional practice and everyday life of people which also means openness to changes and therefore to different worlds. ...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{shows how}} two <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> - {{civil rights activists}} in the 1940 s and religious conservatives in the 1980 s - achieved many of their goals by becoming core players in a political party. In each case, the group faced opposition within its chosen party but allied with friendly partisans to marginalize opponents and nominate politicians committed to their priorities. Trying to influence office holders whom the groups had no hand in nominating proved ineffective: office holders would promise benefits but do nothing that displaced core supporters or median voters. Mobilizing nonpolitical groups for political purposes was the road to success. In both cases, <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> rather than politicians drove the process, creating transformed parties that would stand up for rather than straddle the issues they cared about...|$|R

40|$|Mortality {{crisis in}} Russia was {{discussed}} {{many times in}} the scientific literature. However little attention was paid to the problems of the quality of mortality statistics in Russia, which is rapidly deteriorating. During the first half of 1990 s mortality from such cause as "injuries undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted" grew with particularly rapid pace. In this study we tested a hypothesis that mortality from violent causes of death (particularly in middle-aged men from <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups)</b> is concealed using death codes from the class "Symptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions" (ICD- 9). Reported mortality from this group of causes increased 6 -fold for males and 9 -fold for females in 1989 - 2002. This hypothesis of concealing criminal cases of violent deaths under the mask of ill-defined conditions was confirmed using case study of death certificates from the Kirov region of Russia.

40|$|Every filmmaker {{knows this}} truism well. Most films revolve around a {{conflict}} situation. Those {{of us that}} teach screen production in academia are also aware that conflict in student projects is often based on some personal trauma. How are we {{to deal with these}} traumatic narratives as supervisors? In this paper we offer three perspectives on this question along with one detailed example. 1. For some students trauma provides the very reason for the story. Filmmakers that belong to <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> are a good case in point. Trauma associated with <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> existence is most often the driving force for stories in this genre.

We recognize these students in our workshops by their blockages, silences and avoidance of narratives.

It is tempting to think that, as supervisors, we can unlock these personal blockages and uncover the underlying writing potential. In this perspective scriptwriting classe...|$|R

40|$|Housing {{provision}} in China has undergone significant changes since economic reform. In the {{early stage of}} reform the objective was {{to solve the problems}} that are internal to the socialist economy, namely unrecoverable housing investment and housing shortages. The state adopted policies to 'commodify' and 'decentralise' housing provision. The mode of provision was transformed from a centrally allocated budget to shared investment contributed by state work-units, local governments, and individual households. Since the 1990 s Chinese cities have seen increased foreign investment in real estate development and consequently experienced an unprecedented building boom. Little is know about the impacts of globalisation on housing development. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the changes in housing investment and to highlight the dilemma of housing 'commodification' in the process of globalisation. Specifically, foreign investment contributed to initial capital formation in real estate development and more importantly helped to create a marketised housing segment. The buoyant market price demonstrated the profitability of real estate, thus attracting more capital into housing development. The combined effect of marketisation and globalisation has led to increasing social spatial differentiation and inadequate housing provision to <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{regeneration}} of Chinese migrant communities, {{which are}} usually referred to as "villages in the city," various modes of governance have been formed based on {{the relationships between the}} three key actors (state, market, and society). These modes of governance are characterized by problems ranging from a lack of a transparent planning process, to ineffective collective decision-making. Rural migrants also play only a marginal role, or no role at all, in the regeneration practices, resulting in actual and potential social conflicts and inequality.

The availability of safe and effective vaccines for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and B (HBV) may {{play a major role}} in combating this phenomenon.

To our knowledge, the present article is the first to solely deal with vaccination against HAV in DUs. Immunization after the administration of anti-HAV vaccine has been demonstrated in DUs even if they have responded significantly less than either the general population or carriers of chronic liver disease. All the vaccines were well tolerated and adherence to the vaccine schedule was good.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} engages {{a fundamental}} concern for sociologists, criminologists, and scholars of urban poverty: how authorities attempt to better control <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> {{and how those}} populations counteract and even resist these efforts. Drawing on five years of ethnographic fieldwork, interviews, and archival research, the dissertation analyzes daily life {{on the streets of}} Los Angeles' Skid Row district, a neighborhood widely-regarded as the "homeless capital of America," distinguished as containing what is arguably the largest concentration of standing police forces found anywhere in the country, if not the world. Tracing the historical trajectory of neighborhood development into current-day, street-level interactions between police officers and Skid Row's impoverished and homeless inhabitants, I argue that a new model of social control has emerged, tightly wedding rehabilitative and punitive interventions - what I term "therapeutic policing. " Examining inhabitants' everyday experiences of Skid Row in the shadow of policing, the text further examines a range of strategies - from quiet subversion to overt opposition - by which those in the neighborhood attempt to resist the mandates of therapeutic policing. Throughout the analysis, I demonstrate that the increasing omnipresence of surveillance, detainments, and arrests in Skid Row, and other marginalized and stigmatized urban neighborhoods, is fundamentally reshaping the manner in which residents come to understand themselves, their peers, and their communities...|$|R

However, with their omnipresent inserted ads and product placements, {{it is also clear that}} that Chinese television has been commercialized one step further. In doing so, these popular programs have strengthened their class bias in a more obvious way, allowing middle class values and ideologies to become the most prominent mainstream social values. This has further diminished the space for China’s working class and farmers to express their voices. As Chinese television is further subordinated to the commercial logic, it has also intensified its role in shaping class relations in Chinese society...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to analize the new {{situation}} of labour {{different from the}} one of the eighties and nineties of the 20 th century, that is configuring a new model of poverty within the labour market. Design/methodology: The current research is based on a comparative analysis of governmental reports, proposals and plans aimed at reducing poverty through labour market. This analysis allows to detect the main actions developed by governmental institutions. Findings: Currently a growing number of workers (employees and self-employed) is pushed towards poverty {{as a consequence of the}} deterioration of labour conditions in the framework of the economic globalisation. During the crisis of the 80 s, becoming employed was a warranty to escape from poverty, but nowadays this is not enough. Unemployment it is not the only synonym of poverty and social exclusion is not solely found in <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> The new labour conditions, with low salaries, temporary contracts and long working times configure a new tipology of poverty directly linked with job market that affects more highly educated and professional groups. Research limitations/implications: This research collects different governmental reports and Action Plans at all levels. Even that, there can be other reports not included in this article. Originality/value: Currently, poverty risk responds to multifactorial parameters determined by the relationship of the individual with the labour market, family structure, available social capital, level of family debt and existing social policies. The comparative study of these factors allow a better understanding and analysis of this phenomenon, increasingly global and affecting a higher number of <b>social</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
40|$|The author {{poses the}} problem of female {{perspective}} in science {{in the framework of}} the critique of ethnology as a form of intellectual colonization of »primitive peoples« and <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> (youth, minorities, women). Major points of the critique are: 1. There is a distinction between sex as a biological category, and gender as social/cultural category which constitutes women as secondary human beings. 2. Western theoreticians transferred the male bias of their own societies and science to the cultures they studied, leaving women out of their descriptions, or seeing them as subordinated to men the way they are in the West. 3. Male bias in ethnology is also {{based on the fact that}} male anthropo¬logists have better access to men 2 ̆ 7 s cognitive models of the culture studied than to women 2 ̆ 7 s. In most societies men dominate the public sphere, and so do their models of reality. Thus, when women enter »the male sphere« and compete with men, many do that on men 2 ̆ 7 s terms by internalizing their models and attitudes. 4. The struggle for female perspective in science occurs as an aspect of struggle for social emancipation of women. An increasing number of ethno¬logical studies form the foundation for anthropology of women, particularly those in the area of ritual and symbolism. Such works do not »complete« the picture of various cultures: they offer a radically different view. »Demasculinization« is decolonization of science...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores how gender {{can operate}} as a {{disguise}} for class in {{an examination of the}} self-sacrifice of the Maiden in Euripides’ Children of Herakles. In Part I, I discuss the role of human sacrifice in terms of its radical potential to transform society and the role of class struggle in Athens. In Part II, I argue that the representation of women was intimately connected with the social and political life of the polis. In a discussion of iconography, the theater industry and audience I argue that female characters became one of the means by which different groups promoted partisan interests based on class and social status. In Part III, I show how the Maiden solicits the competing interests of the theater audience. After discussing the centrality (as a heroine from an aristocratic family) and marginality (as a woman and associated with other <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups)</b> of the Maiden’s character, I draw upon the funeral oration as a comparative model with which to understand the quite different role of self-sacrifice in tragedy. In addition to representing and mystifying the interests of elite, lower class and marginal groups, the play (on a more radical reading) glorifies a subordinate character whose contradictory social status (both subordinate and elite) embodies the social position of other “marginal” members of Athenian society (e. g., lower class males and females, resident foreigners). The play stages a model for taking political action to transform the social system and for commemorating the tragic costs of such undertakings...|$|R

We recognized these students, by their need to tell their story, on the one hand, and by their tendency to find trauma everywhere, on the other hand. Students in this category present us with stories that contain most imaginative and creative transformations around some personal trauma invoking negations/ inversions, double negations, displacements and symbolic transformations...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the most {{important}} factor in creating participation for people at grassroots level is accessibility to the media, both as receivers and producers of content (see Rodriguez, 2000; Fraser & Estrada, 2001, 2002; Tabing, 2002; and Dagron, 2001, 2004). In recent years, community radio stations have been mushrooming in Indonesia as a consequence of the democratisation of the media system in post-Soeharto Indonesia. In Indonesia community radio is used by the civil society at grassroots level to empower people who have little opportunity to voice their interests. The characteristics of community radio - size, proximity and openness to participation - provide both forms of access. By providing a forum for capacity building, community radio enhances people’s participation in the decision making process and in the preservation of local cultures in their villages. In fact, at village level the empowerment of people is central to the role of community radio; thus, people in Timbulharjo, Minomartani and Wiladeg have had the opportunity to express their interests. Community radio stations encourage diversity, challenging the tendency of commercial radio to erase cultural differences through their conceptualising of audiences as markets. In this way, community radio accommodates the interests of <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> and draws them into the public sphere. This thesis is about the way in which the Indonesian people’s movement creates grassroots democracy by using community radio as a tool for participating in social communication processes at village level, in particular in Yogyakarta Special Region. The main question is ʻhow do people at grassroots level use community radio in the democratic transition in Indonesia?’ Multiple case studies were used in order to build a comprehensive picture of the use of community radio in Indonesia as a tool for promoting participation in local contexts. To discuss its findings this thesis uses participatory communication and public sphere theories. This thesis also considers the civic role of community radio in its responses to earthquake disaster in several regions in Indonesia, where people used the medium of radio to create solidarity to help affected people...|$|R

S. Latino Theatre productions from 1985 - 2008. From the wide spectrum of possibilities the dissertation privileges multimedia and cybernetic theatrical practices. The study is based on the analysis of twenty-one theatrical productions from Spain, Chile and U. S. Latinos' within their national as well as international theatrical and historical context. The pieces include staged productions by well-known theatrical groups, new avant-garde groups, street theatre and a religious festival. The aim of this diversity is to demonstrate that multimedia and cybernetic theatrical practices are transnational and transcultural. In this study the main topic of discussion is {{the use of}} multimedia and digital techniques as a means of theatrical and performative communication. It also sheds light on the relationship between theatre production and economic trends such as postmodernism, neoliberalism and globalization. The corpus of study is a multitude of very diverse theatrical forms and expressions. As is common in theatre, Latin American, Spanish and U. S. Latino playwrights search for new aesthetics and avant-garde means by which to communicate with a very large community and multicultural society. The assumption of this research is that the performances with emphasis on technologies coexist with a diversity of theatrical trends and developed parallel to other more canonical theatrical discourses. Yet much of the mode of theatrical communication and techniques by theatre groups today has appropriated a cyber-cultural means of communication. I argue that these trends in contemporary theatre transcends national boundaries and implements transnational and multimedia codes to reach today's spectator, one whose visual competence is strongly influenced by contemporary visual cultures, cinema, modern art, television, marketing, mass media, digital and cyber-culture. The new technologies allow the contemporary playwright new modes of representation and to include new cultural and social spaces such as women, gay, lesbian, marginal individuals and <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> The approach I use integrates cultural studies, semiotics of theatre, discourses theories, performance, film and visual studies. In spite of critics who question multimedia, cybernetic and internet theatre, I propose that playwrights have adapted to the new technologies in order to represent singular world visions and social imaginaries. Multimedia, virtual, cyber and internet theatres are the contemporary versions of a long tradition of the interrelationship between technologies and theatre...|$|R

40|$|The text {{is dealing}} with the problem of {{political}} representation and modes of participation in Italy towards the end of 1960 ’s and mid- 1970 ’s. The author’s hypothesis is that the movement of non-institutional participation from the autumn of 1969 functioned as a relative stabilizer of the Italian society, because it represented the channel of para-legal mobilization of considerable portions of lower social classes and those belonging to declassed bourgeois, while that movement never had any destructive terrorist manifestations. In that phase of the movement the principal role was taken by groups of the New Left. In the transitory period towards 1970 ’s sindicates, which had been transformed and partially debureaucratized, took over the role of channeling dissenting tendencies of the working class and wide marginal strata of the society. During the crisis of 1973 and along with strengthening of leftist parties (the Communist Party of Italy), tendencies aiming at non-institutional participation started vanishing. Owing to its incapability of entering the government, what made it hold the image of the protector of order and legality, while it as simultaneously the representative of demands of participation from the bottom, the alternative of action for the CPI and the New Left was becoming more and more circumscribed, coupled with the parallel enlargement of the field of »armed parties« and various modes of terrorist violence. <b>Marginal</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> started envisaging their position as the permanent state to which the only possible reaction could be »the ubiquity of violence«. In his analysis the author pays particular attention to the »index of marginalization«, and the degree of »marginalization« is measured in relation to: (a) instability of the social role, (b) deficient or inappropriate internalization of cultural norms of the society or of subcultural norms of a class, stratum or social role, (c) the distance {{from the center of the}} society, i. e. from the central social roles and positions of hierarchical stability, (d) perturbations affecting social roles, or those which affected them, (e) consciousness of the non-existence of any institutional protection (syndicates) and impossibility of self-articulation by means of political party, »indicate, or formalized pressure group, (f) the awareness of partial or total irrelevance of the role, or even complete deprivation of any social role which is socially recognized, protected and channelized. Based on those indicators, a description of the marginal strata within the social structure is given, and an analysis of the status of the youth, of the disintegration of the New Left, of terrorism and all-reaching guerrilla. In his conclusion the author Ss giving a hypothesis on a strategy »against social diversion« and he is favouring concretization of the idea of self-management in all the spheres of social praxis...|$|R

These latter again reflect {{the idea that the}} <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> benefit should equal the <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> cost, i.e., that production should be increased as long as the <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> benefit exceeds the <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> cost. The result in an unfettered market is inefficient since at the quantity Qp, the social benefit is greater than the societal cost, so society as a whole {{would be better off if}} more goods had been produced. The problem is that people are buying too few vaccinations.|$|R

The existing method may yield positive or negative externalities even if wages reflect <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> products.

When the <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> interest diverges from the marginal private interest, the industrialist has {{no incentive to}} internalize {{the cost of the}} <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> cost. Conversely, Pigou argues, if an industry produces a <b>marginal</b> <b>social</b> benefit, the individuals receiving the benefit have no incentive to pay for that service. Pigou refers to these situations as incidental uncharged disservices and incidental uncharged services, respectively.|$|R
