Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II, the {{advancing}} Soviet Red Army pushed out the Nazi German forces from occupied Poland. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference sanctioned {{the formation of a}} provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, <b>manipulated</b> <b>the</b> implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled Provisional Government of National Unity was formed in Warsaw by ignoring the Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Stalinist period, most Soviet {{workers had}} been paid for their work based on a piece-rate system. Thus their {{individual}} wages were directly tied {{to the amount of}} work they produced. This policy was intended to encourage workers to toil and therefore increase production as much as possible. The piece-rate system led to the growth of bureaucracy and contributed to significant inefficiencies in Soviet industry. In addition, factory managers frequently <b>manipulated</b> <b>the</b> personal production quotas given to workers to prevent workers' wages from falling too low.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 305AD, Diocletian, as {{a result}} of a {{debilitating}} sickness taken in the winter of 304–305AD, announced his resignation. In a parallel ceremony in Milan, Maximian did the same. Lactantius states that Galerius <b>manipulated</b> <b>the</b> weakened Diocletian into resigning, and forced him to accept Galerius' allies in the imperial succession. According to Lactantius, the crowd listening to Diocletian's resignation speech believed, until the very last moment, that Diocletian would choose Constantine and Maxentius (Maximian's son) as his successors. It was not to be: Constantius and Galerius were promoted to Augusti, while Severus and Maximinus Daia, Galerius' nephew, were appointed their Caesars respectively. Constantine and Maxentius were ignored.|$|E

Though ViKY UP serves the aim of taking up {{the task of the}} assistant who is responsible for <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> uterus manipulator, the mechanism of the robot generates a cone-shaped workspace [13].

Darryl tells the others about this so that they will be careful what they say to Val. Nellie, Phyllis, and Kevin confront Val and try to convince her to take Darryl back, to no avail. However, when Kevin then tries to get a date with Val, she is so mortified at her apparent dating prospects that she decides to get back together with Darryl, much to his annoyance.|$|E
5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers <b>manipulated</b> <b>the</b> ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E
5|$|Australia batted {{much more}} productively {{in the second}} innings in ideal weather on the third day. Morris and Barnes put on 122 before the former fell for 62. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease for his last Test innings {{at the home of}} cricket. Yardley {{surrounded}} the Australian captain with fielders and Laker then beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was then introduced with the leg trap ploy again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads. The Australian captain decided to negate the danger of being caught glancing at short fine leg by padding the ball away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of Bradman's bat three times in a row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes then <b>manipulated</b> <b>the</b> strike to shield his captain from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap, and negated the danger Bedser was posing. Bradman accelerated after tea and took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty, with Barnes on 96 and Australia at 1/222.|$|E

5|$|In 1994 Tony Hall, {{the head}} of the BBC's News and Current Affairs, argued that the {{restrictions}} did not allow viewers to make a proper judgment about those subject to the rules, as the subtle changes to their voices could not be heard. In particular he cited the example of the appearance of Gerry Adams on the BBC's On the Record in September 1993, in which he spoke about the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland. Hall said Adams was nervous and defensive throughout the interview as the presenter, Sheena McDonald, argued that peace could not be achieved while the IRA continued its violent stance, but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of the discussion. He also said that some countries, such as India and Egypt, had quoted the restrictions to BBC journalists who complained about the over use of censorship by authorities in those countries. Additionally Hall argued that Sinn Féin and the IRA had <b>manipulated</b> <b>the</b> ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews.|$|E
5|$|In the foundry, Joule is able {{to analyze}} the {{prismatic}} core. She can make out voices coming from the core – including her father's – thus deducing {{that it is a}} transmission of sorts. Heading to Eden Tower to decrypt the core's transmission, she agrees to meet Kai there. Once reunited, they are ambushed by Victor. Kai stays behind to provide Joule the time to escape. She finds a lost crawler filled with parietal art indicating that Victor had <b>manipulated</b> <b>the</b> other corebots to attack the maintenance habitats. Corebot Duncan enters, lamenting the death of his human companion, and unites with Joule against Victor. Joule approaches Eden Tower to activate it, only to be faced with Victor and his minions. She learns that the ships, once orbiting Far Eden while waiting for its terraforming to complete, are long gone, having been destroyed by Victor. He throws Kai's prosthetic leg to the ground, proclaiming him dead. Finally, Joule bests Victor in combat and activates the terraforming system, materializing a hologram of her father from parts of memories hidden in the cores. In the end, it becomes clear that Kai survived his confrontation with Victor.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{recounts the}} events of the game and offers deeper {{insights}} into its story, explaining that Athena wanted Kratos to kill Ares and explaining how she <b>manipulated</b> <b>the</b> other gods, with the exception of Zeus, into aiding Kratos. After learning of Athena's plans, Zeus decides to aid Kratos (with magic and as the gravedigger) with the intention of Kratos becoming the new God of War after killing Ares. Poseidon is persuaded by Athena when she convinces him that Ares brought the Hydra into his domain. Artemis is persuaded because Ares and his minions are destroying her wilderness and its wildlife, and by aiding Kratos she will prevent future destruction. Athena manipulates Aphrodite into believing that Medusa is plotting against her. Hades, however, is omitted from the book, as Kratos does not meet him or gain his magic. Another omission from the book is the part where Kratos receives a new set of blades from Athena, and the Blades of Chaos is revealed to have been forged by Hephaestus in Tartarus.|$|E
