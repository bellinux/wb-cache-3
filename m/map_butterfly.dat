40|$|Thirty years ago, {{researchers}} {{discovered that}} flowers pollinated by butterflies are consistently rich in nectar amino acids, and more recent findings {{have shown that}} butterflies prefer nectar with high amino acid content. These observations led to speculation that amino acids in nectar enhance butterfly fitness and that butterflies have acted as agents of natural selection on nectar composition. Despite a number of experimental efforts over the years, convincing proof that nectar amino acids affect butterfly fitness has been lacking. Here, we provide the first evidence that amino acids in nectar {{have a positive effect}} on fecundity of one butterfly species, supporting the existence of a relationship between nectar preferences and fitness benefits. <b>Map</b> <b>butterflies</b> (Araschnia levana L.) raised under natural larval food conditions laid more eggs when they were fed nectar containing amino acids, whereas nectar amino acids had no effect on the number of eggs laid by butterflies raised on larval food rich in nitrogen. Uptake and utilization of nectar amino acids by <b>map</b> <b>butterflies</b> appear to be compensatory mechanisms enabling them to override impacts of poor larval food. These results provide strong support for the long-standing postulate that nectar amino acids benefit butterflies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{two main}} goals {{of this study}} are: (i) to examine the range shifts of a {{currently}} northwards expanding species, the <b>map</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Araschnia levana), in relation to annual variation in weather, and (ii) to test the capability of a bioclimatic envelope model, based on broad-scale European distribution data, to predict recent distributional changes (2000 – 2004) of the species in Finland. A significant relationship between annual maximum dispersal distance of the species and late summer temperature was detected. This suggests that the <b>map</b> <b>butterfly</b> has dispersed more actively in warmer rather than cooler summers, the most notable dispersal events being promoted by periods of excep-tionally warm weather and southerly winds. The accuracy of the broad-scale bioclimatic model built for the species with European data using Generalized Additive Models (GAM) was good based on split-sample evaluation for a single period. However, the model’s performance was poor when applied to predict range shifts in Finland. Among the many potential explanations for the poor success of the transferred bioclimatic model, is the fac...|$|E
40|$|The European <b>Map</b> <b>Butterfly,</b> Araschnia levana (Nymphalidae), {{represents}} a classical example of seasonal polymorphism, in which summer and spring generations differ strikingly in wing colour pattern. Although the physiological background {{to the formation}} of the two forms is well known, few studies have explored its possible ecological significance. Based on previous findings that both population number and body size tend to be larger in summer, we examined the hypothesis that the summer generation is more capable of long-distance dispersal. We re-analysed mark–recapture data on the butterfly using the multi-strata modelling design in the program MARK, compared biomechanical design traits of the spring- and summer-generation butterflies using canonical variate analysis, and tested for inter-generation differences in allometry relations of design traits to body size. The summer butterflies had shorter residence times and a higher probability of movements among capture sites than the spring butterflies, indicating greater mobility. Regarding the design traits, adults of summer-generation butterflies had a heavier thorax, lower abdomen to body mass ratio, larger wing area, less pointed wings and lower wing loading. The differences in design trait...|$|E

40|$|The European <b>map</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Araschnia levana) is {{a classic}} example of {{seasonal}} polyphenism because the spring and summer imagoes display two distinct morphological phenotypes. The light regime and temperature during larval and prepupal development determine whether or not the pupae commit to diapause and overwintering and thus whether spring or summer imagoes emerge. We used suppression subtractive hybridization to experimentally screen for genes that are differentially expressed in prepupae committed either to accelerated metamorphosis and egg production or diapause and overwintering. The range and ontology of the differentially expressed genes in prepupae developing from larvae exposed either to long-day (LD) or short-day (SD) conditions revealed fundamental differences. The SD prepupae preferentially expressed genes related to cuticle formation and immunity, reflecting the formation of a robust pupal exoskeleton and the upregulation of antimicrobial peptides as preparations for overwintering. One protein preferentially expressed in SD prepupae has a counterpart in Bombyx mori that functions as a diapause duration clock. The differentially expressed genes in LD prepupae included several members of the dusky and osiris families. We also observed the strong induction of different yellow-like genes under SD and LD conditions which suggest a role in the developmental choice between seasonal phenotypes. Our transcriptomic data will facilitate the more detailed analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying seasonal polyphenism...|$|E
40|$|The European <b>map</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Araschnia levana L.) is a {{striking}} example of seasonal plasticity. Individuals of the spring generation are reddish with a fritillary-like colour pattern, whereas the summer generation is black with a white dorsal stripe. Proximate factors explaining {{the development of the}} forms are well known, but ultimate explanations have not been tested experimentally yet. The reddish spring form is assumed to have a warning coloration, as found in other nymphalid butterflies that are unpalatable (Aglais urticae). We tested for differential predation by a visually hunting predator (Parus major) in a laboratory experiment using artificial butterflies designed to represent the spring and summer form. Birds were released individually in a flight cage where the alternative forms were presented. Summer forms were more frequently attacked than spring forms, which may point to some aversion against the reddish spring form. But there was also a strong effect of the interaction between seasonal form and type of substrate. Spring forms were much better protected from attacks on the brown substrate of dead leaves compared to the green substrate of nettle leaves. On the latter substrate, latency times before attacking spring forms were on average 2. 5 times longer than for summer forms. Experiments with artificial butterflies simplify complex predator-prey interactions because they exclude potential taste or odour effects and they also exclude behavioural responses and interactions of the butterfly. However, our results based on static visual signals provide a promising first step to test the functional significance of this striking seasonal polyphenism...|$|E
40|$|Butterflies {{for the new}} millennium: <b>mapping</b> <b>butterfly</b> {{distributions}} in Britain (Lepidoptera) Butterflies for the New Millennium is {{the largest}} and most comprehensive survey of butterfly distribution ever undertaken in Britain and Ireland. The number of contributing recorders, the coverage achieved and the number and quality of distribution records generated far exceed those available for any other invertebrate taxon. The data thus provide a unique insight into the effects of habitat degradation and climate change on a high profile insect group. The results of {{the first five years of}} the survey (1995 - 1999) have been analysed to assess broad-scale distribution changes over the past two decades and the past two centuries. In both time periods, the British distributions of most butterfly species have shown substantial change. The trends affecting habitat specialist and habitat generalist (wider countryside) species differ significantly. The distributions of half of the habitat generalists have increased (consistent with an expected positive response to observed climate change), whereas most habitat specialists declined (consistent with habitat degradation). The opposing forces of climate change and habitat degradation are thought to be the main driving forces. The decline of specialist species indicates a reduction in overall biodiversity, whilst mobile and widespread generalists increasingly dominate biological communities. These patterns of change are thought to be representative of many other invertebrate groups in Britain and demonstrate the use of butterflies as indicators of environmental change...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{colorful}} wing {{patterns of}} butterflies, {{a prime example}} of biodiversity, can change dramatically within closely related species. Wing pattern diversity is specifically present among papilionid butterflies. Whether a correlation between color and the evolution of these butterflies exists so far remained unsolved. Results: We here investigate the Cattlehearts, Parides, a small Neotropical genus of papilionid butterflies with 36 members, the wings of which are marked by distinctly colored patches. By applying various physical techniques, we investigate the coloration toolkit of the wing scales. The wing scales contain two different, wavelength-selective absorbing pigments, causing pigmentary colorations. Scale ridges with multilayered lamellae, lumen multilayers or gyroid photonic crystals in the scale lumen create structural colors that are variously combined with these pigmentary colors. Conclusions: The pigmentary and structural traits strongly correlate with the taxonomical distribution of Parides species. The experimental findings add crucial insight into the evolution of butterfly wing scales and show the importance of morphological parameter <b>mapping</b> for <b>butterfly</b> phylogenetics...|$|R

The number of hot spots decreased considerably and the present-day hot spots are almost exclusively in the northeast of Flanders. Species with low dispersal capacities and species from oligotrophic habitats decreased significantly more than mobile species or species from eutrophic habitats.

40|$|Biogeography {{and ecology}} of {{southern}} Portuguese butterflies and burnets (Lepidoptera) During several {{visits to the}} western part of the Algarve (southern Portugal), the author <b>mapped</b> the <b>butterflies</b> and burnets of this region. In total, I observed 58 butterfly species (51 Papilionoidea, 7 Hesperiidae) and 6 Zygaenidae during my observations in spring and summer. More than 80 % of the species are Palaearctic faunal elements, three species are considered Holarctic, three are Nearctic and four are Palaeotropic. Around 75 % of the Palaearctic species are Mediterranean faunal elements. Within the Palaearctic group, the 23 species belonging uniquely to the Atlanto- Mediterranean faunal type are by far the largest group. Siberian elements are lacking. Thus, the observed species composition is characteristic for the Atlanto-Mediterranean region. Some of the observed species can be found all over the study area, often in a variety of habitats. Other species are more or less geographically restricted. Their regional distribution patterns depend on geomorphological and ecological constraints. Several species are restricted to the limestone areas, others are limited to the acid schist and granite areas. Several species were only observed in the western coastal dunes. Some species occur exclusively in the mountain areas. Some species were not recorded along the windy western and south-western coastal areas. Several species become rare or even disappear in suitable habitats that show little diversity of the vegetation. The occurrence of many species is directly linked to one or few distinct types of vegetation like cork oak forests, deciduous forests and natural hedges along water courses, Cistus macchias, garigues on limestone, dry grasslands or hot rocky places with little vegetation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview {{on the distribution of}} recently discovered Scarce Large Blue (Phengaris (Maculinea) teleius) in northern Serbia (Selevenj Sands, Ludaš Lake and Subotica Sands). <b>Mapping</b> of the <b>butterfly</b> and its habitat has shown that most of the suitable habitats are limited to protected areas where {{at least some of the}} wet meadows with Sanguisorba officinalis host plant are suitably managed and regularly mown. Given the known maximum dispersal distances of P. teleius, the suitable habitat patches possibly support two separate meta-populations. Fragmentation and isolation of remaining colonies represent the main threats to long term survival of the species in Serbia. Based on IUCN criteria for regional red lists, the species qualifies as Endangered (EN) in Serbia and requires immediate conservation actions.

Both taxa have been ecologically well characterized and exploited to address a broad spectrum of evolutionary issues. Using AFLP markers, we constructed the first linkage <b>map</b> of Colias <b>butterflies.</b> The <b>map</b> is composed of 452 markers spanning 2541. 7 cM distributed over 51 linkage groups (40 major groups and 11 small groups with 2 – 4 markers).

This nonrandom marker distribution can account for the nonequivalence between the number of linkage groups and the actual haploid chromosome number (N = 31).
