40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} the {{establishment}} of <b>supervisory</b> <b>function</b> in China's deposit insurance is an urgent task of the country's financial regulators and it becomes an indispensable component in a sound financial supervisory system. An important supplement to the banking regulatory system and aiming to protect depositors against financial losses caused by bankruptcy of financial institutions through a risk compensation mechanism, the implementation of <b>supervisory</b> <b>function</b> in deposit insurance helps to fulfill supervisory goals in the banking industry. Meanwhile, we argue that the supervisory responsibilities of the prospective deposit insurance agency in China are to some extent {{different from those of}} the existing banking regulatory institution, and therefore will not cause overlap in regulation or overuse of regulatory resources.

In problem state, a large set of general purpose non-privileged instructions are available to a user program. In supervisor state, system programs are additionally able to use a small set of privileged instructions which are generally intended for <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions.</b> These functions may affect other users, other processors, or the entire computer system. A program is only allowed to access specific <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> after thorough authorization checking by the operating system: DEBCHK (SVC 117), TESTAUTH (SVC 119), and possibly additional tests. Programs which fail any of these tests are ABENDed, that is abnormally terminated and immediately cease processing.

40|$|Abstract The world {{all over}} {{is of the}} opinion that quality and {{functional}} education are pre-requisite for the attainment of a country’s development economically and technologically. Monumental studies and achieve- ments in various spheres of life by developed and developing Nations of the world are often attributed to products of high standards of education. The efficacy and efficiency of educational system lies in its ability to deliver quality education in cost-effective ways. For such educational system to stand tall in attaining these goals, re-invigorated or repositioned administrative and <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> in all our educational systems in general and vocational technical education in particular must be put in place. e-activity with all of its components have the potentials of bringing these experiences to bare in vocational technical education.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether principals, department chairpersons, and teachers felt the <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> generally associated with the department chairperson’s role, should be considered more important than what they were considered to be at the time of the investigation. [...] The study was a cross-sectional description of the perceptions held by a random sample of secondary school teachers and the entire population of secondary school department chairpersons and their principals. Two hundred and twenty-two teachers, two hundred and twenty-two department chairpersons, and sixty-five principals were sent a questionnaire. The instrument, developed for this study, measured each reference group’s perception of the amount of importance presently placed on the 15 <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions,</b> and their perception as to the amount of importance which each group felt should be placed on the 15 functions. The statistical procedure used to test the hypotheses was the t-test. [...] The major finding of this study was that principals, department chairpersons and teachers all felt that more importance should be placed on each of the <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> examined. Functions which each of the three reference groups felt should be considered important functions of the department chairperson’s role included: improving student evaluation procedures, evaluating and changing the department's instructional program, developing the department’s goals and objectives, orienting new teachers, coordinating the work of department teachers, assessing the need for teacher inservice, and keeping department members informed. [...] The <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> of coordinating the use of resource people, reporting department activities, orienting substitutes, conducting demonstration teaching, and coordinating the department's program with other school departments, were considered, by all three reference groups, to be somewhat important functions of the department chairperson's role. Informally observing teachers was a function which all three reference groups felt should be considered more important, but principals, department chairpersons and teachers were reluctant to suggest that this function should even be considered a somewhat important function of the department chairperson’s role. [...] The major finding suggests the need for school boards and school administrators to examine the functions presently performed by department chairpersons, and to then define or redefine the minimum parameters of the department chairperson position. School boards and school administrators should also structure the department chairperson position in such a way that department chairpersons are given the authority and time needed to perform these functions. The development of an on-going evaluation procedure for the department chairperson position would better ensure effective use of this position...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of maintaining the banking <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> at the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB). First, these pros and cons are identified and listed using the economic literature, after a brief analysis of the ongoing debate and international experience regarding monetary policy, independence of the central bank and banking supervision. Then it is discussed the international tendencies as related to central bank reforms and the respective supervisory systems, including an annex panel of the experience of 40 different countries. The first and clearest tendency identified is to withdraw <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> from the monetary authorities, normally seen as capable of strengthening the "central bank independence". The second trend - and one that seems to be gaining strength - is merger of the agencies charged with banking, securities and insurance supervision into a single agency, enhancing their capacity to perform the financial groups' consolidated supervision. There is no firm conclusion as the more effective institutional arrangement related to banking supervision under the control of the central bank or another institution. ...|$|R
