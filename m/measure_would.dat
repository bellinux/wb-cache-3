5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E
5|$|Upon taking power, Lenin's regime {{issued a}} series of decrees. The first was a Decree on Land, which {{declared}} that the landed estates of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments. This contrasted with Lenin's desire for agricultural collectivisation but provided governmental recognition of the widespread peasant land seizures that had already occurred. In November 1917, the government issued the Decree on the Press that closed many opposition media outlets deemed counter-revolutionary. They claimed the <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> be temporary; the decree was widely criticised, including by many Bolsheviks, for compromising freedom of the press.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, {{a decree}} in Paris allowed cyclists {{in that city}} to turn right or, {{if there is no}} street to the right, proceed {{straight}} ahead on red, under the condition that they “exercise caution” and yield to pedestrians, after road safety experts deemed the <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> reduce collisions. During the summer of 2015, Paris law was modified to allow cyclists to treat certain stop lights as yield signs as allowed by signage. The change only applied to right turns or going straight at a T-junction.|$|E
25|$|After {{the passage}} of Measure 47, {{as part of the}} ongoing anti-tax {{movement}} in Oregon, there was some confusion as to how the <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> be interpreted by the courts. One interpretation had the ballot measure reducing property tax revenues by $458 million in the fiscal year 1997–1998, while another interpretation, provided by the Oregon Attorney General, had it providing a reduction of only $270 million. Much of this disagreement had to do with what limitations Measure 47 would place on increases in the assessment of a property's value.|$|E
25|$|The manager could, if he wished, {{attempt to}} start a rival bank, {{but he could not}} legally claim {{to be part of the}} Medici Bank, since a right to use that trademarked name came with the partnership.

However, even before the shares' profits were paid out, any sums invested in the branch outside of an ownership of shares were repaid at a set interest rate, sometimes leading to one branch paying another for the latter's investment in the former.|$|E

Editorials in newspapers such as the San Francisco Chronicle and Los Angeles Times criticized the measure, saying that the lack of such information would hamper legitimate medical and scientific purposes. The voters did not pass the measure.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} by Fitch, a credit-rating agency, determined {{that as many}} as four of Atlantic City's eight casinos would be bankrupted by expanding casino gambling outside the city. Supporters of gambling in North Jersey say that the <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> help Atlantic City by redirecting as much as $200 million a year in tax revenue to the city. Opponents say that it is unlikely that much revenue would be generated and that it would not make up for the losses due to new competition. In recent years four Atlantic City casinos have closed, causing severe economic problems.|$|E
25|$|A one-state {{solution}} is generally endorsed by Israeli Arabs. Many are becoming nervous that {{a two-state solution}} would result in official pressures for them {{to move into a}} Palestinian state in the West Bank and/or Gaza Strip and so lose their homes and access to their communities, businesses and cities inside Israel. Some Israeli government spokespeople have also proposed that Palestinian-majority areas of Israel, such as the area around Umm el-Fahm, be annexed to the new Palestinian state. As this <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> cut these areas off permanently from the rest of Israel's territory, including the coastal cities and other Palestinian towns and villages, Palestinians view this with alarm. Many Palestinian citizens of Israel would therefore prefer a one-state solution because this would allow them to sustain their Israeli citizenship.|$|E

25|$|On February 17, 2017, California State Senator Jerry Hill {{introduced}} SB 797, {{which would}} permit the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board {{to submit a}} regional measure for sales tax increase of th of one cent to the voters in the three counties served by Caltrain. The regional <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> require a two-thirds majority (aggregated among the three counties) to pass, and would provide Caltrain with a dedicated revenue source estimated at $100million per year. For comparison, in fiscal year 2016 (ending June 30, 2016), the operating expenses for Caltrain were $118million, and farebox revenues were $87million, leaving approximately $31million in expenses to be funded by the PCJPB through its member agencies and county government contributions. SB 797 passed the California State Senate in May, and the State Assembly in September, and Governor Brown signed the bill into law in October.|$|E
25|$|Peter Townsend {{transformed}} {{the conception of}} poverty, viewing it not simply as lack of income but as {{the configuration of the}} economic conditions that prevent people from being full members of the society (Townsend, 1979; Ferragina et al. 2016). Poverty reduces the ability of people to participate in society, effectively denying them full citizenship (as suggested by T.H. Marshall). Given that there are no universal principles by which to determine the minimum threshold of participation equating to full membership of society, Townsend argued that the appropriate <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> necessarily be relative to any particular cultural context. He suggested that in each society there should be an empirically determinable 'breakpoint' within the income distribution below which participation of individuals collapses, providing a scientific basis for fixing a poverty line and determining the extent of poverty (Ferragina et al. 2016).|$|E
25|$|People began petitioning the King {{for relief}} against unfair judgments, {{and as the}} number of petitioners rapidly grew, so the King {{delegated}} the task of hearing petitions to the Lord Chancellor. As the early Chancellors lacked formal legal training and showed little regard for precedent, their decisions were often widely diverse. In 1529, a lawyer, Sir Thomas More, was appointed as Chancellor, marking {{the beginning of a new}} era. After this time, all future Chancellors were lawyers. Beginning around 1557, records of proceedings in the Courts of Chancery were kept and several equitable doctrines developed. Criticisms continued, the most famous being 17th-century jurist John Selden's aphorism:Equity is a roguish thing: for law we have a measure, know what to trust to; equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a foot, a Chancellor's foot; what an uncertain <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> this be? One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot: 'tis the same thing in a Chancellor's conscience.|$|E

25|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} held on 7 June, the AKP gained 40.87% of the vote and 258 seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi, TBMM). Though it still remains the biggest party in Turkey, the AKP lost its status as the majority party {{and the power to}} form a single-party government. Until then it had held this majority without interruption for 13 years since it had come to power in 2002. Also, in this election, the AKP was pushing to gain 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly so that it could put a series of constitutional changes to a referendum, one of them was to switch Turkey from the current parliamentary government to an American-style executive presidency government. This pursuit met with a series of oppositions and criticism from the opposition parties and their supporters, fearing the <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> give more unchecked power to the current President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has been drawing fierce criticisms both from home and abroad for his active role in the election, abandoning the traditional presidential role of maintaining a more neutral and impartial position in elections by his predecessors in the office. The result of the Kurdish issues-centred Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey), HDP, breaking through the 10% threshold to achieve 13.12% out of the total votes cast and gaining 80 seats in the Grand National Assembly in this election successfully derailed the AKP from maintaining its hold of power as the majority party and a single-party government as well as enacting a referendum necessary to change the constitution. The AKP is now forced to form a coalition government in negotiation with other parties.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{foremost}} issues in the Democratic primary concerned school funding. [...] In April 1990, the legislature passed LB1059, which made major changes to the financing of public education in the state. [...] Prior to its passage, roughly 70% of the money for primary and secondary schools came from property taxes and other local sources. [...] The expressed goal of the bill's supporters was to increase the state's contribution to school districts from 25% of operational costs to 45%; this would be funded through a 25% increase in the sales tax and a 17.5% increase in the personal income tax. [...] Proponents maintained that the <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> lessen inequality among school districts and would avert {{a significant increase in}} property taxes; they also noted that courts in several other states had struck down locally-financed educational systems such as Nebraska's. [...] Opponents argued that the increased taxes would prove burdensome to Nebraskans, particularly the poor, and expressed doubt that the <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> prevent substantial property-tax increases. [...] The bill passed; Orr vetoed it, but was overridden.|$|E
500|$|In May 1864, Major General [...] Ulysses S.

To man defenses around the capital in their place, and to relieve regiments at various northern fortifications, Lincoln issued a call for 500,000 troops to serve a brief term of 100 days. This <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> allow enough time to raise longer-term regiments to occupy rearward defenses.
