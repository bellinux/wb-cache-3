40|$|This paper {{presents}} a configurable architecture for Network-on-Chip (NoC) router <b>macrocells,</b> and a methodology to streamline their design and configuration. The methodology addresses the typical problems experienced by design and verification engineers when coding highly configurable intellectual property <b>macrocells</b> at Register Transfer Level (RTL) {{with hundreds of}} parameters and thousands of resulting configurations. A NoC infrastructure for a Multi Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) may require tens or hundreds of router <b>macrocells.</b> Therefore, managing the configuration design space is becoming a bottleneck for the design and verification of many-core processing systems. The proposed generation flow is illustrated on a real-world NoC router core. Its configurable architecture is compliant with several NoC topologies such as Ring, Octagon, Spidergon and 2 D mesh typically used in many-core processing platforms. The generation flow allows for {{a reduction in the}} database code size, up to 70 % in our experiments, and a contraction of three orders of magnitudes of the verification space vs. conventional design flows of RTL <b>macrocells.</b> The validity of the approach is also confirmed by synthesizing the generated router <b>macrocells</b> in nanoscale CMOS technology.

In this paper a new distributive timing synchronization scheme for heterogenous networks is proposed that employs the timing information available at user equipments (UEs) to achieve synchronization between noninteracting femtocells and <b>macrocells.</b> Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the clock bias between <b>macrocells</b> and femtocells without introducing any significant overhead.

40|$|Abstract?The {{performance}} {{in terms of}} signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), teletraffic, and spectral efficiency of a combined macrocellular and microcellular network is investigated when either both types of cells share the same channel set, or when the channel set is partitioned between the <b>macrocells</b> and the microcells. The analysis is for time-division multiple access (TDMA) with frequency hopping, power control, and discontinuous transmission, and the radio channel is composed of an inverse fourth-power path loss law with log-normal fading. We commence by introducing a single microcell into a hexagonal cluster of <b>macrocells</b> before considering clustered microcells. Both omni-directional and sectorized cells are examined. We find that high reuse factors are required when channel sharing is employed. When channel partitioning is used, no co-channel interference occurs between the microcells and the <b>macrocells</b> allowing them to be planned independently. The reuse factors in the microcells and <b>macrocells</b> therefore {{do not need to}} be increased beyond conventional values. The outcome is that by opting for channel partitioning, the improvement in spectral efficiency compared to channel sharing is two to three times greater.

5000|$|A {{good example}} is the {{comments}} made by Gordon Mansfield, Executive Director of RAN Delivery, AT&T, speaking at the Femtozone at CTIA March 2010:"We have deployed femtocells co-carrier with both the hopping channels for GSM <b>macrocells</b> and with UMTS <b>macrocells.</b> Interference isn’t a problem. We have tested femtocells extensively in real customer deployments of many thousands of femtocells, and {{we find that the}} mitigation techniques implemented successfully minimise and avoid interference. The more femtocells you deploy, the more uplink interference is reduced." ...|$|R
40|$|Femtocell is envisioned as {{a highly}} {{promising}} solution for indoor wireless communications. The spectrum allocated to femtocells is traditionally from the same licensed spectrum bands of <b>macrocells.</b> The capacity of femtocell networks is highly limited due to finite number of licensed spectrum bands and the interference with <b>macrocells</b> and other femtocells. A radically new communication paradigm is proposed by incorporating cognitive radio in femtocell networks. The cognitive radio enabled femtocells are able to access spectrum bands not only from <b>macrocells</b> but also from other licensed systems (e. g. TV), provided the interference from femtocells to the existing systems is not harmful. It results in more channel opportunities. Thus, the co-channel interference can be greatly reduced and the network capacity can be significantly improved. Further, detection performance can be improved by decreasing the collision probability {{with the help of}} double threshold energy detection...|$|R
50|$|A <b>macrocell</b> array is an {{approach}} to the design and manufacture of ASICs. Essentially, {{it is a small}} step up from the otherwise similar gate array, but rather than being a prefabricated array of simple logic gates, the <b>macrocell</b> array is a prefabricated array of higher-level logic functions such as flip-flops, ALU functions, registers, and the like. These logic functions are simply placed at regular predefined positions and manufactured on a wafer, usually called master slice. Creation of a circuit with a specified function is accomplished by adding metal interconnects to the chips on the master slice late in the manufacturing process, allowing the function of the chip to be customised as desired.|$|E
5000|$|The GAL22V10 has 12 input pins, and 10 pins {{that can}} be {{configured}} as either inputs or outputs, and exists in various switching speeds, from 25 to 4 ns. Each output is driven by an output-logic <b>macrocell,</b> with an output-enable product term, and a variable number of product terms, ranging from eight to sixteen. Each OLMC may be set to output as inverting or non-inverting, and be placed into either registered or combinatorial mode. In registered mode, each <b>macrocell</b> actively uses a D-flip-flop to hold a state under control of the data input from the logic portion of the <b>macrocell</b> and the rising edge of the clock signal, while in combinatorial mode the flip-flop {{is removed from the}} <b>macrocell</b> and the outputs are driven directly by the logic. In the latter mode, the pin may also dynamically switch between input and output based on the product term. In either mode the pin value is fed back into the array as a product term. Combinations are set using an E2PROM. [...] The output registers can be preloaded into a potentially invalid state for testing by a GAL22V10 programmer. Inputs and outputs include active pull-ups and are transistor-transistor logic compatible due to high-impedance buffers.A user electronic signature section is included for details such as user ID codes, revision IDs, or asset tagging on official Lattice Semiconductor units, as well as a static ES section for compatibility with non-Lattice Semiconductor GAL22V10 units. In addition, a security cell is included which, when set, disallows the retrieval of the array logic from the chip, until a new set of logic is set.|$|E

The <b>macrocells</b> behave as the leaders and the femtocells are followers during the learning procedure.
