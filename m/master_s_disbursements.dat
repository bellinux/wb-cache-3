It argued that a <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> degree in industrial design would help graduates specialize in the related field and improve their skills. Therefore, this study consists of fundamental components about <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> studies in industrial design in turkey such as, existing circumstances of <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> degree, defining its problems and requirements, and resolution advisories to education. Seven universities offer a <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> degree in the field of industrial design in Turkey. In the study, comparative analysis of these programs is conducted on their current education system and two survey studies are realized among the academics of these universities, to examine their opinions. In the field study, the increase number of department facilities was underlined as one of the positive developments whereas problems concerning the academic staff of <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> programs came into prominence as the most important weaknesses. In addition, the required improvements of YOK criteria for the discipline were also found a critical situation for the future of programs.

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} provide {{an explanation for the}} firm 2 ̆ 7 s choice of using either a dividend or a stock repurchase for distributing cash to its stockholders. It also provides an examination {{of the impact of the}} firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disbursement</b> decision on the stock market 2 ̆ 7 s resulting reassessment of the value of the firm. Before analyzing the disbursement decision, I examine the stock market effects of dividends and stock repurchases using an event study methodology that corrects for the possible variance change effects of cash distribution announcements. I find that the measured wealth effects are statistically significant and similar, for the most part, to that reported in earlier studies, notwithstanding increases in the variance of the abnormal returns distribution. I apply LIMDEP 2 ̆ 7 s full information maximum likelihood estimator (FIML) to investigate the factors influencing a firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disbursement</b> decision. I use proxies to represent the major theories put forward in the literature to explain firms 2 ̆ 7 rationales for making cash disbursements, namely, signaling / asymmetric information, undervaluation hypothesis, agency theory, dividend clientele, corporate control, optimal capital structure theory, managerial incentives hypothesis, financial flexibility and cash flow permanence. I find that the firm 2 ̆ 7 s payout choice is related to the change in annual earnings per share, the residual volatility in daily stock returns prior to the distribution, the level of undervaluation, the free cash flows of the firm, the size of the firm, the extent of available managerial stock options, the average dividend yield, the volatility of operating earnings, the average daily stock return prior to announcement, the relative proportion of permanent cash flows, and the difference in the levels of permanent cash flows pre and post announcement. I evaluate the stock market impact of the disbursement choice by using a self-selectivity limited-dependent variables model. The findings indicate that while open market repurchasing firms make optimal disbursement choices, that is reflected in the reaction of the stock market to the disbursement announcement, firms using repurchase tender offers make disbursement decisions detrimental to the welfare of their stockholders. However, similar results were inconclusive with regard to firms choosing to utilize dividends as their cash payout mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of innovative entrepreneurship for {{sustained economic growth}} is increasing (IMF, 2017). This is the fundamental motivation for this thesis, in which a study on team maturity, innovation capability, and firm performance in Norwegian entrepreneurships has been performed. The study has contributed with new insight in this area, as well as identifying several interesting elements for further research. Two research questions have guided the study: RQ 1 : Is there an effect on firm performance from team maturity and innovation capability in entrepreneurships? And RQ 2 : Is there an effect from University <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> programs in entrepreneurship on team maturity, innovation capability and/or firm performance in entrepreneurships? In sum, {{it was found that}} high team maturity in entrepreneurial teams leads to high innovation capability for the entrepreneurship. There was found a more varied degree of support for that high innovation capability leads to high firm performance in entrepreneurships, and that high team maturity leads to high firm performance moderated by innovation capability in entrepreneurships. A positive relationship was found via some methods, however the findings were not consistent across other methods. Further investigation of these relationships in other studies is therefore recommended before any final conclusions can be drawn. Especially, the understanding of firm performance in entrepreneurships should be studied further. As for RQ 2, this study has consistently not found any positive effect on team maturity, innovation capability, or firm performance from the affiliation to a University <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> program for entrepreneurship. It was also found that the entrepreneurships with an affiliation to a University <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> program for entrepreneurship were less inclined to use the team as an arena for innovation than the entrepreneurships without such an affiliation. It is recommended that further research look into these relationships to strengthen the understanding of the causes for these findings...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{calibration}} {{of pressure}} sensors is challenging. Often, steady-state calibration is applied on pressure sensors {{used to measure}} dynamical measurements. Steady-state calibration does not represent the dynamic behavior of a sensor. With dynamical calibration {{the quality of a}} dynamical measurement increases. This is the motivation for my <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis, written at the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU in spring 2017. The <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis investigates methods for performing dynamic calibration. The best method {{is believed to be the}} use of an aperiodic pressure generator, because of its large range of frequencies and pressures, and in addition, the low cost and simple construction. The dynamic calibration method developed in this <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis is based on a step-response method with use of ultra-fast diaphragm valves with response time less than 5 ms. The target was to build a functional dynamic calibration system, and by use of the system, find the natural frequency of the calibrated sensor. By finding the natural frequency of the calibrated sensor, it is possible to find the uncertainty in dynamic measurements, and therefore increase the quality of the measurements. To generate a perfect working dynamic calibration system was proven to be difficult. The first problem arose when it was realized that the machining of the calibration system was not done according to the drawings. These inaccuracies resulted in air pockets in the system that was impossible to deflate, and as a consequence, signal noise was observed in the pressure step. The second problem was the behavior of the diaphragm valves. When the valve opened, the open-valve position was not fixed, and the diaphragm piston started to oscillate. This led to slow fluctuations prior to the final state after the step. The slow fluctuations worked as a low pass filter and delayed the entire system. This caused a slow rise time of the step generated. The closing position of the valves was fixed, and here the slow fluctuations did not occur, and the rise time improved. The calibration system does still not work in a perfect manner, but has a range of application. An almost suitable step was generated, and with use of Fast Fourier Transform it could be indicated that the highest natural frequency achieved by the system was 2246 Hz. By knowing this frequency and with use of a reference sensor it can be determined if a calibrated sensor does not need an extra uncertainty term. The dynamic calibration system developed could also be used to verify if a dynamic pressure sensor and amplifier behave in a correct manner. However, these methods need further investigation by experiments. Further work has also been an important part of this <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis...|$|R

40|$|This <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis {{covers the}} design of a {{post-tensioned}} concrete bridge in Trondheim municipality in Norway, in collaboration with Statens vegvesen (SVV). The concept of the bridge is inspired by Egg-Graben-Brücke in Austria, which was designed and built without steel reinforcement in the bridge deck. The total length of the bridge is 73 meters and it is divided into 3 spans. The cross-section of the bridge is assumed as a massive T-beam/slab with flanges. The width of the cross-section with edge beams is 9, 5 meters and the height is 1, 3 meters. The bridge is planned to be built in 4 stages and a proposed building process is presented. The bridge is post-tensioned in longitudinal and transverse direction. Due to the high maintenance costs of bridges, the bridge is designed to use as little steel reinforcement as possible to enhance the durability. The number of prestressing tendons have been determined. The design is according to established standards such as Eurocodes, and Handbook N 400 by Statens vegvesen. Analytical models have been created in the program NovaFrame for longitudinal direction and some parts in the program Scia Engineer for transverse direction. The <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis contains analyses for ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state for critical sections. The capacities and requirements are sufficient in the controlled sections for both limit states...|$|R
