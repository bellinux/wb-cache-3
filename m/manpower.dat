5|$|A further {{complication}} is that {{a certain}} proportion of the Allied <b>manpower</b> was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men. Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of <b>manpower</b> which could not have contributed to Plataea, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, the {{government}} attempted {{to solve the}} <b>manpower</b> shortage problem by instituting obligatory military service. Men of eighteen to forty years of age were to be conscripted for two years. Opposition to conscription and to the campaigns against guerrilla groups resulted in widespread evasion of military service. As a result, during the late 1980s {{the government}} normally met <b>manpower</b> requirements by impressing men into military service.|$|E
5|$|NOTE: <b>Manpower</b> figures exclude {{officers}} (centurions and decurions), {{which would}} have numbered about 3,500 men overall.|$|E
5|$|To prepare {{these forces}} the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command) {{increased}} the call-up age range and recruited from Eastern European countries controlled by German forces, increasing <b>manpower</b> on the Western Front from roughly 400,000 {{to just over}} 1 million soldiers. Hastily organized into new divisions, these infantrymen lacked training and sometimes even weapons. Despite an immense German effort {{in the face of}} intense Allied bombing to build the necessary stocks for the offensive, there were shortages of fuel, ammunition, weapons and <b>manpower</b> by the scheduled date of the counterattack. Even the elite Waffen-SS divisions were often deficient in <b>manpower.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{nationalisation}} after World War II the National Coal Board spent £500,000 on modernising the mine's {{infrastructure to}} give it the capability for annual production of 315,000tons, however <b>manpower</b> shortages and geological problems caused the pit to close in 1966.|$|E
5|$|As <b>manpower</b> {{shortages}} on the Western Front {{began to}} become acute, a second plebiscite {{was held on}} 20 December 1917. This time it was defeated by an even greater margin of 94,152 votes. This effectively {{put an end to}} plans to expand the AIF in France and ultimately led to severe <b>manpower</b> shortages that the AIF in France experienced in 1917 and 1918. As a result, plans to expand the force to a 6th Division were shelved and its <b>manpower</b> distributed amongst the other five divisions, while the five divisions were amalgamated together under the banner of the Australian Corps, thus effectively allowing the 4th Division, which was struggling to maintain its numbers to act as a depot formation within the Corps with the other three divisions providing most of the combat power.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{causing the}} {{destruction}} of lands, foods and belongings, fire {{could also be used}} to divert <b>manpower.</b> 13th century Mongol armies regularly sent out small detachments from their main forces to start grass fires and fire settlements as diversions.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, the Manhattan Project {{employed}} some 129,000 workers, of whom 84,500 were construction workers, 40,500 were plant {{operators and}} 1,800 were military personnel. As construction activity fell off, the workforce declined to 100,000 a year later, {{but the number}} of military personnel increased to 5,600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult. In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the War <b>Manpower</b> Commission. In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War <b>Manpower</b> Commission gave the project their highest priority.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1944, {{in order}} to rectify a {{shortage}} of labour in the primary production sector of the New Zealand economy, the New Zealand Government, {{in consultation with the}} United States and the United Kingdom, decided that it was necessary to release <b>manpower</b> from the military back into the civilian workforce. After some debate, it was decided that this <b>manpower</b> would come from the 3rd Division, while the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was fighting in Italy, would be allowed to remain intact.|$|E
5|$|The {{garrison}} constituted {{roughly a}} tenth of the total French Union <b>manpower</b> in Indochina. The defeat seriously weakened the position and prestige of the French as previously planned negotiations over the future of Indochina began.|$|E
5|$|Toward this end, in {{the early}} November 1798, Jourdan arrived in Hüningen, near the Swiss city of Basel, to take command of the Army of Observation, {{so-called}} because its function was to observe {{the security of the}} French border on the Rhine. Once there, Jourdan assessed the quality and disposition of the forces and identified needed supplies and <b>manpower.</b> He found the army woefully inadequate for its assignment. The Army, and its flanking armies, the Army of Helvetia (Switzerland) and the Army of Mayence, were equally short of <b>manpower,</b> supplies, ammunition, and training. Jourdan documented assiduously these shortages, pointing out in lengthy correspondence to the Directory the consequences of an under-manned and under-supplied army; his petitions seemed to have little effect on the Directory, which sent neither significant additional <b>manpower</b> nor supplies.|$|E
5|$|While these {{operations}} succeeded, {{the cost in}} terms of <b>manpower</b> and resources was high. By {{the end of the}} year the military experienced shortages as a result of decreased American aid, while communist forces continued gaining strength.|$|E
5|$|A limited {{operation}} {{was supported by}} Egyptian armed forces Chief of Staff Saad El Shazly. He argued that Israel has two fatal weaknesses. The first of which is inability to sustain high human casualties due to limited available <b>manpower.</b> The second is inability to sustain a prolonged war for it mobilizes around 18% of the Jewish population. A prolonged limited defensive war can best capitalize both weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|A {{replacement}} for Melbourne was under consideration {{as early as}} 1956, and the question was revisited on several occasions until the 1980s. In every situation, a new aircraft carrier was turned down due to the increases in <b>manpower</b> and operating costs required to operate the ship when compared to Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|After the North Korean {{infiltration}} on September 7 was repelled, the North Korean {{attack on}} Haman {{ground to a}} halt. The North Koreans, racked by logistical and <b>manpower</b> shortages, focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of <b>manpower</b> led to a {{shortage}} of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of <b>manpower</b> and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E
5|$|As in the First World War, white Rhodesians {{volunteered for}} the forces readily and in large numbers. Over 2,700 had come forward before the war was three weeks old. Somewhat ironically, the Southern Rhodesian recruiters' main problem was not {{sourcing}} <b>manpower</b> but rather persuading men in strategically important occupations such as mining to stay home. <b>Manpower</b> controls were introduced to keep certain men in their civilian jobs. The SRAF accepted 500 recruits {{in the days following}} the outbreak of war, prompting its commander Group Captain CW Meredith to contact the Air Ministry in London with an offer to run a flying school and train three squadrons. This was accepted. In January 1940 the Southern Rhodesian government announced the establishment of an independent Air Ministry to oversee the Rhodesian Air Training Group, Southern Rhodesia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS).|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the invasion, the <b>manpower</b> of the Soviet {{military}} force that had been mobilized was 5.3–5.5 million, and it was still increasing as the Soviet reserve force of 14 million, with at least basic military training, continued to mobilize. The Red Army was dispersed and still preparing when the invasion commenced. Their units were often separated and lacked adequate transportation.|$|E
5|$|At {{various times}} during the program, NASA {{managers}} and personnel found themselves limited in terms of resources and <b>manpower,</b> particularly as Phase Two geared up, and {{had a hard time}} getting anywhere with NASA administration. One particular area of contention was with crew assignments to missions. Many astronauts allege that the method of selection prevented the most skilled people from performing roles they were best-suited for.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, {{the number}} of front line {{infantry}} within the British Army in France had decreased, leading to a <b>manpower</b> crisis. In an attempt to consolidate <b>manpower</b> and to increase {{the number of}} machine guns and artillery support available to the infantry, the number of battalions in a division was cut from twelve to nine. This had the effect of reducing the establishment of a division from 18,825 men to 16,035. In addition, to ease reinforcement, an attempt was made to consolidate as many battalions from the same regiment within the same brigade. These changes impacted the division, resulting in the 15th RWF, 11th SWB and 10th and 16th Welsh being disbanded and the 2nd RWF joining from the 33rd Division. These changes to the division also saw the machine gun companies consolidated into a single battalion, one medium mortar battery broken up and absorbed by the remaining two batteries and the heavy mortar battery leaving the division to become a Corps asset.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, the 559th had 6,000 {{personnel}} in two regiments alone, the 70th and 71st, not including combat troops in security roles or North Vietnamese and Laotian civilian laborers. In {{the early days}} of the conflict the trail was used strictly for the infiltration of <b>manpower.</b> This was due to the fact that Hanoi could supply its southern allies much more efficiently by sea.|$|E
5|$|From 1929 to 1930, {{due to an}} {{increase}} in population and crime, Prince George's County created a separate police department. Prior to this time, laws allowed detectives to be used on loan from the Baltimore City Police Department. The newly-created police department allowed the Sheriff's Office to focus its <b>manpower</b> on enforcing orders of the court.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Phua {{left the}} {{corporate}} world to be a full-time special needs volunteer. She and her partners sold the Centre of Effective Leadership to Right Management, a <b>Manpower</b> Inc. subsidiary. Phua then {{became president of the}} Autism Resource Centre. She often wrote to newspapers and government agencies on issues affecting the special needs community.|$|E
5|$|In March the 1st Parachute Brigade {{joined the}} {{division}}. The 6th Airlanding Brigade left the division on 13April, but remained in Palestine as the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade. This reduced the division's <b>manpower</b> by around twenty-five per cent as {{the strength of}} the airlanding brigade had been almost equal to that of two parachute brigades combined.|$|E
5|$|In Vanuatu, cyclone victims {{received}} {{food and}} emergency aid following the storm. Australian patrol boat HMAS Cessnock provided <b>manpower</b> assistance to 11islands in the country. Reconstruction costs in Vanuatu totalled about $5million (1988USD), {{which was about}} 10 percent of the country's national budget.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{shortage}} of available <b>manpower</b> led to a greater burden being placed upon its allies (socii) {{for the provision of}} allied troops. Where accepted allies could not provide the required force types, the Romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.|$|E
5|$|Like their German counterparts, Soviet {{divisions}} {{were also}} seriously understrength. For example, {{divisions in the}} 40th Army averaged 3,500–4,000 men each, while the 69th Army fielded some divisions which could only count on 1,000–1,500 soldiers. Some divisions had as little as 20–50 mortars to provide fire support. This shortage in <b>manpower</b> and equipment led Vatutin's Southwestern Front to request over 19,000 soldiers and 300 tanks, while {{it was noted that}} the Voronezh Front had only received 1,600 replacements since the beginning of operations in 1943. By the time Manstein launched his counteroffensive, the Voronezh Front had lost so much <b>manpower</b> and had overextended itself {{to the point where it}} could no longer offer assistance to the Southwestern Front, south of it.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Armed Forces {{have three}} branches, the Royal Malaysian Navy, the Malaysian Army, and the Royal Malaysian Air Force. There is no conscription, and the {{required}} age for voluntary military service is 18. The military uses 1.5% of the country's GDP, and employs 1.23% of Malaysia's <b>manpower.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{began to}} make incursions into South Wales from the late 1060s onwards, pushing westwards from their bases in {{recently}} occupied England. Their advance was marked by the construction of castles, frequently on old Roman sites, {{and the creation of}} regional lordships. The reuse of Roman sites produced considerable savings in the <b>manpower</b> required to construct large earth fortifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{conscription}} of German men at {{the start}} of the war created a <b>manpower</b> shortage in German factories important for the war effort. From 1915, the Germans encouraged Belgian civilians to enlist voluntarily to work in Germany but the 30,000 recruits of the policy proved insufficient to meet demands.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available <b>manpower</b> led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies {{for the provision of}} allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.|$|E
5|$|The first Corps was a {{small unit}} that served in the Caribbean from 1808 to 12 October 1810, {{recruited}} from former slaves to address the shortage of military <b>manpower</b> in the Caribbean. The locally-recruited men were less susceptible to tropical illnesses than were troops sent from Britain. The Corps followed {{the practice of the}} British Army's West India Regiments in recruiting slaves as soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary reason}} {{construction}} halted {{on the four}} ships was the shifting of construction materials and <b>manpower</b> from capital ships to U-boats {{in the last two}} years of the war. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918 stating that capital ship construction had ground to a halt primarily for this reason.|$|E
5|$|The same historians {{would not}} {{consider}} the immense logistical effort fielded by the U.S. to sustain its military in Southeast Asia as a waste of <b>manpower</b> and resources, even if only one American soldier in four assigned to South Vietnam served in the combat arms.|$|E
