50|$|Hydraulic {{horsepower}} {{is equivalent}} to <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower.</b> The formula given above is for conversion to <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower</b> from the factors acting on a hydraulic system.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower,</b> {{also known}} as {{imperial}} horsepower equals approximately 745.7 watts. It is defined as 550 foot-pounds per second.|$|E
5000|$|The metric {{horsepower}} equals approximately 735.5 watts (98.6% of {{an imperial}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower).</b> It {{is defined as}} 75 kilogram-force meters per second, approximately 735.5 watts.|$|E
50|$|Drawworks {{can be used}} {{to hoist}} or lower several hundred {{thousand}} pounds of weight and can come in AC, DC or <b>mechanical</b> power units. <b>Horsepower</b> ratings for drawworks can also have a wide range, often ranging from 1000 HP to over 3000 HP.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} definitions {{have been}} widely used:In certain situations {{it is necessary to}} distinguish between the various definitions of horsepower and thus a suffix is added: hp(I) for <b>mechanical</b> (or imperial) <b>horsepower,</b> hp(M) for metric horsepower, hp(S) for boiler (or steam) horsepower and hp(E) for electrical horsepower.|$|R
50|$|Problems {{associated}} with {{the design of the}} axial piston engine include high oil consumption, high fuel consumption, low rpm limit imposed by previously discussed frictional loads, low overall <b>horsepower,</b> <b>mechanical</b> complexity and complex machining methods needs to allow the engine {{to stand up to the}} loads imposed on the components. Additional problems are noted in that, the design does not have a long lifespan when compared to other engine designs due to large numbers of moving parts and relative high stresses. Wear and tear occurs at a faster rate because the engine makes more power pulses per turn of the cam than traditional engines. Lastly, due to very high initial torque and a need for large amounts of coolant, loss of oil or coolant to this design during running will almost certainly result in a catastrophic explosion of the engine because the engine generally has very light casings or shields located in the area around the cams and connecting rods.|$|R
5000|$|Assuming {{the third}} CGPM (1901, CR 70) {{definition}} of standard gravity, gn=9.80665 m/s2, {{is used to}} define the pound-force {{as well as the}} kilogram force, and the international avoirdupois pound (1959), one <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower</b> is: ...|$|E
50|$|Horsepower (hp) is {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} of power (the rate at which work is done). There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower</b> (or imperial horsepower), which is approximately 746 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts.|$|E
50|$|DIN 66036 defines one metric {{horsepower}} as {{the power}} to raise a mass of 75 kilograms against the Earth's gravitational force over a distance of one metre in one second: 75 kg · 9.80665 m/s2 · 1 m / 1 s = 75 ·m/s = 1 PS. This is equivalent to 735.49875 W, or 98.6% of an imperial <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower.</b>|$|E

50|$|DIN 70020 is a {{standard}} from German DIN regarding road vehicles. DIN testing, unlike SAE gross power testing, tested the engine as installed in the vehicle, with cooling system, charging system and stock exhaust system all connected. Because the German word for horsepower is Pferdestärke, in Germany it is commonly abbreviated to PS. DIN hp is measured at the engines output shaft, and is usually expressed in metric (Pferdestärke) rather than <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower.</b>|$|E
50|$|The LP9 is a 2.8 L {{turbocharged}} version {{used for}} the Saab 9-3, Saab 9-5 and other GM vehicles. It has the same bore and stroke as the naturally aspirated LP1, however the compression ratio is reduced to 9.5:1. The engine is manufactured at Holden's Fishermans Bend engine factory in Port Melbourne, Australia, while GM Powertrain Sweden (formerly Saab Automobile Powertrain) is responsible for turbocharging the engine. Global versions of this engine use the same horsepower rating for both metric and imperial markets - <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower</b> - while the Europe-only versions are rated in metric horsepower.|$|E
50|$|The various {{units used}} to {{indicate}} this definition (PS, cv, hk, pk, ks and ch) all translate to horse power in English, {{so it is}} common to see these values referred to as horsepower or hp in the press releases or media coverage of the German, French, Italian, and Japanese automobile companies. British manufacturers often intermix metric horsepower and <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower</b> depending on the origin of the engine in question. Sometimes the metric horsepower rating of an engine is conservative enough so that the same figure can be used for both 80/1269/EEC with metric hp and SAE J1349 with imperial hp.|$|E
50|$|German and British {{horsepower}} ratings apparently differed. Postwar British tests put {{the rating}} of the BMW IIIa at 230 hp. This corresponds to British ratings of the Mercedes DIIIa engine being rated by the British as 180 hp (German rating of 170 hp) and the DIIIau at 200 hp (German-180 hp). This discrepancy may explain the significant difference in performance of the BMW IIIa equipped Fokker D.VIIF both against Mercedes powered D.VII's and their Allied opponents. The standard German Pferdstärke metric horsepower unit was expressed in the early 20th century as being a unit of almost exactly 735.5 watts, while the British unit for <b>mechanical</b> <b>horsepower</b> {{was based on the}} older 33,000 ft-lb/min figure, which translates to 745.7 watts instead.|$|E
