40|$|The {{engineers}} of {{the modern}} University City are constructing a graceful bridge, named PONTE OSWALDO CRUZ, that crosses {{a portion of the}} Guanabara Bay (Fig. 1). The work at west pillar stopped for 3 years (The concret structure in Est. 1). As it will be seen from n. º 1 — 5 of the fig. 1, Est. I, the base of the structure will have five underground boxes of reinforcement, but, to-day they are just like as five uncovered water ponds, until at present: May 1963. (Est. I — fig. 3, n. º 3 — pond n. º 3; A. — old level of the water; B. — actual level of the water; c. — green water; E. — mass of bloom of blue algae Microcystis aeruginosa). Soon after SW portion, as 5 cells in series, of the pillar abutments, and also the NE portion nearly opposite in the Tibau Mount will be filled up with earth, a new way will link Rio City and the University City. We see to day Est. I, fig. 1 — the grasses on the half arenous beach of the Tibau Point. These natural Cyperaceae and Gramineae will be desappear because of so a new road, now under construction, when completed will be 33 feet above the mean sea level, as high as the pillar, covering exactly as that place. Although rainfall was the chief source of water for these ponds, the first water (before meterorological precipitations of whatever first rain it might fall) was a common tap water mixed with Portland Cement, which exuded gradually through the pores of the concret during its hardenning process. Some data of its first cement water composition are on the chemical table, and in Tab. n. º 4 and "Resultado n. º 1 ". The rain — receiving surface of each pond were about 15 by 16 feet, that is, 240 square feet; when they were full of water, their depth was of 2 feet 3 ", having each pond about 4, 000 gallons. Climatic conditions are obviously similar of those of the Rio de Janeiro City: records of temperature, of precipitation and evaporation are seen on the graphics, figs. 2, 3, 4. Our conceptions of 4 phases is merely to satisfy an easy explanation thus the first phase that of exudation of concrete. We consider the 2 nd. phase formation of bacterian and cyanophycean thin pellicel. 3 rd. phase - dilution by rains, and fertilisation by birds; the 4 th phase - plankton flora and fauna established. The biological material arrived with the air, the rains, and also with contaminations by dusts; with big portion of sand, of earth, and leaves of trees resulted of the SW wind actions in the storming days (See - Est. I, fig. 3, G. - the mangrove trees of the Pinheiro Island). Many birds set down and rest upon the pillar structure, its faeces which are good fertilizers fall into the ponds. Some birds were commonly pigeons, black ravens, swallows, sparrows and other sea mews, moor hens, and a few sea birds of comparatively rare occurence. We get only some examples of tropical dust contaminated helioplankton, of which incipient observations were been done sparcely. See the systematic list of the species of plankters. Phytoplankters - Cyanophyta algae as a basic part for food of zooplankters, represented chiefly by rotiferse, water-fleas Moinodaphnia and other Crustacea: Ostracoda Copepoda and Insecta: Chironomidae and Culicidae larvae. The polysaprobic of septic irruptions have not been done only by heating in summer, and, a good reason of that, for example: when the fifth pond was in polysaprobic phase as the same time an alike septic phase do not happened into the 3 rd. pond, therefore, both were in the same conditions of temperature, but with unlike contaminations. Among the most important aquatic organisms used as indicatiors of pollution - and microorganisms of real importance in the field of sanitary science, by authorities of renown, for instance: PALMER, PRESCOTT, INGRAM, LIEBMANN, we choose following microalgae: a) The cosmopolite algae Scenedesmus quadricuada, a common indicator in mesosaprobio waters, which lives between pH 7, 0 and it is assimilative of NO[3 subscripted] and NH[4 subscripted]. b) Species of the genus Chlamydomonas; it is even possible that all the species of theses genus inhabit strong-mesosaprobic to polysaprobic waters when in massive blooms. c) Several species of Euglenaceae in fast growing number, at the same time of the protozoa Amoebidae, Vorticellidae and simultaneous with deposition of the decaying cells of the blue algae Anacystis cyanea (= Microcystis) when the consumed oxygen by organic matter resulted in 40 mg. L. But, we found, among various Euglenacea the cosmopolite species (Euglena viridis, a well known polysaprobic indicatior of which presence occur in septic zone. d) Analcystis cyanea (= M. aeruginosa) as we observed was in blooms increasing to the order of billions of cells per litter, its maximum in the summer. Temperatures 73 ºF to 82 ºF but even 90 ºF, the pH higher than 8. When these blue algae was joined to the rotifer Brachionus calyflorus the waters gets a milky appearance, but greenished one. In fact, that cosmopolite algae is used as a mesosaprobic indicator. Into the water of the ponds its predominance finished when the septic polysaprobic conditions began. e) Ankistrodesmus falcatus was present in the 5 th pond from 26 the. April untill the 26 th July, and when N. NH[4 subscripted] gets 1. 28 mg. L. and when chlorinity stayed from 0. 034 to 0. 061 mg. L. It never was found at N. NH[4 subscripted] higher than 1 mg. L. The green algae A. falcatus, an indicatior of pollution, lives in moderate mesosaprobic waters. f) As everyone knows, the rotifer eggs may be widely dispersed by wind. The rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli in our observation seemed like a green colored bag, overcharged by green cells and detritus, specially into its spacious stomach, which ends blindly (the intestine, cloaca, being absent). The stock of Asplanchna in the ponds, during the construction of the bridge "PONTE OSWALDO CRUZ" inhabits alkaline waters, pH 8, 0 a 8, 3, and when we observed we noted its dissolved oxygen from 3. 5 to 4 mg. L. In these ponds Asplanchna lived in 0, 2 P. PO[4 subscripted]. (Remember the hydobiological observations foreign to braslian waters refer only from 0. 06 to 0, 010 <b>mg.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>P.</b> PO[4 subscripted]; and they refer resistance to 0. 8 N. NH[4 subscripted]). By our data, that rotiger resist commonly to 1. 2 until 1. 8 mg. L. N. NH[4 subscripted]; here in our ponds and, when NO[2 subscripted] appears Asplanchna desappears. It may be that Asplanchna were devoured by nitrite resistant animals of by Culicidae or other mosquitoes devoured by Due to these facts the number and the distribution of Asplanchna varies considerabley; see - plates of plankton successions. g) Brachionus one of the commonest members of class Rotatoria was frquently found in abundance into the ponds, and we notice an important biological change produce by the rotifer Brachonus colyciflorus: the occurence of its Brachionus clayciflorus forms pallas, is rare in Brazil, as we know about this. h) When we found the water flea MOinodaphnia we do not record simultanous presence of the blue algae Agmenellun (= Merismopedia) ...|$|E

40|$|Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) {{has been}} {{developed}} {{in recent years to}} achieve high quality effluent in regards to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds. However, most of these results have been achieved on domestic sewage. In treating industrial wastewater, additional challenges are facing the process designer and operator due to the substantially higher concentrations of both carbon and nutrients. This research and demonstration project is addressing the issue for abattoir (slaughterhouse) effluent. The technology used should be as simple as possible yet still achieve a high degree of BNR. The process used in laboratory and pilot scale is a single tank Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). The results from the laboratory work have been excellent but have to be confirmed in the pilot plant studies. It was found that a certain degree of anaerobic pretreatment (e. g. in anaerobic ponds) can reduce part of the carbon concentration most efficiently while still leaving sufficient COD required for successful BNR. Despite high influent concentrations of approximately 190 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> N and 50 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> total <b>P,</b> good effluent quality of less than 20 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> N and less than 5 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> total <b>P</b> has been achieved.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{wetlands}} {{to function as}} sinks for phosphorus (P) {{has been the subject}} of much debate. We measured the ability of a 1246 ha restored northern prairie wetland to store P from beef slaughter and municipal sewage wastewater. Sediment cores were collected from the Frank Lake marsh to quantify P accumulation, sedimentation rates and sediment adsorption ability. Approximately 60 % of P inputs into the marsh since restoration in 1990 have been stored in the sediments (79 662 kg out of 141 760 kg applied). Sites near the wastewater inflow had greater sedimentation rates (3. 0 cm year 1) and P burial rates (38. 5 g P m 2 year 1) than other sites across the marsh (24 g P m 2 year 1). Surface sediments from the marsh and reference wetlands were collected and spiked experimentally with 25 – 500 <b>mg</b> <b>l</b> 1 <b>P</b> (as NaH 2 PO 43) to determine the ability of the sediments to take up additional P. Sorption isotherms showed that the sediments near the inflow had a limited ability for additional P-sorption. When exposed to 500 <b>mg</b> <b>l</b> 1 <b>P,</b> inflow sites sorbed a maximum of 1000 mg P g sediment 1. In contrast, the rest of the sites in the marsh sorbed up to 1700 mg P g sediment 1, while nearby reference wetland sites sorbed more than 2500 mg P g sediment 1. Approximately 66 % of the marsh sediments still had high sorption ability. Inflow sites had a reduced ability for additional P uptake due to the high P loadings applied to that area. Frank Lake has provided effective P retention, however, future treatment efficacy may decrease if the remaining sediments become saturated. Continued high P loading to the marsh may lead to eutrophication problems and downstream P export from the wetland...|$|R

Squash seeds were planted for two seasons and were irrigated twice a week to replenish 80 % of the class A pan evaporation. Plant and soil samples were collected and analyzed for chemical analysis. Fruit yield was determined from harvesting the middle two rows. With P fertigation, fruit yield, fruit numbers and P uptake were higher than with preplant soil application and the yield was related positively to P uptake. The P fertilizer use efficiency (PFUE) was also higher with fertigation and decreased with increasing P rates. Soil pH in the top soil decreased by the highest P rate due to the acidifying effect of phosphoric acid applied through fertigation. Being slightly soluble, P accumulated more in the top 15 cm soil and was higher with higher rates. With preplant application, P accumulated deeper in the top 30 cm. It can be concluded that the lowest fertigated P rate was adequate to achieve the highest yield and PFUE and was superior to preplant application method...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the role of ubiquitous phototrophic periphyton in aquatic ecosystem on the biogeochemical cycling of organic phosphorus, the conversion and removal kinetic characteristics of organic phosphorus (Porg) such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were investigated {{in the presence of}} the periphyton cultured in artificial non-point source wastewater. The preliminary results showed that the periphyton was very powerful in converting Porg evidenced by the fact that inorganic phosphorus (Pinorg) content in solution increased from about 0. 7 to 14. 3 <b>mg</b> <b>P</b> <b>L</b> 21 in 48 hours in the presence of 0. 6 g L 21 periphyton. This was because the periphyton could produce abundant phosphatases that benefited the conversion of Porg to Pinrog. Moreover, this conversion process was described more suitable by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The periphyton was also effective in removing Porg, which showed that the Porg can be completely removed even when the initial Porg concentration was as high as 13 <b>mg</b> <b>P</b> <b>L</b> 21 in 48 hours in the presence of 1. 6 g L 21 periphyton. Furthermore, it was found that biosorption dominated the Porg removal process and exhibited the characteristics of physical adsorption.

Because of its contribution {{as a food}} source for fish, the growth kinetics of Microcystis aeruginosa, a dominant cyanobacterium in the lake, was studied. The regular occurrence of M. aeruginosa is experienced during the months of May to July or from September to November in Laguna de Bay, the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines. M. aeruginosa was collected from Laguna de Bay, isolated, and established in axenic conditions. Data on the growth kinetic parameters for nitrate-nitrogen and phosphate-phosphorus utilization by M. aeruginosa gave the following values: half-saturation constant (K s), 0. 530 <b>mg</b> N. <b>L</b> âˆ’ 1 and 0. 024 <b>mg</b> <b>P.</b> <b>L</b> âˆ’ 1 respectively; maximum growth rate (Î¼ max), 0. 671. d âˆ’ 1 and 0. 668. d âˆ’ 1 respectively; maximum cell yield, 6. 5 and 6. 54 log, cells. ml âˆ’ 1 respectively; nutrient level for saturated growth yield, 8. 71 <b>mg</b> N. <b>L</b> âˆ’ 1 and 0. 22 <b>mg</b> <b>P.</b> <b>L</b> âˆ’ 1 respectively; and minimum cell quota (Q 0), 2. 82 pg N. cell âˆ’ 1 and 0. 064 pg P. cell âˆ’ 1 respectively.

Before the race, body core temperature, body mass, leg muscle power output during a countermovement jump, and blood samples were obtained. During the marathon (27 uC; 27 % relative humidity) running fatigue was measured as the pace reduction from the first 5 -km to the end of the race.

40|$|Background: Total {{immunoglobulin}} A in saliva (s-IgA) {{is normally}} assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We have investigated methodological {{issues relating to}} the use of particle-enhanced nephelometric immunoassay (PENIA) to measure s-IgA in whole unstimulated saliva and determine its reference range. Methods: Whole unstimulated resting saliva was collected to determine sample stability (temperature, time, effect of a protease inhibitor), limit of quantitation (LOQ), assay precision and analytical variation. The reference range for 134 healthy adults was determined. Results: Linearity was excellent (4 – 10. 3 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> 21, <b>P,</b> 0. 001; R 2 &frac 14; 0. 997) and without significant bias (mean of 20. 7 %). The lowest intra- and inter-analytical coefficients of variation were 1. 8 % and 7. 5 % and LOQ was 1. 4 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> 21. The concentration of s-IgA is stable at room temperature for up to 6 h, at 48 C for 48 h, at 248 C for two weeks and at 2808 C for up to 1. 3 yr. There is no evidence that a protease inhibitor increases the stability or that repeated freeze–thawing cycles degrade sample quality. The reference ranges for s-IgA concentration, s-IgA secretion, s-IgA:albumin and s-IgA:osmolality were 15. 9 – 414. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> 21, 7. 2 – 234. 9 mg min 21, 0. 4 – 19 and 0. 6 – 8. 9, respectively.

Among the different microalgal groups, only the chlorophytes showed a significantly higher density {{in response to the}} 12 N: 1 P treatment at the higher P concentration, indicating that the nutrient ratio had a significant interaction with the nutrient levels used in the experiments. The genera found in the different treatments were generally similar; however, the degree of dominance of some varied with treatment during the experiment. The succession of dominant genera also differed among the N:P treatments. The diatoms like Fragilaria, Aulacoseira (= Melosira) and Nitzschia dominated the lowest N:P. On the other hand, chlorophytes (Kirchneriella and Scenedesmus) dominated the highest N:P treatment, particularly from the second to the seventh week of the experiments with the diatoms becoming co-dominant only towards the eighth week {{until the end of the}} experimental.
