5|$|Roger <b>Miller</b> {{was born}} in Fort Worth, Texas, the third son of Jean and Laudene (Holt) <b>Miller.</b> Jean <b>Miller</b> died from spinal {{meningitis}} when <b>Miller</b> was a year old. Unable to support the family during the Great Depression, Laudene sent her three sons to live with three of Jean's brothers. Thus, <b>Miller</b> {{grew up on a}} farm outside Erick, Oklahoma, with Elmer and Armelia <b>Miller.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{being hurt}} {{in a fall}} in his bathtub after {{slipping}} on a bar of soap, <b>Miller</b> was expected to withdraw and the Republican leadership hoped for a deal as late as May 15, the day <b>Miller</b> was to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought he would use to announce his withdrawal. However, <b>Miller</b> stayed in the race and the two incumbents faced {{each other in the}} Republican primary on June 2, 1992.|$|E
5|$|After {{leading his}} state to another Sheffield Shield title and {{a win over}} England, <b>Miller</b> {{replaced}} Morris as the vice-captain for the tour of the West Indies that started in early 1955. Australia was looking for its first series win against any team in three years, having lost two consecutive series to England. Australia batted first in the opening Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica. <b>Miller</b> came to the wicket at 2/137 {{and put on a}} 224-run partnership with Harvey. Both ended with centuries and <b>Miller</b> scored his highest Test score of 147, striking 15fours. When Valentine and Ramadhin had conceded 100runs, he respectively shook their hands. Australia finished at 9/515. Johnson had been injured when hit in the foot by a yorker so <b>Miller</b> was left in charge of the team on the field with Australia one bowler short. <b>Miller</b> attempted to unsettle the batsmen by placing many men close to the bat in an attempt to insult their batting capabilities. He took the new ball at 5/239 and the hosts collapsed to be all out for 259. <b>Miller</b> had taken 2/36, and enforced the follow-on, which was questioned as paceman Ron Archer had broken down. With Australia two bowlers short, the West Indies moved to 1/114. When Weekes arrived at the crease, <b>Miller</b> unsettled him with delaying tactics, and he was out for one. He then placed two silly points and two silly mid-ons in an attempt to unsettle Walcott, who fell to Lindwall soon after. <b>Miller</b> then took two wickets and the hosts had lost three wickets in as many overs. The West Indies were bowled out and Australia won by nine wickets. <b>Miller</b> had taken 3/62 in the second innings.|$|E

5|$|After the Lord's Test, <b>Miller</b> {{enjoyed a}} night out and {{returned}} to the team hotel after daybreak the next morning. Australia were due to play Surrey at The Oval that day. With Australia in the field, Bradman sent <b>Miller</b> to the fine leg boundary as a punishment—between overs, he was forced to walk the length of the field. One of the spectators felt sorry for <b>Miller</b> and lent him his bicycle, which <b>Miller</b> used to cycle around the circumference of the ground.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952–53 season, the New South Wales Cricket Association's five-man {{selection}} panel installed <b>Miller</b> as captain in place of Morris. This was despite Morris leading the state to the Sheffield Shield in the previous season. <b>Miller</b> did not lobby for the job, but the Sydney media had campaigned for <b>Miller,</b> suggesting that his flamboyant style would attract more spectators and help stem the financial losses of the NSWCA. Despite this, Morris remained the Test vice-captain ahead of <b>Miller.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bradman saw <b>Miller</b> as a top-order batsman {{and as his}} new ball {{partner for}} Lindwall, {{although}} the Victorian allrounder was a reluctant bowler. The Australian captain felt that <b>Miller</b> was crucial to his strategy of attacking England's strong batting line-up—which boasted the likes of Hammond, Denis Compton, Len Hutton, Bill Edrich and Cyril Washbrook—with high pace. <b>Miller</b> was duly selected for the Australian team for the First Test.|$|E
5|$|By the First Test at Trent Bridge, <b>Miller</b> was {{shouldering}} most of {{the bowling}} load. He sent down 52 overs in a rain-affected match, taking match figures of 6/127. He struggled with the bat, making a duck and four. The teams headed to Lord's where <b>Miller</b> had to carry the pace attack without the injured Davidson and Lindwall. Crawford and Ken Mackay were called in to make their debut and support <b>Miller</b> with the pace duties. Australia batted first and <b>Miller</b> managed 28. Australia managed only 285 and Crawford injured himself, exacerbating the burden on <b>Miller.</b> <b>Miller</b> had Peter Richardson and then bowled Tom Graveney with an outswinger. England were 2/32 and their captain Peter May received an inswinger from <b>Miller</b> first ball, which he inside edged onto his stumps, but the bail was not dislodged. The next day, <b>Miller</b> beat May four times and then had Watson caught in the gully in his third over. He then removed Bailey and Trueman. Miller's 5/72 was largely responsible for England falling for 171. Australia was in difficulty at 3/69 when <b>Miller</b> came to bat, hitting a counterattacking 30. Australia set England 371 to win. <b>Miller</b> removed Graveney {{at the start of}} the run chase. Resuming the next morning, he bowled Watson, and had May and Evans both caught behind. He bowled Johnny Wardle and took his only ten-wicket match haul in Tests. Australia won by 185runs and <b>Miller</b> had bowled 70.1overs for the match. His knee had taken a heavy toll and <b>Miller</b> was given an extended break had to play purely as a batsman in the Third Test at Headingley. Australia were caught on a wet wicket in response to England's 325, and <b>Miller</b> top-scored with 41 and Australia were forced to follow on. He had attempted to keep Laker and Lock at bay with his pads. In the second innings, <b>Miller</b> fell for 26 to Laker. Australia lost by an innings, for the first time in a Test in 18years.|$|E
5|$|During June, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Miller's squadron would be deployed to Burma {{to fight against}} Japan. In the meantime, the airmen continued to practice their flying, <b>Miller</b> earning Reeves' ire by making unauthorised leisure flights. Later, {{he was ordered to}} fly tour flights over Germany. Not wanting to do so, <b>Miller</b> lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, Reeves ordered <b>Miller</b> to take his plane instead, which caught fire in mid-flight. With one functional engine and no navigator to assist him, <b>Miller</b> came back to the air base and bellylanded. The fuselage and one of the wings was broken off and the plane became engulfed in flames. <b>Miller</b> escaped physical injury, but was shaken by the accident. Again <b>Miller</b> escaped disciplinary action, and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E

5|$|During the 1946–47 Australian cricket season, all rounder Keith <b>Miller</b> {{represented}} Victoria and Australia. A 27-year-old right-handed batsman {{and fast}} bowler, <b>Miller</b> played in all five Tests against England, performing well with both bat and ball. He finished {{top of the}} Australian Test bowling averages, taking 16 wickets at 20.88, and was second in the batting averages, scoring 384 runs at 76.80. On his Ashes debut in the First Test in Brisbane, <b>Miller</b> scored 79 before taking match bowling figures of 9 wickets for 77 runs (9/77) in Australia's innings victory. In the Fourth Test, played at the Adelaide Oval, <b>Miller</b> broke through for his first Test century, scoring an unbeaten 141. A middle-order batsman and right-arm opening bowler, <b>Miller</b> finished the Test series as Australia's joint leading wicket-taker, along with his new ball partner Ray Lindwall, as Australia won the series 3–0.|$|E
5|$|England {{had started}} the Third Test at Sydney strongly. Australia took its first wicket when <b>Miller</b> caught Washbrook from Johnson with a {{horizontal}} diving catch at slip. England were still in control at 1/128 when <b>Miller</b> came on to bowl. He removed Hutton and Reg Simpson before bowling Compton for a duck. In the space of four overs from <b>Miller,</b> England were now 4/137. <b>Miller</b> had contributed to all four wickets. <b>Miller</b> ended with 4/37 as England were bowled out for 290 on the second day. <b>Miller</b> batted patiently on the third day, reaching 96 by stumps with Australia at 6/362. The next day, with his century four runs away, <b>Miller</b> arrived late, leaving his batting partner Johnson waiting at the players' gate. <b>Miller</b> progressed to 145notout despite the interruption. It has been a patient innings by his standards, taking almost a day. England collapsed for 123, leaving Australia to take an innings victory. In the first innings of the Fourth Test in Sydney, <b>Miller</b> scored 44 and did not take a wicket, but he was heading for consecutive Test centuries in the second innings. He reached 99 when a leg break from Doug Wright spun across him and clipped the off bail. The innings helped Australia to set England a target of 503. <b>Miller</b> took 3/27 on the final day, helping {{to cut through the}} middle order as Australia won by 274runs. <b>Miller</b> was out for seven and a duck in the Fifth Test at the MCG. He took 4/76 in the first innings, joining Lindwall in cutting down the middle order, despite which England won by eight wickets. <b>Miller</b> topped the Test batting averages with 350 runs at 43.75, and for the entire first-class season, he scored 1332runs at 78.35, the highest among all comers. His bowling was also strong, with 17wickets at 17.70, second only to Jack Iverson (21 wickets at 15.23). However, an attack by Morris (182) and <b>Miller</b> (83) in a Shield match dispirited Iverson, and he never played Test cricket again.|$|E
5|$|England {{then started}} their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. Seeing that Lindwall was able to bowl through the pain, Bradman tossed the ball to <b>Miller</b> for the second over to see if <b>Miller</b> could bowl. However, <b>Miller</b> threw the ball back, indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and <b>Miller</b> had quarrelled.|$|E

5|$|Following {{another good}} all-round {{performance}} against Hampshire, top-scoring {{in the first}} innings and taking 5/25 in the second, <b>Miller</b> went into the First Test (at Trent Bridge) in fine form. On the first morning, <b>Miller</b> bowled Hutton and Compton {{on his way to}} 3/38, helping Australia dismiss England cheaply and seize the initiative. <b>Miller</b> scored a duck, but Australia took a 344-run lead on the first innings.
