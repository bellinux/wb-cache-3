50|$|The Global Command and Control System (GCCS) is the {{battlefield}} situation display and {{information management system}} for Theater (warfare) and joint task force level commanders and their staffs. The JTLS-GCCS-NATO C2 federation was developed to examine the use of high-level architecture (HLA) to build interfaces between command and control (C2) systems and simulations. The federation comprises a set of <b>multinational</b> <b>command</b> and control systems (GCCS and the NCIA ICC Air Track display) and exercise support tools. The federation is a partnership of three organizations: the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), the U.S. Joint Staff Directorate for Joint Force Development (J7), and the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency. Each organization has {{a vested interest in}} finding affordable and extensible approaches to the task of linking combat simulations to fielded C2 systems to support training. The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) joins the partnership to provide the HLA, the enabling technology that serves as the foundation for linking C2 systems to simulations.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of NATO is {{largely due to}} the existence of its integrated and <b>multinational</b> <b>command</b> structure. That command structure, the cement of the Alliance, derives from the mutual obligations contained in Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. The publication of this compendium could not be more timely as a contribution to the debate which continues in NATO capitals. NATO is an alliance based on consensus. It is also the most effective military alliance in history; this {{is largely due to}} the existence of its integrated and <b>multinational</b> <b>command</b> structure. That command structure, the cement of the Alliance as it were, derives from the mutual obligations contained in Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. This contractual obligation, which does not exist for the other missions which have arisen since 1990, means that the defense of NATO territory must be the basis of any restructuring. If we were to move away from this and thus weaken the command structure, even with the best intentions, then it is my firm conviction that we would do serious harm to the Alliance and its future. On the other hand, a modified command structure, still based on the Article V contractual obligation, provides a firm basis, as well as flexibility, versatility, and availability for any non- contractual, namely out-of-area, requirement. Command structures do not exist of their own accord. They come into being, change, and develop, to permit commanders at the appropriate level, from top to bottom, to orchestrate the application of military force at sea, in the air, and on land. There is, however, a limit to which one can impose responsibilities on commanders, who after all are personally responsible for the conduct of operations, and a limit to the amount of specialization and detail with which they can cope. This is why we have hierarchical command structures with each commander dealing with the appropriate level of competence. It is why at certain levels command should be joint and at others purely functional. How many levels of command are needed will be dictated by the operations factors of time, forces, and space...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{with people}} {{becoming}} {{more concerned about}} social issues, {{there has been a}} growing interest from corporations, academics and the community in the use of cause-related marketing. Responding to public interest in social issues has led many companies in various industries to fulfil their social responsibilities via causes which aim to provide benefit to the overall community. Cause-related marketing (CRM) is therefore a widely used strategy among numbers of companies operating their businesses in various markets as a means to obtain a competitive advantage and as a long-term rather than a short-term awareness builder and sales generator Many international companies from around the world are now interested in investing in Asian countries because of those countries’ growing markets. Recognising their vast potential size, some international pharmaceutical companies recently decided to enter these Asian markets. Thailand is seen as an important pharmaceutical market in South-East Asia because of its relatively high level of development, high education level and ready acceptance of Western pharmaceutical products. It relies largely on the importation of pharmaceutical products from multinational companies due to its high domestic demand. These <b>multinationals</b> <b>command</b> a major share of the market and receive significant financial and marketing support from their parent companies. Some of these drug companies have introduced their corporate social responsibility programs as well as cause-related marketing programs into the market. Many industry surveys show the positive effects of cause-related marketing on consumers’ attitudes and behaviours. However, a shortage of empirical research in this discipline still exists, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry and in Asian countries such as Thailand. In order to address these gaps, this thesis therefore investigates the following research problem: What is the impact of cause-related marketing campaigns on consumers’ purchase decision making regarding pharmaceutical products in Thailand? This research thus addresses two specific objectives. Firstly, it examines the impact of a cause-related marketing campaign on consumers’ attitudes towards corporate image in the pharmaceutical industry in Thailand. Secondly, it examines the impact of a cause-related marketing campaign on consumers’ purchase intentions towards the pharmaceutical products of a company engaged in a cause-related marketing campaign. A model of the impact of cause-related marketing is developed based on a review of the literature. The model depicts the relationships between the company, the cause and the customers, all of which impact on corporate image and purchase intention. Personal values were hypothesised to moderate purchase intention. A number of hypotheses are developed based on the model. Based on a conceptual model of cause-related marketing, a survey was developed which included measures of attitudes toward cause-related marketing, the company, the cause-related marketing project, the company-cause fit, customer-cause fit, purchase intention, corporate image, terminal values and demographics. The measures were derived from previous studies and pilot testing. The survey was administered in Thai and completed by 413 Thai pharmaceutical customers. The sample had a slightly larger proportion of females than males (58. 8 %) and tended to be younger and better educated than the Thai population, but was considered typical of Thai pharmacy consumers. The examination of the data in this study confirms corporate image is positively influenced by respondents’ attitudes towards cause related marketing, the company-cause fit and the customer-cause fit. Furthermore, company image is positively associated with purchase intention. These findings are all in line with expectations based on the literature. Further, in contrast to expectations the findings did not confirm values moderated purchase intention as expected...|$|R
