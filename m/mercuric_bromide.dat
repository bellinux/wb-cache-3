In addition to the already known four different phases of HgBr 2 in the pressure–temperature range of p, 4 : 5 GPa, 90, T, 600 K our observations show {{the existence of a}} new phase (V) above 9. 0 GPa and, together with published material, support the phase transition sequence: (I) orthorhombic–(II) orthorhombic–(III) monoclinic–(IV) trigonal–(V) trigonal/hexagonal. The structure of phase IV with space group symmetry P 3 has been determined from powder diffraction data. The observation of second-harmonic-generation signals confirms the absence of an inversion center. The structure of phase IV is a commensurately modulated variant of the CdI 2 type layer structure, where part of the Hg atoms are displaced from the centers of the HgBr 6 octahedra by a much as 0. 76 A ̊ in the direction perpendicular to the layers...|$|E

40|$|Synthetic glycoconjugates as a novel {{class of}} useful tools for basic glycoscience studies were {{systematically}} designed and synthesized. The {{main purpose of}} this work was focused on {{creation of a new}} glycochemical field by hybridizing the conventional sugar-chemistry, polymer chemistry, and biochemistry. The thesis was composed of five chapters. The first chapter provided a general introduction to the roles of glycoconjugates in nature and the significance of molecular recognition based on the interaction of carbohydrates and proteins such as lectins and enzymes. ln order to investigate the structures and functions of a variety of glycoconjugates, {{it should be noted that}} we must consider some new strategy and methodology for the preparation of well characterized glycoligands and glycosubstrates in conjunction with glycobiology and glycoteclmology. ln the second chapter, facile and efficient syntheses of activated cyclic aldose derivatives were explained on the basis of a new combination of <b>mercuric</b> (II) <b>bromide</b> and 2, 4, 6 -trimethylpyridine. Reactive intermediates such as orthoester and oxazoline derivatives synthesized here can be useful and versatile precursors for glycoconjugates syntheses and the application of these procedures will be discussed in following chapters. The third chapter under the title of "Glycoprotein Models: Polymeric Sugar Ligands Available for Determining The Binding Specificity of Lectins" gave a new strategy for the investigation of binding specificity of lectins with sugars using Polymeric glycoligands derived from a variety of polymerizable glycosides of N-acetyllactosamine and the related isomers. lt was clearly suggested that a lectin isolated from Erythrina collarodendron showed a specific affinity for β(1 → 4) type disaccharides and the precise evaluation of the interaction of carbohydrates and lectins can be firstly performed by means of polymeric sugar-cluster effect. Chapter 4 was devoted to the syntheses and biochemical evaluation of novel bi-fluorescence-labeled lactoside as a high performance substrate for ceramide glycanase isolated from leech (Macrobdella decora). This unique substrate prepared from n-pentenyl lactoside involved kind of fluorophores as a donor and an acceptor of fluorescence energy transfer in the molecule and showed two emission maximums at around 335 and 540 nm when the substrate was excited at 260 or 290 nm. Using a bi-fluorescence-labeled substrate for kinetic analysis in the enzyme reaction, the KM of the leech ceramide glycanase against the substrate was found to be 7. 7 μM and the Vmax was determined to be 0. 16 nmol/min. Concluding remarks will be described in Chapter 5...|$|R
40|$|In this {{experiment}} {{we attempted to}} use different sources of bacteria to convert arsenic in water to arsenic hydride or arsine gas (AsH 3), to reduce the arsenic content in our sample. The production of arsine gas was monitored using a Hach Kit. <b>Mercuric</b> <b>bromide</b> strips {{were used to determine}} amount of arsine gas evolved. The first trial we used three different sources for bacteria: Bread mold, yogurt and a supplemental tablet contained Acidophilus lactobacilus. The first trial was carried out with the same volume of arsenic solution (10 ppm) in the Hach container but varying amounts of the bacteria source. In the case of the supplemental tablet we tested only with one tablet in each container. Replicates were setup so as to check evolution of gas overtime. The first trial produced no results (no arsine evolution detected) this was accredited to the concentration of arsenic being too high. Another experiment was tried with a piece of bread mold and very lower arsenic concentration. *Graduate student, 1 Chem 111 student...|$|E

Methyl 3 -O-benzyl- 4, 6 -O-isopropylidene-β-D-mannopyranoside (6) was prepared from the corresponding gluco-epimer (4) by oxidation, followed by stereoselective reduction. Condensation of 6 with 2, 3, 4 -tri-O-acetyl-α-D-xylopyranosyl bromide {{in the presence of}} mercuric cyanide gave a 1 : 9 mixture of methyl 3 -O-benzyl- 4, 6 -O-isopropylidene- 2 -O-(2, 3, 4 -tri-O-acetyl-α- (7 a) and -β-D-xylopyranosyl) -β-D-mannopyranoside (7), and then 7 was converted into the acetylated disaccharide-glycoside 11. Regioselective mannosylation, with 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-acetyl-α-D-mannopyranosyl bromide, at position 6 of deisopropylidenated 7 (8), using <b>mercuric</b> <b>bromide</b> as a promoter, afforded the trisaccharide-glycoside derivative 13, which was transformed into the acetylated trisaccharide-glycoside 16.

40|$|For {{countries}} such as Bangladesh with a significant groundwater arsenic problem, there is an urgent need for the arsenic-contaminated wells {{to be identified as}} soon as possible and for appropriate action to be taken. This will involve the testing {{of a large number of}} wells, potentially up to 11 million in Bangladesh alone. Field-test kits offer the only practical way forward in the timescale required. The classic field method for detecting arsenic (the ‘Gutzeit ’ method) is based on the reaction of arsine gas with <b>mercuric</b> <b>bromide</b> and remains the best practical approach. It can in principle achieve a detection limit of about 10 μg l− 1 by visual comparison of the coloured stain against a colour calibration chart. A more objective result can be achieved when the colour is measured by an electronic instrument. Attention has to be paid to interferences mainly from hydrogen sulfide. Due to analytical errors, both from the field-test kits and from laboratory analysis, some misclassification of wells is inevitable, even under ideal conditions. The extent of misclassification depends on the magnitude of the errors of analysis and the frequency distribution of arsenic observed, but is in principle predictable before an extensive survey is undertaken. For a country with an arsenic distribution similar to that of Bangladesh, providing care is taken to avoid sources of bias during testing, modern field-test kits should be able to reduce this misclassification to under 5 % overall...|$|E
40|$|Evidence for the {{generalized}} anomeric effect (GAE) in the N-acyl- 1, 3 -thiazolidines, an important structural motif in the penicillins, was sought in the crystal structures of N-(4 -nitrobenzoyl) - 1, 3 -thiazolidine and its (2 : 1) complex with mercuric chloride, N-acetyl- 2 -phenyl- 1, 3 -thiazolidine, and the (2 : 1) complex of N-benzoyl- 1, 3 -thiazolidine with <b>mercuric</b> <b>bromide.</b> An inverse relationship was generally observed between the. C- 2 -N and C- 2 -S bond lengths of the thiazolidine ring, supporting {{the existence of}} the GAE. (Maximal bond length changes were similar to 0. 04 angstrom for C- 2 -N- 3, S- 1 -C- 2, and similar to 0. 08 angstrom for N- 3 -C- 6.) Comparison with N-acylpyrrolidines and tetrahydrothiophenes indicates that both the nitrogen-to-sulphur and sulphur-to-nitrogen GAE's operate simultaneously in the 1, 3 -thiazolidines, the former being dominant. (This is analogous to the normal and exo-anomeric effects in pyranoses, and also leads to an interesting application of Baldwin's rules.) The nitrogen-to-sulphur GAE is generally enhanced in the mercury(II) complexes (presumably via coordination at the sulphur); a 'competition' between the GAE and the amide resonance of the N-acyl moiety is apparent. There is evidence for a 'push-pull' charge transfer between the thiazolidine moieties in the mercury(II) complexes, and for a 'back-donation' of charge from the bromine atoms to the thiazolidine moieties in the HgBr 2 complex. (The sulphur atom appears to be sp(2) hybridised in the mercury(II) complexes, possibly for stereoelectronic reasons.) These results are apparently relevant to the mode of action of the penicillins.

40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{has been}} used to investigate the structure and structural behaviour of several inorganic solids under variable pressure and temperature conditions. A brief description of the diamond anvil cell (d. a. c.) and its applications to the high- pressure investigations is given. A spectroscopic system built for pressure calibration is discussed, plus an account of powder diffraction data analysis including a detailed description of a software package engineered for the specific reduction of powder data obtained under variable pressure. Potassium nitrate (KNO 3) has seven polymorphs in the pressure range 0. 0 - 4. 0 GPa. This material has been studied with energy dispersive powder diffraction (EDXRD) to 9. 3 GPa. The structure of the non-ambient phase IV refined by neutron diffraction at 0. 36 GPa has been confirmed, the compressibility of the high-pressure phase measured and found to be anisotropic with axial compression ratios a:b:c = 1. 0 : 0. 64 : 0. 50. The valence induced structural transition at 0. 8 GPa in EuPd 2 Si 2 has been studied using EDXRD and uni-axial compressibilities calculated. A basic explanation of the electronic theory which accompanies the subtle shortening of the a lattice parameter in the tetragonal asymmetric unit is also given. The structures of two compounds CH 3 HgX (X = I, Cl) have been investigated using single crystal and angle-dispersive powder techniques respectively. The crystal structure of methyl mercuric iodide is reported. CH 3 HgCl has been observed above and below the temperature induced I/II phase boundary at 162. 5 K.
