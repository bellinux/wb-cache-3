5|$|VSWR and the {{positions}} of the nodes are parameters that can be directly measured with an instrument called a slotted line. This instrument makes use of the reflection phenomenon to make many different measurements at <b>microwave</b> <b>frequencies.</b> One use is that VSWR and node position can be used to calculate the impedance of a test component terminating the slotted line. This is a useful method because measuring impedances by directly measuring voltages and currents is difficult at these frequencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of distributed element filters was {{spurred on by}} the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World WarII. Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at <b>microwave</b> <b>frequencies</b> and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology {{can be found in}} several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes.|$|E

25|$|According to the Drude {{model of}} {{magnetized}} plasma, {{a more general}} expression which {{takes into account the}} interaction of the carriers with an alternating electric field at millimeter and <b>microwave</b> <b>frequencies</b> in an axially magnetized semiconductor requires the expression of the permittivity as a non-diagonal tensor.

25|$|The <b>{{microwave}}</b> <b>frequencies</b> used in {{microwave ovens}} are chosen based on regulatory and cost constraints. The {{first is that}} they should be in one of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands set aside for non-communication purposes. For household purposes, 2.45 GHz has the advantage over 915 MHz in that 915 MHz is only an ISM band in the ITU Region 2 while 2.45 GHz is available worldwide. Three additional ISM bands exist in the <b>microwave</b> <b>frequencies,</b> but are not used for microwave cooking. Two of them are centered on 5.8 GHz and 24.125 GHz, but are not used for microwave cooking because of the very high cost of power generation at these frequencies. The third, centered on 433.92 MHz, is a narrow band that would require expensive equipment to generate sufficient power without creating interference outside the band, and is only available in some countries.|$|E

40|$|Germination is a {{key process}} in plants' phenological cycles. Accelerating this process could lead to {{improvment}} of the seedling growth {{as well as the}} cultivation efficiency. To achieve this, the effect of <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> on the germination of rice seeds was examined. The physiological feedbacks of the MR 219 rice variety in terms of seed germination rate (GR), germination percentage (GP), and mean germination time (MGT) were analyzed by exposing its seeds to 2450 [*]MHz of <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> for one, four, seven, and ten hours. It was revealed that exposing the seeds to the <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> for 10 hours resulted in the highest GP. This treatment led to 100 % of germination after three days with a mean germination time of 2. 1 days. Although the other exposure times of <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> caused the moderate effects on germination with a GPa 3 ranged from 93 % to 98 %, they failed to reduce the MGTa 3. The results showed that ten-hour exposure times of <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> for six days significantly facilitated and improved the germination indices (primary shoot and root length). Therefore, the technique is expected to benefit the improvement of rice seed germination considering its simplicity and efficacy in increasing the germination percentage and rate as well as the primary shoot and root length without causing any environmental toxicity...|$|R
25|$|After several {{rejected}} models, Russell {{devised a}} way to use velocity modulation to allow electrons to flow in bunches and to control their speed. The concept of velocity modulation he used had already been described by A. Arsenjewa Heil and Oskar Heil in 1935, though the Varians were unlikely to have known of the work. The brothers and Hansen ultimately created the klystron, the first tube that could generate electromagnetic waves at <b>microwave</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Russell was responsible for the design and Sigurd built the first prototype, which was completed in August1937.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} free {{electrons}} in the ionosphere, {{in conjunction with}} the earth's magnetic field, causes Faraday rotation, a sort of circular birefringence. This is the same mechanism which can rotate the axis of linear polarization by electrons in interstellar space as mentioned below. The magnitude of Faraday rotation caused by such a plasma is greatly exaggerated at lower frequencies, so at the higher <b>microwave</b> <b>frequencies</b> used by satellites the effect is minimal. However medium or short wave transmissions received following refraction by the ionosphere are strongly affected. Since a wave's path through the ionosphere and the earth's magnetic field vector along such a path are rather unpredictable, a wave transmitted with vertical (or horizontal) polarization will generally have a resulting polarization in an arbitrary orientation at the receiver.|$|E
25|$|Coaxial cables are {{commonly}} used at audio frequencies and above for convenience. A coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a dielectric layer. The current flowing {{on the surface of}} the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the outer tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. Coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5GHz. For <b>microwave</b> <b>frequencies</b> greater than 5GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making waveguides a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. Coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We propose an {{approach}} for {{the measurement of}} <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> in the optical domain with adjustable mea-surement range and resolution. In the proposed approach, two optical wavelengths with a large wavelength spacing are modulated by an unknown microwave signal in a Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM). The optical output from the MZM is sent to a dispersive fiber to introduce different chromatic dispersions, leading to dif-ferent microwave power penalties. The two wavelengths are then separated, with the microwave powers measured by two photode-tectors. A fixed relationship between the microwave power ratio and the <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> is established. The microwave fre-quency is estimated by measuring the two <b>microwave</b> powers. The <b>frequency</b> measurement range and resolution can be adjusted by tuning the wavelength spacing. Different frequency measurement ranges and resolutions are demonstrated experimentally.

25|$|Waveguides {{are similar}} to coaxial cables, as both consist of tubes, with the biggest {{difference}} being that the waveguide has no inner conductor. Waveguides can have any arbitrary cross section, but rectangular cross sections are the most common. Because waveguides {{do not have an}} inner conductor to carry a return current, waveguides cannot deliver energy by means of an electric current, but rather by means of a guided electromagnetic field. Although surface currents do flow on the inner walls of the waveguides, those surface currents do not carry power. Power is carried by the guided electromagnetic fields. The surface currents are set up by the guided electromagnetic fields and have the effect of keeping the fields inside the waveguide and preventing leakage of the fields to the space outside the waveguide. Waveguides have dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the alternating current to be transmitted, so they are only feasible at <b>microwave</b> <b>frequencies.</b> In addition to this mechanical feasibility, electrical resistance of the non-ideal metals forming the walls of the waveguide cause dissipation of power (surface currents flowing on lossy conductors dissipate power). At higher frequencies, the power lost to this dissipation becomes unacceptably large.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to achieving <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> multiplication with a continuously tunable multiplication factor using an unbalanced temporal pulse shaping (TPS) system is proposed and demonstrated. The proposed TPS system {{consists of a}} Mach-Zehnder modulator and two dispersive elements having opposite dispersion values.

40|$|In an ECR {{ion source}} many {{parameters}} {{are related to}} the heating of the electrons. The amplitude of the electric field {{is one of the main}} factors.

Since the ionization becomes more and more difficult when the charge state increases the ionization has to be as efficient as possible. How will the gradient of the magnetic field and the <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> affect the energy of the electron? The computer code to reveal information about these parameters has been developed. The simulations have shown that more efficient heating will be achieved with higher <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> and with smaller gradient of the magnetic field.
