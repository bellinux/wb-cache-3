40|$|Abstract. Methods for modal {{identification}} and structural model updating are employed to develop high fidelity {{finite element models}} of an experimental vehicle model using accelera-tion measurements. The identification of modal characteristics of the vehicle is based on ac-celeration time histories obtained from impulse hammer tests. An available modal identification software is used to obtain the modal characteristics from {{the analysis of the}} various sets of vibration measurements. A high modal density modal model is obtained. The modal characteristics are then used to update an increasingly complex set of finite element models of the vehicle. A multi-objective structural identification method is used for estimating the parameters of the finite element structural models based on minimizing the modal residu-als. The method results in multiple Pareto optimal structural models that are consistent with the measured modal data and the modal residuals used to measure the discrepancies between the measured <b>modal</b> <b>values</b> and the <b>modal</b> <b>values</b> predicted by the model. Single objective structural identification methods are also evaluated as special cases of the proposed multi-objective identification method. The multi-objective framework and the corresponding compu-tational tools provide the whole spectrum of optimal models and can thus be viewed as a gen...|$|R
