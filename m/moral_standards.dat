5|$|Neither {{of these}} {{children}} were recognised by Belgrano in his will, where {{he said he had}} no children. However, it is thought that he did not mention them in order to protect their mothers, as both children were the result of relations that the <b>moral</b> <b>standards</b> of the society of the day would not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the <b>moral</b> <b>standards</b> then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E

"Guilt" [...] is the {{obligation}} {{of a person who}} has violated a <b>moral</b> <b>standard</b> to bear the sanctions imposed by that <b>moral</b> <b>standard.</b> In legal terms, guilt means having been found to have violated a criminal law, though law also raises 'the issue of defences, pleas, the mitigation of offences, and the defeasibility of claims'.|$|R

5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner has {{suggested}} that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce <b>moral</b> <b>standards,</b> as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained that Lincoln was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not run on a Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} a CD-ROM drive, but Lincoln made it sound as if the game was unworthy of Nintendo's <b>moral</b> <b>standards.</b> Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance themselves from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|To his supporters, Quisling was {{regarded}} as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, knowledgeable and with an eye for detail. Balanced and gentle to a fault, they believed he cared deeply about his people and maintained high <b>moral</b> <b>standards</b> throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E

5|$|White was {{initially}} {{enrolled at the}} Lombardy Street Public School. After completing his grammar schooling, he matriculated at the Institute for Colored Youth (ICY) in 1853. Founded by the Society of Friends (Quakers), the ICY emphasized high <b>moral</b> <b>standards</b> for its students and offered a classical study of Latin, Greek, and trigonometry. While enrolled, White expressed an acute awareness of black society and psychological concepts in essays he presented. On May 24, 1855, he addressed Governor James Pollock at a special reception for the institute, touching {{on the issue of}} African American citizenship. The same year, White was elected secretary of the Banneker Institute, a student instructional society that convened weekly to have scholarly discussions. White was his class's lone graduate from the ICY on May 6, 1857; he earned praise for his popularity among classmates and professors alike.|$|E
25|$|The {{stress on}} {{personal}} piety {{opened the way}} for the First Great Awakening in the mid 18th century, which pulled people away from the formal rituals of the established church.

40|$|Is it {{possible}} and desirable {{to translate the}} basic principles underlying cosmopolitanism as a <b>moral</b> <b>standard</b> into effective global institutions. Will the ideals of inclusiveness and equal moral concern for all survive the marriage between cosmopolitanism and institutional power? What are the effects of such bureaucratisation of cosmopolitan ideals? This volume examines the strained relationship between cosmopolitanism as a <b>moral</b> <b>standard</b> and the legal institutions in which cosmopolitan norms and principles are to be implemented. Five areas of global concern are analysed: environmental protection, economic regulation, peace and security, the fight against international crimes and migration...|$|R

25|$|Many Humanists adopt {{principles}} of the Golden Rule. Some believe that universal <b>moral</b> <b>standards</b> are required for the proper functioning of society.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} Ernst Tugendhat's {{concept of}} moral obligation and {{his account of}} why the only justifiable <b>moral</b> <b>standard</b> is universalism ("equal moral respect towards all"). The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts, and in the first I argue that Tugendhat presents a plausible idea of moral obligation as constituted by the "inner" sanctions of guilt and resentment. The propositional content of these reactive attitudes must refer to a <b>moral</b> <b>standard,</b> and this thesis provides an extensive discussion of Tugendhat's arguments as to why this standard must be universalism. There are some difficulties, but they can be solved within Tugendhat's own theoretical framework. In the second part I consider criticism that has been levelled from two opposite camps: Jürgen Habermas agrees that universalism is the only defensible <b>moral</b> <b>standard</b> but denies that obligation is constituted through emotional sanctions. Peter Stemmer, on the other hand, agrees that moral obligation consists in emotional sanctions but rejects the claim that universalism can be justified. I argue Tugendhat's account can be defended against this critique and that both Habermas and Stemmer have incoherent accounts of moral obligation...|$|R
6000|$|Nevertheless {{the case}} against such books as this is {{commonly}} stated wrong. The fault of Dickens is not (as is often said) that he [...] "applies the same <b>moral</b> <b>standard</b> to all ages." [...] Every sane man must do that: a <b>moral</b> <b>standard</b> must remain the same or {{it is not a}} <b>moral</b> <b>standard.</b> If we call St. Anthony of Padua a good man, we must mean what we mean when we call Huxley a good man, or else there is no sense in using the word [...] "good." [...] The fault of the Dickens school of popular history lies, not in the application of a plain rule of right and wrong to all circumstances, but in ignorance of the circumstances to which it was applied. It is not that they wrongly enforce the fixed principle that life should be saved; it is that they take a fire-engine to a shipwreck and a lifeboat to a house on fire. The business of a good man in Dickens's time was to bring justice up to date. The business of a good man in Dunstan's time was to toil to ensure the survival of any justice at all.|$|R
