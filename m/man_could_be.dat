25|$|The word molly (also spelt as molley, mollie, mally) is a pet-form of {{the female}} {{forename}} Mary, and had two main connotations in 18th century English. The first one {{is close to the}} word moll, designating a lower-class girl or woman, occasionally a prostitute. The second one is classified as slang, defining an effeminate, usually homosexual, male. Along with the possible perception of intrinsic female features deriving from the association with the name Mary, another possible origin of this denomination for a homosexual <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> found in the Latin form mollis, indicating the supposed passive-effeminate partner in male homosexual relationships.|$|E

[...] Burger adds that this film came {{at the very end}} of the pre-AIDS filmmaking, when [...] "all levels of erotic experience were faithfully documented by the porn industry... <b>men</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> whores, <b>men</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> monogamous or <b>men</b> <b>could</b> cruise the spectrum in between." ...|$|R
25|$|The looting of the city's {{treasury}} {{could not}} have happened {{without the help of}} {{the most powerful man in}} San Francisco, David Broderick, who was a state senator and held tight control over San Francisco from 1851 until his death in 1859. Broderick's corruption was such that no <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> elected to public office unless he made a deal with Broderick to share half the profits from his office. As a result of these backroom deals, Broderick accumulated a large amount of wealth which further strengthened his position as a powerful city boss. As news of the treasury's financial crisis became known, another even larger uprising of enraged citizenry would occur.|$|E
25|$|The authors {{say there}} were two {{possible}} ways of erecting the stauros, which {{would probably have been}} not much higher than the height of a man. The condemned <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, then lifted up on it. Alternatively, it was probably usual to have the stake implanted in the ground before the execution. The victim was tied to the crosspiece and was hoisted up with the horizontal beam and made fast to the vertical stake. They say that as this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the crossbeam (patibulum) was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the crux commissa may be taken as the normal practice.|$|E
25|$|The mayor {{released}} Benga to {{the custody}} of Reverend James M. Gordon, who supervised the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn and made him a ward. That same year Gordon arranged for Benga {{to be cared for}} in Virginia, where he paid for him to acquire American clothes and to have his teeth capped, so the young <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> more readily accepted in local society. Benga was tutored in English and began to work. Several years later, the outbreak of World War I stopped ship passenger travel and prevented his returning to Africa. This, as well as the poor treatment he was subjected to for most of his life, caused Benga to fall into a depression. He committed suicide in 1916 at the age of 32.|$|E

25|$|O'Brien {{was again}} arrested with Irving on June 5, 1878, and transported to {{authorities}} in Brooklyn {{where they were}} wanted for the burglary of Mr. Betterman's dry goods store in Williamsburg in which $5,000 worth of silk and $1,400 in cash were stolen. Neither <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> properly identified, however, and charges were dropped. A little over two months later, the two were arrested {{in the company of}} Gilbert Yost at O'Brien's Brooklyn residence at No. 152 Pachen Avenue. O'Brien was charged with the burglary of Martin Ibert's Sons' flour and grain store on Graham Avenue which had occurred the previous day. He was tried twice for the burglary, both trials ending in a hung jury, and he finally escaped with Irving from Raymond Street jail on June 1, 1879.|$|E
25|$|English Earls are an Anglo-Saxon institution. Around 1014, England {{was divided}} into shires or counties, largely to defend against the Danes; each shire was led by a local great man, called an earl; the same <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> earl of several shires. When the Normans conquered England, they {{continued}} to appoint earls, but not for all counties; the administrative head of the county became the sheriff. Earldoms began as offices, with a perquisite of {{a share of the}} legal fees in the county; they gradually became honours, with a stipend of £20 a year; like most feudal offices, they were inherited, but the kings frequently asked earls to resign or exchange earldoms. Usually there were few Earls in England, and they were men of great wealth in the shire from which they held title, or an adjacent one, but it depended on circumstances: during the civil war between Stephen and the Empress Matilda, nine Earls were created in three years.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Bacon, the {{influential}} work of Pseudo-Geber (sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto) appeared. His Summa Perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity {{with which they}} were described. By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could {{have an effect on the}} human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the human soul). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reunited with God.|$|E

25|$|Among the Aztecs, the god Xolotl was {{a monstrous}} dog. During the {{creation}} of the Fifth Sun, Xolotl was hunted by Death and escaped him by transforming himself first into a sprout of maize, then into maguey leaves and finally as a salamander in a pool of water. The third time that Death found Xolotl, he trapped and killed him. Three important foodstuffs were produced from the body of this mythological dog. Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Dead, had the bones of man in the underworld, kept over from the previous creations. Xolotl descended to the underworld to steal these bones so that <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reborn in the new creation of the Fifth Sun. Xolotl managed to recover the bones and brought man to life by piercing his penis and bleeding upon them. Xolotl was seen as an incarnation of the planet Venus as the Evening Star (the Morning Star was his twin brother Quetzalcoatl). Xolotl was the canine companion of the Sun, following its path through both the sky and the underworld. Xolotl's strong connection with the underworld, death and the dead is demonstrated by the symbols he bore. In the Codex Borbonicus Xolotl is pictured with a knife in his mouth, a symbol of death, and has black wavy hair like the hair worn by the gods of death.|$|E
500|$|In late March 2010, Brothers & Sisters showrunners Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker {{were hired}} as co-executive {{producers}} for Fringe. The two had previously worked with Fringe co-creators Roberto Orci, J.J. Abrams, and Alex Kurtzman on Alias, and again with Abrams on Lost. [...] "The Plateau" [...] {{marked the first}} Fringe episode they co-wrote. Editor Timothy A. Good also joined the series, making [...] "The Plateau" [...] his first Fringe episode. Good called the episode one of two parts– the second half was the season's eighteenth episode [...] "Bloodline", which Breen and Schapker also co-wrote. The episode premise was inspired by executive producer J.H. Wyman's son, {{who came up with}} the idea that a <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> smart enough to predict events. [...] "The Plateau" [...] marked the first appearance of a fringe case in the parallel universe.|$|E
500|$|Kersh's first {{appearance}} in the series was during the sixth season opening episode [...] "The Beginning".

During this time [...] The Smoking <b>Man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> seen in his office, reminiscent of his silent presence in Walter Skinner's office in early seasons. Kersh assigned Mulder and Scully mostly to menial tasks, such as terrorist details and Federal background checks. When they did investigate an X-File behind his back, Kersh would charge them for expenses they incurred on the case, forcing them to pay {{out of their own}} pocket. He also attempted to separate Mulder and Scully, believing that Mulder threw away a promising career as a criminal profiler, but that Scully's career could still be saved.|$|E

500|$|The {{genesis of}} Trial by Jury began in 1868, when Gilbert wrote a single-page {{illustrated}} comic {{piece for the}} magazine Fun entitled Trial by Jury: An Operetta. [...] Drawing on Gilbert's training and brief practice as a barrister, it detailed a [...] "breach of promise" [...] trial going awry, in the process spoofing the law, lawyers and the legal system. [...] (In the Victorian era, a <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> required to pay compensation should he fail to marry a woman to whom he was engaged.) The outline of this story was followed in the later opera, and two of its numbers appeared in nearly their final form in Fun. [...] The skit, however, ended abruptly: the moment the attractive plaintiff stepped into the witness box, the judge leapt into her arms and vowed to marry her, whereas in the opera, the case is allowed to proceed further before this conclusion is reached.|$|E

A creeping barrage in three belts [...] deep began and counter-battery groups bombarded all known German artillery positions with gas shell. The nine attacking divisions and the three in reserve began their advance as the German artillery reply came scattered and late, falling on British assembly trenches after they had been vacated.|$|E
500|$|The MacLeods {{have two}} main branchesSìol Thormoid (Scottish Gaelic: [...] "seed of Tormod") and Sìol Thorcaill ("seed of Torcall"). Sìol Thorcaill was the {{dominant}} family on Lewis from the Late Middle Ages {{until the end}} of the 16th century. The Gaelic names Tormod and Torcall are derived from the Old Norse names Þórmóðr and Þórketill. Thomas noted that these names were also those of two men with Lewis connections, who are both recorded in the 13th-century kings' saga Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar. One of these men was Þórketill Þórmóðsson, who according to the saga, was slain near the Isle of Skye in about the year 1230. Thomas proposed that this <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a grandson of Ljótólfr. Another man who appears in the saga, Þórmóðr Þórkelsson, was forced to flee Lewis, leaving behind his wife, retainers, and goods; according to Thomas, this shows that Þórmóðr was a resident on the island. Thomas noted that Þórmóðr Þórkelsson was married in about 1231, and on the assumption that each generation could be estimated to be 30 years, Thomas gave Þórmóðr's birth at 1201; his (supposed) father, Þórketill, at 1171; Þórketill's father Þórmóðr at 1141; and this man's father at 1111. Thomas concluded that the elder Þórmóðr would have been born at about the time Ljótólfr flourished on Lewis.|$|E

2500|$|A poorer {{man could}} become a [...] "base client" [...] by selling a share in his honour-price, making his lord {{entitled}} to part of any compensation due him. The lord could make him a smaller grant of land or livestock, for which the client paid rent in produce and manual labour.

2500|$|One of {{the more}} common {{offences}} that required excessive punishment was desertion. A <b>man</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> branded with a [...] "D" [...] if captured, and if he re-offended could face execution. Death sentences were not all that common, with hanging normally reserved for murderers, and death by shot employed {{for those who were}} repeat offenders. One such case involved Joseph Stoakes who, between 1728 and 1730, deserted his regiment three times, and upon being captured for the third time was sentenced by court martial to death.|$|E
