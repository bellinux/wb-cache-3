Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E

He noted that one of the Dodge Dealer Council requests was for a Barracuda type vehicle. The overall dealer product recommendation theme was the same - we want what Plymouth has. The specific request for a Mustang type vehicle was not as controversial to Lynn. His direction to me was to give them a specialty car but he said 'for God's sake don't make it a derivative of the Barracuda': i.e. don't make it a Barracuda competitor.|$|E

Griffin also wore white and black fight shorts instead of his trademark tan shorts for the fight. Griffin {{went on to win the}} gory battle by split decision, showing superior striking skills and a stronger ground game than in their previous fight. After the fight Griffin said, “Tito was a great fight for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back, we’ll have to do a third that’s 1-1 man.” With a split decision in both of their fights, Griffin seemed more than willing to get a rubber match put together with Ortiz to settle the score once and for all. “You could tell he was a guy getting ready for Mark Coleman, no offense, and he’s a guy coming off back surgery. We’ll do it again, I won’t break my foot, he’ll be in better shape,” commented Griffin.|$|E

In an interview with IGN, Larter explained her return to the franchise: [...] "When New Line asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, {{and it was really}} terrific." [...] The film made US$90 million worldwide, to a mixed critical reception. A year later, Larter served as an associate producer of and starred in the thriller Three Way, and in 2005, she appeared in the independent political thriller Confess, and had a role in the romantic comedy A Lot Like Love, starring Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher.|$|E

500|$|Cher's {{music plays}} {{a large role}} in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", Chris Carter having written the episode after {{spending}} a summer listening to Cher records and developing a fixation on the singer. Carter knew that Cher's half-sister Georganne LaPiere was a major X-Files fan, and Carter learned through LaPiere that Cher herself was intrigued by the show and would be interested in making an X-Files guest appearance. Sitcom star Roseanne Barr also expressed an interest in guesting on The X-Files, and Carter wrote the part of Shaineh Berkowitz specifically for her. Barr, however, was unavailable at the time of shooting—her projected role was filled by Pattie Tierce— while Cher passed on the proffered cameo appearance performing as herself, a decision for which she later expressed regret: [...] "I wanted them to ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on and act—then they just wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on and sing ... Just to come on and be myself wasn't anything I'd want to do until I saw [...] " [...] — [...] "Had I [...] the quality of [...] I would have done it in a heartbeat." [...] Cher did authorize the use of three of her tracks on the episode's soundtrack including [...] "Walking in Memphis" [...] heard at the episode's conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator Tracey Bell—filmed in longshot or from the back or overheard—as Cher. Although Bell was credited for the role, Cher's fans responded to the episode's premiere with online speculation as to whether the singer had pseudonymously appeared in the episode. [...] Tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself. These casting choices went against a long-standing tradition on The X-Files of only casting actors who were not well-known.|$|E

You will never tire me, and {{just as long as}} you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> I am at your orders.'" [...] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (he said was related to him by Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.|$|E

[...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs.

[...] "I believe God intended <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here for some purpose," [...] he wrote soon after enlisting. [...] "This action has cost me an Officer's Commission, and ... my citizenship may be revoked, [...] this is the most I can do for my country under the circumstances."

His religious views also affected his views on Zionism: he believed that the State of Israel's existence prior to the Second Coming of Christ was contrary to scriptural prophecies, and that it should therefore be destroyed.|$|E
500|$|After Graham's {{potential}} replacements struggled {{during the}} 1955 training camp and preseason, Brown convinced Graham {{to come back}} and play one more year. He was offered a salary of $25,000 ($ today), making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. The Browns lost the opener against the Washington Redskins, but went on to a 9–2–1 regular-season record and another chance at a championship. Graham threw two touchdowns and ran for two more as the Browns beat the Rams 38–14. When Brown took Graham out of the game in the fourth quarter, the crowd in the Los Angeles Coliseum gave him a standing ovation. It was the final performance of a 10-year career in which Graham's team reached the championship each year and won seven. [...] "Nothing would induce <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back", he said later. He was the NFL's passing leader and Most Valuable Player in 1955. He also won the Hickok Belt, awarded to the best professional athlete of the year. Without Graham, the Browns floundered the following year and posted a 5–7 record, their first-ever losing season.|$|E

Owumi became his team's all-time leader in three-pointers, passing Daniel Gilbert for a total of 169. He collected five three-pointers in another 30-point game on December 14, as Worcester fell to the Cheshire Phoenix.
