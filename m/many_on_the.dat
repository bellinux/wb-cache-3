5|$|A series frontiersmen {{assemblies}} {{were held}} {{over several years}} across the Willamette Valley, with <b>many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> French Prairie at Champoeg. The death of prominent settler Ewing Young on 9 February 1841, who left neither a will or had an heir in Oregon Country, left the future of his property uncertain. Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised {{to discuss the matter}} on the 17th. He proposed the creation of an authority over the pioneers centered on a governor. French-Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge and a few other positions were appointed.|$|E
5|$|McNallen is a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Heathen and wider Pagan community. His espousal of right-wing ethnonationalist ideas and his insistence that Heathenry should be reserved for those of Northern European ancestry has resulted in accusations of racism from both Pagans and the mainstream media. Conversely, <b>many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> extreme right of the Heathen movement have {{accused him of being}} a race traitor for his opposition to Neo-Nazism and refusal to endorse white supremacism.|$|E
5|$|Not all Heathens {{practice}} seiðr; {{given its}} associations {{with both the}} ambiguity of sexuality and gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms, <b>many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Heathen movement's right wing disapprove of it. Although there are heterosexual male practitioners, seiðr is largely associated with women and gay men. One member of the Troth, Edred Thorsson, developed forms of seiðr which involved sex magic utilizing sado-masochistic techniques, something which generated controversy in the community. Part of the discomfort that some Heathens feel toward seiðr surrounds {{the lack of any}} criteria by which the community can determine whether the seiðr-worker has genuinely received divine communication, and the fear that it will be used by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige.|$|E

5|$|Returning to the United States {{after the}} war, Olds was {{assigned}} at West Point {{as an assistant}} football coach for Red Blaik. Apparently resented by <b>many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> staff for his rapid rise in rank and plethora of combat decorations, Olds transferred in February 1946 to the 412th Fighter Group at March Field, California, to fly the P-80 Shooting Star, which began a career-long professional struggle with superiors he viewed as more promotion- than warrior-minded.|$|E
5|$|Sue Bailey Thurman (née, Sue Elvie Bailey; August 26, 1903 – December 25, 1996) was an American author, lecturer, {{historian}} {{and civil rights}} activist. She was the first non-white student to earn a bachelor's degree in music from Oberlin College, Ohio. She briefly taught at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, before becoming involved in international work with the YWCA in 1930. During a six-month trip through Asia in the mid 1930s, Thurman became the first African-American woman to have an audience with Mahatma Gandhi. The meeting with Gandhi inspired Thurman and her husband, theologian Howard Thurman, to promote non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} creating social change, bringing it to the attention of a young preacher, Martin Luther King Jr. While they did not actively protest during the Civil Rights Movement, they served as spiritual counselors to <b>many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front lines, and helped establish the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States.|$|E

25|$|After {{the verdict}} was read, a juror told the press that while Miller's memory may have been bad, <b>many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> jury felt sympathy for her {{due to the nature}} of her cross-examination.

25|$|In 1887 Zitkála-Šá {{returned}} to the Yankton Reservation {{to live with her}} mother. She spent three years there. She was dismayed to realize that, while she still longed for the native Sioux traditions, she no longer fully belonged to them.

25|$|The {{election}} race's {{major developments}} in October 2005 centred on Craig Chandler and David Crutcher, whom many Alberta Alliance members began increasingly attacking {{for what they}} viewed as undesirable spin and campaign tactics. These tactics included attacking leadership candidates, former election, some party policies and the provincial council. The Crutcher team believes <b>many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> council, including Eleanor Maroes, the interim leader, are actively campaigning for other candidates against party rules.|$|E

The Chittagong Hill Tracts People's Association (CHTPA) petitioned the Bengal Boundary Commission that, since the CHTs were inhabited largely by non-Muslims, they should remain within India. Since they had no official representation, there was no official discussion on the matter, and <b>many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indian side assumed the CHT would be awarded to India.|$|E
25|$|Taxes: Sarkozy avoided {{taking a}} {{position}} on the ISF (solidarity tax on wealth). This is considered an ideological symbol by <b>many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left and right. Some in the business world and on the liberal right, such as Alain Madelin, wanted it abolished. For Sarkozy, that would have risked being categorised by the left as a gift to the richest classes of society at a time of economic difficulties.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} test of West's {{political}} outlook was the Bolshevik Revolution. <b>Many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left {{saw it as}} the beginning of a new, better world, {{and the end of the}} crimes of capitalism. West regarded herself as a member of the left, having attending Fabian socialist summer schools as a girl. But to West, both the Revolution and the revolutionaries were suspect. Even before the Bolsheviks took power in October 1917, West expressed her doubts that events in Russia could serve as a model for socialists in Britain or anywhere else.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{questions}} about the environment have become increasingly politicized, with the Left generally accepting the findings of environmental scientists about global warming and <b>many</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Right disputing or rejecting those findings. However, the left is divided over how to effectively and equitably reduce carbon emissions: the center-left often advocates a reliance on market measures such as emissions trading or a carbon tax, while those further to the left tend to support direct government regulation and intervention either alongside or instead of market mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The Magpies {{dropped back}} to the third tier Ron Massey Cup in 2013, with members voting to field a {{separate}} NSW Cup team in 2014, although this did not eventuate.
