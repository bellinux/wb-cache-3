50|$|For polyatomic molecules, progressions {{are most}} often {{observed}} when the change in bond lengths upon electronic excitation coincides with the change due to a ″totally symmetric″ vibration. This is the same process that occurs in resonance Raman spectroscopy.

This produces a long progression in the C-O stretching vibration. Another example is furnished by benzene, C6H6.

30|$|In an acidic {{environment}} {{and at a}} high temperature, methenamine can release <b>methanal</b> (formaldehyde), and the released <b>methanal</b> can react with polyacrylamide (PAM) and resorcinol to generate phenolic resin via a polycondensation process. Phenolic resin can react further with PAM to produce linear polymers that can block channels (Noller 1965; Xing et al. 2005). Under normal reservoir conditions, an acid (such as HCl solution) is injected to trigger the chain reactions. While {{in the process of}} CO 2 flooding, CO 2 dissolves in formation water and reduces its pH to 2 – 4 (an acidic environment) (Raje et al. 1999; Hild and Wackowski 1999; Cai 2010; Zhang et al. 2013 b, c), then the gel system can become CO 2 -sensitive that only works in high-permeability zones where CO 2 can readily breakthrough or channel out. Therefore, the gel system can selectively block the high-permeability zones or gas channels. The reaction mechanisms involved are as follows: (1) CO 2 dissolves in formation water and generates carbonic acid in situ. Carbonic acid creates an acidic environment that is conductive to the formation of gels. (2) Methenamine releases <b>methanal</b> in the acidic environment at relatively high temperatures. (3) Multi-hydroxymethyl resorcinol may be formed through the reaction between <b>methanal</b> and resorcinol, and via polycondensation of multi-hydroxymenthyl resorcinol, phenolic resin is formed.

For the reactions of <b>methanal</b> and methanoic acid with H atoms and OH, HO 2, and CH 3 radicals, the calculated relative electronic energies were obtained with the CCSD(T) /cc-pVXZ (where X = D, T, and Q) method and were extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. The electronic energies obtained with the CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ method were benchmarked against the CCSD(T) /CBS energies and were found to be within 1 kcal mol(- 1) of one another. Thus, the energies calculated using the less expensive CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ method were used in all of the reaction mechanisms and in calculating our high-pressure limit rate constants for the title reactions.

This discovery, using three [FeFe]-hydrogenases that are homologous about the active site but otherwise structurally distinct, was made by protein film electrochemistry, which measures the activity (as electrical current) of enzymes immobilized on an electrode; importantly, the inhibitor can be removed after addition. Formaldehyde causes rapid loss of proton reduction activity which is restored when the solution is exchanged. Inhibition is confirmed by conventional solution assays. The effect depends strongly on the direction of catalysis: inhibition of H(2) oxidation is much weaker than for H(2) production, and formaldehyde also protects against CO and O(2) inactivation.

Mesoporous SnO 2 calcined at 400  °C exhibits the highest response, and its response to 200  ppm ethanol reaches 41.6, which {{is much higher than}} that calcined at 350 and 450  °C. Figure  6 c displays the response-recovery curves of the mesoporous SnO 2 sensors for ethanol, which are tested under the same conditions (the operating temperature is 200  °C) {{in order to make a}} comparison. It revealed that the response speed of the SnO 2 - 400  °C sensor is higher than SnO 2 - 350  °C and SnO 2 - 450  °C. The response and recovery time of the SnO 2 - 400  °C sensor was 31 and 2  s, respectively. With the ethanol concentration increasing from 10 to 200  ppm, the gas-sensing properties curves show an increasing tendency, and the maximum response was 41.6 at 200  ppm. However, when the concentration of ethanol continuously increased to 400  ppm, their sensitivity are decreased and shows a leveling off from 400 to 2000  ppm, because the sensitivity of the sensors was saturated. Moreover, the responses of SnO 2 - 350  °C and SnO 2 - 450  °C show the similar varying tendency, but the responses are much lower than those of SnO 2 - 400  °C. Selectivity is another important parameter to evaluate the sensing ability of a gas sensor [51, 52]. Figure  6 d shows a bar graph of the mesoporous SnO 2 sensors with different calcined temperatures to 200  ppm of ethanol, <b>methanal,</b> methanol, and acetone at the operating temperature of 200  °C. As shown in Fig.  6 d, the sensors exhibit the highest response to ethanol against other target gases. In addition, the sensors are less sensitive to acetone. Meanwhile, the response of the mesoporous SnO 2 calcined at 350, 400, and 450  °C to 200  ppm of ethanol is 9.3, 41.6, and 30.5, respectively. It can also be observed that the responses of the SnO 2 - 350  °C sensor to 200  ppm of ethanol, <b>methanal,</b> acetone, and methanol are less than 10 at 200  °C. These results demonstrate that the as-prepared mesoporous SnO 2 sensors can selectively detect ethanol vapors with the interference of other gases and have a good performance in the operating temperature and response/recovery time.|$|E
