5000|$|The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) defines human-computer {{interaction}} as [...] "a discipline {{concerned with the}} design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them". An important facet of HCI is the securing of user satisfaction (or simply End User Computing Satisfaction)."Because {{human-computer interaction}} studies a human and a machine in communication, it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side. On the machine side, techniques in computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages, and development environments are relevant. On the human side, communication theory, graphic and industrial design disciplines, linguistics, social sciences, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and human factors such as computer user satisfaction are relevant. And, of course, engineering and design methods are relevant." [...] Due to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI, people {{with a variety of}} different backgrounds contribute to its success.

Agents continuously exchange information in their respective neighbourhoods while self-organization takes place. The society functions on a scale between total autonomy and a platform that accommodates compelling <b>man-machine</b> <b>interactions,</b> providing an adaptive musical playground. Agents associate spontaneously into temporary clusters, viewed as emergent structures. These clusters are considered the result of perpetual self-production following the theory of autopoiesis.

50|$|Roberto Paci Dalò has {{developed}} a multi-layered language out of his background in sound and visual arts, which combines the spoken language with body and architecture. His work uses new technologies in combination with an analysis on classical tragic drama. The areas of work of Roberto Paci Dalò includes robotics, cybernetics, <b>man-machine</b> <b>interaction,</b> psychoacoustics, realtime video and sound processing. He wrote, composed and directed since 1985 about 30 music-theatre works presented worldwide. He composed music for acoustical ensembles, electronics, voices {{and a large number}} of radioworks produced by European broadcasting corporations. His production of films and videos is regularly presented in international festivals. His dramaturgical materials are frequently re-composed in sound and video installations - often site specific and interactive - presented in museums, galleries, and the public space. As performer he developed extended techniques on the clarinet and with electronics and sampler. His performances range from solo to electro-acoustical ensembles and improvised music projects in collaboration with other artists. His interest in traditional cultures brought him into explorations and field researches through the Mediterranean, Eastern Europe, Balkans and the North West European islands. He works on expansions of radio language(s) especially through his long term collaboration with ORF Kunstradio. Among his on-site/on-air/on-line projects: La Natura Ama Nascondersi (Kunstradio 1992), Napoli (Nantes 1994, official selection Prix Italia), La lunga notte (1993, award EBU/UER), Lost Memories (Graz 1994, official selection Prix Futura), Many Many Voices (Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlino 1995, CD Edel Records / Akademie der Künste Berlin), Fuori Luogo (commissioned by SFB Sender Freies Berlin for the Prix Europa 98 opening), OZ (SFB / Sonambiente 1996), Italia anno zero (2005), L'assedio delle ceneri (RAI, 2008). Urban explorations is a fundamental aspect of his work. He collects soundscapes {{since the beginning of the}} 80's. His interest in urban spaces brought him to the creation of a corpus of sound and visual work based on this research. Some of this activity is documented on-line in the permanent website Atlas Linz (since 1998) created in collaboration with the Ars Electronica Center Linz. The site is conceived as an open net space devoted to urban explorations and interventions. He develops interfaces and software/hardware in different research centres & foundations.|$|E

40|$|Visual {{biofeedback}} {{with information}} about the patients' degree of activity is a valuable adjunct to robot-assisted gait training as means of increasing the motivation and participation of the patients during highly repetitive training sessions. In the driven gait orthosis (DGO) Lokomat, an estimation of the patient's activity level was based on <b>man-machine</b> <b>interaction</b> forces as measured at the hip and knee actuators of the exoskeletal device. In an early approach, theoretical assumptions about the expected <b>man-machine</b> <b>interaction</b> forces, due to the varying behavior of the patients, were formulated for the calculation of quantitative biofeedback. In contrast to this theory-based approach, we have developed a novel method where the biofeedback calculations were based on measured reference <b>man-machine</b> <b>interaction</b> force profiles of healthy subjects when walking with different degrees of activity. To account for intrasubject and intersubject variability, reference force profiles were processed in a model to generate multiple force profiles describing each activity state. To estimate the activity of a subject walking in the DGO, the <b>man-machine</b> <b>interaction</b> force profile was measured, matched {{to each of the}} generated force profiles, and the best fitting profile of the different activity states was identified by the smallest Euclidian distance, respectively. By calculating the difference between these Euclidian distances, a quantitative estimate of the patient's degree of activity was obtained. The novel method was evaluated and compared to the conventional approach in a study with 18 healthy subjects. This comparison showed that the novel method was more reliable in detecting different activity states and is, therefore, a promising approach for future biofeedback systems...|$|E

30|$|Here, the psychological/work science {{comes into}} play.

It is crucial to exactly identify which tasks in these interactions are “handed over” to the robot and which remain by the human. In contrast to applications of industrial robots, service tasks are characterized by a close costumer–client relation, often even including direct contact, which results in a number of implications in terms of design and utilization of service robots. Moreover, the author points to the fact that usability criteria must be augmented, firstly, by characteristics covering the hardware and software technology components of the robot and, secondly, by criteria that pertain to the “relationship quality” of the robot.|$|R

The measure of symmetry is an elaborate difference between {{the internal and external}} symmetry kernels of an object. The idea here is to use the evolution of the symmetry measure of a face over an ordered set of its sub-images. We claim that different evolutionary trends will represent different face expressions. The proposed signature has been tested on several face databases (psychological image collection at stirling and jaffe). Experimental results indicate that the proposed signature characterizes normal from happy expression with a good accuracy...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUser {{simulation}} {{has become}} an important trend {{of research in the}} field of spoken dialog systems because collecting and annotating real <b>man-machine</b> <b>interactions</b> with users is often expensive and time consuming. Yet, such data are generally required for designing and assessing efficient dialog systems.
