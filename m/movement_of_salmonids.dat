40|$|The {{inability}} to identify natal origins (i. e., individual rivers and hatcheries) of adult Pacific {{salmon in the}} ocean has impeded our understanding of their ocean ecology and the management of mixed-stock fisheries. Strontium isotope (87 Sr: 86 Sr) ratios recorded in otoliths of fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from all major natural and hatchery spawning sites in the California Central Valley {{can be used as}} natural tags to identify natal origins with high accuracy (82 %) and improved when additional otolith markers identified fish to hatchery (98 %) or naturally spawned (94 %) sources. A spatial baseline of 87 Sr: 86 Sr signatures was developed by targeting 87 Sr: 86 Sr within juvenile portions of otoliths accreted in natal streams and hatcheries using laser ablation and a multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The availability and analyses of known-origin coded wire tagged adults provides a rare test of this technique to reconstruct early life-histories of adults (90 % correct classification). By quantifying the area of watershed influenced by granitic rocks using hydrologic and geologic data layers, we explained 94 % of the geographic variability in 87 Sr: 86 Sr in salmon otoliths.

Prior to its listing, however, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources requested the development of measures to allow for the free <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonids</b> through the nominated area via artificial in-stream structures. This report introduces a pioneering effort to modify check dams in order to improve ecosystem linkages. The River Construction Working Group has intensively discussed and implemented restoration projects for three years, and the results have been monitored after implementation. Of 44 streams within the Shiretoko World Natural Heritage Site, 14 streams have had one or more in-stream structure(s) built. A total of 123 structures, mainly soil conservation dams, are distributed sporadically in these streams. Following assessment, the Working Group concluded that it would be reasonable to modify 31 structures in 5 streams, including 18 structures that were to be modified before listing. The most suitable design that met local stream conditions was selected, after accounting for salmon passage, adverse impacts on stream environments above and below the construction sites and on fishing grounds, efficiency of construction and ease of post-modification maintenance. Working in cooperation among the group members and parties concerned, we succeeded in restoring salmonids' upstream runs and extending their spawning habitat in streams above some of the dams, while keeping the disaster prevention function of the dams intact...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStudying the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> {{individuals}} in the wild {{has always been a}} challenge in ecology. However, estimating such movement is essential in life sciences as it is the base-line for evaluating connectivity, a major component in developing management and conservation plans. Furthermore, movement, or migration, is an essential parameter in population genetics, as it directly affects genetic differentiation. The development of highly variable markers has allowed genetic discrimination between individuals within populations and at larger scales, and the availability of high-throughput technologies means that many samples and hence many individuals can be screened. These advances mean that we can now use genetic identification for tracking individuals, and hence follow both survival and reproductive output through the life cycle.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of GeographyLisa M. B. HarringtonWhile {{environmental}} concerns {{have played a}} secondary role in dam removal rationales thus far, the Condit and Elwha removal projects could signal a change in governmental and public priorities in dam management in the United States (Born et al. 1998; Bednarek 2002). For this research, I compared two dam removal projects designed to restore native salmon runs in two rivers in Washington State: the Condit Dam on the White Salmon River and the Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams on the Elwha River. This thesis asks: given choices of preserving dams that produce clean electricity and the well-established lake-based habitats created by their reservoirs or re-establishing a free-flowing river to reestablish fish and wildlife populations, how are decisions made, and what does the process and outcome mean to local communities? Research interview data was used in combination with policy documents to answer three research questions: 1) What factors affect decision-makers’ and other stakeholders’ support for (or rejection of) dam removal? 2) How did stakeholders’ perceptions and opinions {{play a role in}} the decision-making process? and 3) What can we learn from problems and successes evident from the dam removal decision processes? The main factors influencing both the Condit Project and the Elwha Project were environmental (salmon restoration), political (meeting legislative requirements for fish passage), and economic (finding the least cost fish passage alternative). The primary motivation for both projects was salmon restoration via the provision of federally mandated fish passage. The possibility of regaining a valuable resource spurred Tribal, federal, and state agencies to advocate for the removal alternative. Dam owners in both cases desired the least cost option, resulting either in their consent to removal (Condit Project) or selling the dams and relinquishing responsibility to the federal government (Elwha Project). Both took over two decades to complete and were removed in 2011. Perceptions of the relative importance of removal/retention options and dissatisfaction with the decision-making process led to polarization of the communities affected by the dam removals and contributed to the 20 + year project timelines. In order to promote good will and understanding between decision makers and stakeholders, two lessons can be learned from the Condit and Elwha Projects: 1) actively seek to include both proponents and opponents in decision-making and 2) establish robust communication among stakeholders and decision makers. Additionally, preliminary evidence indicates that dam removal does result in <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonids</b> to river reaches that had been blocked by dams, and dam removal may also lead to unintended consequences related to local environmental quality and resource access, such as short term air quality concerns and longer term effects on groundwater availability...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Apache trout (Oncorhynchus gilae apache) are {{a federally}} {{threatened}} salmonid endemic to the White Mountains of east-central Arizona. Nonnative salmonids can prey on, compete with and hybridize with Apache trout, and have thus {{been identified as}} a major threat to this species. Emplacement of fish migration barriers (primarily of gabion construction) on selected streams {{is one of the major}} recovery actions being used to isolate and protect upstream populations from nonnative salmonids; however, the effectiveness of this recovery action has not been evaluated. We evaluated the success of constructed barriers at preventing the upstream <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> nonnative <b>salmonids.</b> We also evaluated if barriers affected Apache trout population characteristics by examining condition and size structure above and below barriers.

Our objectives were to (1) evaluate upstream and downstream <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> these three native species past a small dam built to divert irrigation water from the stream and a barrier constructed to prevent upstream <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> nonnative <b>salmonids</b> and (2) describe population characteristics in stream segments created by these structures. Our results indicated that upstream and downstream <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the three target fishes were common. Fish of all three species moved frequently downstream over both structures, displayed some upstream movements over the irrigation diversion dam, and did not move upstream over the fish barrier. Spawning migrations by some fish into an intermittent tributary, which was not separated from Muddy Creek by a barrier, were observed for all three species. Both the irrigation diversion dam and the fish barrier contributed to fragmentation of the native fish populations, and considerable differences in population features were observed among segments.

We evaluated the short-term <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> stream-dwelling <b>salmonids</b> by recapture <b>of</b> marked individuals during {{day and night}} snorkeling and backpack electrofishing. Bull trout Salvelinus confluentus and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were captured in sufficient numbers to evaluate instream movements {{and the influence of}} stream habitat on movement. Salmonids moved upstream more often than downstream, which suggests that fish fled in response to sampling procedures. Fish movement rates were related to sampling method and stream habitat characteristics. The proportion of bull trout (mean total length, 148 mm) moving upstream from a 50 -m reach was 28 % for day snorkeling, 25 % for night snorkeling, and 18 % for single-pass electrofishing. The likelihood <b>of</b> rainbow trout <b>movement</b> upstream during sampling declined as the percentage of rubble substrate increased.

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} is {{a growing}} problem worldwide. Particularly in river systems, numerous dams and weirs hamper the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> {{a wide variety of}} species. With the aim to preserve connectivity for fish, many barriers in river systems are equipped with fishways (also called fish passages or fish ladders). However, few fishways provide full connectivity. Here we hypothesized that restricted seasonal opening times of fishways can importantly reduce their effectiveness by interfering with the timing of fish migration, for both spring- and autumn-spawning species. We empirically tested our hypothesis, and discuss the possible eco-evolutionary consequences of affected migration timing. We analyzed <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> two <b>salmonid</b> fishes, spring-spawning European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and autumn-spawning brown trout (Salmo trutta), in Norway’s two largest river systems. We compared their timing of upstream passage through four fishways collected over 28 years with the timing <b>of</b> fish <b>movements</b> in unfragmented river sections as monitored by radiotelemetry. Confirming our hypothesis, late opening of fishways delayed the migration of European grayling in spring, and early closure of fishways blocked migration for brown trout on their way to spawning locations during late autumn. We show in a theoretical framework how restricted opening times of fishways can induce shifts from migratory to resident behavior in potamodromous partial migration systems, and propose that this can induce density-dependent effects among fish accumulating in lower regions of rivers. Hence, fragmentation may not only directly affect the migratory individuals in the population, but may also have effects that cascade downstream and alter circumstances for resident fish. Fishway functionality is inadequate if there is a mismatch between natural fish movements and fishway opening times in the same river system, with ecological and possibly evolutionary consequences for fish populations...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} exists that some marine animals perceive and orient to local distortions in the earth's main static geomagnetic field. The magnetic fields produced by undersea electric power cables that carry electricity from hydrokinetic energy sources to shore-based power stations may produce similar local distortions in the earth's main field. Concerns exist that animals migrating along the continental shelves might orient to {{the magnetic field}} from the cables, and move either inshore or offshore away from their normal path. We have studied {{the effect of the}} Trans Bay Cable (TBC), an 85 -km long, high voltage, direct current (DC) transmission line leading underwater from Pittsburg, CA to San Francisco, CA, on fishes migrating through the San Francisco Estuary. These included Chinook salmon smolts (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that migrate downstream through the San Francisco Estuary to the Pacific Ocean and adult green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), which migrate upstream from the ocean through the estuary to their spawning habitat in the upper Sacramento River and return to the ocean after spawning occurs. Based on a detailed gradiometer survey, we found that the distortions in the earth's main field produced by bridges across the estuary were much greater than those from the Trans Bay Cable. The former anomalies exceeded the latter by an order of magnitude or more. Significant numbers of tagged Chinook salmon smolts migrated past bridges, which produced strong magnetic anomalies, to the Golden Gate Bridge, where they were recorded by dual arrays of acoustic tag-detecting monitors moored in lines across the mouth of the bay. In addition, adult green sturgeon successfully swam upstream and downstream through the estuary on the way to and from their spawning grounds.
