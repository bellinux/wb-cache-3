25|$|In PLD, a large {{supersaturation}} {{occurs on}} the substrate during the pulse duration. The pulse lasts around 10–40 microseconds {{depending on the}} laser parameters. This high supersaturation causes a very large nucleation density on the surface as compared to <b>molecular</b> <b>beam</b> <b>epitaxy</b> or sputtering deposition.

Using a variety of electron spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, and first-principles simulations, we describe the chemical-physical mechanisms activated by SuMBE resulting in graphene growth. In particular, we find a crucial role of high-kinetic energy deposition in enhancing the organic/inorganic interface interaction, to control the cage openings and to improve the growing film quality. These results, while discussed in the specific case of graphene on copper, are potentially extendable to different metallic or semiconductor substrates and where lower processing temperature is desirable.

25|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} is {{only one}} of many thin film deposition techniques. Other methods include <b>molecular</b> <b>beam</b> <b>epitaxy</b> (MBE), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sputter deposition (RF, magnetron, and ion beam). The history of laser-assisted film growth started soon after the technical realization of the first laser in 1960 by Maiman. Smith and Turner utilized a ruby laser to deposit the first thin films in 1965, three years after Breech and Cross studied the laser-vaporization and excitation of atoms from solid surfaces. However, the deposited films were still inferior to those obtained by other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and <b>molecular</b> <b>beam</b> <b>epitaxy.</b> In the early 1980s, a few research groups (mainly in the former USSR) achieved remarkable results on manufacturing of thin film structures utilizing laser technology. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Dijkkamp, Xindi Wu and Venkatesan were able to laser deposit a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7, a high temperature superconductive material, which was of superior quality to that of films deposited with alternative techniques. Since then, the technique of pulsed laser deposition has been utilized to fabricate high quality crystalline films, such as doped garnet thin films for use as planar waveguide lasers. The deposition of ceramic oxides, nitride films, metallic multilayers and various superlattices has been demonstrated. In the 1990s the development of new laser technology, such as lasers with high repetition rate and short pulse durations, made PLD a very competitive tool for the growth of thin, well defined films with complex stoichiometry.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{bottom-up}} techniques build or {{grow larger}} structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, self-assembly and positional assembly. Dual polarisation interferometry is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another {{variation of the}} bottom-up approach is <b>molecular</b> <b>beam</b> <b>epitaxy</b> or MBE. Researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key {{to the discovery of}} the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of spintronics.|$|E

It {{is widely}} used in materials such as GaAs, AlGaAs, InGaAs and InAlAs grown by <b>molecular</b> <b>beam</b> <b>epitaxy</b> (MBE). Cross-rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for printed circuit boards in surface-mount technology.

40|$|The {{effects of}} nanoholes, grown by <b>molecular</b> <b>beam</b> droplet <b>epitaxy,</b> on the {{electrical}} properties of quantum well (QW) heterostructures are reported. To investigate how {{the depth of}} nanoholes affect the electrical properties of the QW heterostructures, the growth conditions for nanoholes were optimized {{with respect to their}} depth and density. Using the results of the optimization of the nanohole growth, three InGaAs pseudomorphic quantum wells with nanoholes were investigated with varied depth and a constant density. A QW heterostructure without nanoholes was grown as a reference structure. For all the samples, temperature dependent Hall effect measurements, noise studies as a function of both bias and temperature, and temperature dependent current-voltage (I-V) measurements have been carried out {{to examine the effects of}} nanoholes on the QW heterostructures. The Hall effect measurements revealed clear correlation between the depth of the nanoholes and the electrical characteristics of the QW systems such as Hall mobility and sheet electron density. Besides an increase in the mobility and carrier density, the nanoholes lead to a significant reduction of 1 /f noise due to a decrease in the Hooge parameter, which can be advantageous for the fabrication of high performance electronic devices. In addition, it was shown that the nanoholes change the energy spectrum of the QW heterostructures which affects carrier transport in the QWs and metal-semiconductor interface. The changes of the energy spectrum were clued in by the variation of carrier activation energy, appearance of a new deep state in the band gap of an AlGaAs barrier layer that affect carrier kinetics and fluctuation phenomena in the present material system. The results of this thesis show a potential of nanoholes grown by droplet epitaxy as a promising candidate for modulation of material properties and fabrication of advanced material systems for electronic and optoelectronic application...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{innovations}} in experimental {{techniques such as}} <b>molecular</b> and cluster <b>beam</b> <b>epitaxy,</b> supersonic jet expansion, matrix isolation and chemical synthesis are increasingly enabling researchers to produce materials by design and with atomic dimension. These materials constrained by sire, shape, and symmetry range from clusters containing as few as two atoms to nanoscale materials consisting of thousands of atoms. They possess unique structuraI, electronic, magnetic and optical properties that depend strongly on their size and geometry. The availability of these materials raises many fundamental questions as weIl as technological possibilities. From the academic viewpoint, the most pertinent question concerns {{the evolution of the}} atomic and electronic structure of the system as it grows from micro clusters to crystals. At what stage, for example, does the cluster look as if it is a fragment of the corresponding crystal. How do electrons forming bonds in micro-clusters transform to bands in solids? How do the size dependent properties change from discrete quantum conditions, as in clusters, to boundary constrained bulk conditions, as in nanoscale materials, to bulk conditions insensitive to boundaries? How do the criteria of classification have to be changed as one goes from one size domain to another? Potential for high technological applications also seem to be endless. Clusters of otherwise non-magnetic materials exhibit magnetic behavior when constrained by size, shape, and dimension. NanoscaIe metal particles exhibit non-linear opticaI properties and increased mechanical strength. SimiIarly, materials made from nanoscale ceramic particIes possess plastic behavior...|$|R

It is shown that diamond can be grown using atomic H and methyl <b>molecular</b> <b>beams</b> at temperatures down to 700 °C using H: CH 3 flux ratios of approximately 10 : 1. The deposits produced are polycrystalline in nature and the maximum growth rates observed (approximately 0. 1 μm h- 1) using these precursors is approximately ten times larger than when acetylene is substituted for methyl. Mechanistic studies show important differences between the behaviour of the two C source chemicals, Methyl adsorbs on the diamond surface with high sticking probability over a wide temperature range, whereas acetylene only reacts with the growth surface at temperatures of 1200 K and above. Furthermore, the acetylene then tends to desorb to form propane rather than to contribute to diamond growth, hence low growth rates are displayed by this precursor...|$|R
