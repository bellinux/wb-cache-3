30|$|Our {{study as}} well as other {{previous}} studies (e.g., Carter et al. 2014 a, b; Wu 2015, 2017) suggest that the R-T growth rate calculated with numerical models could be a good index for the prediction of EPBs. However, we have compared past EPB occurrence data and R-T growth rates calculated with GAIA and past <b>meteorological</b> reanalysis <b>data.</b> For the practical forecast of EPBs, it is necessary to predict ionosphere-thermosphere variations one or more days ahead. One possible way to make a prediction is to introduce <b>meteorological</b> forecast <b>data</b> instead of the <b>meteorological</b> reanalysis <b>data</b> in the lower atmosphere. The other way is to run GAIA by itself without the <b>meteorological</b> reanalysis <b>data.</b> Since GAIA can reproduce meteorological processes in the troposphere to some degree, it is expected that the model can be used to predict the atmosphere-ionosphere system without forecast data. Further investigation is necessary {{for the development of a}} forecast technique.|$|R

5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of August1, a strong central dense overcast, an area of high, thick clouds, developed over the center of circulation, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Throughout the next day, the system gradually developed an eye within the central dense overcast, leading to further strengthening. Operationally, Guillermo was thought to have briefly leveled out in intensity on August2; however, in post-storm analysis, the NHC discovered that a steady period of rapid intensification took place. Unlike most hurricanes in the eastern Pacific, Guillermo was investigated by Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft during its rapid intensification stage. The aircraft released several dropsondes into the storm to gather <b>meteorological</b> <b>data.</b> This mission {{marked the first time}} the Hurricane Hunters recorded high-resolution wind data from flight level to within several meters of the ocean surface inside the eyewall of a major hurricane.|$|E

However, from 1941 the archipelago became of strategic importance in the supply chain between the Allied powers, {{as well as a}} source of badly needed coal. The Norwegian government-in-exile rejected a Soviet–British occupation; instead the British Army started Operation Gauntlet to evacuate Spitsbergen. On 29 August 1941, the entire population of Ny-Ålesund was evacuated to Longyearbyen, and on 3 September 765 people were evacuated from Longyearbyen to Scotland. Later the last 150 men were also evacuated. With Longyearbyen depopulated, a small German garrison and air strip was established in Adventdalen, mostly to provide <b>meteorological</b> <b>data.</b> After the British Operation Fritham regained control of Barentsburg, the German forces left Longyearbyen without combat.|$|E
5|$|Tianchi Basins: As {{precipitation}} was {{for important}} agriculture and food production, the Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao developed a precipitation gauge that was {{widely used in}} 1247 during the Southern Song dynasty to gather <b>meteorological</b> <b>data.</b> Qin Jiushao later records application of rainfall measurements in the mathematical treatise Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections. The book also discusses problems using large snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement. Tianchi Basins were installed at provincial and district capitals and bamboo snow gauges were situated in mountain passes. The rain gauges were conical or barrel-shaped with one being installed at each provincial and district capital in China. In the treatise, Qin Jiushao also discusses how point measurements were converted to real averages. These averages were important as they postulated indicators of natural disasters such as flooding, since river flooding {{has always been a}} problem in China.|$|E

5|$|A {{weather map}} {{displays}} various meteorological features across {{a particular area}} at a particular point in time and has various symbols which all have specific meanings. Such maps have been in use since the mid-19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes. Maps using isotherms show temperature gradients, which can help locate weather fronts. Isotach maps, analyzing lines of equal wind speed, on a constant pressure surface of 300 or 250hPa show where the jet stream is located. Use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500hPa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds at various levels show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure. Cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other <b>meteorological</b> <b>data</b> that are included in synoptic reports sent by professionally trained observers.|$|E

Occasionally chasers would make stops at rural airstrips or NWS offices for an update on weather conditions. NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) could provide information in the vehicle, without stopping, such as weather watches and warnings, surface weather conditions, convective outlooks, and NWS radar summaries.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{modeling}} of ambient air pollutants through ANN in industrial area of Ujjain city in India and the study was carried out on modeling of air pollutants like SPM and RSPM using Artificial Neural Network. Artificial neural networks (ANN), whose performances to deal with pattern recognition problems is well known, are proposed to identify air pollution sources. The ANN system was run by giving the inputs of <b>meteorological</b> <b>data’s</b> and giving the outputs of concentration of various pollutants and accordingly the estimation of Errors was done by this study. The monthly data’s in year from 2009 - 2012 of <b>meteorological</b> <b>data’s</b> like Temperature, Humidity, wind pressure and rainfall and the pollutants concentration were collected from the State Pollution Control Board. The ANN system used, as shown in figure 1, analyses all these data’s and finds the error coming during the experiment.

25|$|In {{the period}} 1960-2010 average {{precipitation}} in the Upper Barada basin {{has remained the}} same. While the yield of the Fijeh springs has declined from an annual average of 9.5m3/second in 1967-71 to 5.5 m3/second in 1996-2000, {{this is due to}} pumping from the aquifer in the immediate vicinity of the springs that was begun in 1981 in order to supply more water to Damascus during the dry season.

However, the model projects a stronger decline of 15% for the distant future (2069-2098) compared to the base period, and even stronger declines of up to 50% during the springs' high-flow period in March–May.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone forecast {{model is a}} computer program that uses <b>meteorological</b> <b>data</b> to forecast aspects of the future state of {{tropical cyclone}}s.

[...] Statistical models forecast {{the evolution of a}} tropical cyclone in a simpler manner, by extrapolating from historical datasets, and thus can be run quickly on platforms such as personal computers. [...] Statistical-dynamical models use aspects of both types of forecasting. [...] Four primary types of forecasts exist for tropical cyclones: [...] track, intensity, storm surge, and rainfall. [...] Dynamical models were not developed until the 1970s and the 1980s, with earlier efforts focused on the storm surge problem.|$|E
