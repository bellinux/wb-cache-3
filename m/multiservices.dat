30|$|Forced {{termination}} of connections during handover and blocked connection initiation are annoying {{from the perspective}} of multiservice cellular system users. Previous studies have shown that an admission control policy reduces the dropping probability to a much lower level but at the cost of raising the blocking probability to a higher level. As an alternative for reducing both blocking and dropping probabilities, we make use of the Adaptive Multirate (AMR) scheme, which is a well-known real-time streaming coding technique. For an example of AMR technique, a video source is encoded into multiple independent descriptions. A cellular device, depending on its available computing and network resources, joins different descriptions to meet performance requirements. The base layer is received and the enhancement layer(s) are abandoned if the cellular capacity is insufficient for high-quality video. Mobile cellular devices currently obtain basic video quality at a lower frame rate. AMR services can substantially improve the degree of user satisfaction and guarantee the connection-level quality of service (QoS) for different multimedia. In cellular systems, the QoS requirements of different services require a connection admission control (CAC) that limits the number of connections in each access network. Therefore, we focus on the CAC and connection-level QoS of multiservice traffic using adaptive coding in mobile cellular systems. We initially analyzed our CAC policy in a <b>multiservices</b> cellular system by formulating the CAC policy functions, arrival rate, departure rate, blocking probability, and dropping probability of the <b>multiservices,</b> before we derived the connection-level QoS and verified it by simulation. The adaptive coding of <b>multiservices</b> traffic has {{a significant impact on the}} connection-level QoS in multiservice cellular systems. Our method decreased the blocking and dropping probabilities by adapting multirate services while users were roaming. Mobile cellular operators providing AMR services could apply our CAC to fulfill the quality requirements of the user experience and also improve the connection-level QoS.|$|E

30|$|The {{problem of}} <b>multiservice</b> {{transmission}} in OFDMA-based cooperative relay networks is studied comprehensively. We propose a framework to adaptively allocate power, subcarriers, and data rate in OFDMA system to maximize spectral efficiency under {{the constraints of}} satisfying multiuser multiservices' QoS requirements.

30|$|However, {{previous}} studies of call blocking and dropping performance with CAC have not considered adapting <b>multiservices</b> in cellular systems. Mobile cellular systems can now support multiple call services, such as voice and video calls. The bandwidth of these call services is usually fixed. If the bandwidth of these call services can be adapted, the CAC used by such adaptive multirate (AMR) services may reduce the call blocking and dropping probabilities, thereby increasing cellular system utilization to meet a guaranteed level of QoS. For example, G. 722 can change the bandwidth of voice call services while Multiple Description Coding (MDC) can vary the bandwidth of video call services.|$|E
