5|$|Mourning doves are {{prolific}} breeders. In warmer areas, {{these birds}} may raise {{up to six}} broods in a season. This fast breeding is essential because <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> high. Each year, mortality can reach 58% a year for adults and 69% for the young.|$|E
5|$|Presently, human-caused shark <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> continuing, {{primarily}} from accidental and illegal catching in commercial and recreational fishing {{as well as}} from being caught in beach protection netting, and the populations of great white shark in Australia are yet to recover.|$|E
5|$|The meat, oil, bones, and skins are {{valuable}} items sold in markets. <b>Mortality</b> <b>is</b> often caused by direct hunting by humans or other human-induced causes, such as habitat destruction, entanglement in fishing gear, and watercraft collisions. Steller's sea cow went extinct due to overhunting in 1768.|$|E
30|$|During the study, no <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> {{observed}} in cow, pig and rabbit dung. But in poultry, sheep dung and vegetable compost, the <b>mortalities</b> <b>were</b> observed. In vegetable compost the <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> {{observed in}} the whole study period.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 192 largemouth bass were caught at Lake Ray Roberts, Texas (1995) to {{investigate}} five controversial bass angling techniques relative to hooking mortality. The bait types were Texas-rigged scented and non-scented plastic worms, Carolina-rigged scented and non-scented plastic worms, and live golden shiners. Overall hooking <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> 21. 87 % and <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> dependent upon bait type. Highest mortality {{resulted from the}} Texas-rigged scented lures, while the lowest <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> generated by live golden shiners. A creel survey indicated that few anglers were having success with the investigated baits.

5|$|Bird {{predation}} of {{the adult}} cicada is common, with wrens and grey fantails, noisy miners, blue-faced honeyeaters, little wattlebirds, grey and pied butcherbirds, magpie-larks, Torresian crows, white-faced herons and even the nocturnal tawny frogmouth, all reported as significant predators. The frogmouths and bearded dragons have been observed feeding on emerging nymphs, however total nymphal <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> estimated at under 10%.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS rate in Nigeria is {{much lower}} {{compared}} to the other African nations such as Kenya or South Africa whose prevalence (percentage) rates are in the double digits. , the HIV prevalence rate among adults ages 15–49 was just 3.1 percent. , life expectancy in Nigeria is 52.62 years on average according to CIA, and just over half the population have access to potable water and appropriate sanitation; , the infant <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> 8.4 deaths per 1000 live births.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, sarus cranes {{have been}} known to live for as long as 42 years. Premature adult <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> often the result of human actions. Accidental {{poisoning}} by monocrotophos, chlorpyrifos and dieldrin-treated seeds used in agricultural areas has been noted.

30|$|Until {{the final}} {{measurement}} at 2.5  years, the mean trial <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> below 2 %. At 2.5  years, > 10 % <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded in the}} CTH-DEC x 2, CTH-Oct and winter glyphosate and CTH-Oct treatments, with 43 % in the no control treatment.|$|R
5|$|Infant <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> often {{high among}} ruffed lemurs, {{but can also}} be highly variable. In some seasons, as many as 65% are unable to reach three months of age, {{possibly}} due to falls and related injuries, although in some seasons infant <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> as low as 0%. For those that do survive to adulthood, sexual maturity is attained at 18 to 20 months in females and 32 to 48 months in males. Sexual maturity may take longer to reach in the wild compared to captivity. For females, the inter-birth interval, or time between successive offspring, is typically one year, and in captivity, females can remain reproductively active {{until the age of}} 23. The life expectancy for both species of ruffed lemur is estimated at 36 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Great {{white sharks}} (Carcharodon carcharias) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) are plausible, albeit undocumented, predators of the porbeagle. There {{is a record}} of a small {{individual}} caught off Argentina that bore bite marks from a copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus) or similar species, but it is uncertain whether the porbeagle {{was the target of}} attempted predation or if the two were simply involved in interspecific aggression. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Dinobothrium septaria and Hepatoxylon trichiuri, and the copepods Dinemoura producta, Laminifera doello-juradoi, and Pandarus floridanus. Natural annual <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> low, estimated to be 10% for juveniles, 15% for adult males, and 20% for adult females in the western North Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 {{the first}} {{adequately}} large scale {{study on the}} natural history and long-term prognosis of this condition was reported; this showed that at 16 months follow-up 57.1% of patients had full recovery, 29.5%/2.9%/2.2% had respectively minor/moderate/severe symptoms or impairments, and 8.3% had died. Severe impairment or death were more likely in those aged over 37 years, male, affected by coma, mental status disorder, intracerebral hemorrhage, thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system, central nervous system infection and cancer. A subsequent systematic review of nineteen studies in 2006 showed that <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> about 5.6% during hospitalisation and 9.4% in total, while of the survivors 88% make a total or near-total recovery. After several months, {{two thirds of the}} cases has resolution ("recanalisation") of the clot. The rate of recurrence was low (2.8%).|$|E
30|$|Fingerling <b>mortalities</b> <b>were</b> 100 %, 96 %, 70 % and 42 % in pH  3, 4, 5 and 6. One hundred percent, 44 %, 22 % and 12 % {{juvenile}} <b>mortalities</b> <b>were</b> {{noted in}} pH  3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. One hundred percent, 34 %, 18 % and 14 % adult <b>mortalities</b> <b>were</b> recorded in pH  3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Tolerance of O. niloticus to low pH was Adult > juvenile > fingerlings. Morphological and behavioural changes observed include erratic swimming, gasping, slimy mucous secretions, skin erosion, bleeding of fins, impairment in feeding and lethargy. <b>Mortality</b> <b>was</b> attributed to acid stress, acidosis of the blood, {{erosion of the}} epidermal layers, sodium ion influx inhibition and ionoregulatory system failure.|$|R
30|$|Hospital <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> 60 %. ICU, 3 and 6 -month <b>mortality</b> rates <b>were,</b> respectively, 47, 67 and 71 %. For 50 {{patients}}, withdrawal/withhold of life-sustaining therapies (WLTs) were decided after 6  days [2.0 – 14.5]. Among these patients, 36 patients died in ICU {{and nine}} patients died after ICU discharge. <b>Mortality</b> <b>was</b> not different {{according to the}} reason of ICU admission (sepsis versus acute respiratory failure, p[*]=[*] 0.32) (data not shown).|$|R
30|$|Methods: Patients {{suspected}} for old {{definition of}} severe sepsis and septic shock were retrospectively identified in 3 urban tertiary hospital EDs from May 2014 to April 2015. Demographic findings, initial vital signs, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), site of infection, initial lactate levels, systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria (SIRS), qSOFA score, SOFA score, and 28 -day <b>mortality</b> <b>were</b> abstracted. Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of SIRS, qSOFA, and SOFA to predict 28 -day <b>mortality</b> <b>were</b> compared and diagnostic performance of qSOFA 2 {{or more to}} predict 28 -day <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> calculated.|$|R
5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} soil surface. Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> high in wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 {{years for}} females, and 80.2 years for males. Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> expected to decline. New Zealand's fertility rate of 2.1 is relatively high for a developed country, and natural births {{account for a}} significant proportion of population growth. Consequently, the country has a young population compared to most industrialised nations, with 20% of New Zealanders being 14 years old or younger. By 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3 million, the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18% to 29%. In 2008, the leading cause of premature death was cancer, at 29.8%, followed by ischaemic heart disease, 19.7%, and then cerebrovascular disease, 9.2%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mortality</b> <b>is</b> {{high for}} eggs and hatchlings, and nests face threats from floods, overheating, and predators. Flooding {{is a major}} cause of failure of {{crocodilians}} to breed successfully, as nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen, and juveniles get washed away. One of the chief predators of alligators' eggs in Florida is the raccoon, which is attracted by olfactory cues after the nest has been disturbed by turtles. The Florida black bear also raids alligator eggs. In Africa, mongooses, honey badgers, baboons, otters, warthogs, bushpigs, and spotted hyenas are all fond of crocodile eggs, but the monitor lizard is thought {{to be the most important}} nest raider. This lizard is also a major hazard in Asia, where other egg predators include civets, mongooses, rats, sloth bears, jackals, and dogs.|$|E
40|$|Objective Status epilepticus (SE) is {{associated}} with significant morbidity and <b>mortality,</b> and there <b>is</b> some controversy concerning predictive indicators of outcome. Our main goal <b>was</b> to determine <b>mortality</b> and to identify factors associated with SE prognosis. Method This prospective study in a tertiary-care university hospital, included 105 patients with epileptic seizures lasting more than 30 minutes. <b>Mortality</b> <b>was</b> defined as death during hospital admission. Results The case-fatality rate was 36. 2 %, which was higher than in previous studies. In univariate analysis, <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> associated with age, previous epilepsy, complex focal seizures; etiology, recurrence, and refractoriness of SE; clinical complications, and focal SE. In multivariate analysis, <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> associated only with presence of clinical complications. Conclusions Mortality associated with SE was higher than reported in previous studies, and {{was not related to}} age, specific etiology, or SE duration. In multivariate analysis, <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> independently related to occurrence of medical complications...|$|R

40|$|Black {{mortality}} {{in an urban}} environment in the antebellum South is relatively under-researched. This {{article is based on}} burial records from Savannah between 1853 and 1861 and argues that black <b>mortality</b> in Savannah <b>was</b> noticeably better than on nearby plantations and was broadly comparable to white <b>mortality.</b> This <b>is</b> in contrast to previous studies on slave mortality which have tended to stress that black <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> worse than white. I conclude by arguing that <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> linked to more closely to class than race in Savannah...|$|R
5|$|Most {{research}} has focused on thrips species that feed on economically significant crops. Some species are predatory, but most of them feed on pollen and the chloroplasts harvested from the outer layer of plant epidermal and mesophyll cells. They prefer tender parts of the plant, such as buds, flowers and new leaves. Besides feeding on plant tissues, the common blossom thrips feeds on pollen grains and on the eggs of mites. When the larva supplements its diet in this way, its development time and <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> reduced, and adult females that consume mite eggs increase their fecundity and longevity.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} cat is {{a significant}} predator of birds. UK assessments indicate they may be accountable for an estimated 64.8million bird deaths each year. A 2012 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds {{each year in the}} United States. Certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 30% of house sparrow <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> linked to the domestic cat. In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety. The proposal that cat populations will increase when the numbers of these top predators decline is called the mesopredator release hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{factor in}} nesting <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> starvation. Sibling rivalry can be intense, and in South Africa {{third and fourth}} chicks inevitably starve. In the dryer habitats with fewer amphibians the diet may lack sufficient vertebrate content and may cause bone abnormalities in growing chicks due to calcium deficiency. In Barbados, nests were sometimes raided by vervet monkeys, and a study in Florida reported the fish crow and black rat as other possible nest raiders. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to brown pelicans nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall. In Australia, Torresian crows, wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles take eggs or young, and tick infestation and viral infections may also be causes of mortality.|$|E

5|$|The film {{operates}} on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It employs {{some of the}} conventions of film noir, among them {{the character of a}} femme fatale; narration by the protagonist (in the original release); chiaroscuro cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlook—extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity. It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of genetic engineering in the context of classical Greek drama and hubris. It also draws on Biblical images, such as Noah's flood, and literary sources, such as Frankenstein. Linguistically, the theme of <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> subtly reiterated in the chess game between Sebastian and Tyrell, supposedly based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851 (though Scott has said this was merely coincidental).|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. <b>Mortality</b> <b>is</b> higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
5|$|More than 100 insect species prey on H. zea, usually {{feeding on}} eggs and larvae. The {{insidious}} flower bug (Orius insidiosus), a pirate bug, feeds on the eggs of H. zea, thus {{acting as a}} biological control agent. Some plants emit a blend of chemicals in response to damage from H. zea, which attract parasitic insects. Cardiochiles nigriceps, a solitary endoparasitoid wasp, makes use of these volatile plant compounds to identify the presence of H. zea. When the wasps find damaged host plants, they hover around and then search for the host with their antennae. When the females find their prey, they use their antennae to position themselves and deposit eggs into the host. The braconid wasp Microplitis croceipes, which deposits its eggs inside a living caterpillar, {{is also an important}} parasitoid of both H. zea and the related species Heliothis virescens. When larval densities are high, a fungal pathogen, Nomuraea rileyi, can cause an outbreak of disease. However, pupal <b>mortality</b> <b>is</b> high not because of predators, but because of harsh weather conditions, collapsing pupal chambers, and disease.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} the initial mortality (fish judged nonreleasable at weigh-in), prerelease mortality (fish judged nonreleasable 1 – 2 h after weigh-in [which includes initial mortality]), and postrelease mortality (fish that died during a 5 -d retention in net-pens) in 14 live-release tournaments for walleye Sander vitreus conducted in April–October 2006 and April–July 2007 in {{lakes and rivers}} in Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Among the 14 events, initial <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> 0 – 28 %, prerelease <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> 3 – 54 %, and postrelease <b>mortality</b> <b>was</b> 0 – 100 %; the mortality of reference fish (walleyes 31 cm long that were captured by electrofishing and held in net-pens with tournament-caught walleyes to measure postrelease <b>mortality)</b> <b>was</b> 0 – 97 %. <b>Mortality</b> <b>was</b> generally low in events conducted when water temperatures were below 148 C but substantially higher in events when water temperatures were above 188 C.
