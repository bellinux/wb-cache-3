Multiple-cell Lead-Acid battery packs can be equalized by a controlled overcharge, eliminating the need to periodically adjust individual cells to match the rest of the pack. Lithium-based based batteries cannot be equalized by an overcharge, so alternative methods are required. This paper discusses several cell-balancing methodologies. Active cell balancing methods remove charge from one or more high cells and deliver the charge to one or more low cells. Dissipative techniques find the high cells in the pack, and remove excess energy through a resistive element until their charges match the low cells.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{financial}} instability of the 1980 s following financial deregulation in Australia can be partly traced {{to a lack of}} attention to agency problems in banking.

Complementary developments in corporate governance and control are required to ad-dress agency relationships involving bank management.

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} {{sequestration}} (CCS) {{has been proposed}} {{as a means to}} dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the continued use of fossil fuels. For geologic sequestration, the carbon dioxide is captured from large point sources (e. g., power plants or other industrial sources), transported to the injection site and injected into deep geological formations for storage. This will produce new water challenges, such as the amount of water used in energy resource development and utilization and the “capture penalty” for water use. At depth, brine displacement within formations, storage reservoir pressure increases resulting from injection, and leakage are potential concerns. Potential impacts range from increasing water demand for capture to contamination of groundwater through leakage or brine displacement. Understanding these potential impacts and the conditions under which they arise informs the design and implementation of appropriate <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>controls,</b> important both for assurance of environmental safety and for accounting purposes.
