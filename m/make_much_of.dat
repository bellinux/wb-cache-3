5|$|Despite a low-scoring {{start to}} the 2003 English cricket season, in which he passed 40 only once in his first seven innings of the season, he kept {{his place in the}} Test side for the visit of the touring Zimbabweans. Batting at number five in both Tests, Key failed to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an impact, scoring 18 runs in the first match and four in the second. He had reason to feel aggrieved at his first Test dismissalumpire Steve Bucknor gave him out caught behind, despite Key not hitting the ball.|$|E

However, by the time he became a Senator of the College of Justice he was past his prime intellectually and thus did not <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an impact in that role. A Jacobite sympathiser, he is best known for his defence of rebels standing trial at Carlisle after the Jacobite risings.|$|E
5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit, which his father had helped to found. From 13 November 1914, Nevinson spent nine weeks in France with the FAU and the British Red Cross Society, mostly working at a disused goods shed by Dunkirk rail station known as the Shambles. The Shambles housed some three thousand badly wounded French troops, who had been evacuated from the Front and then all but abandoned. For weeks they had been left unfed and untended with the dead and dying lying together on dirty straw. Nevinson, alongside his father and other volunteers, worked to dress wounds, help clean and disinfect the shed and started to make it habitable. Nevinson later depicted his experiences in The Shambles in two paintings, The Doctor and La Patrie. As the French authorities began {{to take control of}} the situation, Nevinson was reassigned as an ambulance driver. Although Nevinson would often <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> this time as an ambulance driver, particularly in his publicity material, he only held the role for a week as, due to his poor health, he lacked the strength to steer the vehicle. By January 1915 his worsening rheumatism had made him unfit for further service and he returned to Britain.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 717, Maslama with his army crossed from Asia into Europe over the Dardanelles, and {{proceeded}} to besiege Constantinople from land and sea. His navy, however, was soon neutralized {{by the use of}} Greek fire, and as his army was unable to overcome the city's land defences, the siege continued into the winter, which was especially severe that year, with snow covering the ground for three months. Maslama had brought along many supplies, but they either soon ran out or were lost—Arab accounts <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Leo tricking the Arab general yet again during negotiations into handing over or destroying a significant part of his hoarded supplies—and the army began to suffer from hunger and disease. In spring, reinforcements arrived in the shape of two large fleets from Egypt and Ifriqiya, but a large part of their crews, who were mostly conscripted Christians, went over to the Byzantines, and Leo's navy managed to destroy or capture the Arab fleets. The Byzantines also defeated an Arab army marching to aid the besiegers through Asia Minor, while Maslama's men had to contend with attacks by the Bulgars as well, which cost them many men. The siege had clearly failed, and the new Caliph, Umar II (r. 717–720), ordered Maslama to retreat. On 15 August 718, after thirteen months of siege, the Arabs departed.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia's {{other main}} {{economic}} arm, farming, performed less strongly during the war, {{partly because the}} Chartered Company prioritised the strategically important mines {{at the behest of}} British officials. Southern Rhodesian farmers were optimistic at the outbreak of war, surmising that the Empire would become desperate for food and that they would be essentially immune to inflation because they grew their own crops. While these conclusions were on the whole accurate, logistical complications made it difficult for Rhodesian food to be exported, and as in mining there was often a shortage of labour. There were a number of drives to increase agricultural yield with the hope of feeding more people in Britain, but because Southern Rhodesia was so far away it was difficult for the colony to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an impact. One of the main culinary contributions the territory made to the British wartime marketplace was Rhodesian butter, which first reached England in February 1917.|$|E

25|$|Armitage {{was born}} in Sheffield, Yorkshire. He made his {{first-class}} debut for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 1872, opening the batting in the first innings. He failed to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an impression in the game, scoring 0 and 1, taking 0–19 from eight overs and taking no catches. He next appeared for Yorkshire in 1874 against a United South of England XI, but again did little.|$|E

Delescluze was being prosecuted for having promoted {{a monument to the}} representative Baudin, who had been killed while resisting the coup d'état of 1851, and Gambetta seized his opportunity to attack both the coup d'état and the government with a vigour which made him immediately famous.|$|E

Berck ceased his work on all other series to focus solely on Sammy.|$|E

Duke, having failed to gain much traction as a Democrat, then successfully sought the Presidential nomination of the Populist Party. He appeared on the ballot for president in 11 states and was a write-in candidate in some other states, some with Trenton Stokes of Arkansas for vice president, and on other state ballots with Floyd Parker for vice president.

25|$|The inaugural Revolution team {{featured}} several U.S. Men's National Team regulars {{returning from}} abroad {{to be part}} of the new league. Despite the presence of Alexi Lalas, Mike Burns, and Joe-Max Moore, however, the team was one of only two that failed to make the playoffs of the then 10 team league. The following season, the squad made the playoffs, but failed to advance past the first round. For the next five years, this playoff result would be the Revs' best (which they matched in the 2000 season), as a revolving door of players and head coaches failed to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an impact on the fledgling league.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{documentation}} of the history and necessity of the Declaration of Helsinki. The first code of conduct for research including medical ethics was the Nuremberg Code.

This issue called for the creation of the Declaration. There are some stark differences between the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki, including the way it is written. Nuremberg was written in a very concise manner, with simple explanation. The Declaration of Helsinki is written with thorough explanation in mind and including many specific commentaries.|$|E
25|$|England {{lost the}} five match ODI series against India 5-0, with the bowlers failing to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an impression. India made 387/5 {{in the first}} ODI {{on their way to}} a convincing victory. Stuart Broad took four wickets in the second game, but on the whole England’s bowlers were {{expensive}} an uneconomical, as they failed to bowl out India in the series. India won the first Test between the sides, after making 387/4 in their second innings to secure a six wicket victory.

25|$|Coulthard {{was brought}} into a Victoria XV in March 1880 to take on that season's Australian {{representative}} team. He was the leading wicket-taker for his side with 5/52 and 4/28. In his first-class debut for Victoria later that year, against South Australia on the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, he took 3/29 and contributed 31 runs to a first innings total of 329, but his performance with the leather slumped in the second innings, conceding 49 runs for a single wicket. The following month, after top scoring (51) for a Victorian XV in a match against the Australian XI, Coulthard played in his first of three first-class contests against New South Wales. He failed to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a statistical impact for Victoria {{in any of these}} intercolonials.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they did}} not <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an {{impression}} in the inaugural East African Premier League, dominated by the two Ugandan sides, they did dominate in the opening rounds. It {{was a different story}} in the 50-over counterpart, the East African Cup, though. They totally dominated the tournament, and except the occasional Ugandan good performance, nearly every franchise appeared minnows in front of them. They topped the group with 28 points from 10 games (6 wins and only two losses), and then won comprehensively in the twice-postponed final against Ugandan side Nile Knights (the other being Rwenzori Warriors) by 84 runs. After they posted a massive 280/5 (Rakep Patel 92, Duncan Allan 65), Pakistani-born Kenyan cricketer Abdul Rehman took 4-32 as their opponents could only manage 196/9.|$|E

Despite concerns over his fitness, Yuvraj was selected in the 15-man Indian squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, with the chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkar confirming Yuvraj was fit. He featured in the last two matches of the four-ODI series against Sri Lanka in February 2007, and struck an unbeaten 83-ball 95 in the deciding final game at Visakhapatnam. India won the match by seven wickets and the series 2–1.|$|E
