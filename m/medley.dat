As a Gator, she was an eleven-time SEC champion, including the 50-yard backstroke (twice), 100-yard backstroke (twice), 200-yard backstroke, and six relays. She was a three-time NCAA champion (twice in the 400-yard <b>medley</b> relay, and once in the 200-yard <b>medley</b> relay), and received a total of eighteen All-American honors. The Gators won the 1982 NCAA women's team championship, and the Gators' winning 400-yard <b>medley</b> relay team of Andrews, Amy Caulkins, Michele Kurtzman and Kathy Treible set a new American national record {{in the event of}} 3:40.99.

5|$|Four years later, when Seoul, South Korea {{hosted the}} 1988 Summer Olympics, she swam the {{freestyle}} leg for the silver medal-winning U.S. {{team in the}} women's 4×100-meter <b>medley</b> relay with teammates Beth Barr (backstroke), Tracey McFarlane (breaststroke), and Janel Jorgensen (butterfly). The U.S. women's <b>medley</b> relay team was fraught with last-minute drama, as several previously selected swimmers dropped out to focus on individual events, or were replaced because they had performed below expectations, only hours before the event final. In the event final, the U.S. <b>medley</b> relay team included women with no history of competing together, no relay exchange practice, and no coach; the East German favorites taunted the Americans before the race. Wayte would later characterize the race {{as one of her}} proudest moments. She also captured a bronze medal with the third-place U.S. women's 4×100-meter freestyle relay team that included Mitzi Kremer, Dara Torres and Laura Walker. Individually, she finished fourth in the women's 200-meter freestyle; she was also a medal contender in the women's 200-meter individual <b>medley,</b> but was disqualified when the judges ruled she used an illegal butterfly kick on the breaststroke leg of the <b>medley.</b>|$|E
