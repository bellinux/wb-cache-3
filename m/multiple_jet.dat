40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} has been developed to simulate the compressible jets flow from the top-blown lance with multi-nozzles in converter to a free surrounding domain. The variations of fluid density and viscosity, high temperature, and Mach number were taken into consideration in this model which was validated against the physical modeling results. More specifically, computations were obtained to compare the widely used realizable k-epsilon turbulence model against the standard k-omega turbulence model, which shows that the latter one is superior to calculate diverse turbulent conditions within the <b>multiple</b> <b>jets.</b> Moreover, the coalescence pattern of the <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> has been illustrated by their Mach number distribution, and each individual jet proceeds in a curve course, bending to the lance center and tending to unite. The effects of the inclination angles on the jets coalescence were also investigated, which indicates that the lower the inclination angle is, the stronger the interfering extent between the <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> is. With the help of this model, the dynamic power of the <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> to support the cavity formation was demonstrated, and additionally, a mathematical model concerning the effective penetration radius and digressing path of the <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> was proposed by taking the inclination angle and the axial distance from the nozzle tips as arguments...|$|R

50|$|A <b>multiple</b> <b>jet</b> or multijet meter is a {{velocity}} type meter {{which has}} an impeller which rotates horizontally on a vertical shaft.

This meter works mechanically much like a single jet meter except that the ports direct the flow at the impeller equally from several points around the circumference of the element, not just one point; this minimizes uneven wear on the impeller and its shaft. Thus these types of meters are recommended to be installed horizontally with its roller index pointing skywards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{advantages}} of Reichardt's hypothesis {{in dealing with}} single and <b>multiple</b> circular <b>jets</b> in a stagnant environment are highlighted. The stages involved {{in the development of}} the point source method, an offshoot of the new hypothesis, are presented. Previous results of experiments on <b>multiple</b> circular <b>jets</b> in a stagnant environment justify the method of superposition. As a prelude to discussion of <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> in a co-flowing stream, results on the excess-velocity decay, the growth of the shear layer, and the dilutions for a single jet based on Reichardt's hypothesis are presented. The spreading hypothesis is generalized by introducing a link factor kl to account for the co-flowing stream. The distribution of excess-momentum flux uΔu is shown to be Gaussian in nature. Based on the principle of superposition, the decay of the maximum excess velocity and the dilution are predicted for odd and even numbers of jets in an array. The predictions seem to be in good agreement with observed data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in the oxygenation by plunging water jets {{in the last few}} years due to their inherent advantages, like energy-efficient, low operation cost, etc. Though a lot of work has been reported on the oxygen-transfer by single plunging water jets but very few studies have been carried out using <b>multiple</b> plunging <b>jets.</b> In this paper, volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient and oxygen-transfer efficiency has been studied experimentally for <b>multiple</b> inclined plunging <b>jets</b> (having jet plunge 0 angle of 60) in a pool of water for different configurations, in terms of varying number of jets and jet diameters. This research suggests that the volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient and oxygentransfer efficiency of the <b>multiple</b> inclined plunging <b>jets</b> for air-water system are significantly higher than those of a single vertical as well as inclined plunging jet for same flow area and other similar conditions. The study also reveals that the oxygen-transfer increase with increase in number of <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> under similar conditions, which will be most advantageous and energy-efficient in practical situations when large volumes of wastewaters are to be treated. A relationship between volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient and jet parameters is also proposed. The suggested relationship predicts the volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient for <b>multiple</b> inclined plunging <b>jet(s)</b> within a scatter of ± 15 percent. The relationship will be quite useful in scale-up and in deciding optimum configuration of <b>multiple</b> inclined plunging <b>jet</b> aeration system.
