40|$|OBJECT: Microsurgery is not {{the only}} option for larger {{vestibular}} schwannomas (VSs); recent reviews have confirmed the feasibility and efficacy of radiosurgery for larger VSs. This study illustrates the outcomes of a series of large VSs after <b>multisession</b> stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: A series of 33 VSs larger than 8 cm 3 (range 8 – 24 cm 3, mean 11 cm 3, median 9. 4 cm 3) were treated using the CyberKnife from 2003 to 2011 with the <b>multisession</b> SRS technique in 2 – 5 fractions (14 – 19. 5 Gy). Five patients had undergone surgical removal and 5 had ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Nine patients were eligible for but refused surgery. Twelve patients were older than 70 years and 5 were younger than 40 years. Two female patients had neurofibromatosis. RESULTS: The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 111 months (median 48 months); radiological growth control was achieved in 94 % of cases: 19 tumors (58 %) displayed no size variation or reduction in tumor diameter; 12 (36 %), after a transient enlargement, presented with arrested growth or shrinkage. Seven patients had a volume reduction of more than 50 %. Two patients (6 %) needed debulking and 2 were treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Actuarial progressionfree survival rates at 1 year and 5 years were 97 % and 83 %, respectively. Hearing was retained in 7 of the 8 patients with serviceable baseline hearing. Adverse events were limited to 1 case each of vertigo, tongue paresthesia, and trigeminal neuralgia. CONCLUSIONS: The good control rate obtained with <b>multisession</b> SRS deepens the controversy of the radiobiology of VSs and may extend the indication of radiation therapy (fractionated or SRS) for large VSs to include patients without symptoms of mass effect. The limited number of cases and short follow-up period do not provide sufficient support for widespread application of <b>multisession</b> SRS in young patients. Further studies with <b>multisession</b> SRS are warranted...|$|E

This study compared the <b>multisession</b> effect of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX {{with that of the}} typical antipsychotic haloperidol on the expression of avoidance responding. Rats (N 199) were trained to move to safety on presentation of a tone in one-way active conditioned avoidance and were tested across 5 sessions. Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of CNQX (20 -min injection–test interval) produced a dose-dependent, immediate block of avoidance responding, compared with the extinction-like decline of avoidance responding produced by haloperidol (intraperi-toneal [ip], 60 -min injection–test interval; icv, 60 but not 20 -min injection–test interval). Previous exposure to CNQX significantly reduced its efficacy, illustrating that its effects may not be specific to the conditioned safety-related stimuli that control responding in conditioned avoidance, as proposed for antidopaminergic compounds. The new <b>multisession</b> profile of disrupted avoidance responding illustrated by CNQX suggests different roles for glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in conditioned avoidance responding. Results are consistent with a role for AMPA receptors in maintaining the expression of learning...|$|E

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important in recent years due {{to their ability to}} detect and convey realtime, in-situ information for many civilian and military applications. A fundamental challenge for such networks lies in energy constraint, which poses a performance limit on the achievable network lifetime. We consider a two-tier wireless sensor network and address the network lifetime problem for upper-tier aggregation and forwarding nodes (AFNs). Existing flow routing solutions proposed for maximizing network lifetime require AFNs to split flows to different paths during transmission, which we call <b>multisession</b> flow routing solutions. If an AFN is equipped with a single transmitter/receiver pair, a <b>multisession</b> flow routing solution requires a packet-level power control at the AFN so as to conserve energy, which calls for considerable overhead in synchronization among the AFNs. In this paper, we show {{that it is possible to}} achieve the same optimal network lifetime by power control on a much larger timescale with the socalled single-session flow routing solutions, under which the packet-level power control and, thus, strict requirement on synchronization are not necessary. We also show how to perform optimal single-session flow routing when the bit-rate of composite flows generated by AFNs is time-varying, as long as the average bit-rate can be estimated...|$|E
40|$|Transcranial {{direct current}} {{stimulation}} (tDCS) {{has been suggested}} as an adjuvant tool to promote recovery of function after stroke, but the mechanisms of its action to date remain poorly understood. Moreover, studies aimed at unraveling those mechanisms have essentially been limited to the rat, where tDCS activates resident microglia as well as endogenous neural stem cells. Here we studied the effects of tDCS on microglia activation and neurogenesis in the mouse brain. Male wild-type mice were subjected to <b>multisession</b> tDCS of either anodal or cathodal polarity; sham-stimulated mice served as control. Activated microglia in the cerebral cortex and neuroblasts generated in the subventricular zone as the major neural stem cell niche were assessed immunohistochemically. <b>Multisession</b> tDCS at a sublesional charge density led to a polarity-dependent downregulation of the constitutive expression of Iba 1 by microglia in the mouse cortex. In contrast, both anodal and, to an even greater extent, cathodal tDCS induced neurogenesis from the subventricular zone. Data suggest that tDCS elicits its action through multifacetted mechanisms, including immunomodulation and neurogenesis, and thus {{support the idea of}} using tDCS to induce regeneration and to promote recovery of function. Furthermore, data suggest that the effects of tDCS may be animal- and polarity-specific...|$|E
