5|$|Calleia {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States in November 1941. During World War II, Calleia led the <b>Malta</b> War Relief organization in the U.S. The house {{where he was born}} was destroyed in 1942; his family took refuge underground, in ancient catacombs, during the near-constant aerial bombing of <b>Malta</b> by the Axis powers that continued for more than two years. Under the auspices of the Motion Picture Division of USO Camp Shows, he made personal appearances at U.S. military facilities in 1943. He also accepted an invitation from the Hollywood Victory Committee to make a tour of military camps in North Africa, particularly because the tentative itinerary included <b>Malta.</b> On the 20,000-mile trip Calleia and his small troupe entertained service personnel in Natal, Dakar, along the coast to Casablanca and across to Tunis before going to <b>Malta,</b> which Calleia had not visited since 1922. They gave two shows a day and visited all of the hospitals at each stop; and they presented six shows in <b>Malta</b> as part of the exchange program between U.S. and British entertainment units.|$|E

5|$|The {{volatility}} of the Maltese tourism {{market in the}} past has been largely due to trends in the preferences of tourists from the United Kingdom, who comprise <b>Malta's</b> largest tourism market. Although <b>Malta's</b> uniform use of English, its traditional ties to the United Kingdom and low-cost travel options have made it an attractive option to British tourists, changing preferences of these tourists can impact <b>Malta's</b> tourism income quite significantly. For example, the increasing preference of British tourists for Spanish destinations during the 1980s was reflected in a drop in <b>Malta's</b> tourism numbers during that period.|$|R

5|$|In 1942, Great Britain was {{waging war}} against Italian forces in North Africa and their allies, Rommel's Afrika Korps. <b>Malta</b> was {{critical}} to this campaign During {{this stage of the}} war, <b>Malta</b> was critically short on munitions, food and aviation fuel. Attempts to run the blockade and resupply <b>Malta</b> proved to be a failure; previous convoys such as Harpoon (from Gibraltar) and Vigorous (from Alexandria, Egypt) had lost most of their merchantmen and their escorts had been damaged. A new convoy was hence planned for mid-August, and named Pedestal.|$|E

5|$|<b>Malta</b> had {{organised}} the Consulato del Mare (Consulate of the Sea) for {{the first}} time on 1 September 1697 per initiative of Grandmaster Perellos.

Perellos had established foreign relations between <b>Malta</b> and Russia in 1698, {{for the first}} time, exactly a century before the Order's expulsion from <b>Malta.</b> During his grandmastership the coastal fortifications of <b>Malta</b> were strengthened by the construction of batteries, redoubts, and entrenchments. He also was the driving force behind the third rate squadron of the order which was eventually inaugurated in 1705. In 1707 he entrusted Romano Carapecchia with the reorganization of the drainage system in Valletta.|$|E

The sovereignty of the Knights Hospitaller over <b>Malta</b> from 1530 to 1798 resulted in a legacy of elaborate artistry and architecture throughout <b>Malta.</b> The country's modern museums and art galleries feature relics from Malta's history for tourists and Maltese residents alike to enjoy.|$|E

Upon her return to the UK on 26 October, the destroyer was briefly assigned to the 11th Escort Group before rejoining the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in November. She then began a lengthy refit and work up that lasted until April 1942.|$|E
