50|$|Observations in the {{literature}} survey regarding the different damage models are similar, i.e., they are not generic. In spite of considerable progress in the damage identification using vibrationbased methods, there is still lack of a fairly successful algorithm todetect damage as concluded in all the reviews since 1995. In 1995,in the review published by Dimarogonas (1996), it is concluded “Aconsistent cracked beam vibration theory {{is yet to be}} developed”.In 2005, in another review about vibration based structural healthmonitoring, Carden and Fanning (2004) conclude, “There is no universalagreement as to the optimum method for using <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> data for damage detection, location or quantification”.Similarly in 2007, Montalvao et al. (2006) state as one of the conclusions,“There is no general algorithm that allows the resolutionof all kinds of problems in all kinds of structures”. Similar trendregarding lack of generality of proposed models is seen in the latestreview by Fan and Qiao (2010).|$|E

50|$|The {{operating}} principle {{is based on}} the Doppler effect, which occurs when light is back-scattered from a vibrating surface. Both velocity and displacement can be determined by analyzing the optical signals in different ways. A scanning laser vibrometer integrates computer-controlled X,Y scanning mirrors and a video camera inside an optical head. The laser is scanned point-by-point over the test object’s surface to provide a large number of very high spatial resolution measurements. This sequentially <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> data can be used to calculate and visualize animated deflection shapes in the relevant frequency bands from frequency domain analysis. Alternatively, data can be acquired in the time domain to, for example, generate animations showing wave propagation across structures. In contrast to contact measuring methods, the test object is unaffected by the vibration measuring process. Today, vibrometry covers a huge range of applications such as the study of microstructures moving only a few pm at frequencies up to 30 MHz, {{all the way up to}} the intense dynamics occurring in Formula 1 engines with vibration velocities approaching 30 m/s.|$|E
40|$|Two {{distinct}} aerodynamically excited vibrations in a {{high pressure}} low flow centrifugal compressor are documented. A <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> near 21 % of running speed {{was identified as a}} nonresonant forced vibration which results from rotating stall in the diffuser; a <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> near 50 % of running speed was identified as a self excited vibration sustained by cross coupling forces acting at the compressor wheels. The dependence of these characteristics on speed, discharge pressure, and changes in bearing design are shown. The exciting mechanisms of diffuser stall and aerodynamic cross coupling are evidenced. It is shown how the rotor characteristics are expected to change as a result of modifications. The operation of the compressor after the modifications is described...|$|E
30|$|Mechanical vibrations, {{obtained}} by the accelerometers mounted on the motor body, are widely used for the detection and diagnosis of induction motor faults. In a practical industrial environment, motors are usually coupled with other mechanical components of different speeds which {{also contribute to the}} <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> along with the motor of interest. As a result, the <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> signal contains unavoidable background noise coming out from other coupled mechanical subsystems and sometimes from the sensor itself. This unexpected noise component can mask the fault signature within the acquired signal which will make the fault diagnosis difficult. To separate or reduce noise component from the signal of interest, several noise cancelation methods have been proposed in the literature which in fact utilized adaptive or wavelet-based filtering processes. In [3], Lee and White proposed a two-stage adaptive line enhancer to enhance the <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> signal. Application of self-adaptive noise cancellation algorithm was illustrated in [4] by Antoni and Randall. Again, a denoising algorithm for vibration signals incorporating NeighCoeff shrinkage model with dual-tree complex wavelet transform was proposed by Wang et al. in [5]. However, all of these existing noise reduction algorithms work as a preprocessing step of fault signature extraction and increase computational complexity of a fault diagnosis system.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of bridge condition from vibration measurements {{has generally been}} determined via the monitoring of modal parameters determined though adaptations of the standard Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or other stationary time-series based transformations. However, the nonstationary nature of <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> signals from damaged structures can limit the quality of frequency content information estimated by such methods. The Hilbert–Huang Transform’s (HHT) ability to decompose non-stationary <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> data into a time-frequency-energy representation allows signal variations to be identified sooner than other stationary-based transformations, thus potentially allowing early detection of damage. The present study uses data obtained from a progressive damage test conducted on a real bridge subjected to excitation from a double axle passing vehicle as a test subject. Decomposed vibration signals from the HHT and associated marginal spectrums are assessed to determine structural condition for various damage states and different locations along the bridge.

40|$|A Bayesian {{framework}} is presented for structural model selection and damage identification utilizing <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> data. The framework {{consists of a}} two-level approach. At the first level the problem of estimating the free parameters of a model class given the measured data is addressed. At the second level the problem of selecting the best model class from a set of competing model classes is addressed. The application of the framework in structural damage detection problems is then presented. The structural damage detection is accomplished by associating each model class to a damage location pattern in the structure, indicative of the location of damage. Using the Bayesian model selection framework, the probable damage locations are ranked according to the posterior probabilities of the corresponding model classes. The severity of damage is then inferred from the posterior probability of the model parameters corresponding to the most probable model class. Computational issues are addressed related to the estimation of the optimal model within a class of models and the optimal class of models among the alternative classes. Asymptotic approximations as well as Monte Carlo simulations are used for estimating the probability integrals arising in the formulation. The framework {{can be used for}} assessing the reliability of structures based on the <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> data. The proposed methodology is illustrated by applying it to the identification of the location and severity of damage of a laboratory smallscaled bridge using <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> data...|$|E

40|$|International audienceHealth Monitoring {{of civil}} {{structures}} {{can be performed}} by detecting changes in the modal parameters of a structure, or more directly in the <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> signals. For a continuous monitoring the excitation of a structure is usually ambient, thus unknown and assumed to be noise. Hence, all estimates from the vibration measurements are realizations of random variables with inherent uncertainty due to (unknown) process and measurement noise and finite data length. In this talk, a strategy for quantifying the uncertainties of modal parameter estimates from a subspace-based system identification approach is presented {{and the importance of}} uncertainty quantification in monitoring approaches is shown. Furthermore, a damage detection method is presented, which is based on the direct comparison of the <b>measured</b> <b>vibration</b> signals without estimating modal parameters, while taking the statistical uncertainty in the signals correctly into account. The usefulness of both strategies is illustrated on data from a progressive damage action on a prestressed concrete bridge...|$|E

40|$|The R&D {{group of}} the EFRC has {{developed}} recently a guideline for vibrations in reciprocating compressor systems. This guideline includes many years of experience and knowledge of engineers who are {{working in the field}} of rotating machinery. The worldwide acceptance of such a guideline will increase when it is proven that the values from this guideline are realistic. Many reciprocating compressors are installed at the chemical plant of BASF in Ludwigshafen in Germany, ranging from low to high power consumption compressors, fixed and variable speed compressors from different manufacturers and from very old to very new.
