These observations are consistent with the previous findings on other species of Hawaiian Drosophila.

40|$|International audienceWe {{analysed}} the phenotypic {{outcome of}} a Stra 8 -null mutation on male meiosis. Because the mutant spermatocytes (1) underwent premeiotic DNA replication, (2) displayed cytological features attesting initiation of recombination and of axial-element assembly, and (3) expressed Spo 11 and numerous other meiotic genes, {{it was concluded that}} STRA 8 is dispensable for meiotic initiation. The few mutant spermatocytes that progressed beyond leptonema showed a prolonged bouquet-stage configuration, asynapsis and heterosynapsis, suggesting function(s) of STRA 8 in chromosome pairing. Most importantly, a large number of mutant leptotene spermatocytes underwent premature chromosome condensation, within 24 hours following the meiotic S phase. This phenomenon yielded aberrant metaphase-like cells with 40 univalent chromosomes, similar to normal <b>mitotic</b> <b>metaphases.</b> From these latter observations and from the wild-type pattern of Stra 8 expression, we propose that, in preleptotene spermatocytes, STRA 8 is involved in the process that leads to stable commitment to the meiotic cell cycle...|$|R

All these techniques showed that in all the examined species the ribosomal cistrons are located in one telomeric position on the X chromosomes. This localization of NORs {{seems to be a}} general phenomenon in aphids whereas autosomal NORs have been reported for Schoutedenia ralumensis only. Our data show a certain amount of heteromorphism between homologous NORs. This condition, already reported for some aphid species, is an unusual phenomenon in other animal species. The origin of this rDNA heteromorphism is still unclear.

The sperm aster enlarged and, at the time of pronuclear apposition, filled the cytoplasm. After male and female gamete union, the microtubule matrix was reduced. At the <b>mitotic</b> <b>metaphase</b> stage, microtubules were detected in the spindle, which was anastral and fusiform.

At <b>mitotic</b> <b>metaphase,</b> microtubules were concentrated around the chromatin. The results of experiments using taxol, a microtubule stabilizing agent, suggest that maternal centrosomal material is present in the mature porcine oocyte as dispersed undetect-able material that can form a microtubule network after parthenogenetic activation.

40|$|SummaryDuring cell division, a microtubule-based {{mitotic spindle}} mediates the {{faithful}} segregation of duplicated chromosomes into daughter cells. Proper length {{control of the}} <b>metaphase</b> <b>mitotic</b> spindle is critical to this process and {{is thought to be}} achieved through a mechanism in which spindle pole separation forces from plus-end-directed motors are balanced by forces from minus-end-directed motors that pull spindle poles together. However, in contrast to this model, <b>metaphase</b> <b>mitotic</b> spindles with inactive kinesin- 14  minus-end-directed motors often have shorter spindle lengths, along with poorly aligned spindle microtubules. A mechanistic explanation for this paradox is unknown. Using computational modeling, in vitro reconstitution, live-cell fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy, we now find that the budding yeast kinesin- 14 molecular motor Kar 3 -Cik 1 can efficiently align spindle microtubules along the spindle axis.

The karyotypes of E. guentheri and E. parvus were very similar and differed only slightly in the morphology of pair 2. These two species also had an NOR-bearing secondary constriction on the long arms of pair 6. The karyotype of E. binotatus differed from those of E. guentheriand E. parvus in the morphology {{and size of the}} chromosomes, in the number of chromosomal arms, in the NOR location (detected on the short arms of pair 1), and in the pattern of heterochromatin. These results reinforce the differences between E guentheri and E binotatus and support the existence of two species group. Five individuals of E binotatus showed morphs for pairs 2 and 3. These morphs probably arose from the translocation of a segment from one chromosome of pair 3 to a homologue of pair 2. In addition, some <b>mitotic</b> <b>metaphases</b> of E binotatus showed spontaneous chromosomal breaks which suggested that there were sites of fragility. Meiotic diakinesis showed multiple chromosomal rings, indicating the occurrence of multiple translocations, as previously reported by other investigators.

40|$|Silver {{staining}} of <b>mitotic</b> <b>metaphases</b> of the aphid A. pisum {{reveals the}} presence of argentophilic bridges connecting the two X chromosomes. The presence of nucleolar material connecting sex chromosomes seems {{to be quite a}} common phenomenon in organisms belonging to very different phyla, and suggests a role of nucleolar proteins in chromosome association and disjunction. In somatic cells of A. pisum, bridges connecting X chromosomes are detectable not only after silver staining but also after CMA 3 staining. This finding suggests that GC rich DNA is involved in this type of association. Molecular analysis of rDNA intergenic spacers shows several 247 bp repeats containing short sequences having a high level of homology with the chi sequence of Escherichia coli and with the consensus core region of human hypervariable minisatellites. Moreover, each 247 bp repeat presents a perfect copy of a promoter sequence for polymerase I. These aphid repeats show structural homologies with a 240 bp repeat, which is considered to be responsible for sex chromosome pairing in Drosophila, not only in view of their common presence within rDNA spacers but also for their length and structure. The presence of chi sequences in the IGS of A. pisum, by promoting unequal crossing-over between rDNA genes, could thus give rise to the nucleolar organizing region (NOR) heteromorphism described in different aphid species. Although X pairing at NORs is fundamental in aphid male determination, {{the presence of}} heteromorphism of rDNA genes does not inhibit male determination in the A. pisum clone utilized for our experiments...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{repetitive}} sequences that {{accumulate in}} the heterochromatin consist a large {{fraction of a}} genome and due to their properties are suggested to be implicated in centromere function. Current knowledge of heterochromatic regions of Bactrocera oleae genome, the major pest of the olive tree, is practically nonexistent. In our effort to explore the repetitive DNA portion of B. oleae genome, a novel satellite sequence designated BoR 300 was isolated and cloned. The present study describes the genomic organization, abundance and chromosomal distribution of BoR 300 which is organized in tandem, forming arrays of 298 bp-long monomers. Sequence analysis showed an AT content of 60. 4 %, a CENP-B like-motif and a high curvature value based on predictive models. Comparative analysis among randomly selected monomers demonstrated {{a high degree of}} sequence homogeneity (88 % – 97 %) of BoR 300 repeats, which are present at approximately 3, 000 copies per haploid genome accounting for about 0. 28 % of the total genomic DNA, based on two independent qPCR approaches. In addition, expression of the repeat was also confirmed through RT-PCR, by which BoR 300 transcripts were detected in both sexes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of BoR 300 on <b>mitotic</b> <b>metaphases</b> and polytene chromosomes revealed signals to the centromeres of two out of the six chromosomes which indicated a chromosome-specific centromeric localization. Moreover, BoR 300 is not conserved in the closely related Bactrocera species tested and it is also absent in other dipterans, but it’s rather restricted to the B. oleae genome. This feature of species-specificity attributed to BoR 300 satellit...|$|R
