5|$|A <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason was {{recorded}} primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria. Its production {{was marked by}} an ongoing legal dispute with Waters as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released. Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason has no central theme and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason was {{released}} in the UK and US on 7September 1987. It went straight to number three in both countries, held from the top spot by Michael Jackson's Bad and Whitesnake's self-titled album.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>momentary</b> {{reduction}} in speed, the train {{turns to the}} right and descends into a downward 540-degree helix. Immediately following the first helix, the train climbs into an upward 270-degree helix to the left. Following the climb is a small descent and a final hill. The train climbs up from the final hill into the terminal brake run.|$|E
5|$|From the 1987 <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason tour onwards, Wright and touring keyboardist Jon Carin favoured Kurzweil digital synthesizers, {{including}} the K2000 keyboard and K2000S rack module for reproducing piano and electric piano sounds. Wright retained the Hammond {{along with a}} Leslie speaker, playing it onstage and using it during the Division Bell sessions.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{received}} mixed reviews and was derided by Waters, A <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason outsold Pink Floyd's previous album The Final Cut (1983), and {{was supported by}} a successful world tour. In the US, it has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.|$|E
5|$|According to the USDA, in 2016 501,560 animals (61%) (not {{including}} rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) {{were used}} in procedures that did not include more than <b>momentary</b> pain or distress. 247,882 (31%) animals {{were used in}} procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 71,370 (9%) were used in studies that would cause pain or distress {{that would not be}} relieved.|$|E
5|$|Additional Confederate {{activity}} in Louisiana occurred on June 29 at Goodrich's Landing. Confederates attacked a plantation and army training center run by former slaves. The Confederates destroyed the plantations and captured {{over a hundred}} former slaves before disengaging {{in the face of}} Ellet's Marines. Confederate raids such as these were disruptive and caused damage, but they were only minor setbacks and showed the Confederates could cause only <b>momentary</b> disturbances in the area.|$|E
5|$|After Waters' {{departure}} in 1985, Wright {{began to}} contribute to Pink Floyd again, beginning with sessions for the album A <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason. However, he did not legally rejoin as an equal to Gilmour and Mason, and was a salaried musician for the resulting tour, as his contract {{said he could not}} rejoin as a full member. On the album credits, his name was listed after Mason and Gilmour and his photo did not appear on the cover.|$|E
5|$|Delegates, as {{they waited}} for the {{committees}} to complete their work, spent much of the first two days listening to various orators. Of these, only Senator Blackburn, a silver supporter, sparked much reaction, and that only <b>momentary.</b> Delegates called for better-known speakers, such as Altgeld or Bryan, but were granted neither then; the Illinois governor declined, and the Nebraskan, once seated, spent much of his time away from the convention floor at the platform committee meeting at the Palmer House.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{spent more}} than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California, before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost {{identical}} road crew to that used for their <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety. The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by English {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, {{released in the}} UK and US on 7 September 1987, on the labels EMI and Columbia. It followed guitarist David Gilmour's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, Wright and Mason helped Gilmour craft what became the first Pink Floyd album since the December 1985 departure of bass guitarist, singer, and primary songwriter Roger Waters.|$|E
5|$|Black {{attempts}} to locate further {{information about the}} Millennium Group's activity, having believed them defeated in 1999. He finds that his access to their old computer systems still works, and learns that they may know the whereabouts of his daughter Jordan. Spurred on by several <b>momentary</b> encounters with similarly demonic beings, Black returns to his home town of Seattle, Washington. As he visits the grave of his wife Catherine, he is tranquilised and apprehended by Group members. Waking in captivity, he learns that they seek his help against the same demonic forces he has been encountering—and that Jordan is now a willing initiate of the Group. She has now begun to powerfully manifest visions of the future, similar to Black's ability to see the past through others' eyes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{creative}} tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, {{followed by}} Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined {{them as a}} session musician and, later, a band member. The three produced two more albums—A <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured through 1994. After nearly two decades of acrimony, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason reunited with Waters in 2005 to perform as Pink Floyd in London {{as part of the}} global awareness event Live 8; Gilmour and Waters later stated they had no plans to reunite as a band again. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The final Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was recorded without Waters and based almost entirely on unreleased material.|$|E
5|$|Nemec's {{character}} replaced Daniel Jackson (portrayed by Michael Shanks) during season6 after Shanks {{had left}} the show amid controversy after season5. The producers based Jonas's motivation to join Stargate Command on his <b>momentary</b> reluctance to actively prevent Daniel's death, and his feelings of responsibility afterwards. Jonas was slowly integrated into the story in a prolonged transition stage over {{the first half of}} season6. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season6, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season7. The role of Jonas was reduced to recurring status in season7.|$|E
5|$|Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) {{lives in}} Tokyo with {{his younger sister}} Linda (Paz de la Huerta) and {{supports}} himself by dealing drugs, {{against the advice of}} his friend Alex (Cyril Roy), who attempts to turn Oscar's interest toward The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a Buddhist book about the afterlife. The first segment begins with Linda leaving for work (at a local strip club) and then follows Oscar's nightly routine through strict point-of-view shots, including <b>momentary</b> blackouts that represent blinking, private internal thoughts, and extended sequences of a DMT-induced hallucination.|$|E
5|$|The narrator, Charles, {{lives with}} his friend Juste in a large boarding-house {{populated}} almost entirely with students like themselves (Charles is studying law and Juste medicine). The sole exception is their middle-aged neighbor, Z. Marcas, of whom they see only <b>momentary</b> glimpses in the hall. They learn {{that he is a}} copyist, and living on an extremely small salary. When the students find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a <b>momentary</b> steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
5|$|Winston Churchill was {{impressed}} by Henson. Grimley comments that they had much in common, both spending years as isolated figures speaking out for beliefs that were dismissed {{at the time and}} later vindicated. As prime minister, Churchill persuaded Henson out of retirement in 1940 to resume his old duties as a Canon of Westminster Abbey. After overcoming the <b>momentary</b> strangeness of being back in his old post after nearly thirty years he preached with vigour until cataracts made his eyesight too poor to continue. He retired from the Abbey in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, <b>momentary</b> flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E
5|$|Childermass {{meanwhile}} eventually {{receives the}} message meant {{for him by}} Strange and uses it to break the enchantment over Lady Pole. Enraged by this, the gentleman with the thistledown hair intends to place a second deadly curse on Lady Pole, as Faerie tradition demands. En route, he murders Vinculus after they encounter him, with Stephen Black forced to watch. During these events, Norrell and Strange attempt a spell that would cause the nature forces of England {{to pay homage to}} John Uskglass. Not knowing his true name, they dedicate it to the 'nameless slave'. However, the two magicians' belief that this is Uskglass is mistaken, and instead the power is devoted to Stephen. He uses his <b>momentary</b> control of England to destroy the man with the thistledown hair, before Stephen, travelling through one of the newly opened Faerie roads, becomes the new king of the now blossoming Lost-Hope.|$|E
5|$|Edward habitually smoked twenty {{cigarettes}} and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a rodent ulcer, {{a type of}} cancer affecting the skin next to his nose, was cured with radium. Towards {{the end of his}} life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered a <b>momentary</b> loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.|$|E
5|$|Przemysł II's foreign {{politics}} are more known during this time. His friendly relations with Henry IV Probus survived, despite the <b>momentary</b> interruption, even after 1273. This alliance was maintained without significant changes, and {{only as a}} result of the events that taken place on 18 February 1277 in the town of Jelcz near Wrocław, the Duke of Poznań was forced to explicitly stand at the side of the Wrocław ruler, his cousin. Henryk IV was kidnapped and imprisoned in the Legnica castle by his uncle, Duke Bolesław II Rogatka. The pretext used by the Duke of Legnica to do this was the demands of the Duke of Wrocław over one-third of his domains, which, according to him, were part of his inheritance as legacy from both his father Henry III the White (died in 1266) and uncle Władysław (died in 1270). Bolesław II used in his favor the political weakeness of Henryk IV's guardian, King Otakar II of Bohemia, who in September 1276 was forced to submit to King Rudolph I of Germany.|$|E
5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a <b>momentary</b> clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} CAB and included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB concluded that the <b>momentary</b> fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a boost pump failure, and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E
5|$|The three-week {{siege of}} Marash was also {{accompanied}} by the wholesale massacre of the Armenian repatriates. Roving Turkish bands threw kerosene-doused rags on Armenian homes and laid a constant barrage upon the American relief hospital. The Armenians themselves, as in previous times of trouble, sought refuge in their churches and schools. Women and children found <b>momentary</b> shelter in Marash's six Armenian Apostolic, three Armenian Evangelical churches and in the city's sole Catholic cathedral. The Armenian legionnaires attempted {{to put up a}} defense but were ultimately overwhelmed. All the churches and eventually the entire Armenian districts were put to flames. The plight of the Armenians was only exacerbated when the French decided to pull out on 10 February. When the 2,000 Armenians who had taken shelter in the Catholic cathedral attempted to follow the retreat, they were cut down by Turkish rifle and machine gun fire.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{attempted}} {{to subvert the}} <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained {{the right to use}} the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.|$|E
5|$|However, Kerrigan {{does not}} perish, {{and as the}} second chapter begins, the player is charged by the Zerg hive mind, the Overmind, to protect a {{chrysalis}} it claims will be its greatest creation. The chrysalis eventually hatches on the Zerg world Char to reveal Kerrigan having been infested with Zerg DNA, making her a powerful hybrid of both Zerg and Terran genetics. Raynor, drawn to Char by psychic dreams cast by Kerrigan during her incubation, fails {{in an attempt to}} rescue her, but is spared as Kerrigan does not see him as a threat, and possibly due to any lingering affection she had for him. After breaking into a Terran science vessel and reversing the neural conditioning from her training as a psionic agent, Kerrigan is able to sense the presence of the Protoss fleet commander Tassadar on Char. Tassadar diverts Kerrigan's attention long enough for his companion Zeratul to assassinate Zasz, one of the Zerg commanders, with psionic energies the Zerg are unfamiliar with. This causes a temporary mental link between Zeratul and the Overmind, who uses this <b>momentary</b> contact with Zeratul's memories to locate the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind immediately launches the bulk of the Zerg Swarm in an invasion, although Kerrigan remains behind on Char to hunt down Tassadar and Zeratul.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{heads to}} Torona IV to open {{negotiations}} with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in matters of protocol. After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes Cyrus Redblock (Lawrence Tierney) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen (David Selburg) {{to join him in}} the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary (Gary Armagnac) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the Enterprise is scanned from a distance by the Jaradan, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a <b>momentary</b> glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.|$|E

25|$|Snooks eighth war patrol was {{conducted}} off the Kuril Islands from 25 December 1944 to 17 February 1945. Her only sightings during this patrol were two friendly Soviet vessels and a <b>momentary</b> {{contact with a}} small patrol craft.|$|E
