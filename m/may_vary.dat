Jourgensen claims that he convinced Fred Durst to strip naked and wear a cowboy hat while singing. The contributions of all three were omitted from the finished album. Bubba Sparxxx joined Durst in a Los Angeles studio, but his contributions also {{did not make the}} album. Durst wrote over 30 songs with Limp Bizkit drummer John Otto and the band's bassist, Sam Rivers. During production of Results <b>May</b> <b>Vary,</b> Durst listened to the Cure, Patsy Cline, Mazzy Star and classical music.|$|E

In 100 grams, raw squash supplies 16 calories and is rich in vitamin C (20% of the Daily Value, DV), moderate in vitamin B6 and riboflavin (12–17% DV), but otherwise devoid of appreciable nutrient content (table), although the nutrient content of different Curcubita species <b>may</b> <b>vary</b> somewhat.|$|E

Within a single element, the number of {{neutrons}} <b>may</b> <b>vary,</b> determining the isotope of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay.|$|E

There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.|$|E
