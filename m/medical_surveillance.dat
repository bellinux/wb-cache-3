25|$|Decrees {{were made}} in January 1982 {{concerning}} official recognition of persons and bodies responsible for noise monitoring, the monitoring of carbon monoxide and benzene levels in the atmosphere at workplaces, and the inspection of electrical installations. A decree issued in February 1982 laid down safety measures to be taken against electrical hazards arising during the construction, operation and maintenance of electric power distribution installations. A decree issued by the Minister of Labour in March 1982 specified the offices responsible for carrying out the technical tests on particularly dangerous machinery (listed in a decree of April 1981) which are required before the machinery can be officially approved. It also specified the {{information to be provided}} by the person applying for official approval. A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up, restructuring, organization, financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special <b>medical</b> <b>surveillance</b> is required. Another decree, made that same month, contained new regulations governing health, safety and preventive health measures in public undertakings. It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, <b>medical</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code, social security system, civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people. In June 1982, a new popular savings book paying index-linked interest was introduced, under which Individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France and whose tax liability was under FF 1 000 were entitled to hold a maximum of FF 10000 (FF 20000 for households) savings in that scheme. Also in 1982, holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers (Cheques-Vacances), subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings. A banking law of January 1984 entitled individuals lacking current accounts who had been refused by three banks to ask the Bank of France to designate a bank or the postal bank to provide them with free accounts.|$|E

40|$|Medical {{devices are}} used to diagnose, treat, or prevent a disease or {{abnormal}} physical condition without any chemical action in the body. They can also result in unintended incidents and other errors. This thesis was divided into three chapters: i) a systematic review on the recognition, reporting and resolution of incidents related to medical devices and other health technologies; ii) telephone interviews with physicians and registered nurses (RNs) to solicit information on the resolution, reporting and resolution of medical device-related incidents based on their professional experience; and iii) a case study to review the continuous quality improvement (CQI) data retrieved from the wireless smart infusion pump system at The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) and to propose a CQI data analysis process. The systematic review included 30 studies on factors that influence the recognition, reporting and resolution of incidents in hospitals and interventions to improve patient safety. Central themes that emerged for incident reporting were personal attitudes, awareness and perception of incident reporting systems, organizational culture, and feedback to healthcare professionals. In our telephone interviews, physicians and RNs attributed incident recognition to devices not operating based on the manufacturer’s instructions, and to the hospital staff’s knowledge of and professional experience {{with the use of}} the medical device, and clinical manifestations of patients. Suggestions to improve <b>medical</b> device safety <b>surveillance</b> centered on education and training to ensure that the staff is able to use the medical device properly and know what would be considered an error, and how to report these errors. The results of the systematic review and interviews helped to inform the design of a <b>medical</b> device <b>surveillance</b> framework in a hospital setting. Our case study assessed the Dose Error Reduction Software compliance and frequency of soft and hard limit alerts with wireless smart infusion pump systems over a one year period. A CQI data analysis process to monitor the performance of wireless smart infusion pumps is proposed.
