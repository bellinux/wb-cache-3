500|$|Niankhsekhmet: chief {{physician}} of Sahure, {{he asked the}} king that a false door be made for his tomb, to which the king agreed. Sahure had the false door made of fine Tura limestone, carved and painted blue in his presence. The king wished a long life to his physician, telling him: [...] "As <b>my</b> <b>nostrils</b> enjoy health, as the gods love me, may you depart into the cemetery at an advanced old age as one revered".|$|E
60|$|All {{the time}} the scent of that horrible mourning-coach is in <b>my</b> <b>nostrils,</b> and I breathe nothing but a funeral atmosphere.|$|E
6000|$|Thou, {{mother of}} my mortal part, With cruelty didst mould my heart, And with false self-deceiving tears Didst blind <b>my</b> <b>nostrils,</b> eyes, and ears, ...|$|E
60|$|Indigestion is {{the devil}}: nay, 'tis {{the devil and}} all. It besets a man {{in every one of}} his senses. I lose my {{appetite}} at the sight of successful knavery, and sicken to loathing at the noise and nonsense of self-important folly. When the hollow-hearted wretch takes me by the hand, the feeling spoils my dinner; the proud man's wine so offends my palate that it chokes me in the gullet; and the pulvilised, feathered, pert coxcomb, is so disgustful in <b>my</b> <b>nostril</b> that <b>my</b> stomach turns.|$|R
60|$|One more frantic effort I {{made with}} my fast ebbing strength. Weakly I rose {{for the last}} time--my {{tortured}} lungs gasped for the breath that would fill them with a strange and numbing element, but instead I felt the revivifying breath of life-giving air surge through <b>my</b> starving <b>nostrils</b> into <b>my</b> dying lungs. I was saved.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What price your latter-day {{lime-juice}} subaltern?' I {{whispered to}} Stalky behind <b>my</b> hand. His <b>nostrils</b> expanded, and he drummed {{on the edge}} of the Japanese jar with his knuckles.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the smell}} is in <b>my</b> <b>nostrils,</b> [...] Through {{blossoms}} red or gold, Of my own green flower unfading, [...] A bitter smell and bold.|$|E
6000|$|Thou, {{mother of}} my mortal part, [...] With cruelty didst mould my heart, [...] And with false self-deceiving tears [...] Didst bind <b>my</b> <b>nostrils,</b> eyes, and ears, ...|$|E
60|$|Instantly {{she shot}} {{out a hand}} towards me. The edges of the fur cloak fell apart. A wave of the faintest {{possible}} scent floated into <b>my</b> <b>nostrils.</b>|$|E
60|$|Margaret's {{door was}} open. I plunged into her room. The moment I drew the blanket-thickness {{from my eyes}} I knew {{blindness}} and a modicum of what Bert Rhine must have suffered. Oh, the intolerable bite of the sulphur in <b>my</b> lungs, <b>nostrils,</b> eyes, and brain! No light burned in the room. I could only strangle and stumble for'ard to Margaret's bed, upon which I collapsed.|$|R
5000|$|Soviet {{dissident}} Vladimir Bukovsky {{described how}} he was force-fed: [...] "The feeding pipe was thick, thicker than <b>my</b> <b>nostril,</b> and would not go in. Blood came gushing out of my nose and tears down my cheeks, but they kept pushing until the cartilages cracked. I guess I would have screamed if I could, but I could not with the pipe in my throat. I could breathe neither in nor out at first; I wheezed like a drowning man [...] - [...] my lungs felt ready to burst. The doctor also seemed ready to burst into tears, but she kept shoving the pipe farther and farther down. Only when it reached my stomach could I resume breathing, carefully. Then she poured some slop through a funnel into the pipe that would choke me if it came back up. They held me down for another half-hour so that the liquid was absorbed by my stomach {{and could not be}} vomited back, and then began to pull the pipe out bit by bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} less of their leanness than of their smell," [...] I returned. [...] "Their odour when they approach me is not flowery, but {{resembles that of}} other dogs which feed on flesh, and have offended <b>my</b> too sensitive <b>nostrils</b> even in the drawing-rooms of Caracas. It is not like the fragrance of cattle when they return from the pasture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well; 'tis {{the same}} thing in such matters! And the form was Sir Blount's. <b>My</b> <b>nostrils</b> told me, for--there, 'a smelled. Yes, I could smell'n, being to leeward.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So 'To-morrow we die'?" [...] said Miltoun: [...] "You mean, I suppose, that 'public life' is {{the breath}} of <b>my</b> <b>nostrils,</b> and I must die, because I give it up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like it not," [...] I answered; whereon {{he caught}} me rudely by both shoulders, looking close into my face, {{so that the}} fume of the wine he had been {{drinking}} reached <b>my</b> <b>nostrils.</b>|$|E
60|$|Although {{my nerves}} were not {{delicate}} enough {{to detect the}} odour of plebeian fingers which had offended Mr. Fairlie's <b>nostrils,</b> <b>my</b> taste was sufficiently educated to enable me to appreciate {{the value of the}} drawings, while I turned them over. They were, for the most part, really fine specimens of English water-colour art; and they had deserved much better treatment at the hands of their former possessor than they appeared to have received.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is he a member?" [...] said {{someone in}} the background, and {{somebody}} else suggested calling a policeman. I perceived that only a prompt retreat would save {{the whole story of}} our quarrel from the newspapers. So far as I could see nobody knew me there except Philip. I had to take the risks of his behavior; manifestly I couldn't control it. I made no further attempt to explain anything to anybody. Everyone was a little too perplexed for prompt action, and so the advantage in that matter lay with me. I walked through the door, and with what I imagined to be an appearance of the utmost serenity down the steps. I noted an ascending member glance at me with an expression of exceptional interest, but it was only after I had traversed the length of Pall Mall that I realized that my lip and the corner of <b>my</b> <b>nostril</b> were both bleeding profusely. I called a cab when I discovered my handkerchief scarlet, and retreated to my flat and cold ablutions. Then I sat down to write a letter to Tarvrille, with a clamorous [...] "Urgent, Please forward if away" [...] above the address, and tell him at least to suppress Philip. But within the club that blockhead, thinking of nothing but the appearances of our fight and his own credit, was varying his assertion that he had thrashed me, with denunciations of me as a [...] "blackguard," [...] and giving half a dozen men a highly colored, improvised, and altogether improbable account of my relentless pursuit and persecution of Lady Mary Justin, and how she had left London to avoid me. They listened, no doubt, with extreme avidity. The matrimonial relations of the Justins had long been a matter for speculative minds.|$|R
60|$|This of the loon--I do {{not mean}} its laugh, but its looning--is a long-drawn call, as it were, {{sometimes}} singularly human to my ear--hoo-hoo-ooooo, like the hallooing of {{a man on a}} very high key, having thrown his voice into his head. I have heard a sound exactly like it when breathing heavily through <b>my</b> own <b>nostrils,</b> half awake at ten at night, suggesting my affinity to the loon; as if its language were but a dialect of my own, after all. Formerly, when lying awake at midnight in those woods, I had listened to hear some words or syllables of their language, but it chanced that I listened in vain until I heard the cry of the loon. I have heard it occasionally on the ponds of my native town, but there its wildness is not enhanced by the surrounding scenery.|$|R
6000|$|... '"As {{surely as}} I stand upon {{the brink of}} death at this moment, I am innocent. Be comforted, then, O bruised heart; be at peace, O thou breath of <b>my</b> <b>nostrils,</b> life of my life!" ...|$|E
60|$|Troil. I {{have not}} {{quenched}} my eyes with dewy sleep this night; But fiery fumes mount upward to my brains, And, when I breathe, methinks <b>my</b> <b>nostrils</b> hiss! I shall turn basilisk, {{and with my}} sight Do my hands' work on Diomede this day.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{brought the}} death; I rode the spotted {{sickness}} from hut to hut of their workmen, {{and yet they}} would not cease." [...] A nose-slitten, hide-worn Ass, lame, scissor-legged, and galled, limped forward. [...] "I cast the death at them out of <b>my</b> <b>nostrils,</b> but they would not cease." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was midnight; and {{you still}} sat by my side. All others had {{departed}} [...] from the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the coffin. The [...] lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the tremulousness of the [...] monotonous strains. But suddenly these strains diminished in [...] distinctness and in volume. Finally they ceased. The perfume in <b>my</b> [...] <b>nostrils</b> died away. Forms affected my vision no longer. The oppression [...] of the Darkness uplifted itself from my bosom. A dull shot like that [...] of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of [...] the idea of contact. All of what man has termed sense was merged in [...] the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of [...] duration. The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of [...] the deadly Decay.|$|R
6000|$|What {{took place}} during the next five or six days I know not. The demon of sea-sickness had {{completely}} prostrated my faculties, bodily and mental. Some faint recollections I have of stormy weather, horrible noises, and hurried dinners; but the greater part of that period is a miserable blank in my memory. Towards the sixth day, however, the savoury flavour of a splendid salmon-trout floated past <b>my</b> dried-up <b>nostrils</b> like [...] "Afric's spicy gale," [...] and caused my collapsed stomach to yearn with strong emotion. The ship, too, was going more quietly through the water; and a broad stream of sunshine shot through the small window of my berth, penetrated my breast, and went down into the centre of my heart, filling it with a calm, complacent pleasure quite indescribable. Sounds, however, of an attack upon the trout roused me, and with a mighty effort I tumbled out of bed, donned my clothes, and seated myself {{for the first time at}} the cabin table.|$|R
6000|$|This kind of plunge {{is always}} awkward {{owing to the}} {{difficulty}} of rising, and usually disagreeable, owing to the manner in which snow stuffs itself into neck, ears, nose, eyes, mouth--if open--and any convenient crevice of person or garments. The snow-shoes, too, which are so serviceable when you are above them, become exasperatingly obstructive when you are below them. After a struggle of two minutes I got my head clear, winked the snow out of my eyes, blew it from <b>my</b> mouth and <b>nostrils,</b> and looked up. Lumley was standing there with a bland smile on his amiable face; he seldom laughed, though he sometimes chuckled! ...|$|R
6000|$|I don't {{know how}} long I had been asleep when I was roused by a shake on my shoulder. The room was pitch dark, and I felt a hand {{suddenly}} clapped over my mouth. Then a strong smell of whisky and tobacco saluted <b>my</b> <b>nostrils,</b> and a whisper stole into my ear-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} hung them farther from my palace, though, were I King Louis," [...] said the youth. [...] "In my country, we hang up dead corbies where living corbies haunt, {{but not in}} our gardens or pigeon houses. The very scent of the carrion--faugh--reached <b>my</b> <b>nostrils</b> at the {{distance}} where we stood." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{head was}} turned away from me, a striped parasol leaned over her shoulder. With a faintly defiant tilt of her {{beautiful}} head, as if exclaiming, [...] "See, Strangeness, I come!" [...] she stepped firmly on over the turf. A breath of some delicate indoor perfume was wafted across to <b>my</b> <b>nostrils.</b> I clung to my stone, watching her.|$|E
60|$|But as my ears hummed, and all {{my bones}} danced in me with the reverberating din, and <b>my</b> eyes and <b>nostrils</b> were almost suffocated with the smoke, and when I saw this grim old gunner firing away so solemnly, I thought it a strange mode of honouring a man's memory who had himself been {{slaughtered}} by a cannon. Only the smoke, that, after rolling in at the port-holes, rapidly drifted away to leeward, and was lost to view, seemed truly emblematical touching the personage thus honoured, since that great non-combatant, the Bible, assures us that our life is but a vapour, that quickly passeth away.|$|R
60|$|My skin grew cold, {{and my hair}} {{stood on}} end as I listened to that steady and {{ponderous}} footfall. There was some creature there, and surely by the speed of its advance, it was one which {{could see in the}} dark. I crouched low on my rock and tried to blend myself into it. The steps grew nearer still, then stopped, and presently I was aware of a loud lapping and gurgling. The creature was drinking at the stream. Then again there was silence, broken by a succession of long sniffs and snorts of tremendous volume and energy. Had it caught the scent of me? <b>My</b> own <b>nostrils</b> were filled by a low fetid odour, mephitic and abominable. Then I heard the steps again. They were on my side of the stream now. The stones rattled within a few yards of where I lay. Hardly daring to breathe, I crouched upon my rock. Then the steps drew away. I heard the splash as it returned across the river, and the sound died away into the distance in the direction from which it had come.|$|R
5000|$|The Apollo 17 {{crew members}} recalled: [...] "You {{knew that you}} were in a very heavily {{infiltrated}} atmosphere in the LM because of the lunar dust"; [...] "the dust clearing was remarkable considering the amount of dust we had"; [...] "although {{there was a lot of}} irritation to <b>my</b> sinuses and <b>nostrils</b> soon after taking the helmet off, by 2 hours that had decreased considerably"; [...] "I did all the transfer with my helmet off and I am sorry I did because the dust really bothered my eyes and throat. I was tasting it and eating it"; and [...] "when I climbed in the tunnel I could tell there was a lot of dust in the LM and you could smell it".|$|R
6000|$|Now, I {{really could}} not swallow that; and so plainly betrayed my incredulity, that the eagle explained. 'The savoury smells which rise to <b>my</b> <b>nostrils</b> from that {{excellent}} hotel, {{with an occasional}} sniff from the Tremont, are quite sufficient to satisfy my appetite; for, having no stomach, I don't need much food, and I drink nothing but water.' ...|$|E
60|$|Now as to {{what was}} done in {{particular}} during the next ten minutes or more I cannot rightly set down, because so great was my excitement and so intense the fever which had come upon me after the first volley, while the acrid odor of burning powder assailed <b>my</b> <b>nostrils,</b> that I hardly know what I myself did.|$|E
60|$|Came the {{duration}} of darkness, and the slow-growing awareness of other things and of another self. First of all, in this awareness, was dust. It was in <b>my</b> <b>nostrils,</b> dry and acrid. It was on my lips. It coated my face, my hands, and especially was it noticeable on the finger-tips when touched by the ball of my thumb.|$|E
60|$|About {{four hours}} after {{we began our}} journey, I awaked by a very ridiculous accident; for the {{carriage}} being stopped a while, to adjust something {{that was out of}} order, two or three of the young natives had the curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up into the engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer in the guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into <b>my</b> left <b>nostril,</b> which tickled <b>my</b> nose like a straw, and made me sneeze violently; whereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks before I knew the cause of my waking so suddenly. We made a long march the remaining part of the day, and, rested at night with five hundred guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows and arrows, ready to shoot me if I should offer to stir. The next morning at sun-rise we continued our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of the city gates about noon. The emperor, and all his court, came out to meet us; but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to endanger his person by mounting on my body.|$|R
60|$|Nour. I burn, I {{more than}} burn; I am all fire. See how <b>my</b> mouth and <b>nostrils</b> flame expire! I'll not come near myself-- Now I'm a burning lake, it rolls and flows; I'll rush, and pour it all upon my foes. Pull, pull that reverend piece of timber near: Throw't on--'tis dry--'twill burn-- Ha, ha! how my old husband {{crackles}} there! Keep him down, keep him down; turn him about: I know him,--he'll but whiz, and strait go out. Fan me, you winds: What, not one breath of air? I'll burn them all, and yet have flames to spare. Quench me: Pour on whole rivers. 'Tis in vain: Morat stands there {{to drive them}} back again: With those huge billows in his hands, he blows New fire into my head: My brain-pan glows. See! see! there's Aureng-Zebe too takes his part; But he blows all his fire into my heart[4].|$|R
60|$|Our advance {{into this}} savage country had thus uneventfully {{proceeded}} {{for about a}} week, when we encamped for a night {{at a place where}} the river ran among considerable mountains clothed in wood. The fires were lighted on a level space at the water's edge; and we supped and lay down to sleep in the customary fashion. It chanced the night fell murderously cold; the stringency of the frost seized and bit me through my coverings so that pain kept me wakeful; and I was afoot again before the peep of day, crouching by the fires or trotting to and for at the stream's edge, to combat the aching of my limbs. At last dawn began to break upon hoar woods and mountains, the sleepers rolled in their robes, and the boisterous river dashing among spears of ice. I stood looking about me, swaddled in my stiff coat of a bull's fur, and the breath smoking from <b>my</b> scorched <b>nostrils,</b> when, upon a sudden, a singular, eager cry rang from the borders of the wood. The sentries answered it, the sleepers sprang to their feet; one pointed, the rest followed his direction with their eyes, and there, upon {{the edge of the forest}} and betwixt two trees, we beheld the figure of a man reaching forth his hands like one in ecstasy. The next moment he ran forward, fell on his knees at the side of the camp, and burst in tears.|$|R
