5000|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} in technological improvement {{that came out}} of the 1970s was in 1976 by Stoffel with the development of a magnetic sector RTSPMS technique that had a direct-inlet mass spectrometry (DIMS) also known as particle-inlet mass spectrometry (PIMS). [...] The PIMS instrument was the first to have a deferentially-pumped direct inlet that consists of a stainless steel capillary, followed by a skimmer and conical collimator that focuses the sample into a particle beam that goes on to the ionization region. This type of inlet system is what modern on-line aerosol mass spectrometer instruments use today. In 1982 Sinha and Fredlander developed the particle analysis by mass spectrometry (PAMS), this method was the first to incorporate the optical detection of particles followed by laser desorption/ionization (LDI) in a RTSPMS technique. Prior to this point all RTSPMS methods used surface desorption/ionization (SDI) which consist of a heated metal that ionized the samples. [...] The LDI method involves the sample being hit with a continuous wave, where the particle absorbs photons, and undergoes both desorption and ionization by the same pulse. LDI has several advantages over SDI for on-line single particle mass spectrometry, as such since its development it has been the primary ionization method for RTSPMS.The last major step in RTSPMS development was in 1994 by Prather. Prather developed the aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS), this method was the first that allow for simultaneous <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> and composition of single airborne particle. This techniques was different then previous methods in that instead of using the unreliable method of using light scattering signal intensity to measure particle size, this method uses a two laser system that allows for aerodynamic sizing.|$|E

40|$|Light {{scattering}} {{by small}} particles is the physical phenomenon {{that produces the}} natural rainbow in the sky. The same phenomenon can be reproduced in lab- oratory with monochromatic light giving rise to non-intrusive laser based techniques for the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> and refractive index of particles suspended in a medium possessing lower refractive index. These techniques are commonly called ”Rainbow Thermometry” techniques and appear {{at the beginning of}} the nineties. The <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> and refractive index of the particles is obtained through the analysis of the interference fringe image generated in the far field by means of the interaction between the laser light and the particles themselves. The work presented in this thesis has as objective the improvement of the Rainbow Techniques both on the theoretical aspects and the application. In this thesis the Airy theory, which is used as theoretical model for the Standard Rainbow Thermometry, has been improved to minimize the discrepancies it was presenting respect to more complex and complete theories and it has been generalized to spherical particles presenting a spherically symmetric refractive index gradient. This generalized model has been used to evaluate the size and temperature of a n-octane burning droplet in standard atmosphere with good results. The generalization of the Standard Rainbow Thermometry to multiple particles, Global Rainbow Thermometry, is presented both theoretically and experimentally and the role of the particle asphericity in the light scattered in- tensity is evaluated. Two experimental application of the Global Rainbow Thermometry are reported. The first one concerns the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> and refractive index of silicon oil droplets suspended in an aqueous bulk. This experiment allows the Global Rainbow Thermometry validation through the comparison with measurements simultaneously obtained with well known experimental techniques as Back-Light scattering and thermocouple measurement with satisfactory results. The second experiment concerns Global Rainbow Thermometry measurement performed on an evaporating flat-fan water spray. The results obtained, both for temperature and for size, are in satisfactory agreement with predictions al- ready done by other authors and with numerical simulations performed by the engineering code CASIMIRE. status: publishe...|$|E
