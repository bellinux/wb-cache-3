40|$|Objectives: This study {{assessed}} {{the health risks}} for children exposed to phthalate through several pathways including house dust, surface wipes and hand wipes in child facilities and indoor playgrounds. Methods: The indoor samples were collected from various children’s facilities (40 playrooms, 42 daycare centers, 44 kindergartens, and 42 indoor-playgrounds) in both summer (Jul-Sep, 2007) and winter (Jan-Feb, 2008). Hazard index (HI) was estimated for the non-carcinogens and the examined phthalates were diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP). The present study examined these four kinds of samples, i. e., indoor dust, surface wipes of product and hand wipes. Results: Among the phthalates, the detection rates of DEHP were 98 % in dust samples, 100 % in surface wipe samples, and 95 % in hand wipe samples. In this study, phthalate levels obtained from floor dust, product surface and children’s hand wipe samples were similar to or slightly less compared to previous studies. The 50 th and 95 th percentile value of child-sensitive materials did not exceed 1 (HI) for all subjects in all facilities. Conclusions: For DEHP, DnBP and BBzP their detection rates through <b>multi-routes</b> were high and their risk based on health risk assessment was also observed to be acceptable.

40|$|The existence, {{probability}} {{and control}} measures of airborne infections {{have been widely}} discussed for centuries. Although public belief regarding airborne infection kept on altering throughout {{the entire history of}} medicine and is still controversial, many airborne transmission experiments and airborne infection outbreak analyses have been carried out. Different airborne transmission models have been built and various airborne control measures have been evaluated. One of the major knowledge gaps obstructing applications of some airborne control measures in clinical practices and public applications {{is that there is a}} lack of evidence in proving the effectiveness of such measures. Ventilation as an important airborne infection control method can be achieved by opening windows, or increasing the outdoor air supply rate in mechanical ventilation systems or indirectly by using filters and ultraviolet equipments. However the applications of ventilation in infection control were largely restricted to isolation rooms rather than regarded as a public control measure. In this study we focus on evaluating the effectiveness of ventilation as a community measure. Results, therefore, can provide evidence for using ventilation as a public health measure for controlling respiratory diseases transmitted by the airborne route or <b>multi-routes.</b> Two mathematical modeling approaches (deterministic model and social network model) are adopted to estimate different airborne diseases outbreaks with a focus on ventilation and a corresponding analysis of their relative effectiveness compared with other public health measures. A comprehensive understanding of detailed control strategies (including both engineering and public health control) will be achieved through gradually complicated and realistic models. It’s commonly believed that many respiratory infections are transmitted through multiple routes including airborne, droplet-borne and contact routes. Hence the effectiveness of airborne control measures was doubted when the airborne route was not dominant. Therefore, we developed a model to simulate partially airborne transmitted diseases outbreaks and evaluated the relative effectiveness of ventilation when the role of airborne transmission altered. Knowing the complex transmission mechanisms of respiratory transmission and the role of the airborne route in the transmission process is essential in determining the effectiveness of airborne control measures. Hence in this study we also tested the virus exposures dose to infectious patients at different distances when patients were carrying out different respiratory activities. A complex model considering transmission mechanisms of respiratory infections was also built to evaluate the influence of the transmission route in large scale outbreak simulations. The results showed that increasing ventilation rate especially in homes, offices and classrooms is an effective control method for controlling airborne and partially airborne transmitted infections. Combining isolation and increasing ventilation rate can reach similar or even better control effect compared with other general public health interventions such as vaccination. This finding suggested the important role of ventilation in airborne infectious disease prevention and intervention. The ventilation rate required by existing ventilation standards such as ASHRAE 62 might be too low for the purpose of controlling possible airborne outbreaks. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

One hypothesis is known as the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis which refers to the child's ability to infer meaning from cues, using grammatical information from the structure of sentences. Another is the <b>multi-route</b> model in which it is argued that context-bound words and referential words follow different routes; the first being mapped onto event representations and the latter onto mental representations. In this model, parental input has a critical role but the children ultimately rely on cognitive processing to establish subsequent use of words.

40|$|The {{exposure}} of humans to environmental contaminants is usually via {{more than one}} route {{at the same time}} (<b>multi-route</b> exposure). In order to prevent damage to health, environmental policy has to take into account dispersion through the environment and thus <b>multi-route</b> exposure. Additionally, for the evaluation of the risk of actual exposure to substances in the environment, recognition of <b>multi-route</b> exposure is a factor of relevance. For two research projects, "Setting Integrated Environmental Quality Objectives" (IEQO) and "Human Health and the Environment" (H&E) the characterization of <b>multi-route</b> exposure is important. For IEQO a toxicological admissible exposure level has to be allocated to the various environmental compartments (soil, water and air), on the basis of <b>multi-route</b> exposure patterns. However, till now, a methodology for this procedure is not available, because exposure patterns are not available for most chemicals. The programme H&E focuses on determination of cumulative exposures of humans to environment contaminating factors. For this programme insight in the environmental behaviour of contaminants is of interest as well as the routes of direct and indirect {{exposure of}} humans which are connected to this behaviour. Besides that, individual life-style an activity patterns and their influence on a persons exposure are of relevance. The H&E programme requires description of the aforementionted factors at a much higher level of differentiation than the IEQO programme does because H&E it looks into exposure at nation wide, regional and local scales, in relationship with the emitting sources. This report explores the possibilities {{for the development of a}} methodology for <b>multi-route</b> exposure pattern determination. Starting point is the USES computer model, which can perform risk evaluations for new and existing substances and pesticides. Additionally, it may be used for prioritisation purposes. While performing an evaluation USES generates a <b>multi-route</b> exposure pattern. The purpose of the research described in this report, is to determine to what extent the USES approach can be applied within IEQO and H&E. It should also indicate where the USES approach needs supplementation. The report must not be considered as a validation of USES. With USES the exposure patterns of 5 substances have been determined. These substances were highly different in physico-chemical characteristics and in the way they are used. Subsequently, the computed patterns have been compared to data derived from field studies. The USES approach is appropriate to support the derivation of IEQOs. The approach needs to be supplemented with an estimation of exposure via soil contact (e. g. ingestion) and dermal contact with contaminated water.

The New York terminal area is an example of where this happens in the U. S. An important goal, therefore, is to increase the efficiency of operations in congested terminal airspace where possible. Modeling studies of arrival and departure flows have shown that sharing of arrival and departure airspace increases efficiency in terminal operations. One source of inefficiency in terminal operations is that departure aircraft are frequently held level under arrival flows when it would be more efficient to climb the departure aircraft earlier. A Route Crossing Tool was developed to help controllers climb Newark (EWR) departures to the south earlier by temporarily sharing airspace with arrivals coming into LaGuardia (LGA) from the south. Instead of flying under the arrivals, a departure to the south could climb earlier by flying through the arrival airspace if there was a suitable gap between arrivals.

As college recruitment and college entrance examination are combined together; the Ministry of Education {{in cooperation with}} all other universities established the College Entrance Examination Center in 1989. Since 2011, the <b>Multi-Route</b> Promotion Program (MRPP) for college-bound seniors is developed, wherein two main entry ways are used, namely Admission by Recommendation and Screening and Admission by Examination. Admission by Recommendation and Screening includes the “stars program” and “individual application”. For common college entrance examination, subject examinations, such as general scholastic ability test and departmental required test, and practical examinations are included. When handling the examination, examination using information technology and examination for disable individuals are two important aspects for preparation of examination. With regards {{to the number of}} disabled examinees who attend subject ability test, it has been increased from three examinees in 1996 to 237 examinees by 2011. Moreover, the strong impact of the trend of fewer children is also a reason {{for the development of the}} <b>multi-route</b> recruitment, it is recommended that relevant tasks for preparation of examination should be innovated, core information ability should be established, and examination service should be strengthened...|$|E

This method is a <b>multi-route</b> {{improvement}} algorithm that can operate on several routes at a time. To evaluate {{the performance of}} the proposed method, extensive computational experiments on the proposed method applied to a set of benchmark problems are carried out. The results show that the proposed method, when coupled with metaheuristics such as simulated annealing, is comparable with other efficient heuristic methods proposed in the literature.

AMR dynamically routes batches of tuples to operators in the query network based on routing criteria and up-to-date system statistics. In {{the context of}} AMR systems, indexing, a core technology for efficient stream processing, has received little attention. Indexing in AMR systems is demanding as indices must adapt to serve continuously evolving query paths while maintaining index content under high volumes of data. Our proposed Adaptive <b>Multi-Route</b> Index (AMRI) employs a bitmap time-partitioned design that while being versatile in serving a diverse ever changing workload of multiple query access patterns remains lightweight in terms of maintenance and storage requirements. In addition, our AMRI index design and migration strategies seeks to met the indexing needs of both older partially serviced and newer incoming search requests. We show that {{the effect on the}} quality of the index configuration selected based on using AMRIs compressed statistics can be bounded to a preset constant. Our experimental study using both synthetic and real data streams has demonstrated that our AMRI strategy strikes a balance between supporting effective query processing in dynamic stream environments while keeping the index maintenance and tuning costs to a minimum. Using a data set collected by environmental sensors placed in the Intel Berkeley Research lab, our AMRI outperforms the state-of-the-art approach on averag...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a computer model and algorithms for finding the time-dependent minimum path between two stations in a <b>multi-route,</b> multi-mode transit system running to fixed schedules. Selection of the minimum path can be based either on journey time or on weighted time. A worked example using a simple transit network is given to illustrate how the model works. The model has several applications in transport planning: it can be used for generating route schedule information to guide transit users, for assisting in route schedule coordination, and for analyzing transit system accessibility. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
