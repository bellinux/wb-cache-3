5|$|<b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> {{magazine}} additionally commented {{upon the}} key theme of satire over {{conflict between the}} critical success of Star Trek and the decision to cancel the program by the studio executives. The magazine noted that writer Michael O'Donoghue's work for the sketch was among the highest caliber scripts he had written for Saturday Night Live. <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> found it ironic that in the sketch the Enterprise was defeated not by its traditional enemies such as the Klingons, but by a stupid NBC executive {{in charge of the}} network's programming schedule.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 1989, a {{group of}} 39 women went into the Pittston Coal {{headquarters}} and held a 36‑hour sit-down strike. The women stated {{that they would not}} leave until a contract was signed. When questioned by police and media reporters to give up their names, the women responded by saying that they were daughters of <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones.</b> The Daughters gained the attention of the media and completely halted production at Pittston for an entire day and a half. The women involved were not members of the UMWA but wanted to support their cause, and due to this they were linked to the UMWA and considered by some {{to be a part of}} the union.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> {{attempted}} {{to stop the}} miners' 'redneck army' from marching into Mingo County in late August 1921. <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> also visited the governor and departed assured he would intervene. The legendary <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> opposed the armed march, appeared on the line of march {{and told them to}} go home. In her hand she claimed to have a telegram from President Harding offering to work to end the private police in West Virginia if they returned home. When Keeney demanded to see the telegram and <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> refused he denounced her as a ‘fake’. Because she refused to show anyone the telegram she was suspected of having fabricated the story. <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> not only refused to allow anyone to read the document, the President’s secretary denied ever having sent one. After she fled the camp she reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, <b>Jones's</b> <b>mother</b> was {{diagnosed}} with throat cancer, and in 1997, Higgins objected to a medical procedure for his mother-in-law, but was banned from the hospital room after a psychological evaluation on <b>Jones's</b> <b>mother</b> found she was [...] "inappropriately manipulated by family--especially son-in-law." [...] Jones and Higgins wrote up a document about the incident called [...] "Kidnapped/Held Incommunicado," [...] which {{was sent to the}} national press, and on March 3, 1997, was forwarded to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. On March 20, <b>Jones's</b> <b>mother</b> died, igniting Higgins to start a campaign against the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center, which had been the defendant in several civil rights cases in the recent past. During this time, Jones's novel The Healing {{was in the process of}} being released. Higgins began to bombard the Lexington police, calling them and writing them multiple times a day. A letter that arrived to the police station on February 20, 1998, indicated a bomb threat, and police figured out that Higgins, who at the time was using the alias Bob Jones, was previously wanted for arrest. After a standoff with police at their residence, Higgins committed suicide and Jones was put on suicide watch. Since then, Jones only talks to family and Harper and has refused several requests for interviews.|$|R

50|$|Jones's family collaborated to {{complete}} the book after <b>Jones's</b> death. <b>Jones's</b> <b>mother,</b> Virginia Jones, took over first the coloring and then the actual drawing of the illustrations. Dr. Howard Jones wrote the accompanying text, as well as collecting the specimens featured in the illustrations. Jones's father, Dr. Nelson Jones, who had written the original prospectus for the piece, covered most {{of the costs of}} its continued publication.|$|R
25|$|<b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> {{was joined}} by President Keeney and other UMWA {{officials}} who were also pressuring the miners to go home. Although <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> organized for decades {{on behalf of the}} UMWA in West Virginia and even denounced the state as ‘medieval’, the chapter of the same name in her autobiography, she mostly praises Governor Morgan for defending the 1st amendment freedom of the labor weekly The Federationist to publish. His refusal to consent to the mine owners request he ban the paper demonstrated to <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> that he ‘refused to comply with the requests of the dominant money interests. To a man of that type I wish to pay my respects’. Apparently Jones didn’t know or overlooked that Morgan had received about $1 million in campaign donations from industrialists in the 1920 election.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, Aquino {{was cast}} as the witch Donna in the second series of Being Human. Later that year, Aquino was cast in the ABC Television pilot Divorce: A Love Story. However, the role was recast when the {{producers}} decided that she looked too young to play Jason <b>Jones's</b> <b>mother.</b> The actor was sixteen years younger than her. Aquino played college President Dalley in The Lazarus Effect, also starring Sarah Bolger, Mark Duplass and Olivia Wilde.|$|R
25|$|Jones {{was born}} in Augusta, Georgia, the {{daughter}} of Ella Mae Price Jones and Charlie Jones, living in adjacent North Augusta, South Carolina.

50|$|Jones {{was born}} in Baltimore to Howard Wilbur Jones, Sr. and Edith Ruth Marling Jones on December 30, 1910. Even though {{he lived in the}} city, Jones was educated for a few years in a rural public school to avoid the city public school system. When Jones was a child, he went on house calls and {{hospital}} visits with his father, who was a physician. Jones's father died when he was 13 years old. <b>Jones's</b> <b>mother</b> moved him to a private school {{after the death of his}} father.|$|R
50|$|Marion Jones {{was born}} to African-American George Jones and his Belizean wife, Marion, in Los Angeles, California. She holds dual {{citizenship}} with the United States and Belize. Her parents split when she was very young, and <b>Jones's</b> <b>mother</b> remarried a retired postal worker, Ira Toler, three years later. Toler became a stay-at-home dad to Jones and her older half-brother, Albert Kelly, until his sudden death in 1987. Jones turned to sports as an outlet for her grief; running, pickup basketball games, and anything else her brother Albert was doing athletically. By the age of 15 she was routinely dominating California high school athletics both on the track and the basketball court.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Clive used {{to leave}} home every day shortly after noon, when he was {{supposed}} to betake himself to Gandish's studio. But was the young gentleman always at the drawing-board copying from the antique when his father supposed him to be so devotedly engaged? I fear his place was sometimes vacant. His friend J. J. worked every day and all day. Many a time the steady little student remarked his patron's absence, and no doubt gently remonstrated with him, but when Clive did come to his work he executed it with remarkable skill and rapidity; and Ridley was too fond of him to say a word at home regarding the shortcomings of the youthful scapegrace. Candid readers may sometimes have heard their friend <b>Jones's</b> <b>mother</b> lament that her darling was working too hard at college: or Harry's sisters express their anxiety lest his too rigorous attendance in chambers (after which he will persist in sitting up all night reading those dreary law books which cost such an immense sum of money) should undermine dear Henry's health; and to such acute persons a word is sufficient to indicate young Mr. Clive Newcome's proceedings. Meanwhile his father, who knew no more of the world than Harry's simple sisters or <b>Jones's</b> fond <b>mother,</b> never doubted that all Clive's doings were right, and that his boy was the best of boys.|$|R
25|$|However, Wolf's {{more recent}} work has {{inspired}} controversy {{across the political}} spectrum. Writers in such varied venues as Salon.com, Alternet, <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones,</b> The Atlantic, National Review and The American Spectator have criticized many of her latest journalistic efforts as both conspiratorial and overblown.|$|E
25|$|Candy Jones {{was born}} to a well-off family. Jones {{reported}} vivid, conscious memories of physical abuse by her parents, {{and that she had}} vague memories of sexual abuse in her youth. She was shuttled between relatives, and her <b>mother,</b> <b>Jones</b> insisted, often kept her cloistered or locked in dark rooms. As a child, Jones said she had an imaginary friend named Arlene to help through her lonely episodes.|$|E
25|$|Obama also {{planned to}} push for a program to spend $150 billion over 10 years to develop new {{renewable}} energy sources. This money would also be used to encourage energy conservation and help the auto industry develop fuel-efficient vehicles. However, <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> reported that the Windfall Profits Tax on oil companies, which he frequently cited during the campaign, had been dropped from the agenda early in the transition.|$|E
25|$|After a seven-month investigation, <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> {{published}} an expose {{of the show}} which includes testimony and supporting evidence that the crew obtained an opossum from a wildlife rescue in order to fake a supposed wildlife infestation at a fraternity house in Lexington, and that an infant raccoon died from an apparent lack of appropriate food and medical care after being {{in the possession of}} Ernie Brown for several days amongst numerous other actions alleged against Brown and crew.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept for}} Serial {{originated}} with {{an experiment in}} Koenig's basement. Koenig and Snyder had pitched a different idea at a staff meeting for a weekly program on events during the previous seven days, which staff members received without enthusiasm. When Ira Glass asked Koenig {{if she had any}} other ideas, she mentioned podcasting a story that unfolded over time, a serialized narrative. In an interview with <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones,</b> she explained that each episode would return to the same story, telling the next chapter of a long, true narrative.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1997, he {{was invited}} to speak at a Leadership Network pastors' conference in California. The speech he made {{inspired}} many within the nascent emerging church movement and, according to Driscoll, shifted the movement's focus from reaching Generation X to reaching the postmodern world. As a result, Mars Hill Church and Driscoll were thrust into the national spotlight: he was interviewed on National Public Radio and <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> magazine published a feature on the church. Mars Hill Church grew from 160 members in 1996 to 350 in 1999.|$|E
25|$|By 1924, Jones was {{in court}} again, this time facing charges of libel, slander, and sedition. In 1925, Charles A. Albert, {{publisher}} of the fledgling Chicago Times, won a $350,000 judgment against Jones. Jones remained a union organizer for the UMW into the 1920s and continued to speak on union affairs almost until she died. She released her own account of her experiences in the labor movement as The Autobiography of <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> (1925). During her later years, Jones lived with her friends Walter and Lillie May Burgess on their farm {{in what is now}} Adelphi, Maryland. She celebrated her self-proclaimed 100th birthday there on 1 May 1930 and was filmed making a statement for a newsreel.|$|E
25|$|Friends, relatives, {{places of}} worship, and other {{organizations}} helped spread Merritt's idea throughout the United States and around the world. Local newsletters and arts and crafts magazines such as Fibre Art, Handwoven, and Quilter's Newsletter Magazine helped publicize the project. Stories {{leading up to the}} Pentagon event appeared in over 2,500 publications, including local newspapers and national publications such as McCall's (Gittelson 1985), <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> (Robinson 1985), People (Grogan and Chandler 1985), and Vogue magazine (L. Davis 1985). Coverage appeared in Time magazine (Pierce 1985) and {{on the front page of}} the Washington Post (Saperstein 1985, Kastor 1985, McGrory 1985) after the event. The Ribbon was covered by major radio and television networks. Merritt appeared on Good Morning America in June and August (before the event) and again in November 1985.|$|E
25|$|Wheeling {{also had}} {{considerable}} associations with the American labor movement. In 1904 {{it became the}} first {{city in the country}} to refuse a proposed Andrew Carnegie gift of a free library, because of the industrialist's labor record, especially the notorious Homestead Strike of 1892. By contrast, cigar tycoon Augustus Pollack (despite once rousing controversy by a plan to use convict labor) left many bequests to the labor movement, which erected a memorial statue. The city's earliest union was the United Nailers (1860, which later merged into the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers), followed by the cigar makers in 1862. The 1877 railroad strike at Martinsburg, West Virginia reached Wheeling and became nationwide. In 1897, Eugene Debs, <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> and Samuel Gompers were among the speakers at a national labor convention in Wheeling to discuss a nationwide coal strike.|$|E
25|$|Galaxy 1 carried HBO on {{transponder}} 23 {{at a rate}} of 125 watts, with relay signals {{sent out}} at 6,385 MHz. <b>Mother</b> <b>Jones</b> magazine determined that MacDougall could have potentially taken over the signals of three additional satellites. He could have taken over the network feed of CBS had he positioned his satellite dish at the Telstar 301 satellite, operated by AT, tuned at 6,065MHz. He also could have taken over the foreign language feed of the Voice of America network by aiming his satellite dish at 72 degrees west longitude. The final theorized hijacking would have been aiming his satellite dish at 100 degrees west longitude, above the Galápagos Islands, with a frequency setting of 293.375MHz, thereby jamming the signal of United States Navy satellite Fleetsatcom 1. The magazine also posited that an amateur hobbyist could hijack the satellites that alerted American military forces to Soviet actions, creating confusion for world leaders and placing the world at risk of nuclear destruction.|$|E
