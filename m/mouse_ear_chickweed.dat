Heynh., <b>mouse</b> <b>ear</b> cress, and Cardamine oligosperma Nutt, bitter cress, are studied {{in order to}} assess the conditions used in weightlessness experiments. Among other results, it is found that the growth (height) and flowering (date of bud appearance) were suppressed in <b>mouse</b> <b>ear</b> cress in tubes sealed with Saran. Seed pod formation which occurred by day 45 in open-to-air controls, was still lacking in the sealed plants even up to day 124. The growth and flowering of bitter cress were also suppressed by the Saran seal, although up to day 55 the Saran-sealed plants were taller. It is suggested that atmospheric composition was the cause of the suppression of growth, flowering, and seed pod development in these plants, since the <b>mouse</b> <b>ear</b> cress renewed their growth and then set seed pods after the Saran seal was ruptured...|$|R

40|$|In many {{capillary}} exchange beds, {{blood flow}} is locally regulated by precapillary sphincter-like activity. In this study, we used intravascular tracers and {{scanning electron microscopy}} to investigate precapillary blood flow regulation in the <b>mouse</b> <b>ear.</b> Gelatin ink injections of the normal <b>mouse</b> <b>ear</b> demonstrated 6. 8 ± 2. 3 axial vessels with a cutoff of detectable tracer in the early branches: 19 ± 11 focal constrictions were observed along the 1 st to 5 th order branches of the axial vessels. A perfusion tracer consisting of biotinylated anti-endothelial lectins (Ricinus Communis Agglutin, Lycopersicon Esculentum and Griffonia Simplicifolia) was circulated for 30 min under physiological conditions. Subsequent enzyme histochemistry demonstrated no significant change in distal perfusion or {{in the number of}} focal constrictions (P > 0. 05). Furthermore, the focal constrictions were unresponsive to vasodilators such as organic nitrates and prostaglandin E 1. By contrast, the presence of oxazolone-induced inflammation resulted in significant and sustained vasodilatation for more than 96 h (P > 0. 001). Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated discrete constricting bands morphologically distinct from known precapillary sphincters. These results suggest that these previously unappreciated inflammation-responsive precapillary constrictors regulate capillary recruitment in the <b>mouse</b> <b>ear</b> microcirculation...|$|R

40|$|Adenoviruses offer great {{potential}} as gene therapy agents but {{are limited by}} the strong inflammatory response that occurs {{in response to the}} recombinant virus. Since the degree of inflammation correlates in part with the potential of the viral vector for replication, we constructed a preterminal protein (pTP) deletion mutant adenovirus type 5 vector, Ad 5 dl 308 ΔpTPβ-gal, that is replication incompetent due to deletion of the pTP gene and that has the E 1 genes replaced by the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene {{under the control of the}} cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter. This virus was compared with a first-generation, replication-defective adenovirus vector, Ad 5 dl 308 β-gal, that is isogenic except that it contains a wild-type pTP gene. To examine transduction efficiency and induction of inflammation, we developed a novel system involving intradermal injection of BALB/c <b>mouse</b> <b>ears.</b> <b>Mouse</b> <b>ears</b> can be accurately measured to determine the degree of edema as an indirect measurement of inflammation. Edema and inflammation were induced in a dose- and time-dependent manner by both viruses and correlated well. LacZ activity correlated inversely with edema and inflammation. The pTP-defective vector Ad 5 dl 308 ΔpTPβ-gal transduced <b>mouse</b> <b>ears</b> much more efficiently and induced edema and inflammatory cell infiltration approximately 10 -fold less efficiently than the first-generation vector Ad 5 dl 308 β-gal. The diminished inflammatory response and increased efficiency of transduction observed with Ad 5 dl 308 ΔpTPβ-gal indicate its promise as a gene therapy agent for other tissues. The results also demonstrate that the <b>mouse</b> <b>ear</b> model offers potential for the study of adenovirus-induced inflammation because of the ready access of the ears, the relative ease of continuous measurement, and the sensitivity to adenovirus transducing vectors...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of red seaweed Dichotomaria obtusata, using classic tests in <b>mice</b> (<b>ear</b> edema induced by TPA and writhing induced by acetic acid). The qualitative chemical composition of the aqueous extract (lactones, phenols, triterpenes, steroids and reduced carbohydrates) obtained from this alga was also determined. The results showed that Dichotomaria obtusata (12. 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg, ip) inhibited <b>mouse</b> <b>ear</b> edema in a dose-dependent manner. In the writhing test, aqueous extract (12. 5, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, ip and 100, 200, 400, 800 mg/kg, po) significantly reduced abdominal writhes.

Local application of triacontanol {{has been shown}} anti-inflammatory effects on chemically-induced dermatitis and oral treatment with D- 002 produced anti-inflammatory effects in carrageenan-induced pleurisy and cotton granuloma in rats, but its effects on xylene-induced <b>mouse</b> <b>ear</b> edema had not been studied. This study investigated the effects of single oral and topical doses of D- 002 on this model. Oral dosing groups were composed by one negative control and six xylene-treated, one positive control, four D- 002 -treated (25, 50, 200, 400 mg/kg), and one indomethacin-treated (10 mg/kg). Topical dosing groups were conformed by one negative control and four xylene- treated, one positive control and three D- 002 -treated (2. 5, 5, 10 %). Single oral doses of D- 002 significantly and dose-dependently reduced edema formation and myeloperoxidase activity, but single topical applications unchanged both variables.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the involvement of}} protease-activated receptor- 2 (PAR- 2) in allergic dermatitis, we generated PAR- 2 -deficient (PAR- 2 −/−) <b>mice.</b> <b>Ear</b> thickness, contact hypersensitivity (CH) induced by topical application of picryl chloride (PC) or oxazolone (Ox) after sensitization, and vascular permeability after ear passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) were compared between wild-type (WT) and PAR- 2 −/− <b>mice.</b> <b>Ear</b> thickness was almost the same in untreated WT and PAR- 2 −/− mice. Topical application of PC or Ox thickened the ears at 6, 24 and 48 h after challenge with a peak at 24 h in WT mice.

Histopathological observation of the ears at 24 h after challenge revealed that PC- or Ox-induced ear edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells in WT mice were greatly attenuated in PAR- 2 −/− mice. The vascular permeability in the ears after PCA was not different between WT and PAR- 2 −/− mice.

40|$|The {{replacement}} {{and restoration}} of tissue mass after organ damage or injury in adult higher vertebrates {{is critical to}} the architecture and function of the organ. If replacement occurs with scar tissue, this often results in adverse effects on function and growth as well as an undesirable cosmetic appearance. However, certain mammals, such as the MRL/MpJ mouse, have shown a restricted capacity for regeneration, rather than scar tissue formation, after an excisional ear punch wound. To investigate the changes in tissue architecture leading to ear wound closure, initial ear wounding studies with a 2 -mm clinical biopsy punch were performed on MRL/MpJ mice, by using C 57 BL/ 6 mice as a nonregenerative control strain. In contrast to previously reported studies on <b>mouse</b> <b>ear</b> regeneration, we observed that C 57 BL/ 6 mice in fact showed a limited regenerative capacity. One explanation for this difference could be attributed to the method of wounding used; both previous studies on <b>mouse</b> <b>ear</b> regeneration used a thumb punch, whereas our approach was to use a clinical biopsy punch. This approach led us to further investigate whether the severity of trauma applied influenced the rate of wound healing. We, therefore, compared the effects of the sharp clinical biopsy punch with that of a cruder thumb punch, and introduced a third strain of mouse, Balb/c, known to be a slow-healing strain. A new method to quantify ear punch hole closure was developed and a histologic investigation conducted up to 4 months after wounding. Image analysis data showed a reduction in original ear wound area of 85 % in MRL/MpJ mice at 4 weeks and of 91. 7 % over 4 months by using a biopsy punch. In contrast, the crude thumb punch methodology resulted in an increase in wound area of up to 58 % in Balb/c ears; thought to be due to increased necrosis of the wound site. All biopsy-punched wound areas plateaued in healing between days 28 and 112. Only 5 of 80 MRL/MpJ <b>mouse</b> <b>ears</b> showed no residual holes macroscopically after 28 days. Histologically, all strains of <b>mice</b> healed their <b>ear</b> wounds in a similar manner involving re-epithelialization, blastema-like formation, dermal extension, blood vessel formation, chondrogenesis, folliculogenesis, and skeletal muscle and fat differentiation. However, all regenerative features were more pronounced and accelerated in MRL/MpJ mice when compared with C 57 BL/ 6 and Balb/c biopsy-punched <b>mouse</b> <b>ears...</b>|$|R
