25|$|Acoustic violins may be {{used with}} an add-on {{piezoelectric}} bridge or body pickup, or a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> attached to the fingerboard end. Alternatively, an electrodynamic pickup can be installed under an acoustic violin's fingerboard avoiding interference with any tone-producing parts of the violin, and therefore keeping its acoustic resonances and tone intact.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{application}} is {{the control of}} the throttle of an internal combustion engine in conjunction with an electronic governor. In this usage, the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> and, depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor, causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle.|$|E
2500|$|Over time, fidelity, {{dynamic and}} noise levels {{improved}} {{to the point}} that it was harder to tell the difference between a live performance in the studio and the recorded version. This was especially true after the invention of the variable reluctance <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> cartridge by General Electric in the 1940s when high quality cuts were played on well-designed audio systems. The Capehart radio/phonographs of the era with large diameter electrodynamic loudspeakers, though not ideal, demonstrated this quite well with [...] "home recordings" [...] readily available in the music stores for the public to buy.|$|E
50|$|Most {{versions}} of the Parker Fly feature a set of two <b>magnetic</b> Humbucker style <b>pickups</b> and a Fishman developed piezoelectric pickup designed to emulate acoustic guitar sounds. The piezoelectric pickup is aided by an onboard active pre-amplifier requiring {{the use of a}} 9 volt battery. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups</b> are passive, but sit within the active circuit path. Fly guitars feature a stereo output jack, allowing the piezo and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups</b> to be sent to different amplifiers, or blended into a mono signal. Some Fly models have only <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups,</b> for traditional electric guitar sounds, while some models have only piezo pickups, for use as solid-body acoustic-electric guitars.|$|R
50|$|Reluctance {{can also}} be applied to {{variable}} reluctance (<b>magnetic)</b> <b>pickups.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>pickups.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>pickups,</b> {{as applied}} in {{electric}} guitars, register the vibrations of nickel or steel strings in a magnetic field. They {{have the advantage}} {{that they can be}} connected directly to an (electric guitar) amplifier, but in combination with a steel-string acoustic guitar the sound tends to be electric. This is why acoustic guitarists typically choose a piezoelectric pickup, built in microphone, or both.|$|R
2500|$|In 1926 Joseph P. Maxwell and Henry C. Harrison from Bell Telephone Laboratories {{disclosed}} that the recording {{pattern of the}} Western Electric [...] "rubber line" [...] magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic. This meant that as frequency increased in the treble, recording amplitude decreased. Conversely, in the bass as frequency decreased, recording amplitude increased. Therefore, {{it was necessary to}} attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250Hz, the bass turnover point, in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head. Otherwise, bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place into the next record groove. When played back electrically with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> having a smooth response in the bass region, a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary. G. H. Miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records, the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form.|$|E
5000|$|Until the 1960s, no pickups were {{available}} to amplify the autoharp other than rudimentary contact microphones, which frequently had a poor-quality, tinny sound. In the early 1960s, a bar <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> was designed for the instrument by Harry DeArmond, and manufactured by Rowe Industries. Pinkerton's Assorted Colours used the instrument on their 1966 single [...] "Mirror, mirror". In the 1970s, Oscar Schmidt came out with their own <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, jazz {{electric}} guitarists use an archtop with {{a relatively}} broad hollow sound-box, violin-style f-holes, a [...] "floating bridge", and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup.</b> Solid body guitars, mass-produced since the early 1950s, are also used.|$|E

50|$|However, all {{acoustic}} and semi-acoustic {{styles are}} very sensitive to audio feedback, making the design and placement of these pickups extremely critical and specialized. Some modern models are manufactured with both piezoelectric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups.</b> In addition, some piezoelectric styles are active pickups, in that they incorporate a preamplifier that increases the output of the pickup to match modern amplifier inputs. More recently, solid body electric resonator guitars have appeared. These instruments incorporate one or more <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups,</b> and are played via amplification.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups</b> are P-90 single-coil pickups, {{which are}} used on some Gibson guitars such as the Les Paul Jr. but are rarely used on Fender guitars.|$|R

5000|$|At {{least one}} company, Audiovox, built {{and may have}} offered an {{electric}} solid-body as early as 1932. Audiovox electric guitars were built by Paul Tutmarc who is also credited as the co-inventor of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> along with Art Stimpson, and the fretted electric bass guitar. Bob Wisner worked for Paul converting tube radio amplifiers into guitar amplifiers and eventually developing his own amplifier circuits so Paul's instruments could be sold along with their own amplifiers. Paul was unsuccessful at obtaining a patent for his <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> as it was too similar to the telephone microphone coil sensor device. Audiovox production was handed over to Paul's son, Bud Tutmarc, who continued building these instruments under the brand, [...] "Bud-Electro" [...] until the early 1950s. Bud Tutmarc had been delegated by the senior Tutmarc the task of winding the pickup coils used on his father's and he continued producing them for his own guitars. He used horseshoe magnets in a single-coil and later a hum cancelling dual coil configuration. Bob Wisner was hired by Rickenbacher, later spelled Rickenbacker and may have passed on Tutmarc's <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> technology and helped them develop the more familiar bar magnet and pole-piece pickup construction still widely used today for their cast aluminum electric guitar, nicknamed The Frying Pan or The Pancake Guitar, beginning in 1933.|$|E

50|$|Some {{acoustic}} players use strings, wound with nickel-plated-steel, {{meant for}} electric guitar. The {{properties of the}} nickel-plated strings make it {{a good choice for}} flattop guitars with sound hole-mounted <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>pickups</b> on {{acoustic}} guitars {{are generally}} {{mounted in the}} sound hole, and {{are similar to those}} in electric guitars. An acoustic guitar with pickups for electrical amplification is called an acoustic-electric guitar.|$|R

5000|$|HEI is characterised by the {{incorporation}} of the ignition coil built into the distributor cap for most applications. The system consists of a control module and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> mounted in the distributor. This eliminates ignition points and the coil wire. The control module basically performs the same function as the breaker points in a points and condenser system.|$|E
50|$|A hybrid guitar {{is also an}} {{electric}} guitar {{with the ability to}} produce a signal with the tonal quality of an acoustic guitar in addition to a typical electric signal from a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup,</b> allowing a wide tonal pallette for performers with a varied repertoire. Hybrid guitars typicallyuse a piezoelectric pickup to generate the acoustic-like signal, this is the same type of pickup used in most electro-acoustic guitars.|$|E
5000|$|The clavichord {{has also}} gained {{attention}} in other genres of music, {{in the form}} of the Clavinet, which is essentially an electric clavichord that uses a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> to produce a signal for amplification. Stevie Wonder uses a Clavinet in many of his songs, such as [...] "Superstition" [...] and [...] "Higher Ground". A Clavinet played through an instrument amplifier with guitar effect pedals is often associated with funky, disco-infused 1970s rock.|$|E
25|$|The {{electric}} pipa {{was first}} {{developed in the}} late 20th century by adding electric guitar–style <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups</b> to a regular acoustic pipa, allowing the instrument to be amplified through an instrument amplifier or PA system.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{electric}} bass guitars use <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups.</b> The vibrations of the instrument's {{ferrous metal}} strings within {{the magnetic field}} of the permanent magnets in <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups</b> produce small variations in the magnetic flux threading the coils of the pickups. This in turn produces small electrical voltages in the coils. Many bass players connect the signal from the bass guitar's pickups to a bass amplifier and loudspeaker using a 1/4" [...] patch cord. These low-level signals are then strengthened by the bass amp's preamplifier electronic circuits, and then amplified with the bass amp's power amplifier and played through one or more speaker(s) in a cabinet.|$|R
50|$|Semi-Hollow {{construction}} {{based on}} the design of the Starplayer III. A special resonating bridge construction allows to create Dobro/Resonator sounds while being able to blend it with standard <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups.</b> The Rezobro also features an adjustable nut for slide/bottleneck use.|$|R
5000|$|In 1950 and 1951, {{electronics}} and instrument amplifier maker Leo Fender through his company, designed the first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar {{with a single}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup,</b> which was initially named the [...] "Esquire". The two-pickup version of the Esquire was called the [...] "Broadcaster". The bolt-on neck was consistent with Leo Fender's belief that the instrument design should be modular to allow cost-effective and consistent manufacture and assembly, as well as simple repair or replacement.|$|E
50|$|For example, in {{the case}} of an orifice flow meter, the {{differential}} pressure across the orifice plate is the primary flow element. A turbine meter is equipped with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup</b> that senses the proximity of the turbine blades as the fluid motion causes the turbine to spin; this pickup is the primary flow element for a turbine meter. Diaphragm meters and other positive displacement meters are equipped with a crank shaft, the rotation of which acts as the primary flow element.|$|E
50|$|Electronic: a {{servo motor}} {{is linked to}} the {{throttle}} and controlled by an electronic module that senses engine speed by counting electrical pulses emitted by the ignition system or a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickup.</b> The frequency of these pulses varies directly with engine speed, allowing the control module to apply a proportional voltage to the servo to regulate engine speed. Due to their sensitivity and rapid response to speed changes, electronic governors are often fitted to engine-driven generators designed to power computer hardware, as the generator's output frequency must be held within narrow limits to avoid malfunction.|$|E
50|$|Some {{electric}} guitar models feature piezoelectric pickups, which function as transducers {{to provide a}} sound closer to that of an acoustic guitar with the flip of a switch or knob, rather than switching guitars. Those that combine piezoelectric <b>pickups</b> and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups</b> are sometimes known as hybrid guitars.|$|R
5000|$|Shown at {{the right}} is a 1930 refinished Oscar Schmidt Inc. Model [...] "A". This harp has two DeArmond <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups</b> (one under the chord bars), with a d'Aigle {{fine-tuning}} mechanism, and d'Aigle chord bar assembly, and was used in a 1968 MGM Records/Heritage Records recording by Euphoria.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of pickups used for {{acoustic}} guitar amplification are piezo and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pickups.</b> Piezo pickups are generally mounted under the bridge saddle of the acoustic guitar and can be plugged into a mixer or amplifier. A Piezo pickup made by Baldwin was incorporated in the body of Ovation guitars, rather than attached by drilling through the body; the combination of the Piezo pickup and parabolic ("roundback") body helped Ovation succeed in the market during the 1970s.|$|R
