5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with <b>microwave</b> <b>technology</b> and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E

2500|$|In the Soviet Union, the Moskva (or Moscow) {{system of}} {{broadcasting}} and delivering of TV signals via satellites {{was launched in}} 1979. Stationary and mobile downlink stations with parabolic antennas [...] in diameter were receiving signal from Gorizont communication satellites deployed to geostationary orbits. The {{first in a series}} of Soviet geostationary satellites to carry Direct-To-Home television, Ekran 1, was launched on October 26, 1976. It used a 714MHz UHF downlink frequency so that the transmissions could be received with existing UHF television technology rather than <b>microwave</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to encryption, the widespread availability, in the US, of DBS {{services such as}} PrimeStar and DirecTV had been reducing the popularity of TVRO systems since the early 1990s. [...] Signals from DBS satellites (operating in the more recent Ku band) are higher in both frequency and power (due to improvements in the solar panels and energy efficiency of modern satellites) and therefore require much smaller dishes than C-band, and the digital modulation methods now used require less signal strength at the receiver than analog modulation methods. Each satellite also can carry up to 32 transponders in the Ku band, but only 24 in the C band, and several digital subchannels can be multiplexed (MCPC) or carried separately (SCPC) on a single transponder. Advances in noise reduction due to improved <b>microwave</b> <b>technology</b> and semiconductor materials have also had an effect. However, one consequence of the higher frequencies used for DBS services is rain fade where viewers lose signal during a heavy downpour. C-band satellite television signals are less prone to rain fade.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1940s {{improvements}} in <b>microwave</b> <b>technology</b> {{made it possible}} to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a hydrogen atom, now known as the Lamb shift, and measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron. Discrepancies between these experiments and Dirac's theory led to the idea of incorporating renormalisation into QED to deal with zero-point infinities. Renormalization was originally developed by Hans Kramers and also Victor Weisskopf(1936), and first successfully applied to calculate a finite value for the Lamb shift by Hans Bethe (1947). As per spontaneous emission, these effects can in part be understood with interactions with the zero-point field. But in light of renormalisation being able to remove some zero-point infinities from calculations, not all physicists were comfortable attributing zero-point energy any physical meaning, viewing it instead as a mathematical artifact that might one day be fully eliminated. In Wolfgang Pauli's 1945 Nobel lecture he made clear his opposition to the idea of zero-point energy stating [...] "It is clear that this zero-point energy has no physical reality".|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} of <b>microwave</b> <b>technology</b> during World War 2, {{such as the}} klystron and magnetron tubes and parabolic antennas [...] made radiative (far-field) methods practical for the first time, and the first long-distance wireless power transmission was achieved in the 1960s by William C. Brown. [...] In 1964 Brown invented the rectenna which could efficiently convert microwaves to DC power, and in 1964 demonstrated it with the first wireless-powered aircraft, a model helicopter powered by microwaves beamed from the ground. [...] A major motivation for microwave research in the 1970s and 80s {{was to develop a}} solar power satellite. [...] Conceived in 1968 by Peter Glaser, this would harvest energy from sunlight using solar cells and beam it down to Earth as microwaves to huge rectennas, which would convert it to electrical energy on the electric power grid. In landmark 1975 experiments as technical director of a JPL/Raytheon program, Brown demonstrated long-range transmission by beaming 475 W of microwave power to a rectenna a mile away, with a microwave to DC conversion efficiency of 54%. At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory he and Robert Dickinson transmitted 30kW DC output power across 1.5km with 2.38GHz microwaves from a 26 m dish to a 7.3 x 3.5 m rectenna array. The incident-RF to DC conversion efficiency of the rectenna was 80%. In 1983 Japan launched MINIX (Microwave Ionosphere Nonlinear Interaction Experiment), [...] a rocket experiment to test transmission of high power microwaves through the ionosphere.|$|E
2500|$|Other wartime physics research, {{particularly}} in rocketry and radar technology, was less significant {{in popular culture}} but much more significant for {{the outcome of the}} war. [...] German rocketry was driven by the pursuit of Wunderwaffen, resulting in the V-2 ballistic missile; the technology as well as the personal expertise of the German rocketry community was absorbed by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. rocket programs after the war, forming the basis of long-term military funded rocketry, ballistic missile, and later space research. [...] Rocket science was only beginning to make impact by the final years of the war. [...] German rockets created fear and destruction in London, but had only modest military significance, while air-to-ground rockets enhanced the power of American air strikes; jet aircraft also went into service {{by the end of the}} war. [...] Radar work before and during the war provided even more of an advantage for the Allies. [...] British physicists pioneered long-wave radar, developing an effective system for detecting incoming German air forces. [...] Work on potentially more precise short-wave radar was turned over to the U.S.; several thousand academic physicists and engineers not participating the Manhattan Project did radar work, particularly at MIT and Stanford, resulting in microwave radar systems that could resolve more detail in incoming flight formations. [...] Further refinement of <b>microwave</b> <b>technology</b> led to proximity fuzes, which greatly enhanced the ability of the U.S. Navy to defend against Japanese bombers. [...] Microwave production, detection and manipulation also formed the technical foundation to complement the institutional foundation of the Manhattan Project in much post-war defense research.|$|E
