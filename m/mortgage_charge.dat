60|$|The {{operation}} of this law, however certain, {{might be too}} slow. The present possessors might happen to be long-lived. The legislature knew the natural impatience of expectants, and upon this principle they gave encouragement to children to anticipate the inheritance. For it is provided, that the eldest son of any Papist shall, immediately on his conformity, change entirely the nature and properties of his father's legal estate: if he before held in fee simple, or, in other words, had the entire and absolute dominion over the land, he is reduced to an estate for his life only, with all {{the consequences of the}} natural debility of that estate, by which he becomes disqualified to sell, <b>mortgage,</b> <b>charge,</b> (except for his life,) or in any wise to do any act by which he may raise money for relief in his most urgent necessities. The eldest son, so conforming, immediately acquires, and in the lifetime of his father, the permanent part, what our law calls the reversion and inheritance of the estate; and he discharges it by retrospect, and annuls every sort of voluntary settlement made by the father ever so long before his conversion. This he may sell or dispose of immediately, and alienate it from the family forever.|$|E

Using proprietary data of major building societies in Australia for 36 months, this paper examines the changes of mortgage yield spreads in the pre-and post-GST periods for building societies.

40|$|Australia {{has seen}} {{significant}} rises in mortgage costs and sharp declines in housing affordability {{in the past}} decade or so, which corresponds with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2000. To what extent the GST has impacted mortgage costs is the research question. This study investigates the GST impact on the mortgage costs of Australian mortgage corporations. Using data of mortgage corporations operating in Australia, we perform t-tests and multivariate regression analysis to examine the GST effects on mortgage yield spreads. The empirical results clearly indicate that mortgage corporations increased their <b>mortgage</b> <b>charges</b> in the post-GST periods significantly beyond the magnitude of the GST. Furthermore, the lenders started to increase the yield spreads before and continued to increase the spreads after the implementation of the GST, indicating the rise in mortgage costs was not a one-off surge. The findings offer insights into mortgage costs and have significant policy implications and wider economic relevance...|$|R
50|$|Racial {{and ethnic}} {{residential}} segregation in the United States still persists, with African Americans experiencing {{the highest degree}} of residential segregation, followed by Latino Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. This isolation from White American communities is highly correlated with low property values and high-poverty neighborhoods. This issue is propagated by issues of home ownership facing minorities, especially African Americans and Latino Americans, since residential areas predominantly populated by these minority groups are perceived as less attractive {{in the housing market}}. Home ownership by minority groups is further undermined by institutionalized discriminatory practices, such as differential treatment of African Americans and Latino Americans in the housing market compared with White Americans. Higher <b>mortgages</b> <b>charged</b> to African American or Latino American buyers {{make it more difficult for}} members of these minority groups to attain full home ownership and accumulate wealth. As a result, African American and Latino American groups continue to live in racially segregated neighborhoods and face the socioeconomic consequences of residential segregation.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} two years the {{teaching}} of Personal Property Law has undergone a major transformation. At this point in time, {{after the end of the}} transitional 2 year period of the Personal Property Securities Act (PPSA) it is clear that the traditional common law principles now need to be examined in the context of a statute based approach. The PPSA has made significant inroads into the way personal property is dealt with in commercial transactions. Not only has the PPSA impacted on various types of security agreements such as <b>mortgages,</b> <b>charges,</b> and pledges, but it also reaches into areas such as leases, liens and bailments. Probably the most important effect the PPSA has had on the way property ownership is perceived, is the way it has disenfranchised the concept of nemo dat quod non habet. The dilemma for educators is to make sense of these ground breaking developments in a way students can understand. The challenge is to do so in a way that familiarises students with the traditional common law concepts, while teaching them the ground rules and intricacies of the PPSA as they apply to personal property...|$|R

40|$|I {{propose a}} {{life-cycle}} model where a finitely lived risk averse agent finances her housing investment choosing {{to provide a}} down payment. After signing the mortgage contract, the agent may strategically default and move into the rental market. Risk neutral lenders efficiently price <b>mortgages</b> <b>charging</b> a default premium to compensate themselves for expected losses due to default on a mortgage. As a result, mortgage value and amount of leverage are closely linked. An alternative is for the agent to rent the same house, paying a rent fully adjustable to house prices. The rent risk premium is set such that the agent is indifferent ex ante between owning with a mortgage and renting. Three main results arise. First, the optimal down payment and the house price volatility are positively related. The higher the house price volatility, the higher the down payment the agent provides to decrease the volatility of the equity share in the house. Second, {{in the presence of}} borrowing constraints, a higher risk of unemployment persistence and/or a substantial drop in labor income decreases the leveraged position the agent takes. Third, ruling out the effect of taking costly leverage on owning a house significantly biases the results in favor of owning over renting...|$|R
