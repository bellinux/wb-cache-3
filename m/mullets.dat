5|$|Kalmar (1100) has {{the oldest}} known city arms in Sweden, {{depicting}} a fortified tower (borgtorn) and dating to 1247. The two stars were added {{by the end}} of the 13th century, and the arms have remained virtually unchanged to date. Blazon: Argent, a tower embattled gules, with door and windows Or, issuing from a wavy base azure, between two <b>mullets</b> of six points gules.|$|E
5|$|Sigtuna (990), one of {{the oldest}} cities in Sweden, is known for its Viking Age history and rune stones. In medieval times, coins were minted at Sigtuna, and legend {{suggests}} it was the royal seat for a time, signified by the crown on its arms. The crown appeared in the city seal in 1311, and carried through to the municipal arms granted in 1971. Blazon: Azure, a crown Or between three <b>mullets</b> argent.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including <b>mullets,</b> porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flathead}} grey <b>mullet</b> (Mugil cephalus) is {{an important}} food fish species in the <b>mullet</b> family Mugilidae. It is found in coastal tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. [...] Its length is typically 30 to 75 cm. It is known with numerous English names, including the flathead <b>mullet,</b> striped <b>mullet</b> (US, American Fisheries Society name), black <b>mullet,</b> bully <b>mullet,</b> common <b>mullet,</b> grey <b>mullet,</b> sea <b>mullet</b> and <b>mullet,</b> among others.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the coast}} of Northwest Florida and Alabama, this <b>mullet,</b> called the striped or black <b>mullet,</b> is often a {{specialty}} of seafood restaurants. Fried <b>mullet</b> is most popular, but smoked, baked, and canned <b>mullet</b> are also eaten. Local fishermen usually catch <b>mullet</b> in a castnet, though some use a hook. <b>Mullet</b> is a delicacy {{in this area and}} is most often consumed in the home. <b>Mullet</b> are usually filleted, and the remaining frames used for fish stock, used in chowders and stews. [...] The <b>mullet</b> most commonly consumed in Florida however is the white <b>mullet</b> (Mugil curema), because its preference for cleaner water gives it a cleaner and less muddy taste.|$|R
50|$|Flathead grey <b>mullet</b> is {{mentioned}} in the Joseon era ichthyology book Jasaneobo (hangul:자산어보, hanja:玆山魚譜) as a fish of exceptional taste and nutritional value. Flathead grey <b>mullet</b> is used in various dishes: grilled, steamed, in jjigae, with noodles, as jeon and hoe. Flathead grey <b>mullet</b> dishes such as sungeojjim (steamed flathead grey <b>mullet)</b> are served for special occasions. The taste of flathead grey <b>mullet</b> is slightly different from season to season. Flathead grey <b>mullet</b> caught in spring and winter has a sweet taste, summer flathead grey <b>mullet</b> is tasteless, and autumn flathead grey <b>mullet</b> tastes fatty and savory.|$|R
5|$|After {{they left}} The Simpsons, Oakley and Weinstein created Mission Hill. The show {{was plagued by}} promotional issues and was swiftly canceled. They worked as {{consulting}} producers on Futurama, then created The <b>Mullets</b> in 2003. The two wrote several unsuccessful TV pilots, and were due to serve as showrunners on Sit Down, Shut Up in 2009. Oakley left the project over a contract dispute. He has since written for The Cleveland Show and Portlandia, without Weinstein. He also served as co-executive producer and writer on Portlandia, sharing a Writers Guild of America Award with his fellow writers in 2013. Oakley is married to fellow writer Rachel Pulido.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} (if not the most) {{abundant}} near-shore sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes. Occasionally squid, octopus, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp, and gastropods are also taken. In Shark Bay, the most important prey are silversides, herring, smelt-whitings, and wrasses; {{this is also the}} only local shark species that preys on the Waigeo seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis), found in seagrass beds avoided by other sharks. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, it feeds mainly on halfbeaks, herring, and <b>mullets,</b> and is also a major predator of penaeid prawns. Smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans, switching to fish as they grow older.|$|E
5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, <b>mullets,</b> mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their mouths and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to their mouths and gills.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{specimens}} of Limusaurus show morphological traits associated with herbivory that are shared {{with other groups}} of herbivorous theropods, including the Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, Oviraptorosauria, and Alvarezsauroidea, along with the troodontid Jinfengopteryx. In particular, adult specimens are characterized {{by the presence of}} stomach stones (gastroliths), with older adults having gastroliths that are larger and more numerous than those of younger adults; the size and quantity of these gastroliths are comparable to those of birds in young adults, and those of ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs in old adults. These groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter, suggesting that Limusaurus did the same; the increased amount of gastroliths in older adults may be indicative of the gut's ability to finely process plant matter increasing with age. An isotope analysis of the available {{specimens of}} Limusaurus specimens likewise showed that adults consistently match the isotope signatures of other herbivorous dinosaurs; however, in the same analysis, juveniles and subadults were found to vary greatly in their isotopic signatures. This indicates that juveniles were likely omnivorous, but switched to strict herbivory as they aged. This is comparable to the diet shift experienced by the aforementioned <b>mullets</b> and armored catfish.|$|E
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, <b>mullets,</b> bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E
