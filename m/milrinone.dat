50|$|<b>Milrinone</b> is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor. This drug {{inhibits}} {{the action}} of phosphodiesterase-3 and thus prevents degradation of cAMP. With increased cAMP levels there {{is an increase in}} the activation of PKA. This PKA will phosphorylate many components of the cardiomyocyte such as calcium channels and components of the myofilaments. Phosphorylation of calcium channels permits an increase in calcium influx into the cell. This increase in calcium influx results in increased contractility. PKA also phosphorylates potassium channels promoting their action. Potassium channels are responsible for repolarization of the cardiomyocytes therefore increasing the rate at which cells can depolarize and generate contraction. PKA also phosphorylates components on myofilaments allowing actin and myosin to interact more easily and thus increasing contractility and the inotropic state of the heart. <b>Milrinone</b> allows stimulation of cardiac function independently of β-adrenergic receptors which appear to be down-regulated in those with heart failure.|$|E

MethodsFive groups of Landrace swine were compared: (1) control group, no cardiopulmonary bypass; (2) bypass group, 90 minutes of normothermic bypass and 60 minutes of reperfusion; (3) inhaled <b>milrinone</b> group, bypass preceded by a 1. 8 -mg bolus of inhaled <b>milrinone</b> followed by a continuous <b>milrinone</b> nebulization; (4) intravenous <b>milrinone</b> group, bypass preceded by 2 mg of intravenous milrinone; and (5) inhaled NaCl group, bypass preceded by inhaled saline solution. After sacrifice, pulmonary arterial endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and bradykinin were studied in organ chambers. ResultsInhaled <b>milrinone</b> caused less hypotension (P <. 05), a lesser decrease in peripheral vascular resistances (P <. 01), and a lower heart rate (P <. 05) than intravenous <b>milrinone.</b> Inhaled <b>milrinone</b> prevented the alterations in relaxations of pulmonary arteries to acetylcholine caused by cardiopulmonary bypass, and relaxations to bradykinin were improved in the inhaled <b>milrinone</b> group (P <. 05) compared with the cardiopulmonary bypass and control groups.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective data analysis, identifying all infants {{who were exposed to}} <b>milrinone</b> and discharged from 322 neonatal intensive care units managed by the Pediatrix Medical Group from 1997 - 2010. We identified adverse events (AEs) during <b>milrinone</b> exposure. The unit of observation for clinical AEs was the first course of <b>milrinone</b> and for laboratory AEs it was an infant-day of exposure to <b>milrinone.</b> Results: Overall, 1446 of 716, 821 (0. 2 %) infants received <b>milrinone</b> for a total of 6894 infant-days. The proportion of infants exposed to <b>milrinone</b> increased from 0 in 1997 to 4 / 1000 infant cases in 2010.

40|$|Background: Myocardial {{failure and}} {{dysfunction}} {{is not uncommon}} during critical illness and following cardiac surgery. For optimal treatment, {{a better understanding of}} the effects of inotropic drugs is needed. In this thesis, two non-adrenergic mediated inotropes, <b>milrinone</b> and levosimendan were studied in different models of myocardial dysfunction. The study aims were to assess the following: the effects of <b>milrinone</b> on blood flow in coronary artery bypass grafts during CABG surgery; the effects of <b>milrinone</b> on left ventricular diastolic function during post-ischaemic myocardial dysfunction; whether <b>milrinone</b> or levosimendan are protective or injurious during acute myocardial ischaemia, and if levosimendan potentiates myocardial function when added to <b>milrinone</b> in an experimental model of post-ischaemic (stunned) myocardium. Material and Methods: In Study I, 44 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery(CABG) were included as subjects. <b>Milrinone</b> or saline was administrated in a single dose during cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) and coronary graft flow measurements were recorded after 10 and 30 min following CPB. In Study II; 24 patients undergoing CABG had estimations of peak ventricular filling rates made before and after CPB with administration of <b>milrinone</b> or saline as a single dose during CPB, performed by assessment of the rate of change in diastolic cross-sectional left ventricular area. In Study III, energy-metabolic effects of <b>milrinone</b> and levosimendan were measured in an anaesthetized porcine model during 45 minutes of regional myocardial ischemia. Microdialysis sampling of metabolites of local ischemic metabolism allowed assessment of glycolytic activity and the degree of myocardial calcium overload. In Study IV, in a porcine model of postischaemic myocardial stunning, ventricular pressure-volume relationships were analyzed when <b>milrinone</b> or a combination of <b>milrinone</b> and levosimendan were given together. Results: In Study I, there was a clear increase in non-sequential saphenous vein graft blood flow with <b>milrinone</b> at 10 minutes (64. 5 ± 37. 4 compared to placebo 43. 6 ± 25. 7 ml/min (mean ± SD).). A decreasing but still measureable flow increase was seen for <b>milrinone</b> at 30 minutes. In Study II, an increase in early left ventricular filling rate (ventricular cross-sectional area rate of change,dA/dt) was seen in the <b>milrinone</b> treated group. Pre-bypass <b>milrinone</b> group dA/dt 22. 0 ± 9. 5 changed to post-bypass values dA/dt 27. 8 ± 11. 5 cm 2 /sec). Placebo group pre-bypass dA/dt was 21. 0 ± 8. 7 and post-bypass 17. 1 ± 7. 1 cm 2 /sec. A <b>milrinone</b> effect was demonstrated in an adjusted regression model (p = 0. 001). In Study III, neither <b>milrinone</b> nor levosimendan led to a change in energy-metabolic activity during ischemia as reflected by interstitial glucose, pyruvate, lactate orglycerol. Neither drug exacerbated the relative myocardial calcium overload during ischemia. In Study IV, <b>milrinone</b> improved active relaxation (tau) in post-ischemic stunned myocardium, but did not markedly improve systolic function by preload recruitable stroke work. Levosimendan added to <b>milrinone</b> showed minimal effect on active relaxation but a positive effect on systolic function in combination with <b>milrinone.</b> Conclusions: We conclude that <b>milrinone</b> treatment leads to an increase in blood flow in newly implanted coronary saphenous vein grafts, and improves ventricular relaxation post-cardiopulmonary bypass. Neither <b>milrinone</b> nor levosimendan, in this porcine model, negatively influence myocardial energy metabolism or calcium overload during acute ischaemia. Addition of levosimendan to <b>milrinone</b> treatment during post-ischaemic ventricular dysfunction may provide additive inotropic effects on systolic function but probably not for active relaxation...|$|E

Hemodynamic variables and RV volumetric data measured by thermodilution method were collected as follows: after anesthesia induction (T 1); 10 min after heart displacement for obtuse marginal artery anastomosis (T 2); after pericardial closure (T 3). Cardiac index and heart rate increased and systemic vascular resistance significantly decreased in <b>milrinone</b> group at T 2.

Recently, a number of clinical studies have been carried out to evaluate the effects of <b>milrinone</b> on cardiac function in patients with low ventricular ejection fraction undergoing CABG.

OBJECTIVES: This review examines the effectiveness of prophylactic postoperative use of <b>milrinone</b> to prevent LCOS or death in children having undergone surgery for {{congenital heart disease}}. SEARCH METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed to identify randomised controlled trials. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science in February 2014 and conducted a top-up search in September 2014 as well as clinical trial registries and reference lists of published studies.

40|$|Heart failure {{remains a}} major {{therapeutic}} {{problem with a}} poor prognosis despite therapy with digitalis, diuretics and vasodilator drugs. Because impaired myocardial contractility is a principal feature of persistent heart failure, the development of phosphodiesterase inhibitors, e. g. <b>milrinone,</b> has presented important therapeutic possibilities. <b>Milrinone</b> exerts both positive inotropic and vasodilator activity, and improves systemic haemody-namics by increasing left ventricular stroke volume and decreasing left ventricular filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance. In addition to improving systolic pump function, <b>milrinone</b> {{has also been shown}} to improve impaired diastolic relaxation of the failing heart. Importantly, treatment with <b>milrinone</b> does not significantly increase myocardial oxygen consumption. In moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III and IV), intravenous and oral <b>milrinone</b> have been shown not only to produce acute haemodynamic improvement but also to relieve the associated symptom of breathlessness, with improvement in quality-of-life indices. In placebo-controlled, double-blind studies oral <b>milrinone</b> has enhanced exercise tolerance and increased total body oxygen consumption in mild (class II), moderate and severe heart failure. There is no evidence of a substantial pro-arrhythmic effect or other significant non-cardiovascular side-effects {{associated with the use of}} <b>milrinone.</b> The possibility of improved survival, which is still the ultimate goal of therapy with phosphodiester-ase inhibitors, remains to the studied. Similarly, the role of these agents in the management of mild heart failure...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that thyroid hormone in physiological concentrations stimulates sarcolemma-enriched rabbit-myocardial-membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase in vitro. In this study, <b>milrinone</b> [2 -methyl- 5 -cyano-(3, 4 '-bipyridin) - 6 (1 H) -one], a cardiac inotropic agent, was thyromimetic {{in the same}} system. At clinically achievable concentrations (50 - 500 nM), <b>milrinone</b> significantly stimulated membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase in vitro. This action was antagonized by W- 7 [N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloro- 1 -naphthalenesulfonamide], an agent that also blocks thyroid hormone action on the Ca 2 +-ATPase, at concentrations as low as 5 microM. Progressive additions of <b>milrinone</b> to membranes incubated with a fixed concentration of thyroxine (0. 10 nM) or triiodothyronine resulted in a progressive obliteration of the thyroid hormone effect on Ca 2 +-ATPase. Amrinone [5 -amino-(3, 4 '-bipyridin) - 6 (1 H) -one], the parent bipyridine of <b>milrinone,</b> {{had no effect on}} myocardial Ca 2 +-ATPase activity. X-ray crystallographic analysis of <b>milrinone</b> and amrinone revealed structural homologies between the phenolic ring of thyroxine and the substituted ring of <b>milrinone,</b> whereas amrinone did not share these homologies. The mechanism(s) of the inotropic actions of thyroxine and of <b>milrinone</b> is not clearly understood, but these observations implicate Ca 2 +-ATPase, a calcium pump-associated enzyme, as one mediator of the effects on the heart of these two compounds...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the optimal pharmacokinetic model for <b>milrinone</b> in pediatric patients after cardiac surgery when <b>milrinone</b> was administered as a slow loading dose followed by a constant-rate infusion. The data used for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multi-center trial of <b>milrinone</b> as prophylaxis for the development of low cardiac output syndrome after surgery for repair of complex congenital cardiac defects. Two blood samples were randomly collected from each patient for determination of plasma <b>milrinone</b> concentrations with subsequent population pharmacokinetic modeling. The pharmacokinetics of <b>milrinone</b> in pediatric patients under 6 year's age were best described by a weight-normalized one compartment model after a slow loading dose followed by a constant-rate infusion. The volume of distribution was 482 mlkg − 1, and was independent of age. Clearance was a linear function of age given by Cl= 2. 42 mlkg − 1 min − 1 [1 + 0. 0396 *age]...|$|E
