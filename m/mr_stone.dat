500|$|On February4, Concord artist Philip Holden sent Beach {{improved}} sketches {{for both}} sides. Beach {{had been under}} the impression that the year must appear on the coin by itself, in addition to the anniversary dates 1775—1925; on February5 Keyes wrote to Beach that he had viewed the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar and the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar. Both bore their dates only as part of anniversaries. Keyes noted that the two coins had the words [...] "PILGRIM" [...] and [...] "HUGUENOT" [...] respectively before [...] "HALF DOLLAR", and proposed that the word [...] "PATRIOT" [...] appear in the same place on the new coin. Keyes noted that April19, the anniversary of both battles, is Patriot Day in Massachusetts. He insisted that the words [...] "THE CONCORD MINUTE MAN" [...] appear even if it was illegible, [...] "the public in these two towns are sometimes pretty sensitive about petty matters and so <b>Mr.</b> <b>Stone</b> and I have been very particular to come to an agreement as to all details." ...|$|E
500|$|On Christmas Day, the Los Angeles Times ran a {{critical}} article entitled [...] "Suppression of the Facts Grants Stone a Broad Brush." [...] New York Newsday followed suit {{the next day}} with two articles – [...] "The Blurred Vision of JFK" [...] and [...] "The Many Theories of a Jolly Green Giant." [...] A few days later, the Chicago Sun-Times followed suit with [...] "Stone's Film Trashes Facts, Dishonors J.F.K." [...] Jack Valenti, then {{president and chief executive of}} the Motion Picture Association of America, denounced Stone's film in a seven-page statement. He wrote, [...] "In much the same way, young German boys and girls in 1941 were mesmerized by Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, in which Adolf Hitler was depicted as a newborn God. Both JFK and Triumph of the Will are equally a propaganda masterpiece and equally a hoax. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Stone</b> and Leni Riefenstahl have another genetic linkage: neither of them carried a disclaimer on their film that its contents were mostly pure fiction." [...] Stone recalls in an interview, [...] "I can't even remember all the threats, there were so many of them." ...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the letter}} from <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Stone</b> was {{received}} on December 4, 1930, the Mayor did not receive it until December 15, 1930. He notes that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Stone</b> has not yet registered for employment through the Unemployment Committee. He also mentions that "nearly 500 people" have registered with the Unemployment Committee and asks that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Stone</b> not be disappointed if she does not get immediate results...|$|R

2500|$|The {{line up to}} Kaitoke Station {{was officially}} opened on 28 December 1877 by the Marquis of Normanby. [...] A special train was run from Wellington to Kaitoke for the {{occasion}} {{under the supervision of}} District Engineer Mr. Hales and General Manager <b>Mr.</b> <b>Stone.</b> [...] After speeches and an inspection of the station, by which time had had a refreshments room added, the Governor and party boarded the train again to return to Wellington. [...] Over the next few days, excursion trains were run from Wellington to Kaitoke to satiate the curiosity of those who had heard of the fearsome reputation the line had gained during its construction.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, Naipaul {{returned}} to Trinidad for a two-month stay with his family. Travelling by ship there, he sent humorous sketches of the ship's West Indian passengers to Pat. These sketches became {{the inspiration for}} The Suffrage of Elvira, a comic novella about a rural election in Trinidad. In 1957, Naipaul became an editorial assistant at the Cement and Concrete Association (C), his only full-time job. [...] The C {{was to be the}} setting for Naipaul's later novel, <b>Mr</b> <b>Stone</b> and the Knight's Companion. At this time the New Statesmans Kingsley Martin gave Naipaul a part-time job reviewing books, a job he did from 1957 to 1961.|$|E
2500|$|Naipaul {{had spent}} an overwrought year in India. [...] Back in London, after An Area of Darkness was completed, he felt creatively drained. [...] He {{felt he had}} used up his Trinidad material. [...] Neither India nor the writing of <b>Mr</b> <b>Stone</b> and the Knight's Companion, his only attempt at a novel set in Britain with white British characters, had spurred new ideas for imaginative writing. [...] His {{finances}} too were low, and Pat went back to teaching to supplement them. [...] Naipaul's books had received much critical acclaim, {{but they were not}} yet money makers. [...] Socially, he was now breaking away from the Caribbean Voices circle, but no doors had opened to mainstream British society.|$|E
