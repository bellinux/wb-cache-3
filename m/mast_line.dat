However, they are tumor cells carrying a gain-of-function mutation of Kit. We established an immortal <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> without Kit mutation, NCL- 2, derived from NC mouse bone marrow. NCL- 2 cells could be maintained without additional growth factors and thus could respond to exogenous growth signals. Moreover, NCL- 2 cells expressed FcεRI and KIT, and release histamine and LTB 4 in response to antigen stimulation. This cell line could be a useful tool to analyze proliferation, differentiation, and function of normal mast cells...|$|R

40|$|Degradation of the {{extracellular}} matrix occurs under physiological and pathological conditions, {{thought to be}} principally mediated by a family of neutral proteolytic enzymes termed the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The present study was initiated to determine whether mast cells {{have the ability to}} produce these proteases in diseased and normal human tissue. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization was performed to localize interstitial collagenase protein and mRNA transcripts in diseased human tissue. The human <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> HMC- 1 was cultured under serum free conditions, stimulated with phorbol mystrate acetate (PMA) and supernatants analyzed by Western blotting and zymography to determine the profile of secreted MMPs. The dog <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> BR, known to secrete gelatinolytic enzymes, was used in parallel studies. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by RT-PCR for the expression of tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs). Collagenase- 1 protein and mRNA were expressed by tryptase and chymase positive human mast cells in all tissue analyzed. This proteinase wa also detected in the cytoplasm and conditioned media of HMC- 1 cells. PMA induced gelatinolytic activity in both <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines</b> examined. TIMP- 1 immunoreactivity was detected and TIMP- 1, and- 2 (but not TIMP- 3) mRNA transcripts were amplified from HMC- 1 cells. This is the first demonstration of the expression of collagenase- 1 by human mast cells in both inflamed and normal tissues, and by a human <b>mast</b> cell <b>line.</b> MMPs secreted by these cells could contribute to the extensive matrix lysis characteristic of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory ocular disorders.

The anaesthetic drugs most commonly associated with anaphylaxis are neuromuscular blocking agents. As these drugs act on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of the neuromuscular junction, potentiation of anaphylaxis by a nicotinic receptor on basophils and mast cells is plausible. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are present on a human basophil and <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines</b> as their presence may suggest a mechanism of associated anaphylaxis. Nicotinic receptors were demonstrated on a basophil and a <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> using an α-bungarotoxin–fluorescein conjugate by flow cytometry and by both conventional and confocal microscopic techniques.

40|$|Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a {{rare disease}} caused by an {{abnormal}} mast cell accumulation in various tissues. Two classes of constitutive activating c-kit mutations are found in SM. The most frequent class occurs in the catalytic pocket coding region with substitutions at codon 816 {{and the other in}} the intracellular juxtamembrane coding region. Therefore, kinase inhibitors that block mutated c-kit activity might be used as therapeutic agents in SM. Here, we show that STI 571 inhibits both wild-type and juxtamembrane mutant c-kit kinase activity, but has no effect on the activity of the D 816 V mutant. Accordingly, STI 571 selectively decreases the survival of normal mast cell and of <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines</b> either with juxtamembrane c-kit mutations, but not that of tumoral mast cell from patient with SM or of <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines</b> with the D 816 V mutation.

40|$|The human <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> (HMC) - 1 {{cell line}} is growth-factor {{independent}} {{because of a}} constitutive activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit. Such deregulated Kit activity has also been suggested causative in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) and mastocytosis. HMC- 1 is the only established continuously growing human <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> and has therefore been widely employed for in vitro studies of human mast cell biology. In this paper we describe two sublines of HMC- 1, named HMC- 1560 and HMC- 1560, 816, with different phenotypes and designated by the locations of specific mutations in the c-kit proto-oncogene. Activating mutations in the Kit receptor were characterized using the pyrosequencing™ method. Both sublines have a heterozygous T to G mutation at codon 560 in the juxtamembrane region of the c-kit gene causing an amino acid substitution of Gly- 560 for Val. In contrast, only HMC- 1560, 816 cells have the c-kitV 816 mutation found in mast cell neoplasms causing an Asp→Val substitution in the intracellular kinase domain. Kit was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and associated with phosphatidylinositol 3 ′-kinase (PI 3 -kinase) in both variants of HMC- 1, but this {{did not lead to}} a constitutive phosphorylation of Akt or extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), which are signalling molecules normally activated by the interaction of stem cell factor (SCF) with Kit. The documentation and characterization of two sublines of HMC- 1 cells provides both information on the biological consequences of mutations in Kit and recognition of the availability of what in reality are two distinct cultured human <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines...</b>|$|R

40|$|CD 43 (leucosialin, sialophorin) is {{the major}} sialoprotein of nearly all {{circulating}} leucocytes and has important biological activities in cellular differentiation and activation. Recently, the expression of CD 43 has also been demonstrated on mast cells and basophils by flow cytometry. In order to further characterize mast cell/basophil leucosialin we have investigated CD 43 on the human <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> HMC- 1, the human basophilic precursor cell line KU- 812, and the human promonocytic cell line U- 937. The apparent molecular weights (MW) were 123, 000 (HMC- 1 and KU- 812) and 144, 000 (U- 937) by Western blot analysis. Expression of CD 43 on HMC- 1 was down-regulated after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Three monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for human CD 43 induced homotypic <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> (HMC- 1) aggregation in a semi-quantitative assay, a phenomenon {{that has not been}} described before with mast cells. Monoclonal antibodies specific for seven other surface antigens and an irrelevant mAb of the same isotype had no effect. The level of aggregation was dependent on anti-CD 43 mAb concentration, time and temperature. Anti-leucosialin-induced aggregation of HMC- 1 cells was completely inhibited by mAb against CD 11 a (LFA- 1) and CD 18 (beta 2 -chain). Monoclonal antibody to CD 54 (ICAM- 1) partially inhibited anti-CD 43 -induced homotypic aggregation, while anti-CD 11 b (CR 3), anti-CD 11 c (p 150, 95) and a control mAb had no inhibitory effect. We conclude that <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> CD 43 antigen expression is differentially regulated during cell activation, and speculate that anti-CD 43 -induced homotypic aggregation of HMC- 1 cells is closely associated with modulation of beta 2 -integrins...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the regulation of}} mouse l-histidine decarboxylase (HDC) gene expression, we isolated genomic DNA clones encoding HDC. Structural analysis revealed that the mouse HDC gene was composed of 12 exons, spanning ∼ 24 kb. Northern blotting analysis indicated that, among the cell lines examined, {{a high level of}} HDC gene expression was restricted to mature <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines</b> and an erythroblastic cell line. The gene was induced strongly in the mouse immature <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> P 815 after incubation in the peritoneal cavity of BDF 1 mice. We observed that the promoter region was demethylated in the HDC-expressing cell lines and in induced P 815 cells. Interestingly, forced demethylation by 5 -azacytidine (5 -azaC) treatment induced high expression of HDC mRNA in P 815 cells. The activity of a mouse HDC promoter–reporter construct stably transfected in P 815 cells was repressed by in vitro patch-methylation. This low promoter activity of the patch-methylated reporter construct was restored after 5 -azaC treatment, which demethylated the patch-methylated promoter.

40|$|Abstract Background Intravenous {{morphine}} use {{is associated}} with elevated histamine release leading to bronchoconstriction, edema and hemodynamic instability in some patients. This study evaluated the possibility that sulfite, which is present as a preservative in many morphine preparations, might contribute to histamine release in vitro. Results The human <b>mast</b> cell <b>line,</b> HMC- 1, was exposed to various morphine concentrations, {{in the absence of}} sulfite, under cell culture conditions. Clinically attained concentrations of morphine (0. 018 μg/ml and 0. 45 μg/ml) did not cause increased histamine release from mast cells. There was a significant increase in histamine release when the morphine concentration was increased by 1184 -fold (668 μg/ml morphine). Histamine release from mast cells exposed to morphine and/or sulfite required the presence of prostaglandin H synthetase. Histamine release in experiments using sulfite-containing morphine solutions was not statistically different from that observed in morphine-only solutions. Conclusion Sulfite in sulfite-containing morphine solutions, at concentrations seen clinically, is not responsible for histamine release in in vitro experiments of the human <b>mast</b> cell <b>line,</b> HMC- 1. This does not preclude the fact that sulfite may lead to elevation of histamine levels in vivo. </p...|$|R

40|$|Mastocytosis is a {{rare disease}} {{characterized}} by neoplastic accumulation of mast cells in various organs, particularly in skin and bone marrow. Sporadic mastocytosis is usually caused by somatic point mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT that occur in exon 17, codon 816, and activates KIT by affecting the intracellular enzymatic site of the molecule. Homeostasis of so altered mast cells is influenced on different levels. These cells show an elevated rate of proliferation and changes in cellular apoptosis. In this thesis {{the expression of the}} inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) Survivin in neoplastic mast cells and its importance as a diagnostic marker or therapeutic target has been evaluated. For this purpose the Survivin content of normal and neoplastic mast cells was analyzed. Furthermore Survivin expression in mast cells of bone marrow samples from patients with mastocytosis and healthy donors was compared. The expression of Survivin protein in the neoplastic human <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> HMC- 1 was downregulated by siRNA and apoptosis was subsequently induced with tyrosine kinase inhibitors or the death receptor ligand TRAIL. It is known from other hematopoietic neoplasia that Smac mimetics, inhibitors of the IAPs XIAP, cIAP 1 and cIAP 2, are potent therapeutics able to amplify the effect of classical cytotoxic therapies. Here the Smac mimetic LCL 161 was used in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKC 412 and TRAIL to inhibit growth of the neoplastic <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> HMC- 1. The expression of the IAP Survivin is enhanced in neoplastic altered mast cells and can be detected in significantly higher amounts in mast cell infiltrates of the bone marrow from patients with mastocytosis compared to healthy donors underlining its value as a diagnostic marker. Downregulation of Survivin protein as well as the use of the Smac mimetic LCL 161 inhibited the growth of the neoplastic <b>mast</b> cell <b>line</b> HMC- 1 synergistically with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the death receptor ligand TRAIL. These results emphasize the relevance of cellular regulation of apoptosis as a future target for the therapy of mastocytosis. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the potential contribution of miRNA dysregulation to the biology of canine mast cell tumors (MCTs), a well-established spontaneous model of malignant mast cell disease. Methods: We evaluated the miRNA expression profiles from biologically low-grade and biologically high-grade primary canine MCTs using real-time PCR-based TaqMan Low Density miRNA Arrays and performed real-time PCR to evaluate miR- 9 expression in primary canine MCTs, malignant <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines,</b> and normal bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Mouse <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines</b> and BMMCs were transduced with empty or pre-miR- 9 expressing lentiviral constructs and cell proliferation, caspase 3 / 7 activity, and invasion were assessed. Transcriptional profiling of cells overexpressing miR- 9 was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 2. 0 ST arrays and real-time PCR was performed to validate changes in mRNA expression. Results: Our data demonstrate that unique miRNA expression profiles correlate with the biological behavior of primary canine MCTs and that miR- 9 {{expression is}} increased in biologically high grade canine MCTs and malignant cell lines compared to biologically low grade tumors and normal canine BMMCs. In transformed mouse malignant <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines</b> expressing either wild-type (C 57) or activating (P 815) KIT mutations and mouse BMMCs, miR- 9 overexpression significantly enhanced invasion but had no effect on cell proliferation or apoptosis. Transcriptional profiling of normal mouse BMMCs and P 815 cells possessing enforced miR- 9 expression demonstrated dysregulation of several genes, including upregulation of CMA 1, a protease involved in activation of matrix metalloproteases and extracellular matrix remodeling. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that unique miRNA expression profiles correlate with the biological behavior of canine MCTs. Furthermore, dysregulation of miR- 9 is associated with MCT metastasis potentially through the induction of an invasive phenotype, identifying a potentially novel pathway for therapeutic intervention. © 2014 Fenger et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

Thus, inhibition of KIT {{has been a major}} focus for treatment of this disorder. Here we investigated a novel approach to such inhibition. Utilizing rational drug design, we targeted the switch pocket (SP) of KIT, which regulates its catalytic conformation. Two SP inhibitors thus identified, DP- 2976 and DP- 4851, were examined for effects on neoplastic mast cell proliferation and mast cell activation. Autophosphorylation of both wild-type and, where also examined, KIT D 816 V activation was blocked by these compounds in transfected 293 T cells, HMC 1. 1 and 1. 2 human <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines,</b> and in CD 34 (+) -derived human mast cells activated by stem cell factor (SCF). Both inhibitors induced apoptosis in the neoplastic <b>mast</b> cell <b>lines</b> and reduced survival of primary bone marrow mast cells from patients with mastocytosis. Moreover, the SP inhibitors more selectively blocked SCF potentiation of Fc 92 ̆ 03 aRI-mediated degranulation. Overall, SP inhibitors represent an innovative mechanism of KIT inhibition whose dual suppression of KIT D 816 V neoplastic mast cell proliferation and SCF-enhanced mast cell activation may provide significant therapeutic benefits.
