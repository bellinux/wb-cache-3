50|$|The Type 97 mortar {{examined}} had {{an extension}} fitted to the sight, raising {{the latter to}} the level of the muzzle of the mortar. This extension probably was added to permit sighting of the weapon when it was deeply dug in or slightly in defilade. Elevation scale of the sight is graduated in 50-mil intervals from 700 to 1,600 mils, and a <b>micrometer</b> <b>drum</b> enables elevation readings to be made to the nearest mil. The collimator can be traversed in a full circle, and the azimuth scale is calibrated in 100-mil graduations in two sections of 3,200 mils each. As in the case of elevation, a <b>micrometer</b> <b>drum</b> permits azimuth readings to be made to the nearest mil. There is a throw-out lever for rapid traverse of the collimator, which may be placed at an angle of elevation and locked in position by a series of meshing notches. There are no open sights for rough laying of the piece.|$|E
5000|$|Attached to {{the frame}} are the [...] "horizon mirror", an index arm which moves the index mirror, a {{sighting}} telescope, sun shades, a graduated scale and a <b>micrometer</b> <b>drum</b> gauge for accurate measurements. The scale must be graduated so that the marked degree divisions register twice the angle through which the index arm turns. The scales of the octant, sextant, quintant and quadrant are graduated from below zero to 90°, 120°, 140° and 180° respectively. For example, the sextant shown alongside has a scale graduated from −10° to 142°, so that is basically a quintant: the frame is a {{sector of a circle}} subtending an angle of 76° (not 72°) at the pivot of the index arm.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{technique}} is proposed which allows {{assessment of the}} anterior chamber depth with a standard table slit-lamp without any extra attachments. A final approximation is made which suggests that a 10 change in the angle between the observation and illumination systems of the slit lamp when the end point is reached indicates a change in anterior chamber depth of 0 - 1 mm. The first recorded slit-lamp technique for measuring {{the depth of the}} anterior chamber was that used by Donders in 1872. In this technique the slit-lamp is focused on the corneal endothelium and then the anterior lens surface. The slit-lamp movement be-tween these two positions gives the apparent depth of the anterior chamber. In 1914 Ulbrich utilised the Donders technique with the additional refinement of a <b>micrometer</b> <b>drum</b> to measure the slit-lamp move-ment accurately. The technique, of course, relies on the eye maintaining a fixed position during the tim...|$|E
40|$|A symmetrically opening slit mechanism, {{particularly}} {{suitable for}} infra-red spectrometers, is described. I t employs parallel spring movements, operates for widths from 1 to 2 OOO p and {{is suitable for}} use with curved jaws. Its operating torque is about 50 g cm which, with its rapid response and freedom from backlash, makes it suitable for automatic control. The jaws remain parallel to within about 3 sec, and the mid-line of the slit does not drift more than about 2 p. Hysteresis between the driving <b>micrometer</b> <b>drum</b> and the measured slit width amounts to 0. 2 - 0. 3 p, and {{may be due to}} an oil film. The slit jaws can be set so close together as to polarize the transmitted light completely. The slit mechanism, with a suitable rotational movement, has been applied to a twin-beam infra-red spectrometer; it has been demonstrated that entrance and exit slits must be alined to within a few seconds if satisfactory balance of the twin beams is to be achieved. An appendix describes a new all-spring reversing mechanism which enables the slit width to be controlled to better than 0. 05 p, and which is apparently completely free from hysteresis...|$|E
