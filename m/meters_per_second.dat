The study included five cultivars ranging from early- to late-season types: 'Norland,' 'Superior,''Norchip,' 'Russet Burbank,' and 'Kennebec,' Tuber development progressed well under continuous irradiation at 400 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and under 12 hours irradiance and 12 hours dark, while tuber development was suppressed in all other light treatments. Continuous irradiation at 200 or 400 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> resulted in severe stunting and leaf malformation on 'Superior' and 'Kennebec' plants, but little or no injury and vigorous shoot growth in the other cultivars. No injury or stunting were apparent under 12 -dim light or 12 -dark treatments. Plants given 12 hours dim INC showed significantly greater stem elongation but less total biomass than plants in other treatments. The continuous light encouraged shoot growth over tuber growth but this trend was overridden by providing a high irradiance level. The variation among cultivars for tolerance to continuous lighting indicates that potato may be a useful species for photoinhibition studies...|$|R

5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 <b>meters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E

40|$|A double {{pressure}} probe {{technique was}} used to measure simultaneously water flows and hydraulic parameters of individual cells and of excised roots of young seedlings of maize (Zea mays L.) in osmotic experiments. By following initial flows of water at the cell and root level and by estimating the profiles of driving forces (water potentials) across the root, the hydraulic conductivity of individual cell layers was evaluated. Since the hydraulic conductivity of the cell-to-cell path was determined separately, the hydraulic conductivity of the cell wall material could be evaluated as well (Lpcw = 0. 3 to 6. 10 − 9 <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> <b>per</b> megapascal). Although, for radial water flow across the cortex and rhizodermis, the apoplasmic path was predominant, the contribution of the hydraulic conductance of the cell-to-cell path to the overall conductance increased significantly from the first layer of the cortex toward the inner layers from 2 % to 23 %. This change was mainly due to an increase of the hydraulic conductivity of the cell membranes which was Lp = 1. 9. 10 − 7 <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> <b>per</b> megapascal in the first layer and Lp = 14 to 9. 10 − 7 <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> <b>per</b> megapascal in the inner layers of the cortex. The hydraulic conductivity of entire roots depended on whether hydrostatic or osmotic forces were used to induce water flows. Hydrostatic Lpr was 1. 2 to 2. 3. 10 − 7 <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> <b>per</b> megapascal and osmotic Lpr = 1. 6 to 2. 8. 10 − 8 <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> <b>per</b> megapascal. The apparent reflection coefficients of root cells (σs) of nonpermeating solutes (KCI, PEG 6000) decreased from values close to unity in the rhizodermis to about 0. 7 to 0. 8 in the cortex. In all cases, however, σs was significantly larger than the reflection coefficient of entire roots (σsr). For KCI and PEG 6000, σsr was 0. 53 and 0. 64, respectively.

In leaves acclimated to 60 and 25 micromole photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> the gradient in CAM activity was reversed, i. e. more CO 2 was taken up through the upper than through the lower surfaces and nocturnal acidification was higher in the tissue next to the upper surfaces. Total net carbon gain and total nocturnal acid synthesis were highest in leaves which had developed at 400 micromole photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Chlorophyll content was markedly reduced in leaves which had developed at 1300 micromole photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> especially in the exposed adaxial parts. There was also a sustained reduction in photosystem II photochemical efficiency as indicated by measurements of the ratio of variable over maximum chlorophyll a fluorescence. These findings suggest that, at high growth photon flux densities, the reduced activity of the exposed portions of these succulent leaves is caused by (a) the adverse effects of excess light, (b) together with a genotypic component which favors CO 2 uptake and acid synthesis in the abaxial (lower) leaf parts even when light is not or only marginally excessive. This latter component is predominant at medium photon flux densities, e. g. at 400 micromole photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> It becomes overridden, however, under conditions of deep shade when strongly reduced light levels in the abaxial parts of the leaf chlorenchyma severely limit photosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|Stomatal conductances of {{normally}} oriented and inverted {{leaves were}} measured as light levels (photosynthetic photon flux densities) were increased {{to determine whether}} abaxial stomata of Vicia faba leaves were more sensitive to light than adaxial stomata. Light levels were increased over uniform populations of leaves of plants grown in an environmental chamber. Adaxial stomata of inverted leaves reached maximum water vapor conductances at a light level of 60 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> the same light level at which abaxial stomata of normally oriented leaves reached maximum conductances. Abaxial stomata of inverted leaves reached maximum conductances at a light level of 500 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> the same light level at which adaxial stomata of normally oriented leaves reached maximum conductances. Maximum conductances in both normally oriented and inverted leaves were about 200 millimoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for adaxial stomata and 330 millimoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for abaxial stomata. Regardless of whether leaves were normally oriented or inverted, when light levels were increased to values high enough that upper leaf surfaces reached maximum conductances (about 500 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second),</b> light levels incident on lower, shaded leaf surfaces were just sufficient (about 60 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second)</b> for stomata of those surfaces to reach maximum conductances. This `coordinated' stomatal opening on the separate epidermes resulted in total leaf conductances for normally oriented and inverted leaves that were the same at any given light level. We conclude that stomata in abaxial epidermes of intact Vicia leaves are not more sensitive to light than those in adaxial epidermes, and that stomata in leaves of this plant {{do not respond to}} light alone. Additional factors in bulk leaf tissue probably produce coordinated stomatal opening on upper and lower leaf epidermes to optimally meet photosynthetic requirements of the whole leaf for CO 2...|$|R

Fluxes were measured using the mass-balance approach during exposure to 4. 56 micromoles <b>per</b> cubic <b>meter</b> (0. 11 microliters per liter) SO 2 for 2 hours in a controlled environmental chamber. Flux through adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces with closed stomata ranged from 1. 9 to 9. 4 nanomoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for SO 2, and 0. 3 to 1. 3 millimoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for H 2 O vapor. Flux of SO 2 into leaves through stomata ranged from ∼ 0 to 8. 5 (dark) and 3. 8 to 16. 0 (light) millimoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Flux of H 2 O vapor from leaves through stomata ranged from ∼ 0 to 0. 6 (dark) to 0. 4 to 0. 9 (light) millimole <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Lycopersicon had internal flux rates for both SO 2 and H 2 O vapor over twice as high as for the other species.

The initial slope of the photosynthetic CO 2 response curve was dependent on light intensity at reduced light levels only (less than 450 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> in C. album and below 200 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> in P. vulgaris). Modeled simulations indicated that the initial slope of the CO 2 response of photosynthesis exhibited light dependency when the rate of RuBP regeneration limited photosynthesis, but not when rubisco capacity limited photosynthesis. Measured observations closely matched modeled simulations. The activation state of rubisco was measured at three light intensities in C. album (1750, 550, and 150 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> <b>second)</b> and at intercellular CO 2 partial pressures (C 1) between the CO 2 compensation point and 500 microbars.
