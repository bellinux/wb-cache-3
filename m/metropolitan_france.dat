5|$|A new {{electoral system}} of two-round voting had been {{introduced}} for the 2004 regional elections, in part {{in an attempt to}} reduce the FN's influence in regional councils. The FN won 15.1% of the vote in <b>metropolitan</b> <b>France,</b> almost the same as in 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new electoral system. For the 2004 European elections too, a new system less favourable to the FN {{had been introduced}}. The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats.|$|E

5|$|In August 1939, she {{embarked}} six Loire 130s {{and eight}} Latécoère 298s and sailed for Oran, {{where she was}} when World War II began the next month. Commandant Teste remained in North African waters until December 1939, {{when she returned to}} Toulon and landed her aircraft. She served as an aircraft transport between French North Africa and <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>France</b> {{for the first half of}} 1940. In late June 1940, she was transferred from the over-crowded anchorage at Oran to Mers El Kébir. She was lightly damaged by shell splinters during the British attack on Mers-el-Kébir on 3 July 1940, but suffered no casualties. She arrived at Toulon on 18 October where she was subsequently disarmed. In June 1941, Commandant Teste was reactivated as a gunnery training ship.|$|E
5|$|In the 1997 {{legislative}} elections the FN polled its best-ever {{result with}} 15.3% support in <b>metropolitan</b> <b>France,</b> confirming its {{position as the}} third most important political force in France. It also showed that the party had become established enough to compete without its leader, who {{decided not to run}} to focus on the 2002 presidential election. Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly (Toulon), thanks to a good communication director, it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies. The FN was arguably more influential now {{than it had been in}} 1986 with its 35 seats. While Bruno Mégret and Bruno Gollnisch, in an unusual display of dissent, favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre-right following the left's victory, Le Pen rejected any such compromise. In the tenth FN national congress in 1997, Mégret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen. Le Pen however refused to designate Mégret as his successor-elect, and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election.|$|E

5|$|The Napoleonic Wars, {{the name}} for a {{succession}} of connected conflicts between the armies of the French Emperor Napoleon and his European opponents, were nine years old when the War of the Fifth Coalition ended in 1809. The Treaty of Schönbrunn that followed the war gave Napoleon possession of the final part of Adriatic coastline not under his control: the Illyrian Provinces. This formalised the control the French had exercised in Illyria since 1805 and over the whole Adriatic Sea since the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807. In the Treaty of Tilsit, Russia had granted France control over the Septinsular Republic and withdrawn their own forces from the region, allowing Napoleon freedom of action in the Adriatic. At Schönbrunn, Napoleon made the Illyrian Provinces part of <b>metropolitan</b> <b>France</b> and therefore under direct French rule, unlike the neighbouring Kingdom of Italy which was nominally independent but in reality came under his personal rule. Thus, the Treaty of Schönbrunn formalised Napoleon's control of almost the entire coastline of the Adriatic and, if unopposed, {{would allow him to}} transport troops and supplies to the Balkans. The French army forming in the Illyrian Provinces was possibly intended for an invasion of the Ottoman Empire in conjunction with the Russians; the two countries had signed an agreement to support one another against the Ottomans at Tilsit.|$|E

50|$|The {{first was}} the {{collapse}} of the French colonial empire. The Colonial Army and colonial enterprises were the principal form of employment for Corsicans. In 1920, Corsicans made up 20% of colonial administration, despite only making up 1% of <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>France's</b> population. The end of colonialism deprived young Corsicans of the opportunities of their elders and forced many to return to the island. This situation resulted in the emergence of a regionalist movement with the objective of increasing the number of opportunities for the islanders. During the uprisings in Algeria in 1958 and 1961, Corsica was the only French départment that joined the insurgent colonists.|$|R
