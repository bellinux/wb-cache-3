40|$|International audienceObservations of Archean organic-walled <b>microfossils</b> {{suggest that}} their fossilization took place through both {{encapsulation}} and permineralization. In this study, we investigated <b>microfossils</b> from the ca. 3. 0 Ga Farrel Quartzite (Pilbara, Western Australia) using transmitted light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman microspectrometry, and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) ion microprobe analyses. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrated that permineralized <b>microfossils</b> were not {{characterized by the}} micrometric spatial relationships between Si and C-N as observed in thin sections. Permineralized <b>microfossils</b> are composed of carbonaceous globules that did not survive the acid treatment, whereas encapsulated <b>microfossils</b> were characterized due to their resistance to the acid maceration procedure. We also investigated the microscale relationship between the 12 C 14 N- and 12 C 2 - ion emission as a proxy of the N/C atomic ratio in both permineralized and encapsulated <b>microfossils.</b> After considering any potential matrix and microtopography effects, we demonstrate that the encapsulated <b>microfossils</b> exhibit {{the highest level of}} geochemical preservation. This finding shows that the chemical heterogeneity of the <b>microfossils,</b> observed at a spatial resolution of a few hundreds of micrometers, can be related to fossilization processes.

During the past 5 years, we have conducted electron microscopy investigations to understand the morphology and chemical composition of <b>microfossils</b> in ancient terrestrial rocks and to search for <b>microfossils</b> presence in meteorites. We have detected evidence of indigenous <b>microfossils</b> and biominerals in-situ in every carbonaceous meteorite investigated but have found no evidence for <b>microfossils</b> in the nickel-iron and stony meteorites studied.

Neither group of plants is present today, although potential Tertiary survivors include the vascular plant Pringlea antiscorbutica and six moss species. Volcanic activity has altered the distribution and abundance of the vegetation. The vascular flora covers a range of environments and, although only six species are currently widespread, glacial retreat and the consequent connection of previously separate ice-free areas is providing opportunities for further distribution of vegetation into adjacent areas.|$|E
25|$|Sediment or rock {{samples are}} {{collected}} from either cores or outcrops, and the microfossils they contain are extracted {{by a variety}} of physical and chemical laboratory techniques, including sieving, density separation by centrifuge or in heavy liquids, and chemical digestion of the unwanted fraction.

The enormous numbers of microfossils that a small sediment sample can often yield allows the collection of statistically robust datasets which can be subjected to multivariate analysis. A typical <b>microfossil</b> study will involve identification of a few hundred specimens from each sample.|$|E

These sites are distinguished by large numbers of pisidiid clams and other less common shelled invertebrates, like unionid clams and snails. This association is not a coincidence, as the invertebrate shells would have slowly dissolved and released enough basic calcium carbonate to protect the eggshells from naturally occurring acids that otherwise would have dissolved them and prevented fossilization.|$|E
40|$|<b>Microfossils,</b> {{probably}} representing {{members of}} Precambrian photosynthetic communities of bacteria and blue-green algae, {{have been found}} in the approximately 2800 - 2500 million-year-old Bulawayan stromatolites from Rhodesia. Several populations of coccoid and elongate <b>microfossils</b> have been observed in the dark, carbon-rich stromatolite laminae. Some of these elongate forms are morphologically similar to modern bacterial spores. These <b>microfossils</b> were studied in petrographic thin sections and identified by combined scanning electron microscopy-electron microprobe and by analyses of energy dispersive spectra of individual <b>microfossils.</b> The <b>microfossils</b> contain 1 - 20 % organic carbon; some morphotypes contain traces of sulfur and one other, traces of phosphorus. The polymeric nature of the organic carbon was established by analyzing aggregates of <b>microfossils</b> at elevated temperatures in the solid inlet system of an organic mass spectrometer. The coccoid <b>microfossils</b> range in size from 1. 2 to 4. 3 μm, the elongate <b>microfossils</b> are from 2. 4 to 9. 8 μm. They are mineralized with dolomite, embedded in a calcite matrix, and are shown to be both indigenous and syngenous with the rock. Identical <b>microfossils</b> also containing organic carbon but mineralized with quartz have been observed in the stromatolites from Belingwe which are part of the Bulawayan Group from Rhodesia. Caution must be used in the interpretation of what these forms are because of their great age and relatively simple morphologies.

40|$|The {{discovery}} {{of evidence for}} biogenic activity and possible <b>microfossils</b> in a Martian meteorite may have initiated a paradigm shift regarding the existence of extraterrestrial microbial life. Terrestrial extremophiles that live in deep granite and hydrothermal vents and nanofossils in volcanic tuffs have altered the premise that microbial life and <b>microfossils</b> are inconsistent with volcanic activity and igneous rocks. Evidence for biogenic activity and <b>microfossils</b> in meteorites {{can no longer be}} dismissed solely because the meteoritic rock matrix is not sedimentary. Meteorite impact-ejection and comets provide mechanisms for planetary cross-contamination of biogenic chemicals, <b>microfossils,</b> and living microorganisms. Hence, previously dismissed evidence for complex indigenous biochemicals and possible <b>microfossils</b> in carbonaceous chondrites must be re-examined. Many similar, unidentifiable, biological-like microstructures have been found in different carbonaceous chondrites and the prevailing terrestrial contaminant model is considered suspect. This paper reports the {{discovery of}} <b>microfossils</b> indigenous to the Murchison meteorite. These forms were found in-situ in freshly broken, interior surfaces of the meteorite. Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) and optical microscopy images indicate that a population of different biological-like forms are represented. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy reveals these forms have high carbon content overlaying an elemental distribution similar to the matrix. Efforts at identification with terrestrial <b>microfossils</b> and microorganisms were negative. Some forms strongly resemble bodies previously isolated in the Orgueil meteorite and considered <b>microfossils</b> by prior researchers.

40|$|A {{variety of}} <b>microfossils,</b> {{originating}} from plant foods, become {{trapped in the}} dental calculus matrix. Processing of dental calculus allows extraction of these <b>microfossils.</b> The resulting data {{can be used to}} reconstruct diet at the individual and population levels as the identification of <b>microfossils</b> like starch grains and phytoliths to the generic level, and sometimes to the species level, is possible. However, in some archaeological sites, dental calculus deposits do not preserve well enough to be processed. To prevent the loss of information in such cases, we present a technique, called ‘‘dental wash’’. It permits extracting <b>microfossils</b> from cryptic dental calculus deposits. In the two experimental archaeological cases presented herein we identified phytoliths, starch grains as well as a diatom fragment with this method, whereas in a control sample no <b>microfossils</b> were found. Moderate damage to the teeth was detected when they were already friable due to poor preservation. Minor damage to the surface of well-preserved teeth was observed. This indicates that the proposed method is efficient in recovering <b>microfossils,</b> but unacceptable because of damage to teeth. If the method can be refined, it will expand the potential of dental calculus analysis to a greater range of archeological sites...|$|R
