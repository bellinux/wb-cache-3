25|$|The VOC is {{generally}} considered to be the world's first truly transnational corporation and it was also the first <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprise</b> to issue shares of stock to the public. Some historians such as Timothy Brook and Russell Shorto consider the VOC as the pioneering corporation in the first wave of the corporate globalization era. The VOC was the first multinational corporation to operate officially in different continents such as Europe, Asia and Africa. While the VOC mainly operated in what later became the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), the company also had important operations elsewhere. It employed people from different continents and origins in the same functions and working environments. Although it was a Dutch company its employees included not only people from the Netherlands, but also many from Germany and from other countries as well. Besides the diverse north-west European workforce recruited by the VOC in the Dutch Republic, the VOC made extensive use of local Asian labour markets. As a result, the personnel of the various VOC offices in Asia consisted of European and Asian employees. Asian or Eurasian workers might be employed as sailors, soldiers, writers, carpenters, smiths, or as simple unskilled workers. At the height of its existence the VOC had 25,000 employees who worked in Asia and 11,000 who were en route. Also, while most of its shareholders were Dutch, {{about a quarter of the}} initial shareholders were Zuid-Nederlanders (people from an area that includes modern Belgium and Luxembourg) and there were also a few dozen Germans.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} profit margins of affiliates of <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> and local firms in forty-three Indian manufacturing industries to seek explanations of the superior performance of the former. The empirical analysis finds support for the proposition that <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> and local firms constitute different strategic groups in an industry and that the former as a group enjoys greater protection from mobility barriers. <b>Multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> appear to enjoy persistent advantage over their local counterparts especially in knowledge (both technology and human skill) intensive industries.

40|$|Abstract: With the {{business}} globalization of <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises,</b> management transplantation of multinational company to foreign subsidiary {{company has been}} a common phenomenon. Furthermore, <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> management transplantation to their foreign subsidiary company has become the key for keeping sustaining competitive advantage gradually. The <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> management transplantation to their foreign subsidiary company based on parent-subsidiary company relationship perspective is presented in this paper. The effect of multinational parent-subsidiary company relationship to management transplantation mainly depends on the culture integration, trust degree, property right structure, strategy intent to subsidiary company and so on. So the influence of culture integration, trust degree, strategy intent and property right structure to management transplantation is further discussed in this paper. Furthermore, <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> management transplantation affected factors was not discussed sufficiently in the existed literature, so as a contribution of this paper, it will be supplemented. The suggestion of improving <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> management transplantation effect will also be put forward...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} if conventional foreign direct investment theories explain why <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> conduct foreign direct investment in Thailand. Theory testing based on multiple case studies will be the research method employed and qualitative secondary data {{will be used in}} an exploratory manner. Specifically, Dunning's eclectic paradigm will be tested against the foreign direct investment of three <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Thailand, namely, Royal Dutch Shell, Toyota and Tesco. The study shows that conventional foreign direct investment theories are not powerful enough to explain all of the reasons <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> conduct foreign direct investment in Thailand. Favorable exchange rates, weak market conditions, cultural similarities, geographic proximity, profitability, availability of partners, encouraging government incentives and the future potential of the region can play a substantial role when judging why <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> conduct foreign direct investment in Thailand. This enhances our understanding of foreign direct investment theories and highlights their shortcomings when applied to Thailand. Therefore, governments and business analysts should not only rely on conventional foreign direct investment theories in order to explain the foreign direct investment of <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Thailand...|$|R

40|$|Most <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> face {{difficulties}} {{regarding what}} and how to best communicate activities related to corporate social responsibility. Therefore, this master thesis addresses the online communication of corporate social responsibility by Swedish <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises.</b> The purpose is {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the way Swedish <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> reveal messages regarding corporate social responsibility to their international stakeholders while communicating with them online via their websites and social media. This research is of qualitative nature and follows a multiple case study design. The six Swedish MNEs the Volvo Group, H&M, Atlas Copco, Securitas AB, Svenska Kullagerfabriken, and Svenska Cellulosa AB are included in the sample. Two methods for data collection are combined: online observation of the communication regarding corporate social responsibility on the corporate websites including sustainability reports or alike and in social media as well as qualitative, semi-structured interviews with the employees in charge of corporate social responsibility. The results indicate that the examined <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> communicated corporate social responsibility in different ways depending on whether they communicate via their corporate websites, their reports or in social media. This master thesis concludes with practical recommendations for <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> involved in communication of corporate social responsibility...|$|R
