5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that <b>mismatched</b> impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E

30|$|Field-of-study <b>mismatch</b> {{occurs when}} a worker, trained in a {{particular}} field, works in another field (e.g. a worker trained in the law, business and social sciences field works in the service sector, or, as Sloane (2003) illustrates, that of an English major working as a statistician). Conceptually and empirically, field-of-study <b>mismatch</b> is distinct from qualifications <b>mismatch</b> in that a worker may be matched to the job {{in terms of the}} quantity of schooling received (qualification match) but not by the type of schooling received (Sloane 2003; Robst 2008; Quintini 2011 a). Seen this way, field-of-study <b>mismatch</b> is a form of horizontal <b>mismatch</b> while qualification <b>mismatch</b> is a form of vertical <b>mismatch</b> (Verhaest et al. 2013). In studying field-of-study <b>mismatch,</b> the literature has generally ignored how skill supply and skill demand dynamics influence <b>mismatch</b> and the relationship between horizontal and vertical <b>mismatch</b> in the wage penalty associated with field-of-study <b>mismatch.</b> Using the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC), an internationally comparable survey of adult skills, this paper addresses both gaps and updates cross-national estimates of field-of-study and qualification <b>mismatch.</b>|$|R

5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the <b>mismatched</b> nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E

40|$|The skills <b>mismatch</b> {{and spatial}} <b>mismatch</b> {{perspectives}} are often presented as competing {{explanations of the}} spatial distribution of unemployment within metropolitan areas. This paper argues that the spatial <b>mismatch</b> hypothesis addresses some of the shortcomings of the skills <b>mismatch</b> perspective, while not denying the importance of skills <b>mismatch.</b> The development of the spatial <b>mismatch</b> hypothesis in the US is traced, before considering its relevance in the British context. A framework in which to conceptualise and reconcile skills <b>mismatch</b> and spatial <b>mismatch</b> within metropolitan areas is developed, incorporating the operation of local housing and labour markets {{as well as the}} role of commuting. The paper concludes by arguing that skills and spatial <b>mismatches</b> reinforce each other and that the concept of employability offers some potential to help understand how job searchers and employers make decisions in situations of skills and/or spatial <b>mismatch.</b> The implications for future research are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Six {{different}} base-pair transversion <b>mismatches</b> are repaired {{with different}} efficiencies in an in vitro <b>mismatch</b> repair system. In particular, the T/T and C/C <b>mismatches</b> {{appear to be}} less efficiently repaired than the A/A and G/G <b>mismatches.</b> Four A/G and four C/T <b>mismatches</b> at different positions are repaired to different extents. One of the A/G <b>mismatches</b> is repaired equally efficiently when DNA heteroduplexes are fully methylated or hemi-methylated at the d(GATC) sequences. This type of <b>mismatch</b> repair appears to be unidirectional with A to C conversion by acting at A/G mispairs to restore the C/G pairs. This methylation-independent correction is not controlled by the mutH, mutL, mutS, uvrE, uvrB, phr, recA, recF, and recJ gene products. The independence of the transversion <b>mismatch</b> repair of these genes and methylation distinguishes this from the known <b>mismatch</b> repair pathways...|$|R
5|$|Tchaikovsky {{lived as}} a {{bachelor}} {{for most of}} his life. In 1868 he met Belgian soprano Désirée Artôt. They became infatuated with each other and were engaged to be married but due to Artôt's refusal to give up the stage or settle in Russia, the relationship ended. Tchaikovsky later claimed she was the only woman he ever loved. In 1877, at the age of 37, he wed a former student, Antonina Miliukova. The marriage was a disaster. <b>Mismatched</b> psychologically and sexually, the couple lived together for only {{two and a half months}} before Tchaikovsky left, overwrought emotionally and suffering from an acute writer's block. Tchaikovsky's family remained supportive of him during this crisis and throughout his life. He was also aided by Nadezhda von Meck, the widow of a railway magnate who had begun contact with him not long before the marriage. As well as an important friend and emotional support, she became his patroness for the next 13 years, which allowed him to focus exclusively on composition. Tchaikovsky's marital debacle may have forced him to face the full truth about his sexuality; he never blamed Antonina for the failure of their marriage.|$|E

But while there, Homer sees a do it yourself barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work. Homer tries to install the pit, but bungles the job when he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement. He frantically tries to assemble the barbecue pit before the cement hardens, but only makes things worse. In the end, Homer is left with a <b>mismatched</b> collection of parts stuck in hardened cement, which angers him. He vents his rage on the construct, mangling it further. Later, Homer takes the results of his work back to the store for a refund, which he does not receive. On the way home, Homer loses control of the wagon containing the jumbled mess of concrete and bricks. It rolls down the highway and crashes into a woman's car, wrecking it. Homer flees the scene of the accident, but the woman tracks him down.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a methodology to characterize and model BJT’s <b>mismatch</b> behavior for RFIC design. A measurement technique {{based on the}} conventional S-parameter measurement is developed to measure the <b>mismatch</b> behavior at high frequencies (HFs). First, besides the typical de-embedding, the bondpad <b>mismatch</b> is subtracted statistically from the capacitance <b>mismatch</b> measurement. Second, a semi-empirical methodology using physical parameters, such as window CD and vertical doping, is developed to model the measured AC <b>mismatch</b> behavior for transistors of different size. Finally, a systematic procedure is proposed to extract the <b>mismatch</b> parameters, {{which can be used}} in the SPICE Monte-Carlo <b>mismatch</b> simulation. The proposed <b>mismatch</b> modeling methodology is validated on an industrial 0. 35 m RF BiCMOS process. The proposed model fits the <b>mismatch</b> characteristics of the key AC parameters, such as CBE, CBC, and fT at different current densities. The model also scales well with geometry for the transistors with sizes useful for RFIC application. Index Terms — Bipolar modeling, <b>mismatch</b> modeling, RF circuit design...|$|R

We used data from the 'AX 200 for ischemic stroke' trial (AXIS 2 study NCT 00927836). We studied the association between the presence of the DWI/FLAIR and PWI/DWI <b>mismatch,</b> baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), age, ischemic-core volume, gender, intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and perfusion-mismatch volume in univariate analysis. Significant variables (P< 0. 05) were added into the final multivariate model. We analyzed 197 patients. Seventy-two (37 %) had both the PWI/DWI and the DWI/FLAIR <b>mismatch.</b> Patients with the double <b>mismatch</b> pattern had a shorter LTM than patients with the PWI/DWI <b>mismatch</b> alone (Median difference 90 [*]minutes, P< 0. 01). Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent association between the two <b>mismatch</b> patterns (odds ratio (OR) 2. 6, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 2 to 5. 4).

40|$|Eukaryotic cells possess several {{distinct}} <b>mismatch</b> repair pathways. A <b>mismatch</b> can {{be introduced}} in retroviral double-stranded DNA by a pre-existing mutation within the primer binding site (PBS) of the viral RNA genome. In order to evaluate <b>mismatch</b> repair of retroviral double-stranded DNA, Moloney leukemia virus (MLV) -based vectors with a mutation in their PBS {{were used to}} infect <b>mismatch</b> repair-competent as well as <b>mismatch</b> repair-deficient cell lines. If the target cells were capable of repairing the <b>mismatch</b> before an infected cell divided, the <b>mismatch</b> within the PBS could be repaired to the wild-type or mutant PBS. If the target cells were unable to repair the <b>mismatch,</b> half the cells in the colony should contain the mutant PBS while the other half should contain the wild-type PBS. To evaluate these predictions, individual colonies were isolated and analyzed by PCR. Almost all mismatch-deficient cell colonies analyzed (cell lines HCT 116 and PMS 2 –/–) contained both the wild-type and mutated PBS, therefore, <b>mismatches</b> within retroviral double-strand DNA could not be repaired by the mismatch-deficient cells. In contrast, <b>mismatches</b> in ~ 25 % of the <b>mismatch</b> repair-competent cell clones analyzed (cell lines HeLa and PMS 2 +/+) were repaired, while 75 % were not.

In the system, several channel ADCs operate at interleaved sampling times as if they were effectively a single ADC operating at a much higher sampling rate. However, <b>mismatches</b> such as offset, gain <b>mismatches</b> among channel ADCs as well as timing skew of the clocks distributed to them degrade S/N of the ADC system as a whole. This paper analyzes the channel <b>mismatch</b> effects in the time-interleaved ADC system.
