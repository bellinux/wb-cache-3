5000|$|Most {{insurers}} {{around the}} world have introduced some form of <b>merit-rating</b> in automobile third party liability insurance. Such systems penalize at-fault accidents by premium surcharges and rewards claim-free years by discounts, commonly known as a [...] "no-claims discount".|$|E
40|$|Throughout the United States it {{is common}} {{practice}} for automobile insurance premiums for a particular policy to vary depending upon the driver class and geographic location of the policyholder {{as well as the}} type and number of vehicles covered by the policy. In addition, most states also permit so-called "merit rating" plans whereby each policyholder's annual premium is adjusted up or down depending upon the insured's claims experience and traffice violation record during previous years. Although these merit rating plans may be viewed as a special type of risk classification, the rationale underlying their use {{is quite different from the}} justification for driver class and territory differentials. This paper develops a methodology for evaluating merit rating plans that are used in conjunction with other risk classification criteria. A theoretically equitable merit rating plan is designed and compared with plans commonly used throughout the country. The differences are striking, especially among high risk classes. For example, most typical merit rating plans overcharge good drivers in high risk classes [...] often by more than 25 %. 1. 0 The Purpose of <b>Merit-Rating</b> The popular rational behind <b>merit-rating</b> is straightforward: <b>Merit-Rating</b> keeps "good" drivers from subsidizing "bad" drivers and, because having any accident or traffic violation means higher rates, it promotes safe driving an...|$|E
40|$|The {{automobile}} {{third party}} insurance <b>merit-rating</b> systems of 22 countries are simulated and compared, using as main tools the stationary average premium level, the variability of the policyholders ' payments, their elasticity with respect o the claim frequency, and {{the magnitude of the}} hunger for bonus. Principal components analysis is used to define an "Index of Toughness " for all systems ~. I...|$|E
40|$|In 1971 all the Belgian {{companies}} {{introduced in}} automobile third party liability a compulsory <b>merit-rating</b> system. From {{the very first}} years of application, {{it appeared that the}} system was not well balanced, since the average collected premium constantly decreased, when the effects of inflation were removed. In 1976, for instance, a large company distributed 315 millions B. F. in bonus discounts, and collected only 2 millions of malus increases, so that the average reduction of the premium reached 27. 9...|$|E
40|$|Mixed Poisson {{distributions}} {{are widely}} used for modeling claim counts when the portfolio {{is thought to be}} heterogeneous. The risk (or mixing) distribution then represents a measure of this heterogeneity. The aim {{of this paper is to}} use a variant of the Patilea and Rolin [15] smoothed version of the Simar [20] Non-Parametric Maximum Likelihood Estimator of the risk distribution in the mixed Poisson model. Empirical results based on two data sets from automobile third-party liability insurance demonstrate the relevance of this approach. The design of <b>merit-rating</b> schemes is discussed in the second part of the paper. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors would like to thank the CAS review team for helpful comments and suggestions.
