50|$|AGARD-B is a {{standard}} wind tunnel model (calibration model) {{that is used to}} verify, by comparison of test results with previously published data, the <b>measurement</b> <b>chain</b> in a wind tunnel.Together with its derivative AGARD-C it belongs to a family of AGARD standard wind tunnel models. Its origin dates to the year 1952, and the Second Meeting of the AGARD Wind Tunnel and Model Testing Panel in Rome, Italy, when it was decided to define two standard wind tunnel model configurations (AGARD-A and AGARD-B) to be used for exchange of test data and comparison of test results of same models tested in different wind tunnels. The idea was to establish standards of comparison between wind tunnels and improve the validity of wind tunnel tests. Among the standard wind tunnel models, AGARD model configuration B (AGARD-B) has become by far the most popular. Initially intended for the supersonic wind tunnels, the AGARD-B configuration has since been tested in many wind tunnels at a wide range of Mach numbers, from low subsonic (Mach 0.1), through transonic (Mach 0.7 to 1.4) to hypersonic (Mach 8 and above). Therefore, a considerable database of test results is available.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical analysis of error calculations during a system design. A system {{is understood as}} a <b>measurement</b> <b>chain</b> that consists of units called transducers. In general, transducers are connected in three basic configurations; serial, parallel and with feedback. In order to illustrate the analysis of error calculations we consider only two connected units for each configuration of a <b>measurement</b> <b>chain.</b> In this paper, we analyze two types of error calculations for these three basic configurations. First, a standard error calculation is described assuming that transducer errors in a <b>measurement</b> <b>chain</b> are mutually correlated. System designers frequently assume an error correlation and therefore use standard error calculations. Second, error calculations are performed assuming that transducer errors are not mutually correlated. The case of mutually uncorrelated transducer errors is very common {{in a real system}} design since the numerical specifications of individual transducers are obtained from multiple independent catalogs. Thus, it is the uncorrelated nature of transducer errors that requires a modification of standard error calculations. We analyze error calculations for each configuration of transducers and for mutually correlated and uncorrelated transducer errors. In conclusion, the error formulas assuming mutually uncorrelated transducer errors model a real system design more accurately than the standard error formulas...|$|E

40|$|This MSc thesis {{belongs to}} a bigger project named ARH- 700 "Basistechnologien für Thermische Strömungsmaschinen". As purpose, this project pretends to lay the {{theoretical}} and experimental foundations of thermal turbomachinery {{in order to have}} a reference point of knowledge and know-how for future investigations on this topic. Despite the huge range of thermal turbomachinery, two restrictions were established as starting point: Output power around 1 kW and high rotational speed. Combining those restrictions plus the fact that compressor wheel velocity should not exceed 500 m/s, optimum wheel diameter range became then similar to automotive turbochargers specifications. Particularly, the contribution of this thesis to the main project is the development of a rotordynamic <b>measurement</b> <b>chain</b> and an analysis interface. Indeed, the reason for building a new <b>measurement</b> <b>chain</b> lays on the need of a faster measurement system for rotordynamic tests to be adapted on a cold-gas test bench (meaning cold, a temperature up to 250 °C). This test bench has already an embedded acquisition system, which is fast enough for thermodynamic purposes but not for rotordynamic tests. Then, the new system should be built and integrated so both systems could work concurrently complementing each other. Aside, both systems should also be able to work independently. The departure point of the thesis starts with the configuration of an acquisition system, adaptation and calibration of sensors, and the implementation of measuring sequences. Also a graphic user interface (GUI) based on Matlab® is developed. This GUI is able to manage the real-time acquisition, data postprocessing and evaluation of the results. Once those points are completed, the measurement is validated by testing a serial production turbocharger. After the validation, rotordynamic analyses are carried out on the ARH- 700 project prototypes. Unfortunately, the manufacturing of the first prototype was delayed and therefore its rotordynamic analysis runs out of this thesis timeframe. However, its adaptation and balancing could be carried out and are included as Appendices. Then, the thesis experimental part is focused on the validation of the <b>measurement</b> <b>chain</b> and on a deep rotordynamic analysis of the automotive turbocharger. Nevertheless, a failure on the turbocharger during a thermodynamical test made impossible to continue the tests. Hence, the experimental part is finally dedicated to compare the rotordynamic response between a fully operational turbocharger and a damaged on, while validating the <b>measurement</b> <b>chain</b> in the process. Simultaneously, some complementary simulations of linear rotordynamics with a simple model are carried out with otordynamikberechnungsprogramm”, calculation software for rotors. This report is structured in five main blocks. Firstly, a summary of the rotordynamic and signal processing theoretical background required for the development of the thesis and the understanding of the analysed data. Secondly, the <b>measurement</b> <b>chain</b> is described in detail stage by stage mentioning all the devices involved. Thirdly, simulations are carried on following a simple rotordynamic model. Fourthly, experimental tests configuration and conduction are explained, as well as the obtained results.

Experimental results highlighted a standard instrumental uncertainty (including the nonlinearity) lower than 5 % with the single frequency calibration procedure, such a value was reduced to 2 %.

Optically based measurements {{are among the most}} common technologies throughout modern industrial instrumentation architectures. However, operating nuclear power plant <b>measurement</b> <b>chains</b> are almost totally devoid of optical technologies. Because optically based transduction and signal transmission have significant advantages over conventional technologies, future reactors will almost certainly employ optically based sensors. The focus of the current project has been on demonstrating a representative optically based measurement in a near-core environment. Conceptually the new sensor consists of a scintillator and neutron converter assembly located at the distal end of a light guide whose proximal end is located in a benign environment. The scintillator and neutron converter assembly consists of a uranium layer placed against a thick (few microns) scintillator layer. The fission fragments resulting from neutron interactions in the uranium produce light in the scintillator. Simultaneously the temperature of the scintillator results in blackbody type photon emissions. The light from the sensor is guided out from the reactor core region using a hollow-core optical wave guide. The temporal and wavelength characteristics of the light emerging from the wave guide are measured and used to determine the temperature of the scintillator and the neutron flux incident upon the uranium layer. 1...|$|R
