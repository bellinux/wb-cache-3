[...] Chester Bennington, the lead vocalist of the {{alternative}} rock band Linkin Park, has {{a role in the}} film playing Evan, a white power skinhead. Bennington met with an acting coach to prepare for his role. He said, [...] "It was actually a little more difficult than I expected because it took a lot for me {{to figure out how to}} portray this guy and what exactly his motives were going to be throughout. I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> overthinking it, and I met with this really great acting coach who helped me walk through and make sense of the, 'Motivation' [...] ". Devon Bostick was offered to reprise his role as Brent from Saw VI, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Hole in November 1999, Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for D'arcy Wretzky in The Smashing Pumpkins in early 2000. Auf der Maur toured {{with the band}} for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina/The Machines of God (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one {{of the reasons why}} I took 2001 off is I didn't even know what I was going to do with music. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know if I was going to make my own record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." [...] Among the demos was [...] "Real a Lie", a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand, that was released as a single by the duo's former band Tinker in 1994. Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album [...] "happened very naturally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Campese further wrote that, [...] "In the World Cup {{match against}} South Africa, I kicked the ball {{three or four}} times when I could have run. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> worried my speed was going, and that was {{affecting}} my confidence, especially to counterattack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want {{to appear}} a hustler," [...] I said, [...] "and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> mistaken in the actual time, but it feels to me like hours since I asked you how the {{catastrophe}} really occurred." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> {{sorry if}} <b>I</b> have talked too much," [...] he said. [...] "I forgot that you, perhaps, are tired. You {{have met with}} disappointments, <b>maybe.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorry. <b>I</b> will read now and not disturb you." ...|$|R

2500|$|Guthrie {{received}} religious {{training for}} his bar mitzvah from Rabbi Meir Kahane, {{who would go}} on to form the Jewish Defense League. [...] "Rabbi Kahane was a really nice, patient teacher," [...] Guthrie later recalled, [...] "but shortly after he started giving me my lessons, he started going haywire. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> responsible." [...] Guthrie converted to Catholicism in 1977, before embracing interfaith beliefs later in his life.|$|E
2500|$|Shanahan {{became a}} free agent {{following}} the 2005–06 season and subsequently signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the New York Rangers. After completing a successful nine-year stay in Detroit, he {{expressed a desire to}} move on in his NHL career, stating, [...] "It really came down to an instinct I had. Detroit has a great past and a great future ahead of them as well, but I guess I just felt that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> identified with the past {{a little bit more than}} the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} in The New Yorker, Adelman said of Rumsfeld, a friend and {{associate}} of 36 years: “How could this happen to someone so good, so competent? This war made me doubt the past. Was I wrong all those years, or was he just better back then? The Donald Rumsfeld of today is not the Donald Rumsfeld I knew, but <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong about the old Donald Rumsfeld. It’s a terrible way to end a career. It’s hard to remember, but he was once the future.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{to blame}} for that," [...] {{answered}} Grace. [...] "I told Ada all about our proposed trip, and said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sorry that she couldn't go with us. You must remember she treated me very nicely while {{we were at the}} seminary, especially after Dora and Nellie left." ...|$|R
6000|$|He chuckled. [...] "Sister, you can't {{get away}} with it. I'm onto you. You {{consider}} me a big bluff. Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> But so are you, my dear--and pretty enough so that I'd try {{to make love to}} you, if I weren't afraid you'd slap me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ogre {{has said}} that Skinny Puppy acted as an escape for Key, who wished to {{distance}} himself from Images in Vogue: [...] "He was looking for something to break out of , and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> it". Key would continue to drum for Images in Vogue until the group relocated to Toronto in 1985. Key's concept behind Skinny Puppy came from the group's first song ever recorded, [...] "K-9". The idea, according to Key, was to create music which explored [...] "life as seen through a dog's eyes". Skinny Puppy also incorporated the use of [...] "B-grade horror movie visuals", including fake blood and props, into their live performances. Key justified these [...] "shock gore" [...] antics with the following: ...|$|E

5000|$|The surrealist painter favours {{a utopian}} New Zealand: [...] "Most of my art {{is related to}} the ecology of the world," [...] Summerton says. [...] "I'm not a hippy, greenie painter who rants on, but <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an environmentalist. New Zealand is a bit of an oasis like that and I've had that theme running through my work for a while." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{her first}} {{official}} day as co-host, October 11, 1976, after being welcomed by then host Tom Brokaw, Pauley said: [...] "Every story I’ve seen begins {{by noting that}} {{a year and a}} half ago Jane Pauley was a second string news reader in Indianapolis.

6000|$|... "I've been thinking," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{a little}} rude just now. I should like, {{if you will}} let me, to explain. I think, when you have heard my story, you will understand, and forgive me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Manson has {{commented on}} the subject of children, saying that she [...] "just missed the whole baby calling. I feel a lot of women think you're a freak if you feel like that, and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> strange but <b>I</b> never got that feeling.

5000|$|In {{his book}} Living in the End Times, Žižek {{suggests}} that the criticism of his positions is itself ambiguous and multilateral: ... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> attacked for being anti-Semitic and for spreading Zionist lies, for being a covert Slovene nationalist and unpatriotic traitor to my nation, for being a crypto-Stalinist defending terror and for spreading Bourgeois lies about Communism... so <b>maybe,</b> just <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> on right path, the path of fidelity to freedom." ...|$|R
