40|$|By using industrialized building, pre-installed modules can be {{delivered}} to the construction site where they are easily mounted. This method has many advantages compared to on-site manufacturing, for example, the precision during the production process should be much higher than building each wall and floor on site. Furthermore, the quick erection procedure when using prefabricated elements and the possibility to use weather protection {{has the advantage of}} not being dependent on weather conditions, and many other factors. Masonite Beams AB is a Swedish company (a member of the Norwegian company, Byggma ASA) with a relatively new technology using light weight beams as bearing elements in the walls and a certain stiff board lamella slap which is mounted {{on the top of the}} floor structure creating an integrated stiff beam / board floor structure. The elements are flat which make it much easier to transport the elements from the factory to the building site where the building parts are easily mounted with special <b>mounting</b> <b>stud.</b> One of the main drawbacks of lightweight structure is the sound transmission.

50|$|Another {{problem with}} the {{cylinder}} heads was the arrangement of cylinder head fixing studs, half of which were vertical {{and the other half}} at an angle. The angled studs when heated and cooled, expanded and contracted at a different rate to the alloy heads, causing sideways forces which caused premature failure of the cylinder head gaskets. Anecdotally this arrangement was to reduce production costs as the cylinder head <b>mounting</b> <b>studs</b> and bolt were all accessible with the rocker covers fitted. This allowed the factory to completely assemble the cylinder head assembly before fitting to the engine. However this was not possible in the end due to the cam chain fitting and setting of the cam timing requiring the removal of the rocker covers.|$|R

40|$|Instrumentation {{difficulties}} {{encountered in}} the previous reporting period were addressed early in this reporting period, resulting in a new instrumentation configuration {{that appears to be}} free of the noise issues found previously.

40|$|Bilateral lesions of {{the medial}} preoptic/anterior {{hypothalamic}} area and olfactory bulbectomies were performed sequentially in sexually active male cats, with {{the order of}} operations balanced. Male sexual behavior was virtually eliminated by the combined operations in all cats. Increased levels of female preceptive behavior were seen following either type of lesion alone, and combined operations resulted in increased levels of receptivity. The results support the concept that there exists, within the brains of male animals, the neural basis for the display of female as well as male sexual responses and that certain brain operations may potentiate the display of female responses. However, {{it does not appear}} that the reduction of male behavior is necessarily coupled with an increase in female behavior since no correlation was seen between the degree of enhancement of female behavior and the decrement in male behavior. Sexual responses typical of the opposite sex are on occasion displayed by both male and female animals. This phenomenon is most extensively documented in rats.

50|$|In 1859, a {{completely}} new sword pattern was introduced for Marine Corps officers, who were instructed to wear the same sword then worn by Army foot officers since 1850. Also, in 1859 a similar sword was authorized for wear by Marine NCOs so that the swords worn by Marine officers and NCOs appeared to share very nearly the same pattern and characteristics. The Marine NCO version, though similar to that worn by Marine officers, had several differences. Among the most noticeable, NCO swords had plain brass hilts and scabbard mounts, whereas officers’ hilts and scabbard mounts normally were gilt. Also, the grips on NCO swords were wrapped with leather, whereas those for officers were usually covered with sharkskin. Finally, NCO scabbards had only two scabbard mounts, consisting of a top <b>mount</b> with frog <b>stud</b> and a scabbard tip, whereas officers’ scabbards bore three mounts, including upper and middle mounts fitted with carrying rings.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark IV {{differed}} from the W-series engine was in {{the placement of the}} valves and the shape of the combustion chambers. Gone was the chamber-in-block design of the W-series engine (which caused the power curve to drastically dip above 6500 RPM), and in its place was a more conventional wedge chamber in the cylinder head, which was now attached to a conventional 90 degree deck. The valves continued to use the displaced arrangement of the W-series engine, but were also inclined so that they would open away from the combustion chamber and cylinder walls, a design feature made possible by Chevrolet's <b>stud</b> <b>mounted</b> rocker arms. This alteration in valve placement resulted in a significant improvement in volumetric efficiency at high RPM and a substantial increase in power output at racing speeds. Owing to the appearance of the compound angularity of the valves, the automotive press dubbed the engine the [...] "porcupine" [...] design.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For {{diadromous}} anguilliform fish, such as eel (Anguilla spp.) and lamprey (Petromyzon spp. and Lampetra spp.), conventional fishways function poorly. Often this is {{a reflection}} of their alternate life history strategies and/or poor swimming performance in comparison to subcaragiform species, for which fishways are more frequently designed. Unique behavioural strategies adopted by anguilliform fish during upstream migration (such as climbing) provide an opportunity for the development of novel, species specific solutions. For eel, synthetic bristle board passes have been developed and widely implemented. More recently, boss or studded substrates (commonly referred to as eel or lamprey tiles in the UK) have been installed oriented either horizontally (with upward facing studs) or vertically (and side <b>mounted</b> with <b>studs</b> facing the channel wall) at numerous low-head barriers. Despite implementation in the field, here we will present results from the first controlled study on the efficiency of eel/lamprey tiles. Using a large open channel flume we were able to quantify passage success, passage efficiency and observe the behaviour of yellow phase European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and upstream migrant adult river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) as they encountered a model crump weir. The weir was either unmodified or modified with horizontally or vertically oriented tiles. The addition of the tiles improved passage; however efficiencies remained low in some instances, particularly for lamprey. Potential causes for poor passage are discussed, as is the need for further research on design optimisation, which if conducted may enable eel/lamprey tiles to significantly improve the connectivity of rivers fragmented by anthropogenic barriers...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a study of more than 500 bronzes, {{described}} in a Catalogue, and mostly illustrated, of the late pre-Roman Iron Age from England and Wales south of Lancashire and Yorkshire. The classes of objects studied comprise: presumed and probable vehicle-fittings and horse-harness, weaponry, mirrors, vessels, 'spoons', weighing-devices, and miscellaneous other pieces including sheet <b>mounts</b> and ornamental <b>studs.</b> New classifications are proposed, and the presumed functions of the bronzes are discussed.

5000|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{design for the}} 335 series engines is its most definitive aspect. All {{cylinder head}}s were two-valve heads that use large ports with poly-angle or 'canted' valves. [...] This resulted in the intake and exhaust valves being at separate angles. Canting the valves allowed for very large valves to be installed, while reducing the port length and minimizing sharp turns within the port. The end result was a cylinder head that had valves and ports much larger and freer flowing than the Ford Windsor V8s, {{and in some cases}} larger than some of the Ford FE and 385 Series V8s. [...] This same basic cylinder head design was used on the Ford Boss 302 engine, after it was modified to work with the Windsor engine block. [...] Most 335 series engines used stamped rocker arms with cast fulcrums that made for a nonadjustable valve train. Only the Boss 351 and 351 HO had adjustable valve train which had rocker arms <b>mounted</b> on screw-in <b>studs</b> and used guide plates.|$|R

40|$|The use of accelerometers {{to monitor}} the {{vibrations}} of either complex machinery or simple component involves some considerations about the mounting of the sensor to the structure. Different types of mounting solutions are commonly used but in all cases they can be classified {{in one of these}} categories: <b>stud</b> <b>mounting,</b> screw mounting, adhesive mounting, magnetic mounting and probe sensing. Indeed each of them has a specific field of application depending on e. g. the mounting surface conditions, the temperature, the accessibility to the specific mounting point, etc. The choice of the mounting solution has a important effect on the accuracy of the usable frequency response of the accelerometer, since the higher the stiffness of the fixing, the higher the low-pass frequency limit of the mounting. This paper specifically focuses on adhesive mounting of accelerometers, which includes a great number of different products from the temporary adhesives like the beeswax to the permanent ones like cyanoacrylate polymers. Among the variety of commercial adhesives, three specific glues have been experimentally compared to assess their transmissivity and the results are reported in this paper. A two component methylmethacrylate (HBM X 60), a modified silane (Terostat 737) and a cyanoacrylate (Loctite 401) adhesives have been used to joint two aluminium bases, one connected to an accelerometer and the other to the head of electromagnetic shaker.

40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} a {{research}} project that examines flanking sound transmission involving lightweight gypsum board walls using SEA. There are multiple transmission paths between any two gypsum board surfaces coupled by the junction. This is because the gypsum board leaves of a wall are often resiliently <b>mounted</b> to the <b>studs,</b> which forms a cavity and transverse velocity {{is not the same}} {{on either side of the}} wall. Often the assumption is made that power flow occurs along every path independently and the power balance method is applied to estimate the flanking transmission along every path independently. This approach overestimates the power flow along each of the single paths, since their magnitude is a complex function of the wall structure. However, two different approaches of application of the power balance method to estimate the total flanking sound transmission between two rooms from measured surface velocity level differences between two leaves are presented in this paper. One is a common approach that was already applied in earlier work to identify the relative importance of the different paths that might contribute to the overall transmission at the regarded junction. The velocity level difference is measured between the surfaces of the flanking walls that are exposed two the source and receiving room respectively where the first is excited structurally. In the second, the modified measurement approach, the surface velocity of the wall that is not exposed to the source room is measured instead to get some benefit in predicting the structural response of this leaf to airborne excitation in the source room. The results of the methods are compared and the advantages as well as the disadvantages of both methods are discussed...|$|R
