5|$|Several {{proteins}} in the exosome are {{the target of}} autoantibodies in patients with specific autoimmune diseases (especially the PM/Scl overlap syndrome) and some antimetabolic chemotherapies for cancer function by blocking {{the activity of the}} exosome. In addition, mutations in exosome component 3 cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and spinal <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{pathogenic}} mutations {{have been}} identified in the prion-like domains of heterogeneous nuclear riboproteins hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 in familial cases of muscle, brain, bone and <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> degeneration. The wild-type form of all of these proteins show a tendency to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, while the pathogenic mutations exacerbate this behaviour and lead to excess accumulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E
50|$|Muscle {{spindles}} {{consist of}} both sensory <b>neurons</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> {{in order to}} provide proprioception and make the appropriate movements via firing of <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> There are three types of lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> involved in muscle contraction: alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> and beta <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> Alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> the most abundant type, are used in the actual force for muscle contraction and therefore innervate extrafusal muscle fibers (muscle fibers outside of the muscle spindle). Gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> on the other hand, innervate only intrafusal muscle fibers (within the muscle spindle), whereas beta <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> which are present in very low amounts, innervate both intrafusal and extrafusal muscle cells. Beta <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> have a conduction velocity greater than that of both other types of lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> but there is little currently known about beta <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> Alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> are highly abundant and larger in size than gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> (LMNs) are <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> {{located in}} either the {{anterior}} grey column, anterior nerve roots (spinal lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons)</b> or the cranial nerve nuclei of the brainstem and cranial nerves with motor function (cranial nerve lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons).</b> All voluntary movement relies on spinal lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> which innervate skeletal muscle fibers and act as a link between upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> and muscles. Cranial nerve lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> control movements of the eyes, face and tongue, and contribute to chewing, swallowing and vocalization. Damage to the lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> can lead to flaccid paralysis.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{distinguishing}} {{molecular marker}} of gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> is transcription factor Err3. It is expressed {{at high levels}} in gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> but very little in alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> On the other hand, neuronal DNA binding protein NeuN, are present in significantly greater quantities in alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> Osteopontin, a protein also expressed in bones, hence the [...] "osteo-" [...] prefix, is a marker for alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> This in turn can provide scientists a way of eliminating gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> if alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> are of interest. One study in particular made this conclusion {{based on the fact}} that osteopontin was present in larger cell bodies, indicating the alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> as they have larger cell bodies than gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b>|$|R
5|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} {{result in}} progressive damage to {{different parts of}} the brain's function, and worsen with age. Common examples include dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, alcoholic dementia or vascular dementia; Parkinson's disease; and other rarer infectious, genetic, or metabolic causes such as Huntington's disease, <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> diseases, HIV dementia, syphilis-related dementia and Wilson's disease. Neurodegenerative diseases can affect {{different parts of the}} brain, and can affect movement, memory, and cognition.|$|E
5|$|As Leeds manager he was criticised for the {{physical}} and often negative approach of his teams, though the period was noted for its highly physical football across the country. His resignation as England manager fuelled criticism of him as money-obsessed, and unproven allegations of bribery and financial misconduct also tarnished his reputation. He retired in 1984, but was diagnosed with <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> disease in May 1987, which led to his death two years later. He remains a highly popular figure in Leeds, and has a stand named after him at Elland Road {{as well as a}} statue outside the ground.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
50|$|A {{subcortical}} loop exists {{within the}} brain linking upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> {{originating in the}} primary motor and pre-motor cortices and the brainstem, with the basal ganglia. These upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> eventually initiate movement by controlling the activity of lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> located in the brainstem and spinal cord, and project out to innervate the muscles in the body. Upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> also modulate activity of local circuit neurons, whose synapses are a large input to these lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> in turn affecting subsequent movement. Thus, the basal ganglia indirectly influence movement via regulation of {{the activity of the}} upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> which ultimately determine activity of the lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> {{like all}} cells, express {{specific}} genetic markers at birth. Muscle spindle derived GDNF neurotrophic factors {{must also be}} present for postnatal survival. Wnt7A is a secreted signaling molecule selectively in gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> by embryonic day 17.5 of mice. This is the earliest molecule present in gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> that differentiates them from alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> illustrating the divergence of {{these two types of}} lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> {{release a}} neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, from their axon {{terminal}} knobs, which are received by nicotinic receptors of the alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> In turn, alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> relay the stimulus.|$|R
5|$|One {{mechanism}} {{involved in}} recovery is nerve terminal sprouting, in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal sprouts. These sprouts can reinnervate orphaned muscle fibers {{that have been}} denervated by acute polio infection, restoring the fibers' capacity to contract and improving strength. Terminal sprouting may generate a few significantly enlarged motor neurons doing work previously performed {{by as many as}} four or five units: a single <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> that once controlled 200 muscle cells might control 800 to 1000 cells. Other mechanisms that occur during the rehabilitation phase, and contribute to muscle strength restoration, include myofiber hypertrophy—enlargement of muscle fibers through exercise and activity—and transformation of type II muscle fibers to type I muscle fibers.|$|E
5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E
5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health, where {{he served as a}} senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E
25|$|Alpha (α) <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> (also called alpha motoneurons), are large, multipolar lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> of the {{brainstem}} {{and spinal}} cord. They innervate extrafusal muscle fibers of skeletal muscle and are {{directly responsible for}} initiating their contraction. Alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> are distinct from gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> which innervate intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{route of}} nerve signals within the efferent somatic nervous system {{involves}} a sequence that {{begins in the}} upper cell bodies of <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> (upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons)</b> within the precentral gyrus (which approximates the primary motor cortex). Stimuli from the precentral gyrus are transmitted from upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> and down the corticospinal tract, via axons to control skeletal (voluntary) muscles. These stimuli are conveyed from upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> through the ventral horn of the spinal cord, and across synapses to be received by the sensory receptors of alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> (large lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons)</b> of the brainstem and spinal cord.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} expression of β-amyloid protein (AP) and Amyloid precursor protein (APP) in spinal <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> of young adult (3 month old) and aged (26 - 30 month old) rats. The {{total number of}} spinal <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> in the seventh cervical (C 7) spinal segment was also examined in both young adult and aged rats. There was an ~ 21 % (p < 0. 001) {{decrease in the number}} of <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> of the C 7 spinal segment in aged rats compared with young ones. Immunoreactivity (IR) of AP and APP was not observed in spinal <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> of young adult rats. In contrast, ~ 50 % of the spinal <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> of the aged rats were APP positive. Furthermore, extensive immunoreactivity was found in the processes of spinal <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> of aged rats. These results have shown that AP and APP is coincident with the loss of <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> in the spinal cord of aged rats, and might be associated with the degenerative processes of ageing <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the formation of}} topographic maps, Eph/ephrin signaling has been implicated in the proper guidance of <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> axons in the spinal cord. Although several members of Ephs and ephrins contribute to <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> guidance, ephrin-A5 reverse signaling has been shown to {{play a critical role in}} the survival of <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> growth cones and to mediate growth cone migration by initiating repellence in EphA-expressing migrating axons.|$|E
25|$|An alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> and {{the muscle}} fibers it innervates is a motor unit. A <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> pool {{contains}} the cell bodies {{of all the}} alpha motor neurons involved in contracting a single muscle.|$|E
50|$|Subtypes {{of these}} fibers include (GSE): alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> (α) - these target extrafusal muscle fibers, and gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> (γ) that target intrafusal muscle fibers. Beta <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> target {{both types of}} muscle fiber {{and there are two}} types known as static and dynamic.|$|R
25|$|Like other <b>neurons,</b> lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> {{have both}} afferent (incoming) and efferent (outgoing) connections. Alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> receive input {{from a number}} of sources, {{including}} upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> sensory neurons, and interneurons. The primary output of α-MNs is to extrafusal muscle fibers. This afferent and efferent connectivity is required to achieve coordinated muscle activity.|$|R
50|$|Upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> are <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> that {{originate}} {{either in}} the motor region of the cerebral cortex or in the brain stem and carry motor information down to the lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> The main effector or <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> (efferent neurons) for voluntary movement lie within layer V of the primary motor cortex and are a type of giant pyramidal cell called Betz cells.

25|$|Defective {{function}} of the survival of <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> (SMN) protein in snRNP biogenesis, caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene which codes for SMN, {{may account for the}} <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> pathology observed in the genetic disorder spinal muscular atrophy.|$|E
25|$|Over time, people {{experience}} increasing difficulty moving, swallowing (dysphagia), and speaking or forming words (dysarthria). Symptoms of upper <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> involvement include tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called Babinski's sign also indicates upper <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> damage. Symptoms of lower <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles {{that can be}} seen under the skin (fasciculations) although twitching is not a diagnostic symptom and more of a side effect so twitching would either occur after or accompany weakness and atrophy.|$|E
25|$|Polyneuropathy is a {{collection}} of peripheral nerve disorders that often are breed-related in dogs. Polyneuropathy indicates that multiple nerves are involved, unlike mononeuropathy. Polyneuropathy usually involves motor nerve dysfunction, also known as lower <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> disease.|$|E

50|$|Like other <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> α-MNs {{are named}} after the {{properties}} of their axons. Alpha <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> have Aα axons, which are large-caliber, heavily myelinated fibers that conduct action potentials rapidly. By contrast, gamma <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> have Aγ axons, which are slender, lightly myelinated fibers that conduct less rapidly.|$|R
25|$|Upper motor neurons (UMNs) send {{input to}} α-MNs via several pathways, {{including}} (but not limited to) the corticonuclear, corticospinal, and rubrospinal tracts.

40|$|Trophic factor {{deprivation}} induces neuronal {{nitric oxide}} synthase (NOS) and apoptosis of rat embryonic <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> in culture. We report here that <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> constitutively express endothelial NOS that helps support the survival of <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> cultured with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by activating the nitric oxide-dependent soluble guanylate cyclase. Exposure of BDNF-treated <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> to nitro-Larginine methyl ester (L-NAME) decreased cell survival 40 – 50 % 24 hr after plating. Both low steady-state concentrations of exogenous nitric oxide (� 0. 1 �M) and cGMP analogs protected BDNF-treated <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> from death induced by L-NAME.
