40|$|The {{report is}} based on work {{conducted}} in a workshop that was held in Brest, France on 13 – 16 October 2015, and describes the preparatory work {{in response to the}} EC longterm management plans for western EU waters (ICES Subareas V to X). Specifically Art. 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1380 / 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, which requires a multiannual plan including quantifiable target. In this context ICES was requested to provide plausible values around FMSY for some stocks inhabiting western EU waters. Estimates of reference points Blim, Bpa, Flim and Fpa are provided for the stocks considered, and the FMSY ranges [Flower, Fupper] are estimated by ICES to be precautionary, and deliver no more than 5 % reduction in long-term yield compared with MSY. The report provides information on the following stocks: •	Black-bellied anglerfish (Lophius budegassa) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	White-bellied anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	Blue ling (Molva dypterygia) in Subdivision Vb, and Subareas VI and VII •	Cod (Gadus morhua) in Divisions VIIe-k (Celtic Sea cod), Division VIIa (Irish Seand Division VIa (West of Scotland) •	Sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in Divisions IVbc, VIIa, and VIId–h (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, English Channel, and southern North Sea) •	Greenland halibut in Subareas V, VI, XII and XIV •	Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) in Divisions VIIb,c,e-k and Division VIb (Rockall) •	Hake (Merluccius merluccius) in Division IIIa, Subareas IV, VI and VII and Divisions VIIIa,b,d (Northern stock) and in Division VIIIc and IXa (Southern stock) •	<b>Megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> <b>spp)</b> in Divisions IVa and VIa •	Four-spot <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> boscii) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	<b>Megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) in Division VIIe (Western Channel) •	Sole (Solea solea) in Divisions VIIIa,b (Bay of Biscay), Divisions VIIf,g (Celtic Sea, Division VIIe (Western Channel) and Division VIIa (Irish Sea) •	Whiting (Merlangius merlangus) in Division VIIe-k, Division VIIa (Irish Sea) and Division VIa (West of Scotland) •	Nephrops in Division VIa (North Minch, FU 11), Division VIa (South Minch, FU 12),Division VIa (Firth of Clyde + Sound of Jura, FU 13, Division VIIa (Irish Sea East, FU 14), Division VIIa (Irish Sea West, FU 15), Division VIIb,c,j,k (Porcupine Bank, FU 16), Division VIIb (Aran Grounds, FU 17), Division VIIa,g,j (Southeast and West of IRL, FU 19) and the Smalls (FU 22) For stocks where ICES advice is given based on the MSY approach, ICES has developed an advice rule (AR) based on the FMSY fishing mortality reference point, that provides the exploitation rate to give catch advice, and a biomass reference point MSY Btrigge r which is used to linearly reduce F if the biomass in the TAC year is predicted to be lower than this reference value (ICES, 2015).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} a microbial transglutaminase (TGase) on the gelling and viscoelastic properties of a gelatin from <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> boscii) skins. Although TGase extended the setting time of fish gelatin, it was found that melting temperature, gel strength and viscosity in solution at 60 °C were considerably increased by the covalent cross-linking action of the enzyme, as observed by SDS-PAGE and SEM. Increasing concentrations of TGase increased the elasticity and cohesiveness of gelatin gels but reduced gel strength and hardness. Partial inactivation of the enzyme was achieved thermally without negatively affecting the properties of the gelatin; whether or not gelatin is thermoreversible depends essentially on the degree of enzyme inactivation. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

Bootstrap Error and Coeficients of Variation associated to mean discards per trip were obtained and compared with asymptotic estimates. Furthermore, we use the bootstrap to quantify {{the contribution of the}} given sources of variability to global variability, and to assess simulated sampling scenarios differing each others in sampling effort.

The results show that added neutral and oxidized lipids, even at high rancidity levels, do not affect shear resistances measured by the Kramer shear-compression cell in non-formaldehyde forming species such as megrim and sardine, over the frozen storage period. However, in a formaldehyde-forming species such as hake, {{in the presence of}} neutral and oxidized lipids {{at the end of the}} storage period, the values of shear resistances may be lower than in the absence of these lipids, probably owing to formation of less formaldehyde in these cases. Although it is very difficult to estimate the importance of a single compound or group of compounds on texture, these results seem to indicate that formaldehyde is a much more important factor than oxidized lipids in changes of texture in fish. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Total mercury {{concentrations}} were {{measured in the}} muscle {{of different kinds of}} fish: megrim (Lepidor-hombus boscii), common sole (Solea vulgaris), striped mullet (Mullus barbatus), anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius), and black-bellied angler (Lophius budegassa), caught in the South Adriatic Sea (South Italy). The highest total mercury levels were found in anglerfish (0. 61 - 2. 22 mg/kg wet wt, mean 1. 26 +/- 0. 58), followed by black-bellied angler (0. 22 - 1. 62 mg/kg wet wt, 0. 68 +/- 0. 36), megrim (0. 05 - 0. 92 mg/kg wet wt, 0. 39 +/- 0. 30), striped mullet (0. 10 - 0. 63 mg/kg wet wt, 0. 31 +/- 0. 13) and common sole (0. 05 - 0. 44 mg/kg wet wt, 0. 19 +/- 0. 15). According to current regulations, 62. 5 % of anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and 23 % of black-bellied angler (Lophius budegassa) samples showed concentrations exceeding the peak value of 1 mg/kg, while only 25 % of samples of <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> boscii), and 8. 3 % of striped mullet (Mullus barbatus), exceeded the peak value fixed at 0. 5 mg/kg.

40|$|The {{role that}} {{juvenile}} anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) {{play as a}} food resource for the demersal community in the southern Bay of Biscay is assessed using 21 years of anchovy abundance data and demersal predator diets. During the study period, a total of 26 fish and elasmobranch species preyed on anchovy either frequently or occasionally. Predators with a crustacean-based diet targeted the smaller anchovy individuals. The size range of anchovy juveniles (centred at 7. 5 – 8. 9 cm) was {{comparable to that of}} the largest nektonic–benthic crustaceans, but generally smaller than other demersal and pelagic fish prey. Hake (Merluccius merluccius) and <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis) were the predators that consumed the highest number of anchovy, one of the main prey items driving the variability of their diets. Anchovy consumption conformed only partially to the abundance of anchovy in the southern Bay of Biscay, suggesting that factors other than abundance might condition its availability to demersal predators. Prey size could be one of them, as the size of the anchovy preyed on proved to be significantly smaller than the individuals collected with bottom trawls. However, other factors, such as the vertical position of the shoals of anchovy juveniles, could also constrain anchovy availability to demersal predators...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{estimate}} the supply elasticity of the fish regarding the variationsin {{one of the most}} important running costs (fuel cost) for the Galician fleet in the Celtic Sea. The Spanish fleet involved in the Celtic Sea fishing grounds, also known as the _ 300 fleet_, as when Spain joined the EEC it was made up of this number of vessels, presently has 199 vessels (the 70 % of them operate from Galicia). This fleet mainly catches hake (merlucius merlucius), anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius and Lophius budegassa), horse mackerel (trauchurus trauchurus), <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis) and nephrops. Although it is currently possible to associate specific target species with particular fleets, various quantities of hake, anglerfish, megrim and nephrops are taken together, depending on the gear type. A supply function for each species has been estimated as an expression that depends on the price of fish, price of other fish landed by the fleet and the fuel price. The preliminary results indicate that the supply of some species is more elastic regarding the fluctuations in fuel prices than other ones. It could explain the strategy of the fleet for selecting the less elastic stocks to the fuel costs...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} a first approach concerning a novel chilling strategy, which employs {{a mixture of}} different preservative organic acids (ascorbic, citric and lactic) in the icing medium. Thus, ice prepared from water including two different concentrations of a commercial acid mixture-formula (800 and 400 [*]ppm; C- 800 and C- 400 conditions, respectively) were applied as icing system to three important commercial fish lean species (hake, Merluccius merluccius; <b>megrim,</b> <b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis; angler, Lophius piscatorius). Lipid oxidation (peroxide value; thiobarbituric acid index; fluorescent compound formation) and hydrolysis (free fatty acid formation) were evaluated throughout the chilling time (up to 12 – 15 days) and compared to results obtained in fish kept under traditional ice prepared only from water (C- 0 condition); a complementary sensory evaluation was carried out. As a result of employing the C- 800 icing condition, a partial inhibition of lipid oxidation and hydrolysis development was obtained that {{was accompanied by a}} shelf life enhancement in all cases. Further research taking into account the complementary action of the present organic acids is envisaged. According to the lipid damage analysis, lipid hydrolysis was a more relevant event than lipid oxidation in all fish species tested.

40|$|To {{confirm the}} {{consistency}} of the age interpretation by validation studies is essential for providing accurate age estimates to the stock assessment process using age-structured models. The Atlantic Iberian <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis) stock is annually assessed by age-structured models in ICES, and specimens are routinely aged by IEO expert readers for this purpose. A total of 8845 otoliths of this stock were aged from 23 annual groundfish surveys carried out in north and northwestern Iberian waters (ICES Div. VIIIc, IXa) and following internationally standardized protocols. Yearly age-length-keys were built using the respective age estimates and applied to the length distribution of each survey, thus obtaining a matrix of abundance indices by age and year. Similar mean lengths are obtained for each age group along the time series. The annual age estimation of L. whiffiagonis is here indirectly validated by tracking cohort abundance indices in the surveys. Strong and weak cohorts are well tracked along the most of their age classes, and the correlations between age abundance indices are statistically significant up to the age 5, which represent around 94 % {{of the total number of}} this species caught in the surveys. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters for the time-series are estimated (L∞: 56; k: 0. 12; t 0 : - 1. 88) and the results are compared with previous studies...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{preservative}} {{organic acids}} (ascorbic, citric and lactic acids) {{were used to}} prepare a novel organic acid-flake icing system for the chilled preservation of hake (Merluccius merluccius), <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis) and angler (Lophius piscatorius). The icing system was prepared with two different concentrations of a commercial acid mixture-formula containing the three organic acids at 800 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg (C- 800 and C- 400 batches, respectively). Aerobic mesophiles, psychrotrophs, proteolytic bacteria, trimethylamine and pH were evaluated and the results compared with sensory analyses. Significantly (P < 0. 05) lower counts of mesophiles were found for hake and megrim in the C- 800 and C- 400 batches compared with the control batch. In the case of angler, significantly (P < 0. 05) lower counts of mesophiles, psychrotrophs and proteolytic microorganisms (P < 0. 05) were found for fish stored in the C- 800 icing conditions. Both C- 400 and C- 800 megrim batches exhibited significantly (P < 0. 05) lower pH values than the control batch, and this result was also observed in the C- 800 angler batch. Sensory analysis confirmed that the shelf lives of the three fish species in the C- 800 batch were extended. According to the parameters assessed, storage of hake, megrim and angler in the proposed ice system better protects their microbial and sensory qualities.

40|$|Four spot <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> boscii) {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in Atlantic waters form Iceland to Cape Bojador. In ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa, Portuguese and Spanish ships captured this species as by-catch mainly in mixed bottom trawl fisheries. Only one exploitation unit {{of this species}} is assessed (from Divisions VIIIc and IXa) in the ICES Working Group of Hake, Monk and Megrim. Discard data are not used {{in the assessment of}} this species, though they are considered significantly high for younger ages. Discards data are available for Spanish trawlers for 1993, 1994, 1997, and the period from 1999 to 2001. A simulation using discard data was made to avoid the underestimation of mortality and recruitment. Due to the change in January 1990 in the minimum legal size for this species in this area, it was decided not to use historical information previous to this year, as it is supposed that this change could substantially affect the fleet discard pattern. Different options were considered as the way of raising: by effort (number of trips, hour of trawling) or by landings (in weight or in number). Reasons for the final choices are explained for all options considered. The way to introduce discards data in the VPA procedure for assessment was through the catch at age matrix since we considered that no fish of this species survive after being discarded. Differences in yield of Short-term and Mediumterm projections were observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{trophic level}} (TL) mean and variance, {{and the degree}} of omnivory for five Celtic Sea fish predators were {{estimated}} using a database of stomach content records characterized by a high level of taxonomic resolution. The predators occupied a high position in the food web, i. e. 4. 75 for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, 4. 44 for haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, 4. 88 for European hake Merluccius merluccius, 5. 00 for <b>megrim</b> <b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis and 5. 27 for whiting (Merlangius merlangus). The level of taxonomic resolution of the prey did not greatly affect mean TL predator values; an effect on variance was evident, low resolution masking intra-population variability in TL. Generalized additive models were used to explain the variability of predator TL caused by environmental variables (ICES subdivision, season) and predator characteristics (length). Significant year, location, season, and interaction effects were found for some species and with length at the scale of ICES subdivision. The species specific variability of TL could be due to spatio-temporal variations in prey availability and/or in predator selectivity following ontogenetic changes. Omnivorous fish TL was less affected by spatio-temporal variations. In addition, results showed that the omnivory index and TL variability provide dissimilar information on predator feeding strategy. Combining information on TL variability and omnivory allowed us to separate between within-individual and between-individual components contributing to trophic niche width and to identify the type of generalization of fish predators...|$|R

Muscle concentrations of organochlorinated compounds as well as biliary levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkylphenols (APEs) were determined in two different fish species, the four-spotted <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> boscii) and the pouting (Trisopterus luscus) collected along the Northern Iberian coast. Additionally, a set of biochemical markers namely, 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and catalase (CAT) were measured in liver subcellular fractions. Chemical analysis indicated geographical differences in pollutant loads that were further reinforced by biomarker responses. Thus, EROD activity showed a good correlation with the amount of PCBs bioaccumulated in muscle tissue of both fish species. Elevated UGT activity was observed in those individuals highly exposed to APEs and 1 -naphthol.

For it, two different concentrations of this brown macroalga extract (0. 67 and 2. 50 g lyophilized alga L- 1 aqueous solution; B- 1 and B- 2 batches, respectively) were tested for a 14 -day storage. The effect of the alga extract was compared with a counterpart batch stored in traditional ice prepared only from water (B- 0 batch). Significant (p < 0. 05) inhibitions of microbial activity (aerobes, psychrotrophs, lipolytic bacteria, proteolytic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae) as well as of pH and trimethylamine formation were observed {{as a result of the}} incorporation of the alga extract in the icing medium, being this effect especially relevant in the B- 2 batch. Concerning lipid damage development, a significantly (p < 0. 05) lower formation of free fatty acids (lipid hydrolysis development) and of fluorescent compounds (tertiary lipid oxidation development) in samples corresponding to both alga-including batches could also be observed; this inhibitory effect was more intense in fish belonging to the B- 2 batch.

40|$|The {{sex ratio}} in the catches of <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis, Walbaum) varied {{systematically}} with depth on three independent trawl survey series off {{the west coast}} of Ireland. Female megrim dominated the shallow catches, while males were more common in catches from deeper waters. The size difference between the sexes alone cannot explain this pattern because it remained evident when fish length was taken into account. Therefore size-specific habitat preferences or size-selective fishing mortality cannot fully explain the observed trend in the sex ratio of megrim. Female megrim grow to a larger size, at a faster rate than males and it is likely that their differences in habitat preferences are related to this. Shallower waters are warmer during the growing season and are likely to provide better conditions for fast growth. An understanding of the mechanisms behind these patterns is an important consideration in the management and conservation of this fish stock, which might be particularly vulnerable because the commercial landings are to a large extent dominated by female megrimNOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Journal of Sea Research.

40|$|Fisheries {{surveys are}} widely used in the stock {{assessment}} process by providing time series of relative abundance and recruitment strength. Surveys also provide biological data that {{have the potential to}} improve stock projections by providing alternatives to the use of spawning stock biomass as a measure of stock reproductive potential. The objective of the present work is to illustrate various sources of error in survey data, using examples from bottom trawl surveys and to provide innovative methods for identifying and minimising these errors. In Chapter 1, the current work is framed within the existing literature and an overview is given of the different sources of error. The next six chapters consist of papers that have been published, are in press, or under review with peer-reviewed journals. These papers consist of case-studies, each exploring a different source of error. In Chapter 2, a method for summarising the precision of a length-frequency distribution is presented and recommendations are given on the sample sizes required to achieve a particlar precision level. In Chapter 3, the variability in the assignment of maturity stages of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa, L.) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus, L.) is examined, using statistical techniques developed in the social sciences. In Chapter 4, the spatial variability in the age-length structure of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus, L.) is explored and a new method for comparing age-length keys is developed. In Chapter 5, the spatial structure in the length-weight relationships of whiting and haddock are analysed using geostatistical tools. In Chapter 6, the spatial trend in the sex ratio of <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis, Walbaum) is explored using generalized additive modelling techniques. In Chapter 7, spatial trends in the proportion of mature cod (Gadus morhua, L.) are investigated. In the concluding Chapter 8, the scale of various errors is reviewed {{in the light of the}} current work and recommendations for sampling design are proposed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} the possible standardization of the cpue of the Vigo-Marín trawl fleet operating in ICES Division VII for its potential use as an abundance index for the assessments of the stocks of <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis) and anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa) in ICES Divisions VIIb–k and VIIIabd, a series of preliminary analyses were conducted on data collected on both landings and discards historic time-series. This document complements the work conducted in Fernández et al. (2008). Updated information through to 2010 is now available, which is taken into consideration. At the same time, the present document considers the main species caught by this fleet (L. whiffiagonis, L. boscii, L. budegassa, L. piscatorius, Merluccius merluccius and Nephrops norvegicus) {{in order to try}} to ascertain whether possible changes in the directionality of the fleet may have occurred over time. There does not seem to be a clear change in species composition through the time-series analysed (1986 – 2010) but an increase in cpue for most species could be observed in approximately the last decade. Qualitative information from the fishing industry confirms that cpues have increased in the last decade and notes the fact that this fleet was substantially renovated during the 1990 s, which may well have led to an increase in its efficiency. For megrim (L. whiffiagonis), the information examined by Fernández et al. (2008) and further extensions considered in this work suggests that the strong increase in cpue from 1999 onwards is more likely due to the technological improvement mentioned above rather than to a strong increase in stock abundance. Thus, the recommendation made by Fernández et al. (2008) that if this cpue series were to be used for tuning the megrim assessment, it should better be split in two periods, one covering from 1984 to 1998 and another one from 1999 onwards, still seems appropriate...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 4, 964 common <b>megrim</b> <b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis, were {{examined}} from commercial catches in Divisions VII b^, off {{the west coast}} of Ireland, between April 1997 and February 2001. A sex ratio of 31. 8 : 1 females to males was recorded, with a higher percentage (15 %) of fish being male at lengths 45 cm TL. The largest and oldest fish recorded was a 51. 3 cm TL female, aged 16 years and weighing 1012. 61 g. The smallest was a 15. 1 cm TL female, weighing just 18. 24 g. Females ranged in age from 2 - 16 years old, while the male age range was considerably smaller, that of 3 - 8 years old. Age at recruitment (tr) was determined to be at age 6 years of age for both female and male fish. Values of 0. 91 and 1. 43 were recorded for total mortality (Z) for female and male respectively. Three different growth models were used to describe the most accurate growth rates for the fish. Average values of 50. 72 cm for Loo, 0. 097 for K and - 4. 78 for to were recorded for female fish, while Leo = 41. 59 cm, K = 0. 138 and to = - 3. 062 were determined for males. Yield per recruit curves revealed that optimum yield occurred at a fishing mortality (F) of 1. 2 and 1. 4 for female and male megrim respectively. Five maturity stages were recorded for the species. Fecundity ranged from 26, 522 - 640, 523 oocytes. Megrim were determined to be total spawners, spawning once annually between January and early March. Estimates of 24. 0 cm TL and 25. 0 cm TL for Lso»/» were calculated for female and male histologically determined maturity at length. Maturity at age estimates for A 50 «/o of 2 years and 2. 5 years were recorded for female male fish respectively. An overall mean prevalence of atresia (Pa) of 63. 5 %, and relative intensity of atresia (la) of 24. 2 % was determined...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the potential {{role of the}} crinoid Leptometra phalangium {{as an indicator of}} highly productive areas along the shelf break that can sustain large biomasses of benthopelagic fish and recruits. The structure of fish assemblages in the central Mediterranean Sea (central-western coast of Italy), analysed on the basis of surveys carried out in summer and autumn from 1997 to 2001, revealed the presence of a well-defined group of species on the shelf break. This area, occurring at a depth of between 120 and 170 m, is characterised by detritic organogenic sediments colonised by the crinoid L. phalangium, a suspension-feeding macro-epibenthic species confined in the Mediterranean to the shelf-break area. Its abundance in the studied area can reach 12 - 15 ind. m(- 2). A total of 121 species belonging to 66 families of demersal organisms (crustacean decapods and stomatopods, cephalopods, selaceens and teleosteens) were caught at shelf-break stations from September to October. The species which typified the assemblage were the fishes Trisopterus minutus capelanus, Merluccius merluccius, Glossanodon leioglossus, Argentina sphyraena, Capros aper, Macroramphos scolopax and Lepidotrigla cavillone, the crustacean decapod Parapenaeus longirostris and the cephalopods Illex coindetii and Todaropsis eblanae. Detritic shelf-break stations showed a higher abundance of demersal organisms than stations distributed on muddy bottoms in the same depth range (100 - 200 m). Such differences appeared to be significant in September - October, when a clear increase in benthopelagic zooplanktivorus species, such as Glossanodon leioglossus, Trachurus trachurus, Trachurus picturatus, was found. The length structure of species occurring on the shelf break showed that for some of them the selection of this area is related to specific phases of their life cycle. Significant highest abundance of recruits and juveniles was observed for Merluccius merluccius, Helicolenus dactylopterus, Phycis blennoides, Parapenaeus longirostris and Capros aper in {{at least one of the}} two seasons. Similarly, an increased abundance of spawners of red mullet Mullus barbatus and four-spotted <b>megrim</b> <b>Lepidorhombus</b> boscii was observed on the shelf break. Results of this study may have important consequences for management of fish stocks and assemblages in the central Mediterranean. The cooccurrence of high densities of L. phalangium and benthopelagic fish, occurring mainly with juveniles and spawners, strongly indicates a potential role of L. phalangium as an indicator of highly productive areas around the shelf break. Such areas appear to play a major role in the production of some of the most abundant and commercially important fish species, such as the Mediterranean hake and red mullet...|$|R
40|$|The ICES Working Group on the Assessment of Southern Shelf Stocks of Hake, Monk and Megrim (WGHMM) met in ICES Headquarters during May 5 - 11 2011. There are 19 {{stocks in}} its remit, {{distributed}} from ICES Division IIIa to IXa: 2 stocks of hake (Hake in Division IIIa, Subareas IV, VI and VII and Divisions VIIIa,b,d and Hake in Divisions VIIIc and IXa), 4 of anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa in Divisions VIIb-k and VIIIa,b,d and L. piscatorius and L. budegassa in Divisions VIIIc and IXa), 3 of <b>megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> whiffiagonis in Divisions VIIb-k and VIIIa,b,d and Lepidorhombus boscii and L. Whiffiagonis in Divisions VIIIc and IXa), 1 of sole (Sole in Divisions VIIIa,b - Bay of Biscay), 2 functional units of Nephrops in Divisions VIIIa,b, 2 in Division VIIIc and 5 in Division IXa. There were 18 participants (of which 1 participated part-time and 1 by correspondence) from 5 countries (France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and UK). The meeting was chaired by Carmen Fernández (Spain). The meeting was tasked with carrying out stock assessments and providing catch forecasts and a {{first draft of}} ICES advice for 2012 for all stocks excepting the Nephrops FUs. For Nephrops, catch and abundance indices information was updated. Analytical assessments using age-structured models were conducted for the southern stocks of megrim and the Bay of Biscay sole, whereas the two hake stocks were assessed using models that allow the use of only length-structured data (no age data). A surplusproduction model, without age or length structure, {{was used to assess}} the southern stocks of anglerfish. No analytical assessments have been provided for the northern stocks of anglerfish or megrim after 2006. For anglerfish this is mostly due to ageing problems and to an increase in discards in recent years, {{for which there is no}} reliable data at the stock level. For megrim, there have been severe deficiencies in the input data, of which several still remain. The state of stocks for which no analytical assessment could be performed was inferred from examination of commercial LPUE or CPUE data and from survey information. This year, the northern megrim and anglerfish stocks were scheduled for the “Same Advice as Last Year”. All 4 anglerfish stocks and the northern megrim stock are scheduled for benchmark assessments at the start of 2012, whereas Nephrops FUs 23 - 24 and Nephrops FUs 28 - 29 are scheduled for Inter-benchmark protocols at the same time. The WGHMM meeting also spent considerable time planning these benchmarks. Section 1 of the report presents a summary by stock and discusses general issues. Section 2 provides descriptions of relevant fishing fleets and surveys, whereas Sections 3 to 12 contain the single stock assessments. Section 13 groups references. Several annexes follow. Titles and abstracts of Working Documents presented to the meeting are in Annex B. Planning of preparatory work for future benchmarks is presented in Annex N. WGHMM recommendations are in Annex O and main data problems requiring action in Annex P. Additionally, the WG ToRs this year included collating data for 4 new species in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian waters (see Annex R) and generic ToRs concerning the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning (Annex S).

40|$|The Planning Group on Commercial Catches, Discards and Biological Sampling [PGCCDBS] (Co-Chairs: Mike Armstrong, UK, and Gráinne Ní Chonchúir, Ireland) met in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 18 th February – 22 nd February 2013, in {{parallel}} with the Mediterranean Planning Group for Methodological Development (PGMed). The PGCCDBS was established in 2002 {{in response to the}} EC-ICES Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) requesting ICES to provide support for the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF). It implements the ICES Quality Assurance Framework to ensure that data sets and parameters supporting assessments and advice for the ICES area are based on i) statistically-sound sampling schemes; ii) correct and consistent inter-pretation of biological material such as otoliths and gonads; iii) technology that im-proves accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection; iv) comprehensive and easily sourced documentation, and v) efficient collaboration between PGCCDBS, ex-pert groups and other bodies in relation to data collection. The 2013 meeting of PGCCDBS focused on work completed since last year, and planned work for 2013 and 2014, in the following topics which formed the basis of the Terms of Reference: Stock-based biological parameters from sampling of fishery and survey catches (age, growth, maturity, fecundity, sex ratio) - Fleet/métier related variables (discards estimates and length/age composi-tions of landings and discards) and statistical design of sampling schemes - Data collection technology (hardware, and software such as WebGR and the Regional Data bases). - Implementation of the ICES Quality Assurance Framework - Addressing recommendations and requests for advice from ICES expert groups (including through PGCCDBS data contact persons), and RCMs. During 2013, the PGCCDBS was requested to address an additional Term of Refer-ence as follows: a) Identify reasons for differences between raised discards estimates provided by ICES and STECF, and make recommendations on how to resolve this problem in the short and longer term. The PGCCDBS met in plenary with PGMed to review the outcomes {{of a wide range of}} workshops and age exchanges conducted since PGCCDBS 2012 and the workplan for 2013. On the basis of this and the PGCCDBS long term planning process, further workshops and exchanges were proposed for 2014 and beyond. These include: - Age and maturity workshops: WKSABCAL, the Workshop on the Statistical Analysis of Biological Calibration Studies (which had been postponed); WKARA, workshop on age reading of anglerfish Lophius spp will be con-sidered during the 2014 meeting, and a workshop will be proposed for 2015 if any advances in the knowledge of age reading of anglerfish have been made. - Sampling design workshops: in order to take forward the work of the series of WKPICS (Workshop on the Practical Implementation of Statistical Sound catch Sampling Programmes) and SGPIDS (Study Group on Practical Implementation of Discard Sampling Plans) which finish in 2013, PGCCDBS proposes the establishment of a Working Group on Commercial Catches to provide ongoing support for the design, implementation and analysis of sampling programmes for commercial fisheries. - Large-scale age exchanges: Whiting (Merlangius merlangus); <b>Megrim</b> (<b>Lepidorhombus</b> spp); Sole(Solea solea); Sprat (Sprattus sprattus, all areas); Horse mackerel and Mediterranean horse mackerel (T. picturatus and T. mediterraneus) - PGCCDBS 2013 also updated the list of national age readers and co-ordinators, and this updated list was uploaded onto the European Age Readers Forum (EARF). Other proposals developed by PGCCDBS are: - Proposals for study contracts on i) anglerfish ageing (Lophius piscatorius); ii) Study proposal on age determination and maturity staging of species not previously subjected to biological sampling for analytical assessments. - Proposal for a training course covering the design of statistically sound catch sampling for fisheries monitoring programmes - ICES cooperative research report (CRR) on the Protocols on the ageing of dif-ferent fish species in the ICES area. PGCCDBS further developed its proposal for the CRR and and developed a work plan for this. PGCCDBS developed work plans for intersessional work related to development of Quality Assurance reports for fishery sampling, including testing a prototype QA report with selected ICES stock assessment expert groups, and circulating a ques-tionnaire to collect information on national approaches to the construction and appli-cation of age-length keys. The ToR’s for PGCCDBS 2014 were also discussed and agreed, see Annex 11, and it was also agreed that the PGCCDBS 2014 meeting will be held in Constanta, Romania, Monday the 10 th of February – Friday the 14 st of February 2014...|$|R
