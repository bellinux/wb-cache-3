Filmsite.org enlisted all fatalities in its Best Film Deaths Scenes. The demise of Kirk's character entered these listings of the <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> deaths on film: George Wales of Total Film (#28), James Eldred of Bullz-Eye.com (#20), and Jeff Otto of Bloody Disgusting (#9).|$|E
5|$|The film's {{concept was}} listed at No. 46 in Bravo's 100 Greatest Scary Moments, in which Smith {{represented}} the film. The Flight 180 explosion scene {{was included in}} the lists of best fictional plane crashes or disaster scenes by Break Studios, Unreality Magazine, New Movies.net, The Jetpacker, MaximOnline, and Filmsite.org. Filmsite.org also included the plane scene and the deaths of three characters (Tod, Terry, and Ms. Lewton) in its Scariest Movie Moments and Scenes, and all fatalities in its Best Film Deaths Scenes. The demise of Detmer's character entered the listings of the <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> deaths on film of George Wales and Simon Kinnear of Total Film (No. 29 and No. 10, respectively), Simon Hill of Eat Horror (No. 10), and Dirk Sonningsen of Mania (No. 10).|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} adjustment, rear shocks span the range from no {{adjustments}} whatsoever to pre-load adjustments only to racing shocks with adjustments for length, pre-load, and four {{different kinds of}} damping. <b>Most</b> <b>shocks</b> have internal oil reservoirs, but some have external ones, and some offer air-assisted damping.|$|R
5000|$|A shock {{absorber}} (in reality, a shock [...] "damper") is a mechanical or hydraulic device designed to absorb and damp shock impulses. It does this by converting the kinetic {{energy of the}} shock into another form of energy (typically heat) which is then dissipated. <b>Most</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers are a form of dashpot.|$|R
50|$|<b>Most</b> {{vehicular}} <b>shock</b> absorbers {{are either}} twin-tube or mono-tube types with some variations on these themes.|$|R

40|$|Tests of a {{prototype}} skin friction gauge at Mach 3. 2 {{in a small}} free piston shock tunnel demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} design concept and the calibration against theoretical skin friction values in a simple flow. The gauge has a rise time of about 20 microsec, sufficiently short for <b>most</b> <b>shock</b> tunnel applications and approaching the rise times needed for expansion tube applications...|$|R
50|$|The {{mounting}} location also affects {{the response of}} <b>most</b> <b>shock</b> detectors. A shock on a rigid item such as a sports helmet or a rigid package might respond to a field shock with a jagged shock pulse which, without proper filtering is difficult to characterize. A shock on a cushioned item usually has a smoother shock pulse., and thus more consistent responses from shock detector.|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{signatures}} of isolated body phases from many deep-focus earthquakes were analyzed {{in the time}} domain. <b>Most</b> <b>shocks</b> {{were found to be}} multiple events when examined in detail. The time history derived from P waves for single events predict synthetic S-wave shapes that match the observations, indicating compatibility with shear dislocation theory. Several other features of source functions in the time domain have been brought to light...|$|R
25|$|Alexander Werth, {{historian}} and BBC Eastern Front war correspondent, {{suggests that the}} nuclear bombing of Japan mainly served to demonstrate the new weapon in the <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> way, virtually at Russia's doorstep, in order to prepare the political post-war field.|$|E
25|$|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is {{the second}} and final novel by the English author Anne Brontë. It was first {{published}} in 1848 under the pseudonym Acton Bell. Probably the <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> of the Brontës' novels, it had an instant and phenomenal success, but after Anne's death her sister Charlotte prevented its re-publication.|$|E
25|$|The murders {{shocked the}} city. Worried parents formed escort groups to take {{children}} {{to and from}} school every day, and to patrol streets at night and on weekends. The Washington Post called the murders of Kendrick and Bradley two of the four <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> murders in the city during 1973.|$|E
60|$|Tom's {{compassion}} for the prisoner, and admiration of him as the daring rescuer of a drowning boy, experienced a <b>most</b> damaging <b>shock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The year 2002 was {{probably}} the darkest year for Bustamante, especially considering his experience at the World Pool Championships. While the tournament was still going on, Bustamante was <b>most</b> <b>shocked</b> when he {{received a phone call}} from his wife informing him that his daughter, who was less than a year old, had died. Devastated by this, Bustamante strongly considered forfeiting his contention at the tournament to return to the Philippines but some people around convinced him to go on.|$|R

25|$|The massacres in Rašića Gaj {{were among}} the <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> early World War II war crimes for Serbs in Eastern Bosnia. The testimonies about the cruel {{slaughter}} of Serbs in Rašića Gaj spread among {{the population of the}} region, causing fear and anger. Many Serbs considered all Muslims and Croats as Ustaše and threatened to kill them to avenge Serbs killed in Rašića Gaj.|$|E
25|$|The <b>most</b> <b>shocking,</b> frightening, and {{fascinating}} image in {{rock in the}} last few years is Courtney Love's stage dive... When some male performers do it, it looks like muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression... For obvious reasons, the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, but Love, typically, decided that she wanted to do it, too. Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being raped, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about every show.|$|E
25|$|The Rašića Gaj massacres were massacres of Serbs {{committed}} by the Muslim Ustaše forces {{at the beginning of}} the World War II in Rašića Gaj, Vlasenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina (contemporary Independent State of Croatia) in June and July 1941. The estimations of the number of Serbs killed in Rašića Gaj vary between at least 70 and 200. It was one of the <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> early World War II war crimes for Serbs in Eastern Bosnia. It frighten and angered them.|$|E
50|$|One design consideration, when {{designing}} or {{choosing a}} shock absorber, is where that energy will go. In <b>most</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers, energy {{is converted to}} heat inside the viscous fluid. In hydraulic cylinders, the hydraulic fluid heats up, while in air cylinders, the hot air is usually exhausted to the atmosphere. In other types of shock absorbers, such as electromagnetic types, the dissipated energy can be stored and used later. In general terms, shock absorbers help cushion vehicles on uneven roads.|$|R
60|$|My lady {{burst out}} laughing, {{and said she}} didn't know which to be <b>most</b> <b>shocked</b> at--my {{language}} or my principles. Some joke tickled her, I suppose, {{of the sort that}} you can't take unless you are a person of quality. Understanding nothing myself but that I was free to put it next to Selina, I went and put it accordingly. And what did Selina say? Lord! how little you must know of women, if you ask that. Of course she said, Yes.|$|R
50|$|Al Falfa {{is back in}} {{his bedroom}} trying to sleep. However, he can still hear the cat's live performance, so he leaves {{the house with a}} rifle, aims his weapon, and pulls the trigger. Unfortunately, the gun does not fire, so he resorts to picking up a red stone which he hurls. The cat is struck head on, and falls unconsciousness. The cats, who are <b>most</b> <b>shocked,</b> rush to check on their idol. Enraged, they begin to chase and throw stuff at the man.|$|R
25|$|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall {{is perhaps}} amongst the <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> of {{contemporary}} Victorian novels. In seeking {{to present the}} truth in literature, Anne's depiction of alcoholism and debauchery was profoundly disturbing to 19th-century sensibilities. Helen Graham, the tenant of the title, intrigues Gilbert Markham and gradually she reveals her past {{as an artist and}} wife of the dissipated Arthur Huntingdon. The book's brilliance lies in its revelation of the position of women at the time, and its multi-layered plot.|$|E
25|$|Kawamoto acted {{quickly to}} change Honda's {{corporate}} culture, rushing through market-driven product development {{that resulted in}} recreational vehicles such as the first generation Odyssey and the CR-V, and a refocusing away {{from some of the}} numerous sedans and coupes that were popular with Honda's engineers but not with the buying public. The <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> change to Honda came when Kawamoto ended Honda's successful participation in Formula One after the 1992 season, citing costs in light of the takeover threat from Mitsubishi as well as the desire to create a more environmentally-friendly company image.|$|E
25|$|Urbšys' {{protested the}} Soviet bases {{arguing that it}} would mean virtual {{occupation}} of Lithuania. Soviets argued that their army would protect Lithuania from possible attacks from Nazi Germany and that a similar treaty was already signed with Estonia. Urbšys argued that Lithuania's neutrality was enough to guarantee its security and proposed to strengthen Lithuanian army. Soviets agreed {{to reduce the number}} of troops to 35,000. Urbšys also bargained for more territories in the Vilnius Region, especially in the vicinity of Druskininkai and Švenčionys, territories with larger Lithuanian population. The Soviets replied that the boundary draw by the 1920 peace treaty was inaccurate and that Belarusians also laid claims to the territory. Soviets tentatively agreed that territories, where Lithuanian majority could be proven, would be transferred to Lithuania. The <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> demand was to cede part of Lithuanian territory to Germany. Lithuanians decided to postpone any negotiations regarding territory transfer to Germany until Germans expressed clear demands.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we employ unit root {{tests that}} allow for {{heterogeneous}} structural breaks developed by Lee and Strazicich (2003), Narayan and Popp (2010), and Im et al. (2010) to examine the stationarity of inflation rates in 11 Mediterranean countries over the period 1960 - 2011. The empirical findings support the stationarity of inflation rates when structural breaks are allowed. Thus, <b>most</b> <b>shocks</b> to inflation rates appear to be temporary and inflation rates show mean reversion. In addition, the results indicate some important policy implications. ...|$|R
60|$|OEdip. Trust me, thou fairest, {{best of all}} thy kind, None e'er {{in dreams}} was {{tortured}} so before. Yet what <b>most</b> <b>shocks</b> the niceness of my temper, Even far beyond the killing of my father, And my own death, is, that this horrid sleep Dashed my sick fancy with an act of incest: I dreamt, Jocasta, that thou wert my mother; Which, though impossible, so damps my spirits, That I could do a mischief on myself, Lest I should sleep, and dream the like again.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{indicator}} {{property of the}} monetary indicator for inflation. Using a P*-model, Svensson (2000) shows theoretically {{that the relationship between}} these two variables is rather tenuous. The present study employs empirical evidence on the relations in his model to quantify its dynamics for the Euro-area. Moreover, we extend Svensson’s analysis by considering different shocks and monetary regimes. It becomes apparent that the system exhibits complicated dynamics and that for <b>most</b> <b>shocks</b> and policy regimes the monetary indicator is not a leading indicator of dangers to price stability at the medium-term. 1...|$|R
25|$|Jackson's death {{triggered}} {{an outpouring}} of reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and causing sales of his music {{and that of the}} Jackson 5 to increase dramatically. Jackson had also intended to perform a series of comeback concerts to over one million people at London's O2Arena from July 2009 to March 2010. A public memorial service for Jackson was held on July 7, 2009, at the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles, where he had rehearsed for the London concerts the night before his death. The service was broadcast live around the world, attracting a global audience of more than one billion people. In 2010, Sony Music Entertainment signed a US $250 million deal with Jackson's estate to retain distribution rights to his recordings up until 2017, and to release seven posthumous albums over the decade following his death. Jackson's death is ranked No.1 on VH1/VH1 Classic's list of 100 <b>Most</b> <b>Shocking</b> Moments in Music.|$|E
25|$|Prior the 2017–2018 season, Žalgiris {{and one of}} {{the club}} {{sponsors}} Avia Solutions Group reached an agreement which guaranteed private flights for the team during away games in a newly renewed business-class Boeing 737 jet. The off-season work began just a week after winning the LKL championship, with Brock Motum, a breakout player, signing with Anadolu Efes S.K.. To replace Motum, Žalgiris signed Aaron White, who played a season with B.C. Zenit Saint Petersburg. Léo Westerman signed with PBC CSKA Moscow, and was replaced by talented guard Vasilije Micić. To replace Seibutis, Žalgiris originally signed Royce O'Neale, who terminated his deal just weeks later to sign with the Utah Jazz. Žalgiris then signed Axel Toupane, who spent the season in the NBA and the NBA D-League, to replace him. Because center Robertas Javtokas announced retirement and the loan of Augusto Lima ended, Žalgiris signed Brandon Davies of AS Monaco in the center position. The <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> departure came in the end of June, when Lukas Lekavičius, breakout point guard, signed a contract with Panathinaikos B.C.. Needing a new point guard, Žalgiris signed Dee Bost, also of AS Monaco, to replace him. Coach Jasikevičius also resigned with Žalgiris, while the retired Javtokas became the new sports director of the team.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} series, Last Broadcast held a poll for the top five <b>most</b> <b>shocking</b> death scenes in Spooks. Two of them were deaths from the seventh series. Adam Carter's death was voted the fourth <b>most</b> <b>shocking,</b> while Ben Kaplan's death was voted third. Connie's death however, was not listed. The {{featuring}} of an actual waterboarding scene drew criticism from Guardian columnist Zoe Williams, who wrote [...] "it's really unpleasant, [...] concurred. 'I only lasted five to 10 seconds, and the sound of my voice crying out to stop isn't me acting.' Pal, that's nice that you're not showing off but this is all wrong and despicable: it's like locking yourself and 10 friends into a loo on a commuter train, to see {{what it would be like}} on the train to Auschwitz. If you can make it stop whenever you like, you're learning nothing and kicking people in the face while you're at it." ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a simple {{methodology}} for the study of regional unemployment persistence in Argentina. We use two complementary perspectives, combining a macroeconomic (aggregate) hysteresis approach with a microeconomic dynamic (individual-two-stage) evaluation. Macroeconomic results indicate that <b>most</b> <b>shocks</b> affecting the unemployment rate in different regions and population sub-groups are predominantly persistent (because of both participation and employment hysteresis). The microeconomic analysis allows us to detect a strong state-dependence effect (for most regions and mainly amongst youth and females), while duration-dependence is only significant for periods of high unemployment...|$|R
30|$|Introduction Echocardiography is {{increasingly}} {{used to assess}} patients with cardiopulmonary compromise. The identification of fluid responsiveness (FR) is key {{in the assessment of}} patients with acute circulatory failure. Several dynamic indices to predict FR obtained with transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have been previously validated in small populations of septic shock patients. Fluid resuscitation is the mainstay of acute management in <b>most</b> <b>shocked</b> patients, but a positive fluid balance is known to be detrimental on outcome. The present study aimed at determining the threshold value of echocardiographic indices to predict FR according to the clinical setting, to reduce false-negative or false-positive results.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{implications}} of alternative exchange rate regimes for asset prices in a portfolio balance model motivated by the recent US-China experience. We establish that asset price responses to various shocks differ across a flexible regime and a-unilateral- peg but the differences for <b>most</b> <b>shocks</b> tend to be rather small. Moreover, while both monetary and public debt expansions have inflationary effects on equity prices, the latter’s impact is stronger under a flexible exchange rate regime. These two findings suggest that a flexible USD/rimni rate would not have limited the recent asset price inflation in the US...|$|R
