25|$|Type I, {{formerly}} known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), Sudeck's atrophy, or algoneurodystrophy, does not exhibit demonstrable nerve lesions.

25|$|Although {{deinstitutionalisation}} {{has been}} {{positive for the}} <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> it also has severe shortcomings. Expectations that community care would lead to fuller social integration have not been achieved; many remain without work, have limited social contacts, and often live in sheltered environments.|$|E
25|$|Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) {{is one of}} the {{two major}} syndromes {{contributing}} to megalencephaly. Typically MCAP and MPPH can be distinguished by somatic features. In differentiation to MCAP, MPPH lacks consistent somatic features other than postaxial polydactly. Furthermore, brain and body development is normally symmetric in the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> that appear to have MPPH symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Every eye is {{different}} {{and there are a}} number of variables that affect the outcome of treatment.

25|$|Studies have {{reported}} that the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> that centralized were able to avoid spinal surgery via isolating the area of local pain.

25|$|Others {{argue that}} the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> appear to have rectal {{intussusception}} {{as a consequence of}} obstructed defecation rather than a cause, possibly related to excessive straining in patients with obstructed defecation. Patients with other causes of obstructed defecation (outlet obstruction) like anismus also tend to have higher incidence of internal intussusception. Enteroceles are coexistent in 11% of patients with internal intussusception. Symptoms of internal intussusception overlap with those of rectocele, indeed the 2 conditions can occur together.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{living in}} the country, and {{visitors}} to Ireland who hold a European Health Insurance Card, are entitled to use the public healthcare system. Under Common Travel Area (CTA) arrangements, British citizens do not require an EHIC card and can instead present their NHS number, NHS card, driving licence or other proof of residence within the CTA. Outpatient services are also provided without charge. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> on median incomes or above are required to pay subsidised hospital charges.|$|E
25|$|B. pseudomallei is {{normally}} found in soil and surface water; {{a history of}} contact with soil or surface water is, therefore, almost invariable in patients with melioidosis; that said, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> who do have contact with infected soil suffer no ill effects. Even within an area, the distribution of B.pseudomallei within the soil can be extremely patchy, and competition with other Burkholderia species has been suggested as a possible reason. Contaminated ground water was implicated in one outbreak in northern Australia. Also implicated are severe weather events such as flooding tsunamis and typhoons.|$|E
30|$|We {{found that}} the scan quality in {{patients}} appeared visually inferior to that of healthy controls, which was correlated to motion {{and a loss of}} image contrast, and vascular artifacts. Nevertheless, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> scans were considered clinically usable in the binary classification. However, it should be noticed that the poorer cQC and aQC scores for ASL scans from patients need to be accepted to a certain degree.|$|R

25|$|Thalidomide was {{originally}} {{released in the}} Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) under the label of Contergan on October 1, 1957 by Chemie GrÃ¼nenthal (now GrÃ¼nenthal). The drug was primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, {{but it was also}} used as an antiemetic and sedative. The drug was banned in 1961 after its teratogenic properties were observed. The problems with thalidomide were, aside from the teratogenic side effects, both high incidence of other adverse reactions along with poor solubility in water and absorption from the intestines. Adverse reactions include peripheral neuropathy in large <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> constipation, thromboembolism along with dermatological complications.|$|E
25|$|As {{opposed to}} lentiviruses, {{adenoviral}} DNA does not integrate into the genome {{and is not}} replicated during cell division. This limits their use in basic research, although adenoviral vectors are still used in in vitro and also in vivo experiments. Their primary applications are in gene therapy and vaccination. Since humans commonly {{come in contact with}} adenoviruses, which cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and eye infections, <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> have already developed neutralizing antibodies which can inactivate the virus before it can reach the target cell. To overcome this problem scientists are currently investigating adenoviruses that infect different species to which humans do not have immunity.|$|E
25|$|Endometriosis is {{a chronic}} disease {{which can cause}} severe, progressive, and at times, incapacitating dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, {{dyspareunia}} and infertility. Dydrogesterone relieves pain without inhibiting ovulation, so that patients are able to become pregnant during treatment. Dydrogesterone is particularly suitable {{in cases where the}} woman desires to become pregnant and to prevent bleeding problems. Dydrogesterone results in statistically significant reductions in the symptoms pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia after the first treatment cycle for the treatment of post-laparoscopic endometriosis. The amount and duration of menstrual bleeding is also significantly reduced, and {{from the end of the}} third month onwards, bleeding was considered normal in the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients.</b> Improvement of endometriosis was observed in 71% of patients and cure in 21%.|$|E
