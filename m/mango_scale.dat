40|$|White <b>Mango</b> <b>Scale</b> Aulacaspis tubercularis Newstead, 1906 was {{reported}} {{for the first time}} in 2010 from mango orchards belonging to Green Focus Ethiopia Ltd in western Ethiopia. It was hypothesized that the pest could en­ter Ethiopia with mango seedlings imported by the same company. The pre­sent study surveyed natural enemies of the pest and their population dynamics in western Ethiopia. Larvae of Chilocorus sp. (Coleo­ptera: Coccinelidae) were found feeding ravenously on live mango scales. There was a statistically sig­nificant (p 0. 05). Populations of White <b>Mango</b> <b>Scale</b> and its predator showed remarkably similar fluctuations, with their abundancies reaching peaks during same months. It has been concluded that the native predator got associated with the exotic insect pest recently, and its population may gra­dually build up. It is suggested that implementation of Chilocorus sp. as a biocontrol agent would be a sound strategy in the management of White <b>Mango</b> <b>Scale</b> in western Ethiopia, together with other control options...|$|E
40|$|Ecological aspects such as {{population}} composition, population fluctuation {{and spatial}} distribution {{as well as}} the natural enemies of Aulacaspis tubercularis (Newstead) (Coccoidea: Diaspididae) were analyzed using data gathered from two localities, viz. Kaapmuiden (25 ° 29 'S, 31 ° 24 'E) and Nelspruit (25 ° 27 'S, 30 ° 58 'E), South Africa. An average of 350 females and 550 males were examined fortnightly for a period of 12 months to determine the frequency of the developmental stages and the percentage parasitism. Eight leaves per tree, two in each quadrant, were randomly picked to determine the relative abundance and the spatial distribution of the scale insects within the tree. Twenty randomly selected trees in an orchard were used for this purpose. The highest infestation of the <b>mango</b> <b>scale</b> occurred on the shady south-facing lower aspect of the tree. Population peaks of the <b>mango</b> <b>scale</b> occurred at different periods {{of the year in the}} two regions monitored. The population peak at Kaapmuiden, with a higher mean temperature, occurred in August, much earlier than at Nelspruit, where it occurred in November. Generations overlapped to such an extent that no developmental stage peaks could be detected. The indigenous parasite Encarsia citrina (Craw) was incapable of controlling Aulacaspis tubercularis despite the percentage of parasitism exceeding 80 % at certain times of the year. The predatory thrips, Aleurodothrips fasciapennis (Franklin), was probably recorded for the first time in Africa while preying on <b>mango</b> <b>scale...</b>|$|E

40|$|Rhyzobius ventralis” is a {{well-known}} coccinellid as a scale insect control agent {{in various parts of}} the world since 1890 s. But, it had been confused with R. forestieri until Pope (1981), who separated these two species and reviewed the previous records. As the first record from Japan, R. forestieri was collected on leaves of Elaeocarpus sylvestris with heavy infestation of the <b>mango</b> shield <b>scale</b> Protopulvinaria mangiferae in Fukuoka City in April, 1987. The present study was carried out on this coccinellid to get some biological parameters by rearing with the <b>mango</b> shield <b>scale</b> as food. Results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The total number of eggs laid by a female is 439 in average. The eggs are laid singly, but by repeated ovipositions 5. 1 eggs in average are laid on the ventral side of an adult scale, or 1. 5 eggs in average in an empty mummy of the scale in Petri dish. 2. The threshold temperature (t_ 0) and the thermal constant (K) for the development from the egg to the adult eclosion are calculated 11. 3 ℃ and 338 day-degrees, respectively. 3. Under 25 ℃ and 16 hrs light conditions, the premating and preoviposition periods are 3 - 4 days and 6 - 7 days, and the durations of the egg, larva and pupa are about 6, 13 and 5 days, respectively. 4. Under the same conditions, the longevity of the adult is about 95 days in both sexes, and the net reproduction rate (R_ 0) and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r_m) are calculated as 192. 3 and 0. 085 per female per day, respectively. 日本から新たに発見されたハラアカクロテントウムシRhyzobius forestieri (Mulsant) の産卵習性, 発育に及ぼす温度の影響, および増殖能力について, ハラビロカタカイガラムシを餌とした飼育によって調査した. 1. 成虫の産卵は, このカイガラムシ成虫の腹面と寄生蜂が羽化した後のマミー内に行われ, 1 カ所に産みつけられる卵粒数は 1 ～ 14 であった. 2. 恒温条件下で飼育した場合, 卵から成虫までの発育所要日数は, 17 ℃で 55. 9 日, 20 ℃で 41. 6 日, 25 ℃で 24. 3 日, 発育零点は 11. 3 ℃, 有効積算温量は 338. 0 日度であった. 3. 卵から成虫に至るまでの生存率は, 25 ℃で 92 %, 20 ℃で 76 %, 30 ℃で 62 %であった. 4. 性比は, 産卵時の母虫の日齢に関係なく, ほぼ 0. 5 であった. 5. 雌当たり産卵数は, 平均 438. 8 卵で, 羽化後 10 ～ 20 日と 40 ～ 50 日に山があり, それ以降は順次減少した. 6. 25 ℃ 16 時間照明の条件下で飼育によって求めた純繁殖率, 世代の平均時間, および内的自然増加率は, それぞれ 192. 3, 61. 9 日, 0. 085 /雌/日であった...|$|R
40|$|Investigations on {{the biology}} of Microterys flavus, a primary {{parasitoid}} wasp of the <b>mango</b> shield <b>scale</b> Protopulvinaria mangiferae were {{carried out in the}} laboratory and the results obtained are summarized as follows: The wasp lays eggs mostly to the adults and rarely to the second-instar larvae of the host scale, but not to the first-instar larvae. Number of eggs laid to a host varies from one to five owing to the influence of the host size, one egg to a host in case when the host is smaller than 3 mm in length, or two to five eggs when the host is larger than 4 mm. The threshold temperature and the thermal constant {{for the development of the}} wasp from the egg to the adult were 9. 5 ℃ and 257 day-degrees, respectively. On 25 ℃ and 16 -hrs light conditions with honey as food, the average longevity of the wasp was 40 days, the total eggs deposited were 205 in average, of which fiftieth percent were laid in 13 days after the emergence of the wasp, and the net reproduction rate (R_ 0) and the intrinsic rate of the natural increase (r_m) were calculated as 116. 8 and 0. 147 per female per day, respectively. ハラビロカタカイガラムシProtopulvinaria mangiferae(Green) の個体群動態に関する基礎資料として, 寄生蜂Microterys flavus (Howard) の寄生様式, 発育速度, 増殖能力などについて調査を行い, 以下の結果を得た. 1.

40|$|Studies on epigeal and {{arboreal}} and predatory arthropods in two mango orchards in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea Predatory arthropods {{were studied}} by the beating method and pitfall trapping in two mango orchards in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Both orchards were not sprayed with synthetic insecticides during or before the study period. Formicidae {{were the most}} numerous group within the epigeal and the arboreal arthropods (2772 and 2269 ind., respectively). The weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, was the most abundant species within the arboreal arthropods. Pheidole spp. was most frequent in pitfall traps. Spiders were the second most numerous group (524 and 619 ind., respectively). Lycosidae were predominant in pitfall traps and Salticidae in net catches with the beating method on the trees. In the barber traps, Carabidae and Staphylinidae were only present in low numbers (47 ind.). Coccinellidae were the most numerous family within the arboreal predatory beetles (89 ind.). Telsimia sp. accounted for 63 % of the ladybird beetles. Crickets were frequently collected in pitfall traps (187 ind.). A survey on the occurrence and importance of mango pests in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea A survey was conducted at four sites in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea to determine the abundance and importance of nine insect pests in mango. The pests, except fruit flies which were monitored by fallen fruits, were monitored three times during 2002 according to their occurrence within the mango season. Out of these pests, the white <b>mango</b> <b>scale</b> Aulacaspis tubercularis, (Homopt., Diaspididae), the mango leafminer Acrocerops spp. (Lep., Gracillariidae), the leafhoppers,Idioscopus clypealis and,I. niveosparsus (Homopt., Cicadellidae), the soft scales Saissetia sp. and Parasaissetia sp. (Homopt., Coccidae) and the fruit fly Bactrocera frauenfeldi (Dip., Tephritidae) proved to be serious pests. Appropriate control measures, in particular biological and cultural methods, are proposed. Infestation levels with fruit piercing moths Othreis fullonia, O. materna, Eudocima salaminia (Lep., Noctuidae), aphids Toxoptera odinae (Homopt., Aphididae), blossom feeders Cosmostola sp., Gymnoscelis sp., Nanaguna breviuscula (Lepidoptera) and planthoppers Colgaroides acuminata, Colgar sp., Scolypopa sp. (Homopt., Flatidae, Ricaniidae) were lower. Appropriate control measures are recommended but not immediately required. On the biological control of Ceroplastes rubens (Homopt., Coccidae) with the introduced parasitoid Anicetus beneficus (Hym., Encyrtidae) A {{study was conducted in}} three provinces of Papua New Guinea to determine damage by the pink wax scale Ceroplastes rubens and to identify endemic parasitoids and parasitization levels in order to evaluate the necessity and possibility of a classical biological control with an introduced parasitoid. Infestation levels with the pink wax scale variied 3. 82 % and 6. 40 %. The parasitization levels variied between 1. 19 % and 3. 05 %. Out of the nine endemic parasitoids identified, Aprostocetus sp. (Hym., Eulophidae) was the most frequent one. The pink wax scale parasitoid Anicetus beneficus (Hym., Encyrtidae) was imported from Australia and released at four sites in the Central Province in March/April 2002. The establishment was controlled at two sites six resp. twelve months after release. Parasitization levels increased significantly (from 3. 05 % to 5. 45 % at Laloki and from 2. 04 % to 22. 15 % at Tahira). At both sites, A. beneficus was the most frequent parasitoid. The parasitization process at the Laloki site was disturbed by the ant Tapinoma sp. Studies on the biology of Deanolis sublimbalis (Lep., Pyralidae) and its natural enemies A study was conducted at four sites in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea to determine infestation levels and biological behaviour of the red banded mango caterpillar Deanolis sublimbalis (RBMC). Eggs and larvae were collected to identify natural enemies and to develop potential control strategies. Infestation levels of mango fruits variied between 3. 36 % and 23. 18 %. The eggs are mainly found at the peduncle covered with dried sepals. Pupation takes place inside the bark of the mango tree. No other plants than Mangifera spp. were confirmed as hosts in laboratory and field studies. The pest goes into diapause during mango off-season. No egg or larval parasitoids were recorded. Control measures like sticky bands are an appropriate method to prevent pupation in the bark. A spraying scheme needs to be developed for commercial producers. It is further recommended to search for potential natural enemies in the centre of origin of M. indica...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are 1) To review the published data and document the current knowledge on allergic manifestations to the fruit mango 2) To highlight the two distinct clinical presentations of hypersensitivity reactions caused by mango 3) To discuss the role of cross-reactivity 4) To increase awareness of potentially life threatening complications that can be caused by allergy to mango. An extensive search of the literature was performed in Medline/PubMed with the key terms "mango", "anaphylaxis", "contact dermatitis", "cross-reactivity", "food hypersensitivity", "oral allergy syndrome" and "urticaria". The bibliographies of all papers thus located were searched for further relevant articles. A total of 17 reports describing 22 patients were documented, including ten patients with immediate hypersensitivity reaction and twelve patients with delayed hypersensitivity reaction to mango. Ten of these patients (four with immediate reaction; six with delayed reaction) were from geographical areas cultivating mango, whereas twelve patients (six with immediate reaction; six with delayed reaction) were from the countries where large <b>scale</b> <b>mango</b> cultivation does not occur. The clinical features, pathogenesis and diagnostic modalities of both these presentations are highlighted. The fruit mango can cause immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, as also "oral allergy syndrome". Although rare, it can even result in a life threatening event. Reactions may even occur in individuals without prior exposure to mango, owing to cross reactivity. It is imperative to recognize such a phenomenon early so as to avoid potentially severe clinical reactions in susceptible patients...|$|R
40|$|Irregular bearing {{is a major}} agronomic {{issue with}} {{economic}} consequences for many temperate and tropical fruit species. In particular, the mango tree, characterized by terminal flowering, is prone to irregularity, with a clear cultivar effect. Mango trees within a monoclonal orchard exhibit contrasted patterns of bearing, suggesting that irregularity is triggered and/or maintained by endogenous factors and not only by genetic or environmental factors. In several species, architectural traits of shoots can affect flowering. In this paper we summarize and discuss the results obtained in different studies on the reciprocal interactions between vegetative development and f lowering and fruiting at different <b>scales</b> in the <b>mango</b> tree, namely the terminal growth unit, the scaffold branch and the whole tree. The topology, morphology and phenology of the mango terminal growth units affect their probability of flowering and fruiting, indicating that structural and temporal vegetative traits are clearly involved in reproduction. Conversely, the reproductive fate of a terminal growth unit affects the occurrence, intensity and phenology of its subsequent vegetative growth, which represents the potential flowering points for the following cycle. These results show that, at the <b>mango</b> growth unit <b>scale,</b> irregular bearing results {{from the effects of}} the flowering and fruiting behavior during a cycle on the reproductive behaviour during the following cycle, these effects being partly mediated by vegetative growth occurring between the two reproductive events. Three points are discussed: what are the physiological mechanisms underlying these relationships at the growth unit scale? What happens at larger scales, i. e., at the scaffold branch and the whole tree scales? And what could be the effects of climate change and cultivation practices on these relationships?

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the outcome}} of a study to map the economic structure and organisation of two selected mango export chains from South Africa by applying selected supply chain analysis tools. The study is part of an inventory on the export of fresh fruit and vegetables commissioned by the European Commission under the Veg-i-Trade Project Work Package 1. The two selected chains were the Bavaria fresh mango and the Blue Skies freshly cut mango export supply chains. The study sought to understand how food safety and quality standards are shaping the structure and relationships in the two export chains given the prevalence of food scares and scandals. An inventory of the activities and the various actors along the mango export supply chains was made in order to identify the structure and functioning of the chains and the issues and constraints faced with the various quality and safety standards. The objective {{of the study was to}} identify the actors and the role they play, determine the governance structure and relationships and identify the quality management programmes and standards employed in the two selected export chains. In addition, the study sought to identify and analyse the different information exchange categories and use of information between the different links along the chains. A qualitative research approach that incorporates case study methodology was used as the inquiry strategy. Through this methodology, the investigation untangled the complexity of the mango export supply chains which is faced with the challenge of maintaining a chain that guarantees adherence to customer specifications and client needs. The study’s findings established that food safety and quality management standards are shaping the structure and organisation of the chains and their stringency has increased with a widened and deepened scope. In addition, the ability to adopt a standard is directly affected by the scale of business operation and standards are technical barriers to entry for small <b>scale</b> <b>mango</b> producers and exporters mainly because of the high certification and operational costs. In reaction to the standards, it was noted that Bavaria and Blue Skies mango export chains are buyer-driven with a high degree of vertical coordination enforced by contracts. The two chains are modular with the use of and strategic positioning of category managers; a high degree of asset specificity and forward integration to reach their markets resulting in a shortened supply chain. Supply chain coordination is carried out on contracted logistics and cold chain services with regulatory functions provided by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and the Perishable Product Export Control Board (PPECB) in South Africa and agricultural and health inspectors in the United Kingdom (UK). There is also product and process differentiation. It was also noted that compulsory certification of quality and food safety standards is the prerequisite to access export markets. The standards used in the Bavaria and Blue Skies mango export chains are the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) and Global Good Agricultural Practice (Global GAP). These are used in conjunction with the British Retail Consortium (BRC), Fairtrade, Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI), International Food Standard (IFS) and Linking Environment And Farming (LEAF). Quality audits and inspections are carried out at each supply chain level to ensure safety and adherence to quality requirements. The supply chain actors carry out continuous quality assessment and one way to achieve this was through the application of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. Quality and safety standards have also resulted in improved traceability in the Bavaria and Blue Skies Mango export chains. Traceability systems in the Bavaria and Blue Skies mango export chains are more automated though they are not harmonised, thus Paltrack, XsenseTM, Caretrace and TempTrip. Automated information systems used to share and exchange information are internet and email as well as barcodes which are used with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). Manual information systems in use are mainly telephones, facsimile and mobile phones. It was also established that major issues and challenges in the Bavaria and Blue Skies mango export chains are a result of factors that affect mango perishability, mainly post harvest handling procedures thus packaging, transportation, storage, ripening and distribution. If not managed well, poor safety and quality management result in economic losses due to product rejections, product recall and cessation of buyer-supplier relationships.
