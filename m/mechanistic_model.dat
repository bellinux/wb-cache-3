30|$|Better {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons would be of great economic importance, when one considers the costs of petrochemical plants. Secondly, <b>mechanistic</b> <b>models</b> {{can be used to}} optimize thermal cracking operations and in reducing costly and time-consuming experimental programs [1, 27]. <b>Mechanistic</b> <b>modeling</b> is widely used thanks to the availability of fast computers. Though it is initially more expensive and time-consuming, its long term advantage is important; once it is developed, it is no longer necessary to employ an expensive pilot plant [28]. Furthermore, <b>mechanistic</b> <b>models</b> account extensively for free radical reactions, which play very significant roles in hydrocarbon pyrolysis. In addition, the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons under industrial conditions occurs at high conversions where secondary reactions of radicals predominate. <b>Mechanistic</b> <b>models</b> have been used mainly in the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons at low conversions [29, 30, 31]. There were few applications at high conversions before and in the early 1980 s [5, 32, 33]. Also, most of the <b>mechanistic</b> <b>modeling</b> studies up to the late 1980 s were on light hydrocarbons and there were few reported studies on the modeling of medium and heavy hydrocarbons pyrolysis [31, 34, 35].|$|R
2500|$|In his PhD thesis, Changeux {{suggested}} that the recognition and transmission of signals by membrane, and in particular by synapses, could use the same mechanisms as the allosteric regulation of enzymes. More than forty years of research would follow, mainly focussed on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (see below). In 1967, Changeux extended the MWC model to bi-dimensional lattice of receptors [...] (an idea that would also be developed three decades afterward by Dennis Bray). He then applied this idea to the post-synaptic membrane of electric organs (analog to striated muscle). His team demonstrated the existence of several interconvertible states for the nicotinic receptor, resting, open and desensitized, displaying different affinities for the ligands, such as the endogenous agonist acetylcholine. The transitions between the states followed different kinetics, and those kinetics plus the differential affinities sufficed to explain {{the shape of the}} post-synaptic potential. A full <b>mechanistic</b> <b>model</b> of the nicotinic receptor from striated muscle (or electric organ) was to be provided much later, when Changeux collaborated with Stuart Edelstein, another specialist of allostery, who worked decades on hemoglobin. In addition to the allosteric modulation of the channel gating by the agonists, many other regulations of the ligand-gated ion channels activity have since been discovered. The modulators bind to a variety of allosteric sites, whether on the agonist binding sites, other binding sites at the subunit interfaces, on the cytoplasmic part of the protein or in the transmembrane domain.|$|E
2500|$|A lesser-known contribution, however one of {{the first}} of its kind, was Hooke's {{scientific}} model of human memory. [...] Hooke in a 1682 lecture to the Royal Society proposed a <b>mechanistic</b> <b>model</b> of human memory, which would bear little resemblance to the mainly philosophical models before it. This model addressed the components of encoding, memory capacity, repetition, retrieval, and forgetting—some with surprising modern accuracy. This work, overlooked for nearly 200 years, shared a variety of similarities with Richard Semon's work of 1919/1923, both assuming memories were physical and located in the brain. The model's more interesting points are that it (1) allows for attention and other top-down influences on encoding; (2) it uses resonance to implement parallel, cue-dependent retrieval; (3) it explains memory for recency; (4) it offers a single-system account of repetition and priming, and (5) the power law of forgetting can be derived from the model's assumption in a straightforward way. This lecture would be published posthumously in 1705 as the memory model was unusually placed in a series of works on the nature of light. [...] It has been speculated that this work saw little review as the printing was done in small batches in a post-Newtonian age of science and was most likely deemed out of date {{by the time it was}} published. [...] Further interfering with its success was contemporary memory psychologists' rejection of immaterial souls, which Hooke invoked to some degree in regards to the processes of attention, encoding and retrieval.|$|E

5000|$|The {{direction}} of flow {{in and around}} a separator along with other flow instruments are usually illustrated on the Piping and instrumentation diagram, (P&ID). Some of these flow instruments include the Flow Indicator (FI), Flow Transmitter (FT) and the Flow Controller (FC). Flow {{is of paramount importance}} in {{the oil and gas industry}} because flow, as a major process variable is essentially important in that its understanding helps engineers come up with better designs and enables them to confidently carry out additional research. Mohan et al (1999) [...] carried out a research into the design and development of separators for a three-phase flow system. The purpose of the study was to investigate the complex multiphase hydrodynamic flow behaviour in a three-phase oil and gas separator. A <b>mechanistic</b> <b>model</b> was developed alongside a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulator. These were then used to carry out a detailed experimentation on the three-phase separator. The experimental and CFD simulation results were suitably integrated with the <b>mechanistic</b> <b>model.</b> The simulation time for the experiment was 20 seconds with the oil specific gravity as 0.885, and the separator lower part length and diameter were 4-ft and 3-inches respectively. The first set of experiment became a basis through which detailed investigations were used to carry out and to conduct similar simulation studies for different flow velocities and other operating conditions as well.|$|E

50|$|Although iatrochemistry and iatrophysics {{were similar}} in ways of thought, and also went hand-in-hand in many aspects, they also {{conflicted}} at times. For example, the concept of fermentation arose from iatrochemical background. A book on fermentation by Henri Louis de Rouviere (1708) connected fermentation with health. However, it also dismissed the relationship of mechanics with health and the <b>mechanistic</b> <b>model</b> of the body. Another conflict arose in explanation of digestion. While iatrophysicists explained the event through mechanistic terms, iatrochemists argued for fermentation {{as the reason for}} the digestive processes in the body. Furthermore, while iatrophysicists rejected acid-base theory as an explanation for bodily processes, iatrochemists embraced the theory.|$|E
40|$|In general, {{models of}} {{ecological}} {{systems can be}} broadly categorized as ’top-down’ or ’bottom-up’ models, based on the hierarchical level that the model processes are formulated on. The structure of a top-down, also known as phenomenological, population model can be interpreted in terms of population characteristics, but it typically lacks an interpretation on a more basic level. In contrast, bottom-up, also known as <b>mechanistic,</b> population <b>models</b> are derived from assumptions and processes on a more basic level, which allows interpretation of the model parameters in terms of individual behavior. Both approaches, phenomenological and <b>mechanistic</b> <b>modelling,</b> can have their advantages and disadvantages in different situations. However, mechanistically derived models might be better at capturing {{the properties of the}} system at hand, and thus give more accurate predictions. In particular, when models are used for evolutionary studies, <b>mechanistic</b> <b>models</b> are more appropriate, since natural selection takes place on the individual level, and in <b>mechanistic</b> <b>models</b> the direct connection between model parameters and individual properties has already been established. The purpose of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, a systematical way to derive <b>mechanistic</b> discrete-time population <b>models</b> is presented. The derivation is based on combining explicitly modelled, continuous processes on the individual level within a reproductive period with a discrete-time maturation process between reproductive periods. Secondly, {{as an example of how}} evolutionary studies can be carried out in <b>mechanistic</b> <b>models,</b> the evolution of the timing of reproduction is investigated. Thus, these two lines of research, derivation of <b>mechanistic</b> population <b>models</b> and evolutionary studies, are complementary to each other...|$|R

50|$|This <b>mechanistic</b> <b>model</b> {{raises the}} {{possibility}} that COI1 serves as an intracellular receptor for JA signals. Recent research has confirmed this hypothesis by demonstrating that the COI1-JAZ complex acts as a co-receptor for JA perception. Specifically, JA-Ile binds both to a ligand-binding pocket in COI1 and to a 20 amino-acid stretch of the conserved Jas motif in JAZ. This JAZ residue acts as a plug for the pocket in COI1, keeping JA-Ile bound in the pocket. Additionally, co-purification and subsequent removal of inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5) from COI1 suggest InsP5 is a necessary component of the co-receptor and plays a role in potentiating the co-receptor complex.|$|E

Until the mid-2000s, there was very little further development of foam fractionation or attempts to understand the underlying physics of the process.

They emphasized how several features of neuroanatomy may support the implementation of choice, including mutual inhibition in recurrent neural networks and the hierarchical organization of timescales for information processing across the cortex.|$|E
