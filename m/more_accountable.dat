5|$|William the Conqueror {{acquired}} {{the support of}} the Church for the invasion of England by promising ecclesiastical reform. William promoted celibacy amongst the clergy and gave ecclesiastical courts more power, but also reduced the Church's direct links to Rome and made it <b>more</b> <b>accountable</b> to the king. Tensions arose between these practices and the reforming movement of Pope Gregory VII, which advocated greater autonomy from royal authority for the clergy, condemned the practice of simony and promoted greater influence for the papacy in church matters. Despite the bishops continuing to play a major part in royal government, tensions emerged between the kings of England and key leaders within the English Church. Kings and archbishops clashed over rights of appointment and religious policy, and successive archbishops including Anselm, Theobald of Bec, Thomas Becket and Stephen Langton were variously forced into exile, arrested by royal knights or even killed. By the early 13th century, however, the church had largely won its argument for independence, answering almost entirely to Rome.|$|E

She also called for <b>more</b> <b>accountable</b> and effective administration of Indigenous affairs.

25|$|Evidence {{shows that}} cash {{can be more}} transparent, <b>more</b> <b>accountable,</b> more cost effective, help support local markets and economies, and {{increase}} financial inclusion and give people more digity and choice. Sending cash is cheaper as {{it does not have}} the same transaction costs as shipping goods. Sending cash is also faster than shipping the goods. In 2009 for sub-Saharan Africa, food bought locally by the WFP cost 34 percent less and arrived 100 days faster than food sent from the United States, where buying food from the United States is required by law. Cash aid also helps local food producers, usually the poorest in their countries, while imported food may damage their livelihoods and risk continuing hunger in the future.|$|E

25|$|In 2015 two Chabad schools, Yeshiva in Melbourne and Yeshiva in Bondi, {{came under}} the {{scrutiny}} of Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. As a result of testimony by victims such as Manny Waks, founder of Tzedek {{as well as by}} school officials and religious leaders, several rabbis in the Jewish community have resigned or been delisted. Philip Dalidakis, son of a Jewish immigrant and currently Southern Metropolitan Member of the Victorian Legislative Council, called on the Prime Minister and Premier to initiate action making the Chabad Yeshiva <b>more</b> <b>accountable.</b> He proposed that financial support from the government be withheld until all leaders who helped cover up abuse resign. He further called for the production of all reports, letters and emails related to the concealment of abuse, the creation and enforcement of clear, specific rules for Yeshiva leaders {{and the creation of a}} fund to compensate victims.|$|E

25|$|The duty of {{good faith}} {{requires}} control persons to exercise care and prudence in making business decisions—that is, the care that a {{reasonably prudent person}} in a similar position would use under similar circumstances. Control persons fail to act in good faith, even if their actions are not illegal, when they take actions for improper purposes or, in certain circumstances, when their actions have grossly inequitable results. The duty to act in good faith is an obligation not only to make decisions free from self-interest, but also free of any interest that diverts the control persons from acting {{in the best interest}} of the company. The duty to act in good faith may be measured by an individual's particular knowledge and expertise. The higher the level of expertise, the <b>more</b> <b>accountable</b> that person will be (e.g., a finance expert may be held to a more exacting standard than others in accepting a third party valuation).|$|E

25|$|Over the 20th century, {{companies}} in the UK became the dominant organisational form of economic activity, which raised concerns about how accountable those who controlled companies were to those who invested in them. The first reforms following the Great Depression, in the Companies Act 1948, ensured that directors could be removed by shareholders with a simple majority vote. In 1977, the government's Bullock Report proposed reform to allow employees to participate in selecting the board of directors, as was happening across Europe, exemplified by the German Codetermination Act 1976. However the UK never implemented the reforms, and from 1979 the debate shifted. Although making directors <b>more</b> <b>accountable</b> to employees was delayed, the Cork Report led to stiffer sanctions in the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 against directors who negligently ran companies at a loss. Through the 1990s the focus in corporate governance turned toward internal control mechanisms, such as auditing, separation of the chief executive position from the chair, and remuneration committees {{as an attempt to}} place some check on excessive executive pay. These rules applicable to listed companies, now found in the UK Corporate Governance Code, have been complemented by principles based regulation of institutional investors' activity in company affairs. At the same time, the UK's integration in the European Union meant a steadily growing body of EU Company Law Directives and case law to harmonise company law within the internal market.|$|E
25|$|Policies - Considered on {{the right}} of the party, Fraser {{supports}} far greater tax and spending powers for the Scottish Parliament in the form of further financial devolution. On 1 September, Fraser outlined his vision for 'New Unionism', with the intention of 'killing independence' and then to 'break the SNP'. He states that he rejects full fiscal autonomy for Scotland, calling it 'independence in disguise', but pledged his support for financial devolution, which he claims will make Parliament <b>more</b> <b>accountable</b> for the money it spends. On 4 September, Fraser made a high-profile announcement, that if elected leader, he would disband the party in favour of setting up a new centre-right party that would be fully autonomous of the UK Conservative Party, but would take the Conservative whip at Westminster. Fraser states that this would be carried out in order to 'de-toxify' the party in Scotland, stating that it would have a distinct Scottish identity, represent Scottish values, support devolution and decentralisation, and fight to maintain Scotland's place within the United Kingdom. He also would rename the party - ditching the name 'Conservative' – with possible new names cited as Scottish Reform Party, Scottish Unionists, The Scottish Progressives, the Progressive Conservatives, Scotland First, Scotland Forward, Caledonian Party or The Caledonians. The name 'Unionist' was downplayed, so as to avoid its connotations to Northern Ireland sectarianism, and a smaller Scottish Unionist Party also exists, rendering a change to this name impossible under electoral law.|$|E
