40|$|Abstract. A {{study of}} the flow {{properties}} of argon through an orifice has been performed with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The study covered {{the full extent of}} the transition regime between free-molecule and continuum flow, both in the upstream and downstream regions. Results for Mach number, number density, velocity and temperature are shown for three representative cases for a specified geometry with argon gas. The variation of <b>molecule</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> through the orifice and the variation of mass-thickness of the gas downstream of the orifice are given in the complete transition range. The molecule flow rates computed herewith show good agreement with previously published experimental measurements. The isentropic equations of a perfect gas are shown to reproduce the expected relationship between properties as a function of the computed Mach number in the continuum regime, but they clearly deviate elsewhere, as expected. The theoretical density function and flow rate agree well with the computed values in the free-molecule flow. However, the computed flow rate is less than the flow rate of a nozzle in the continuum flow. Empirical equations for both the characteristic speed and normalized number thickness have been derived and shown to predict well the values of any gas, for all practical purposes...|$|E

To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} height, external pressure, and bladder fullness on the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> in continuous, non-continuous cystoscopy and the automated irrigation fluid pumping system (AIFPS). Materials. Each experiment had two 2 -litre 0. 9 % saline bags connected to a continuous, non-continuous cystoscope or AIFPS via irrigation tubing. Other equipment included height-adjustable drip poles, uroflowmetry devices, and model bladders. Methods. In Experiment 1, saline bags were elevated to measure the increment in <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> In Experiment 2, saline bags were placed under external pressures to evaluate the effect on <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> In Experiment 3, <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> changes in response to variable bladder fullness were measured.

40|$|As highway systems {{become more}} congested, it becomes {{increasingly}} {{important to understand}} the reliability with which we can estimate important performance measures such as volume to capacity ratios, particularly as we move toward leveraging field infrastructure to obtain real-time performance measures. In 1947, Greenshields wrote a paper that characterized “green time consumed” by “car-in-line-number” that ultimately was called headway. Average headway is one of principles used by the highway capacity manual to estimate saturation <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> at signalized intersections. However, the current analytical techniques calculate a deterministic value for saturation <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> that does not consider the stochastic variation of saturation <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> This paper reviews techniques used to estimate saturation <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> and proposes enhanced calculation methods to group saturation <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> estimates by queue length. Grouping saturation <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> estimates by queue length provides a convenient framework to evaluate saturation <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> reliability. The inter-quartile range (25 % - 75 %) of saturation <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> was calculated to be 1000 vph based on Greenshields’ calculation techniques.

Because saturation <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> is a fundamental input to volume-to-capacity performance measures, characterizing the stochastic variation of saturation <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> provides a basic input for assessing how reliably one can estimate important performance measures such as volume-to-capacity ratios, as well as other performance measures that build upon volume-to-capacity ratios...|$|R
