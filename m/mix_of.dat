The analysis suggests that heterocoordination leading to the formation of complex SiFe 2 is likely to exist in the liquid and is of a strongly interacting nature.

40|$|We prove {{comparison}} {{results for}} the Swendsen-Wang (SW) dynamics, the heat-bath (HB) dynamics for the Potts model and the single-bond (SB) dynamics for the random-cluster model on arbitrary graphs. In particular, we prove that rapid <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> HB implies rapid <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> SW on graphs with bounded maximum degree and that rapid <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> SW and rapid <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> SB are equivalent. Additionally, the spectral gap of SW and SB on planar graphs is bounded from above and from below by the spectral gap of these dynamics on the corresponding dual graph with suitably changed temperature. As a consequence we obtain rapid <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> the Swendsen-Wang dynamics for the Potts model on the two-dimensional square lattice at all non-critical temperatures as well as rapid mixing for the two-dimensional Ising model at all temperatures. Furthermore, we obtain new results for general graphs at high or low enough temperatures. Comment: Ph. D. thesis, 66 page...|$|R

MD 5 turns northwest, heading through woodland and reaching Morganza, where the route intersects MD 242 (Colton Point Road). The road heads west through a <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> woods and farms to Helen, where MD 5 comes to an intersection with MD 238 (Chaptico Road). Here, the route turns north, with residential neighborhoods increasing along the road as it continues through rural areas. The route passes east of a park and ride lot before it comes to another intersection with MD 235 (Three Notch Road) in Oraville, where MD 5 makes a left turn onto Three Notch Road, a four-lane divided highway. The route heads northwest through a <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> rural residences and businesses, with the median widening briefly to include some businesses when the route reaches Mechanichsville. The road continues through rural commercial areas before reaching Charlotte Hall. Here, the median widens again and MD 5 intersects MD 236 (Thompson Corner Road) and MD 6 (New Market Turner Road). From here, the median narrows again as the route turns {{to the north and}} continues through a <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> farms and woods with some businesses, with MD 863 looping off to the east of MD 5 and serving a farmers market.|$|E
