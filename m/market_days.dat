After the sentence had been carried out a county coroner would visit Halifax and convene a jury of 12men, sometimes the same individuals who had found the felon guilty, and ask them to give an account under oath of the circumstances of the conviction and execution, for the official records.|$|E
5|$|By the 1780s, {{local farmers}} {{had begun to}} hold {{informal}} <b>market</b> <b>days,</b> and advertised the town's ideal location between London, Chatham and the Kent Coast. The market {{was held in the}} High Street until 1856, when local farmers and businessmen relocated to Elwick Road and formed a market company that is the oldest surviving registered company in England and Wales. There is still a regular street market in the town, but the market company relocated outside Ashford town centre after part of the 19th-century site was demolished {{to make way for the}} Channel Tunnel Rail Link. It is still used by around 5,000 farmers.|$|E
5|$|Henry III of England {{granted a}} market to the Bishop of Ely using letters close on 9April 1224 {{although}} Ely {{had been a}} trading centre prior to this.

The city is situated on the River Great Ouse, which was a significant means of transport until the fens were drained and Ely ceased to be {{an island in the}} eighteenth century.

5|$|The {{market place}} at the centre of Poulton is the width of two streets and is now closed to motor traffic. Lying south of St Chad's Church and {{surrounded}} by shops, the square contains the town's war memorial {{as well as a}} market cross, stocks, whipping post and fish slabs, from which fish were sold on <b>market</b> <b>days.</b> Although many of the buildings surrounding the market place were rebuilt following a fire in the 18thcentury, a few of the earlier buildings remain. To the south of the market place are town houses that were built for local merchants and professionals.|$|E
5|$|The Hanoverian {{succession}} to {{the throne}} of Great Britain led to reigns with less ceremony than in any since the incorporation of the heralds. The only notable incident for the college in this period, {{during the reign of}} George I, happened in 1727 when an impostor called Robert Harman pretended to be a herald. The knave was prosecuted by the College in the county of Suffolk, and was sentenced to be pilloried in several market towns on public <b>market</b> <b>days</b> and afterwards to be imprisoned and pay a fine. This hefty sentence was executed, proving that the rights of the College were still respected. In 1737, during the reign of George II the College petitioned for another charter, to reaffirm their rights and remuneration; this effort proved unsuccessful. Apart from these events the influence of the College was greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|While burghs {{acted as}} centres of basic crafts. These {{included}} {{the manufacture of}} shoes, clothes, dishes, pots, joinery, bread and ale, which would normally be sold to inhabitants and visitors on <b>market</b> <b>days.</b> However, there were relatively few developed manufacturing industries in Scotland {{for most of this}} period. By the late fifteenth century, there were the beginnings of a native iron-casting industry, which led to the production of cannon and of the silver and goldsmithing for which the country would later be known. As a result, the most important exports were unprocessed raw materials, including wool, hides, salt, fish, animals and coal, while Scotland remained frequently short of wood, iron and, in years of bad harvests, grain, which was imported in large quantities, particularly from the Baltic ports, through Berwick and Ayr.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} defended in medieval times by Bristol Castle, a Norman {{fortification}} {{built on the}} site of a wooden predecessor. The castle {{played a key role in}} the civil wars that followed the death of Henry I. Stephen of Blois reconnoitred Bristol in 1138 and claimed that the town was impregnable. After Stephen's capture, in 1141, he was imprisoned in the castle. The castle was later taken into royal hands, and Henry III spent lavishly on it, adding a barbican before the main west gate, a gate tower, and a magnificent hall. By the 16th century, the castle had fallen into disuse, but the city authorities had no control over royal property, and so the castle became a refuge for lawbreakers. In 1630, the city purchased the castle; Oliver Cromwell ordered its destruction in 1656. An area outside the castle, known as Old Market, was used as a mustering point for troops. It later became a market for the country people to set up stalls and sell their wares. Old Market was also the site of an autumn fair. The market may have existed as early as the 12th century, and was the site of the first suburb outside the city walls. It had side roads which could accommodate the traffic on <b>market</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

25|$|Monday 26 April was market day; {{there were}} more than 10,000 people in the former Basque capital. Generally speaking, a market day would have {{attracted}} people from the surrounding areas to Guernica to conduct business. <b>Market</b> <b>days</b> consisted of local farmers bringing in their crops to sell to the village people. They would bring the crops of the week’s labour to the main square, which is where the market was held.|$|E

25|$|Retail {{markets have}} existed since ancient times. Archaeological {{evidence}} for trade, probably involving barter systems, dates {{back more than}} 10,000 years. As civilizations grew, barter was replaced with retail trade involving coinage. Selling and buying {{is thought to have}} emerged in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) in around the 7th millenium BCE. Gharipour points to evidence of primitive shops and trade centres in Sialk Hills in Kashan (6,000 BCE), Catalk Huyuk in modern-day Turkey (7,500–5,700 BCE), Jericho (2,600 BCE) and Susa (4,000 BCE). Open air, public markets were known in ancient Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenicia and Egypt. These markets typically occupied a place in the town's centre. Surrounding the market, skilled artisans, such as metal-workers and leather workers, occupied permanent premises in alleys that led to the open market-place. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on <b>market</b> <b>days.</b> In ancient Greece markets operated within the agora, an open space where, on <b>market</b> <b>days,</b> goods were displayed on mats or temporary stalls. In ancient Rome, trade took place in the forum. Rome had two forums; the Forum Romanum and Trajan's Forum. The latter was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with shops on four levels. The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shop-front. In antiquity, exchange involved direct selling via merchants or peddlers and bartering systems were commonplace.|$|E

In 1050 a significant settlement of Jews is noted in official documents, and the Codex of the monastery in Hirsau documented Heilbronn's right to hold <b>market</b> <b>days</b> and mint coins, mentioning its harbor and vineyards as well. The name of the city became a widespread Jewish surname in many varieties, see Heilprin.|$|E
