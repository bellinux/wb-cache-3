5|$|Among Denmark's most {{successful}} contemporary photographers are Jacob Aue Sobol, who gained recognition for captivating portraits of his Greenlandic girlfriend, and Per Bak Jensen, who {{introduced a new}} perspective to modern landscape photography. Press photography has prospered too under award-winning contributors such as Jan Grarup and Claus Bjørn Larsen, who have covered wars and conflicts of global importance over the past 20 years. Photography is an interesting hobby for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the world. In 1944, I took {{a photo of a}} car from my digital camera and yesterday, I found that photo. Travelling back in time, photography wasn’t as simple as ‘smile and click’ as we see today. Back in 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! Technology is great, isn’t it? The first every digital camera to be created was in December 1975. It was developed by an engineer in Kodak Company and took 23 seconds to create first photograph. The camera only recorded black and white photographs of 0.1 mega pixels. The camera weighed 8 pounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot with the {{anamorphic}} process. Peckinpah and his cinematographer, Lucien Ballard, also {{made use of}} telephoto lenses, that allowed for objects and people in both the background and foreground to be compressed in perspective. The effect is best seen in the shots where the Bunch makes the walk to Mapache's headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes {{between them and the}} camera; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the foreground are as sharply focused as the Bunch. The editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together in rapid succession, often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the action and the gunfights.|$|E
5|$|As the {{two worlds}} begin to merge, Dusk and Alba reveal their {{plans to go to}} the ancient {{floating}} city known as Mysidia. Once the Warriors of Light arrive and meet the Elder of Mysidia, Sophia, the Avalon Empire attempt to strike Mysidia with their airship superweapon Heliogabalus. The warriors destroy the ship with the aid of Dr. Lugae, the living doll Argy, and Barbara and her dragons. Sophia then helps the warriors gain the last remaining crystal in the World of Light within the caves of Mysidia. After gaining the crystal's ability, Mysidia falls to the ground while simultaneously the Warriors of Darkness are aided by a mysterious man known as The Mask in gaining the last crystal fragment remaining in the World of Darkness. They succeed in gaining the fragment, however The Mask dies. Before his death, he reveals himself to be Elgo's other half that formed when the world split in two and asks the Warriors of Darkness {{to take care of his}} other Half as he dies. After both parties gain the fragments, the split world merges and both parties are reunited, however <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the world have disappeared. Attempting to make a frontal attack to the Avalon Empire, the warriors discover a barrier protecting Avalon and eight gates across the world, linking to a realm called the Rift. Upon entering one of the gates, the warriors encounter a dark sphere in which Sophia explains it is a substance found only in the Rift known as Dark Matter, and that Avalon's goal is to harvest it for their evil purposes. Vata explains the Avalon Empire is guarding the dark matter across the world with their generals, who have been revived in undead forms. After collecting all eight pieces of the dark matter and defeating the undead generals, the dark matter fuses together, creating a new crystal and revealing that the crystal split the world to protect itself from the Empire's plans. The crystal then breaks the barrier that was protecting Avalon, allowing the warriors to enter.|$|E

25|$|The Hindu Ayurvedic texts {{describe}} {{both the}} beneficent uses of alcoholic beverages {{and the consequences}} of intoxication and alcoholic diseases. Ayurvedic texts concluded that alcohol was a medicine if consumed in moderation, but a poison if consumed in excess. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> India and China, have continued, throughout, to ferment a portion of their crops and nourish themselves with the alcoholic product.|$|E
25|$|The Pangasinan people, like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the Malay Archipelago, are {{descendants}} of the Austronesian-speakers who settled in Southeast Asia since prehistoric times.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the colonies in the East Indies, from {{the second half of}} the 19th century onwards, the Netherlands envisaged expansion of Dutch in its colonies in the West Indies. Until 1863, when slavery was abolished in the West Indies, slaves were forbidden to speak Dutch, with the effect that local creoles such as Papiamento and Sranan Tongo which were based not on Dutch but rather other European languages, became common in the Dutch West Indies. However, as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the Colony of Surinam (now Suriname) worked on Dutch plantations, this reinforced the use of Dutch as a means for direct communication.|$|E
25|$|Mashinini {{was born}} in Rosettenville, a white suburb of Johannesburg. Her family lived in the {{backyard}} of a house where her mother, Joana, did housework. When Mashinini was six years old, her family moved to Prospect Township, a neighbourhood near City Deep. Prospect Township was a common destination for Black families who had been evicted from their residence in White areas. In 1936, this neighbourhood too was aggressively gentrified, razed under the Johannesburg Slums Act of 1934. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Prospect Township were relocated to Orlando, Soweto, but Mashinini's family was able to resettle in Sophiatown. Sophiatown was forcibly evicted in turn, several years later, and Mashinini's family moved to Soweto.|$|E
25|$|In {{another attempt}} to help their situation, {{a small group of}} volunteers take a trip to the {{neighboring}} pharmacy to gather medical supplies. However, things go horribly wrong and two people are killed by giant spiders, causing <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the market to side with Mrs. Carmody. Two soldiers commit suicide, and a third, Private Jessup, reveals that the local military base was filled with rumors about the Arrowhead Project, the government's attempt to look into other dimensions, and that the scientists responsible for the experiment may have inadvertently opened a doorway into a dimension containing the creatures that are now invading the town. Mrs. Carmody convinces her followers to blame Jessup and he is stabbed and ejected from the store, quickly falling prey to a large praying mantis-like creature.|$|E

25|$|Since then, {{tourism in}} Nepal has thrived; {{it is the}} country's most {{important}} industry. Tourism is {{a major source of}} income for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the city, with several hundred thousand visitors annually. Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims {{from all over the world}} visit Kathmandu's religious sites such as Pashupatinath, Swayambhunath, Boudhanath and Budhanilkantha. From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62, the number increased to 491,504 in 1999/2000. Following the end of the Maoist insurgency, there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009. Since then, tourism has improved as the country turned into the Democratic Republic. In economic terms, the foreign exchange registered 3.8% of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining. The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country.|$|E
25|$|Outside of Tibeto-Burman, {{one finds}} in Arunachal Pradesh a single {{representative}} of the Tai family, spoken by tribes like the Khampti and Singpho, which is closely affiliated to the Shan language of Myanmar's Shan State. Seemingly, Khampti is a recent arrival in Arunachal Pradesh whose presence dates to 18th and/or early 19th-century migrations from northern Myanmar. In addition to these non-Indo-European languages, the Indo-European languages Assamese, Bengali, English, Nepali and especially Hindi are making strong inroads into Arunachal Pradesh. Primarily {{as a result of}} the primary education system—in which classes are generally taught by Hindi-speaking immigrant teachers from Bihar and other Hindi-speaking parts of northern India, a large and growing section of the population now speaks a semi-creolized variety of Hindi as a mother tongue. Hindi acts as a lingua franca for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the state. Despite, or perhaps because of, the linguistic diversity of the region, English is the only official language recognised in the state.|$|E

500|$|Mesa Verdean villages thrived {{during the}} mid-Pueblo III Era, when architects {{constructed}} massive, multi-story buildings, and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs. Structures built {{during this period}} {{have been described as}} [...] "among the world's greatest archaeological treasures". Pueblo III masonry buildings were typically occupied for approximately fifty years, more than double the usable lifespan of the Pueblo II jacal structures. Others were continuously inhabited for two hundred years or more. Architectural innovations such as towers and multi-walled structures also appear during the Pueblo III Era. Mesa Verde's population remained fairly stable during the 12th century drought. At the start of the 13th century, approximately 22,000 people lived there. The area saw moderate population increases during the following decades, and dramatic ones from 1225 to 1260. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the region lived in the plains west of the mesa at locations such as Yellow Jacket Pueblo, near Cortez, Colorado. Others colonized canyon rims and slopes in multi-family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled. By 1260, the majority of Mesa Verdeans lived in large pueblos that housed several families and more than one hundred people.|$|E
