40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to modelling carangiform fish-like swimming motion for multi-joint robotic fish {{so that they can}} obtain fish-like behaviours and mimic the body motion of carangiform fish. A given body <b>motion</b> <b>function</b> of fish swimming is firstly converted to a tail <b>motion</b> <b>function</b> which describes the tail motion relative to the head. Then, the tail <b>motion</b> <b>function</b> is discretized into a series of tail postures over time. Thirdly, a digital approximation method calculates the turning angles of joints in the tail to approximate each tail posture; and finally, these angles are grouped into a look-up table, or regressed to a time-dependent function, for practically controlling the tail motors in a multi-joint robotic fish. The paper made three contributions: tail motion relative to the head, an error function for digital approximation and regressing a look- up table for online optimization. To prove the feasibility of the proposed methodology, two basic swimming motion patterns, cruise straight and C-shape sharp turning, are modelled and implemented in our robotic fish. The experimental results show that the relative tail motion and the approximation error function are good choices and the proposed method is feasible...|$|E

40|$|Non-linear (NL) ground <b>motion</b> {{amplification}} <b>functions</b> {{have been}} developed for fine grained and highly organic soils using ground response analysis for two profiles in the Kushiro area of Hokkaido, Japan. The NL ground <b>motion</b> amplification <b>functions</b> will support a broader research effort to develop fragility functions for levees resting on organic soils in Hokkaido. The ground <b>motion</b> amplification <b>functions</b> were developed using one-dimensional (1 D) NL ground response simulations in DEEPSOIL (Hashash et al. 2016) based on a suite of earthquake ground motions compiled by Baker (Baker et al. 2011). Corrections to the small-strain Darendeli (2001) modulus reduction curve for fine grained soil recommended by Yee et al. (2013) were used to realistically represent the large-strain portion of backbone curves by asymptotically approaching the shear strength at large strains. The GQ/H material model (Groholski, 2016) in DEEPSOIL was utilized to preserve the input undrained shear strength while still providing the ability to represent small-strain stiffness nonlinearity. The resulting ground motion amplification values, defined as the spectral acceleration of the surface motion divided by the spectral acceleration of the input outcrop motion, was regressed using the functional form for NL site ground motion amplification by Stewart et al. (2014). Ground <b>motion</b> amplification <b>functions</b> for organic soils in the Sacramento / San Joaquin Delta were previously developed by Kishida, et al. (2006 and 2009 a) using 1 D equivalent-linear (EL) ground response analysis (GRA) that were subsequently regressed to derive ground <b>motion</b> amplification <b>functions.</b> These simulations utilized linear and nonlinear regression models for dynamic properties of highly organic soils through ongoing research on this topic that was ultimately concluded by Kishida et al. (2009 b). However, {{it is not clear whether}} these ground <b>motion</b> amplification <b>functions</b> are applicable to the Hokkaido system due to differences in the Peat layers in Hokkaido compared with the Delta, nor is it clear the extent to which the equivalent linear assumption influenced the ground <b>motion</b> amplification <b>functions.</b> This thesis also presents a brief comparison between the NL ground <b>motion</b> amplification <b>functions</b> developed herein and the EL ground <b>motion</b> amplification <b>functions</b> for highly organic soils presented by Kishida et al.

40|$|Motion {{prediction}} of various objects {{is important for}} work of many people. We have to distinguish between near and distant time prediction queries. The trajectory of an object represented by mathematical functions {{can be used for}} near time prediction. These formulas are often called motion functions and they use recent movements to predict future locations of the objects. It is impossible to use simple mathematical formulas to evaluate distant time queries, because the movement trajectory between current and distant future time can alter widely. Trajectory pattern of an object is suitable prediction method to take into account for both near and distant time queries. Consequently, data mining methods can mine trajectory patterns from historic movements and these patterns can be used to predict the future objects movement. The best contemporary methods exploit combination of trajectory pattern method and <b>motion</b> <b>function.</b> This means that in case no trajectory pattern is found, the <b>motion</b> <b>function</b> is used to determine object near location. Using the trajectory pattern prediction principle a new approach to optimize communication between client and server in large virtual environments is introduced.
