40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{evaluate}} the evolution of vegetation and land-cover practices particularly changes in tree cover, shrubs and mixed vegetation during 1994 to 2014. The rapid urbanization in Lahore has now converted the city into a second largest metropolitan city of the country which, in consequence, is affecting the land cover. Keeping in mind these facts, analyses are performed using calibrated satellite images of the year 1994, 2003 and 2014 in GIS environment coupled with ERDAS Imagine.

50|$|Communities may use zoning {{codes to}} isolate noisy urban {{activities}} from areas {{that should be}} protected from such unhealthy exposures and to establish noise standards in areas {{that may not be}} conducive to such isolation strategies. Because low-income neighborhoods are often at greater risk of noise pollution, the establishment of such zoning codes is often an environmental justice issue. <b>Mixed</b> <b>use</b> <b>areas</b> present especially difficult conflicts that require special attention to the need to protect people from the harmful effects of noise pollution. Noise is generally one consideration in an environmental impact statement, if applicable (such as transportation system construction).|$|R

50|$|Angle {{parking is}} very common in car parking lots. It may also be used in streetside car parking in the U.S. when there is more width {{available}} for car parking than would be needed for parallel parking of cars, as it creates {{a larger number of}} parking spaces. Some cities have utilized angled parking on-street (as compared to off-street parking facilities). This has been done mostly in residential, retail and <b>mixed</b> <b>use</b> <b>areas</b> where additional parking compared to parallel parking is desired and traffic volumes are lower. Most angled parking is design in a head-in configuration while a few cities (Seattle, Portland, Baltimore, and Indianapolis are examples) have some back-in angled parking (typically on hills or low traffic volume streets).|$|R

40|$|Koahsiung, {{the largest}} {{industrial}} harbor city in Taiwan, is in {{a stage of}} transition, characterized {{by the presence of}} urban evolution after the economic upswing brought about by industry in the last few decades. The confused relationship between the people and their environment provides evidence of this transition. Two issues concerning the urban environment of Koahsiung at present are: first, the centeral urban areas faces growth pressures because of the strengthening of the city function; and second, industries in the urban area create spatial dilemmas in efforts to address questions of urban growth. Undesirable form of <b>mixed</b> land <b>use</b> and degradation of the environment are obvious problems. Understanding their origin and exploring opportunities for solving them will mean investigating closely the relationship between the industry and urban development.

40|$|This {{application}} {{was made on}} or after January 1, 2007 and {{is subject to the}} new provisions of the Planning Act and the City of Toronto Act, 2006. The zoning by-law amendment application seeks a revision to a previously approved residential development to provide flexibility to the current zoning by permitting rear lane townhouses. This application to amend the zoning by-law proposes to permit the redevelopment of the property at 300 Danforth Road with approximately 258 to 281 dwelling units in a variety of housing forms, such as stacked townhouses, rear lane townhouses, street townhouses and semi-detached units. The current density which provides for a total of 348 dwelling units will remain unchanged. The proposed land use is consistent with the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Area</b> and Neighbourhood policies of the City’s Official Plan. The proposal implements objectives of the Warden Woods Community Secondary Plan. The zoning by-law amendment will allow for the appropriate development of the site, compatible with the surrounding development.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Pedestrians {{are always}} near to {{vehicular}} traffic and street-side activities, chief sources of outdoor air pollution, and are directly exposed to it. Different activities produce pollutants, which affects pedestrians directly. In this thesis, it was {{tried to find}} the level of exposure and sources of PM 2. 5, {{one of the six}} ‘criteria pollutants’ designated by United States Environmental Protection Agency, along a roadways in a busy <b>mixed</b> <b>use</b> <b>area</b> in International District, Seattle, which has a good connectivity to transit. The aim of this experiment is to find out sources of PM 2. 5 emission that affects pedestrians directly while walking, and its level/concentration. The data was collected while walking {{with the help of a}} backpack nephelometer, in both winter (Dec 31 st, 2014 - Jan 9 th, 2015) and spring (March 21 st - March 30 th, 2015) seasons, for 3 times a day, 20 days total to find out pollution levels at different times of a day and seasonal trends. Field collected data was also compared with the nearby fixed-site monitoring stations to understand the difference, if any, between the data recorded and the actual level of pollution pedestrians are exposed to. The result shows that winter is more polluted than spring, and in morning pollution level is much higher than other times of the day. The reasons behind the pollution have been identified as vehicular traffic, construction activity and roadside smoking, along with weather condition. A linear regression model was fit to observe whether the pollutant level at near road are similar to monitoring station data, and was also subjected to ANOVA test. However, it has been acknowledged that several factors may affect the difference between the two, which could not be fitted exactly in a linear model, rather than providing a probabilistic scenario...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} retrofitting existing suburbs to deliver more sustainable lifestyles. The policy of intensification of existing urban and suburban areas {{is referred to as}} a ‘compact city’ strategy. This strategy has been promoted by the UK Government and is linked to claims that higher density, <b>mixed</b> <b>use</b> <b>areas</b> promote more sustainable lifestyles. Whilst the policy is normally considered at the ‘strategic’ level, it is at the local level that its effects are felt and realised. The research answered two research questions ‘Is it physically feasible to retrofit the existing suburban areas?’ And if so ‘do they deliver the claimed sustainability benefits?’ The research used the recommendations within the Urban Task Force report for restructuring existing urban form. The project found that retrofitting the suburbs is feasible and viable at the local level. In some situations it can enable more sustainable lifestyles; in particular improved accessibility, social inclusion and improved physical and mental health benefits...|$|R
