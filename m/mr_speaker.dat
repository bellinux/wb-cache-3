5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Speaker,</b> that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

500|$|Lee later lamented: [...] "Malaysia — to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, <b>Mr</b> <b>Speaker,</b> Sir. But sometimes, {{sitting in}} this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian. This is the doubt that hangs over many minds, and ... {{emotions}} are set in motion, and men pitted against men along these unspoken lines, you will {{have the kind of}} warfare that will split the nation from top to bottom and undo Malaysia." [...] At times, however, Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own. Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia, reminding listeners that the non-Malays were now in the majority, with 61% of the population to the Malays' 39% asking at one point, [...] "Why should we go back to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?" [...] Lee exacerbated deteriorating PAP-UMNO relations by constantly demanding that the federal government [...] "smack down their 'ultras'", whose ranks included prominent UMNO leaders such as Syed Jaafar Albar and Syed Nasir Ismail.|$|E

In line with their commitment to equality, the DAP originally campaigned against Bumiputra privileges, such as those afforded to them by Article 153 of the Constitution. They also continued Lee Kuan Yew's campaign for a Malaysian Malaysia, the idea of which was originally conveyed by Lee in Parliament: [...] "Malaysia – to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, <b>Mr</b> <b>Speaker,</b> Sir. But sometimes, sitting in this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the way <b>Mr.</b> <b>Speaker,</b> did {{you know}} that I am a {{military}} hero?

2500|$|Lee also criticised the government's {{policies}} {{by stating}} that [...] "hey, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens {{to go up to}} the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." [...] He also lamented [...] "Malaysia—to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, <b>Mr</b> <b>Speaker,</b> Sir.

Also severely damaged was the Byzantine Cotton Genesis, the illustrations of which nevertheless remain an important record of Late Antique iconography. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Speaker</b> Onslow, as one of the statutory trustees of the library, directed and personally supervised a remarkable programme of restoration within the resources of his time. [...] The published report of this work is of major importance in bibliography. Fortunately, copies had been made of some, but by no means all, of those works that were lost, and many of those damaged could be restored in the nineteenth century.|$|E
