To assess changes in precipitation extremes in a given region, it is essential to analyze decadal oscillations in precipitation extremes. This study examines temporal oscillations in precipitation data in several sub-regions of Iran using a novel quantile perturbation method during 1980 - 2010. Precipitation data from NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications-Land (MERRA-Land) are used in this study. The results indicate significant anomalies in precipitation extremes in the northwest and southeast regions of Iran. Analysis of extreme precipitation perturbations reveals that perturbations for the <b>monthly</b> <b>aggregation</b> level are generally lower than the annual perturbations. Furthermore, high-oscillation and low-oscillation periods are found in extreme precipitation quantiles across different seasons.

Methods A retrospective, population-based study design was used to assess temporal patterns in hospitalisations for asthma from April 1, 1988 to March 31, 2000. Approximately 14 million residents of Ontario eligible for universal healthcare coverage during this time were included for analysis.

Included within this total are 22 males and 21 females implanted with Vemco V 16 ® acoustic tags. Fifty-nine conventionally tagged fish (9. 1 % of the total) were recaptured over 15 months, with 38 (64. 4 %) of those taken within the spawning season (January-May). The latter total includes 20 fish recaptured within the KMS by taggers and 18 by fishers outside the sanctuary. Of the fish taken outside the sanctuary, five were from unknown locations, while 82 % were captured within 10 - 12 km of the KMS, including 25 of 39 fish taken from channels immediately {{adjacent to the}} spawning site.

Recent studies have indicated a statistically significant seasonal component to atrial fibrillation hospitalizations. Methods We conducted a retrospective population cohort study using time series analysis to evaluate seasonal patterns of atrial fibrillation hospitalizations for the province of Ontario for the years 1988 to 2001. Five different series methods were {{used to analyze the}} data, including spectral analysis, X 11, R-Squared, autocorrelation function and <b>monthly</b> <b>aggregation.</b> Results This study found evidence of weak seasonality, most apparent at aggregate levels including both ages and sexes. There was dramatic increase in hospitalizations for atrial fibrillation over the years studied and an age dependent increase in rates per 100, 000. Overall, the magnitude of seasonal difference between peak and trough months is in the order of 1. 4 admissions per 100, 000 population. The peaks for hospitalizations were predominantly in April, and the troughs in August. Conclusions Our study confirms statistical evidence of seasonality for atrial fibrillation hospitalizations. This effect is small in absolute terms and likely not significant for policy or etiological research purposes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The mottled grouper, Mycteroperca rubra, is {{the most}} {{abundant}} grouper in the shallow rocky habitats < 40 m depth along the eastern Mediterranean. A study carried out from May 1999 to July 2002 revealed that the fish reaches a length of over 83. 5 cm (total length), which is the longest reported for M. rubra. The growth equation {{was found to be}} total length(cm) = 15. 192 *Ln(age(years)) + 31. 108. The size and growth rate of this fish found along the Israeli coast contradict the "Levantine nanism theory". M. rubra is a protogenic hermaphrodite. Females become sexually mature at the age of 2 + years and the youngest male found was 3 +years. The oldest female and male examined during the research were 13 + and 19 + years respectively. The breeding season along the Israeli coast is from February-March to the end of May. During this period <b>monthly</b> <b>aggregations</b> of up to 500 fish were observed at traditional sites. Estimated female fecundity was found to be ca. 570, 000 oocytes X weight (kg). Fish comprised 98 % of the stomach content of the mottled groupers. A single prey, Siganus spp., made up ca. 68 % of the food biomass. We suggest that the success of the mottled grouper in establishing a large population in the eastern Mediterranean has been mainly due to the opening of the Suez Canal that enabled the invasion of Indo Pacific Siganus spp., which is its main food source...|$|R

We present {{an analysis of}} long-term (14 years: Jan 1998 - Dec 2011) changes in {{box jellyfish}} abundance at Waikiki Beach. We tested the relationship of beach counts to climate and biogeochemical variables over time in the North Pacific Sub-tropical Gyre (NPSG). Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Change-Point Analysis (CPA), and General Regression Models (GRM) were used to characterize patterns in box jellyfish arrival at Waikiki Beach 8 - 12 days following 173 consecutive full moons. Variation in box jellyfish abundance lacked seasonality, but exhibited dramatic differences among months and among years, and followed an oscillating pattern with significant periods of increase (1998 - 2001; 2006 - 2011) and decrease (2001 - 2006). Of three climatic and 12 biogeochemical variables examined, box jellyfish showed a strong, positive relationship with primary production, > 2 mm zooplankton biomass, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index. It is clear that that the moon cycle {{plays a key role}} in synchronizing timing of the arrival of Alatina moseri medusae to shore.

30|$|The {{first step}} of the {{modelling}} has shown that BioSTAR was able to predict the aggregated yearly yields for winter wheat and maize in the region at a satisfactory level of accuracy, but individual years stand out with stronger than average (9.6 % for maize and 11.2 % for winter wheat) deviation of up to 31.7 % from the observed yield. Possible explanations for these model deviations lie in {{the resolution of the}} input data. Both the climate and the soil data used for the simulations are strongly aggregated datasets. The climate data is a <b>monthly</b> <b>aggregation</b> from five representative climate stations in the region, and the soil data has been aggregated into 35 soil types and nFK classes. Additionally, only homogenous soil profiles have been assumed as inputs for the model. All these aggregations make it possible to predict biomass potentials and their spatial distribution for a large region, like the region of Hannover, with a reasonable amount of time and work input. Previous BioSTAR validation procedures with non-aggregated climate and soil data have produced better fits of observed and predicted yield data [24]. The biomass potential calculation presented in this article serves as a demonstration of the method itself and to give an overview and comparison of the relative biomass potentials of maize and the two modelled alternative energy crops, triticale and cup plant. Depending on the exactness and resolution of the input data, a higher degree of model prediction accuracy can be achieved.|$|E

We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature to assess the presence of an infradian rhythm of this disease. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to January 2010. Monthly and seasonal variation in the incidence of VTE were analysed. We included studies analysing seasonal or <b>monthly</b> <b>aggregation</b> in the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) with an objective diagnosis of VTE. Two authors independently reviewed and extracted data. Seventeen studies for a total of about 35, 000 patients were included. Twelve studies analysed the seasonal variation and 10 studies the monthly variation of VTE. Our results showed a significantly increased incidence of VTE in winter (chi-square 146. 04, p < 0. 001), with a relative risk (RR) of VTE of 1. 143 (99 % CI [1. 141, 1. 144]), and a significantly increased incidence of VTE in January (chi-square 232. 57, p < 0. 001) with an RR of VTE of 1. 194 (99 % CI 1. 186, 1. 203). Subgroup analyses including only idiopathic venous thromboembolic events confirmed the results of principal analyses. In conclusion, our data support the presence of an infradian pattern in the incidence of venous thromboembolic events, with a significantly higher risk in Winter and in January.

40|$|Regional impact {{assessments}} {{of climate change}} on hydrological extremes require robust examinations of climate model simulations. The climate models may satisfy mean statistics but fail to reproduce extreme quantiles which are crucial for applications of climate change impact analysis on water resources. Through statistical analysis, this paper evaluates and inter-compares the performance of Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations {{for their ability to}} predict changes in hydrological extremes for given locations or catchments in the Nile basin. Two catchments were considered: Katonga and Ruizi catchments in the Lake Victoria basin. Models that differ significantly from the observed extremes were considered unreliable for impact assessments on hydrological extremes. A graphical approach (rainfall quantile/frequency analysis), which allows for easy spotting of discordant models, in combination with several statistics, was used to evaluate 18 GCM control simulations against observed rainfall data. Standard deviation, coefficient of variation and root mean squared error (about the mean) of the observed rainfall, were used to derive error margins against which GCM simulations were evaluated. Model results outside the error margins were considered inconsistent with the observed rainfall. Model inter-comparison was also carried out for the rainfall change projections till the 2050 s and 2090 s through analysis of perturbations and percentage changes based on A 1 B. A 2. and B 1 SRES scenarios. It is noted that the GCM outputs are more consistent in reproducing rainfall signatures at annual aggregation level than at <b>monthly</b> <b>aggregation</b> levels with tendency of overestimation of the rainfall depths but with significant variation among different GCM simulations. The GCMs perform better in reproducing rainfall frequency with higher return periods compared with lower return periods. Most of the GCMs perform better for the wet months than the drier months. The GCMs CGCM 3. 2 a, CM 3. O, CM 4. 1, PCM 1, CGCM 3. 1 T 47, MIROC 3. 2. HIRES, CCSM 3. 0 and FGO-ALS, are the most inconsistent with the observed rainfall for both catchments. Good performing models are MK 3. 5, MK 3. 0, ECHAM 5, CM 2. 1 U. H 2 and CM 2. 0. In general, most GCMs perform poorly for both catchments. This signals the need for significant improvements in the rainfall modelling of the climate models for the study region. There is no strong evidence to suggest that GCM performance improves with higher spatial resolution. Models which are highly inconsistent with other models in reproducing the observed rainfall are not necessarily inconsistent with other models in the future projections. Differences in projections for the A 1 B, B 2, and B 1 scenarios were found to be smaller than the differences between the GCM simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A large number of the stakeholders the the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) having limited capability to access science-based drought information tools, which often hinders their use of best available information on future water availability in planning and decision-making. This Drought Information System is being built using Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information System (HIS) tools (e. g. HydroServer and HydroDesktop) to organize and publish streamflow, precipitation, reservoir storage, and snow water equivalent data at different sites in the UCRB. These variables are important inputs to equations used in the calculation of drought index values. Development of prototype web services for agency data (NWIS, SNOTEL, USBR, NCDC, SNODAS) establishes better access to the data, and standardized WaterML data transmission format is key to the interoperability of system components. As a data processing step for drought index calculation, half-monthly and <b>monthly</b> <b>aggregations</b> of the index calculation input variables are created. Additionally, spatial interpolation methods have been applied to calculate spatially aggregated values for droughts index input variables at the 10 -digit HUC (Hydrologic Unit Code) level.

WaterOneFlow web services (part of the HydroServer toolset) are used to publish these temporally and spatially integrated and interpolated data.

Findings revealed a high vulnerability to fishing, particularly during reproductive periods, and most fish were recaptured within the 5 -month spawning season and within 10 − 12 km of the aggregation site.

40|$|Most {{climate models}} do not {{accurately}} reproduce present climate situation with similar statistics. This means that direct application of projected climate variables to hydrological models for impact analysis is implausible. In {{order to reach}} an adequate impact analysis of climate change, the support climate models should provide perturbation factors (PFs) or climate change signals that are consistent and account for the different aggregation dependency. This study uses the quantile perturbation analysis to explore the variation of PFs of rainfall intensities with respect to different aggregations, the model resolution and frequency, for three future IPCC emission scenarios (A 2, A 1 B and B 1) from eighteen Global Climate Models (GCMs). This approach ensures that the perturbations in the observed events are consistent with similarly ranked events in the climate model series. The GCM scenario quantiles are ranked from high to low values from current (1971 - 1990) conditions and compared to ranked data of GCM simulations for future (2049 - 2060 and 2081 - 2100) conditions. These ratios (PFs) were graphically analyzed for consistency, uncertainty, and dependency on frequency (return period) for the different rainfall aggregations. The PFs, derived from three GCMs (CGCM 3. 1 t 63, CM 2. 1 U. H 2 and CM 2. 0) outputs, are highly inconsistent with those derived from the other models for all the different rainfall aggregations considered and for both the 2050 s and 2090 s. Uncertainty in PFs, which depicts uncertainty in a given model, increases with increase in model temporal resolution. For most models, the PFs are above one and depend on the frequency for both the 2050 s and 2090 s and all three emission scenarios. For daily and monthly aggregations, the distributions of PFs tend to cluster around one for most models. The variation in PFs is higher for the lower quantiles for annual aggregation; but increases in the wet months than in the dry months for <b>monthly</b> <b>aggregation.</b> At daily aggregation, there are many outliers in the PFs for higher ranked quantiles {{for most of the}} GCMs. There is no evidence to suggest that the PFs are spatially dependent although CM 4. 1 model has shown significant variation from Katonga to Ruizi catchments. Models such as MK 3. 5, MK 3. 0 and ECHAM 5, with higher spatial resolutions, tend to have PFs close to or lower than one. Future rainfall intensities will be frequently higher than the present rainfall events in Katonga and Ruizi catchments for both the 2050 s and 2090 s. Although PFs can easily be derived from annual and monthly aggregations, the challenge of deriving climate change signals from daily climate model series, especially for dry days, for application to observed series, is still big. The resulting uncertainty is carried to hydrological models; leading to uncertain impact analysis. However, perturbation analysis is important in assessing consistent models and uncertainty in climate projections as given by the different GCMs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{issue for the}} Pacific-Andean basin in western South-America is whether the latest satellite-based and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model outputs, provide the potential to compensate data scarcity. Based on a comprehensive dataset of ground precipitation, {{the performance of the}} Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3 B 42 V 7 and its predecessor version the 3 B 42 V 6, and the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) precipitation product (OA-NOSA 30) are evaluated over 21 sub-catchments situated in the westernmost N-S axis of South America: the Pacific-Andean Basin in Ecuador and Peru (PAEP). In general, precipitation estimates from TRMM and OA-NOSA 30 capture the seasonal features of precipitation in the study area. Quantitatively, only the Southern sub-catchments of Ecuador and Northern Peru (3. 6 – 6 ° S) are relatively well estimated by both methods. The accuracy of both approaches is considerably less in the northern and central basins of Ecuador (0 – 3. 6 ° S). It is shown that the detection probability is better for light precipitation (less than 5 mm day− 1). Compared to its predecessor 3 B 42 V 7 shows modest basin-wide improvements in reducing biases. The improvement is specific to the coastal and open ocean sub-catchments. In view of hydrological applications, the correlation of TMPA's and OA-NOSA 30 estimates with observations increases with time aggregation. The correlation is higher for the <b>monthly</b> time <b>aggregation</b> in comparison with the daily, weekly and 15 -daily time scales.

40|$|Changes {{in alcohol}} pricing have been {{documented}} as inversely associated with changes in consumption and alcohol-related problems. Evidence of the association between price changes and health problems is nevertheless patchy and is based {{to a large extent}} on cross-sectional state-level data, or time series of such cross-sectional analyses. Natural experimental studies have been called for. There was a substantial reduction in the price of alcohol in Finland in 2004 due to a reduction in alcohol taxes of one third, on average, and the abolition of duty-free allowances for travellers from the EU. These changes in the Finnish alcohol policy could be considered a natural experiment, which offered a good opportunity to study what happens with regard to alcohol-related problems when prices go down. The present study investigated the effects of this reduction in alcohol prices on (1) alcohol-related and all-cause mortality, and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, (2) alcohol-related morbidity in terms of hospitalisation, (3) socioeconomic differentials in alcohol-related mortality, and (4) small-area differences in interpersonal violence in the Helsinki Metropolitan area. Differential trends in alcohol-related mortality prior to the price reduction were also analysed.   A variety of population-based register data was used in the study. Time-series intervention analysis modelling was applied to <b>monthly</b> <b>aggregations</b> of deaths and hospitalisation for the period 1996 - 2006. These and other mortality analyses were carried out for men and women aged 15 years and over. Socioeconomic differentials in alcohol-related mortality were assessed on a before/after basis, mortality being followed up in 2001 - 2003 (before the price reduction) and 2004 - 2005 (after). Alcohol-related mortality was defined in all the studies on mortality on the basis of information on both underlying and contributory causes of death. Hospitalisation related to alcohol meant that there was a reference to alcohol in the primary diagnosis. Data on interpersonal violence was gathered from 86 administrative small-areas in the Helsinki Metropolitan area and was also assessed on a before/after basis followed up in 2002 - 2003 and 2004 - 2005. The statistical methods employed to analyse these data sets included time-series analysis, and Poisson and linear regression.   The results of the study indicate that alcohol-related deaths increased substantially among men aged 40 - 69 years and among women aged 50 - 69 after the price reduction when trends and seasonal variation were taken into account. The increase was mainly attributable to chronic causes, particularly liver diseases. Mortality due to cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality, on the other hand, decreased considerably among the-over- 69 -year-olds. The increase in alcohol-related mortality in absolute terms among the 30 - 59 -year-olds was largest among the unemployed and early-age pensioners, and those with a low level of education, social class or income. The relative differences in change between the education and social class subgroups were small. The employed and those under the age of 35 did not suffer from increased alcohol-related mortality in the two years following the price reduction. The gap between the age and education groups, which was substantial in the 1980 s, thus further broadened. With regard to alcohol-related hospitalisation, there was an increase in both chronic and acute causes among men under the age of 70, and among women in the 50 - 69 -year age group when trends and seasonal variation were taken into account. Alcohol dependence and other alcohol-related mental and behavioural disorders were the largest category in both the total number of chronic hospitalisation and in the increase. There was no increase in the rate of interpersonal violence in the Helsinki Metropolitan area, and even a decrease in domestic violence. There was a significant relationship between the measures of social disadvantage on the area level and interpersonal violence, although the differences in the effects of the price reduction between the different areas were small.   The findings of the present study suggest that that a reduction in alcohol prices may lead to a substantial increase in alcohol-related mortality and morbidity. However, large population group differences were observed regarding responsiveness to the price changes. In particular, the less privileged, such as the unemployed, were most sensitive. In contrast, at least in the Finnish context, the younger generations and the employed {{do not appear to be}} adversely affected, and those in the older age groups may even benefit from cheaper alcohol in terms of decreased rates of CVD mortality. The results also suggest that reductions in alcohol prices do not necessarily affect interpersonal violence. The population group differences in the effects of the price changes on alcohol-related harm should be acknowledged, and therefore the policy actions should focus on the population subgroups that are primarily responsive to the price reduction...|$|R
