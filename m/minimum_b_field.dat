40|$|The {{straight}} {{field line}} mirror field is a marginally stable, non-axisymmetric magnetic well, {{which could be}} applied to a single cell mirror machine of the 2 XIIB type. A long thin flux tube confinement region has been modeled with zero plasma beta and a paraxial central magnetic flux line [1, 2], and the study has been extended to the first order in the plasma beta [3]. There are important beneficial properties of this vacuum field. The three dimensional marginal <b>minimum</b> <b>B</b> <b>field</b> and the ellipticity of the magnetic flux tube have been obtained analytically. For a given mirror ratio, the maximum ellipticity is smaller than obtained at experimental facilities with a mirror ratio below 5 or so. An additional important result for the marginal <b>minimum</b> <b>B</b> <b>field</b> is that the perpendicular gyro centre drift is zero, and the radial drift component is zero even to the first order in plasma beta and thereby the gyro centre drift surfaces lie on the magnetic flux surfaces, and a locally omnigenious equilibrium is provided.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} PIC simulations {{are performed}} {{in order to}} analyse {{the dynamics of the}} magnetotail as the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) rotates from northward to southward direction. This dynamics reveals to be quite different within meridian/equatorial planes over two successive phases of this rotation. First, as IMF rotates from North to Dawn-Dusk direction, the X-Point (magnetic reconnection) evidenced in the magnetotail (meridian plane) is moving earthward (from x=- 35 Re to x=- 17. 5) distance at which it stabilizes. This motion is coupled with the formation of "Crosstail-S" patterns (within the plane perpendicular to the Sun-Earth mine) through the neutral sheet in the nearby magnetotail. Second, as IMF rotates from dawn-dusk to South, the <b>minimum</b> <b>B</b> <b>field</b> region is expanding within the equatorial plane and forms a ring.

40|$|A {{major upgrade}} {{of the first}} ATLAS 10 GHz ECR ion source, which began {{operations}} in 1987, is in the planning and procurement phase. The new design will convert the old two-stage source into a single-stage source with an electron donor disk and high gradient magnetic field that preserves radial access for solid material feeds and pumping of the plasma chamber. The new magnetic field profile allows {{for the possibility of}} a second ECR zone at a frequency of 14 GHz. An open hexapole configuration, using a high energy-product Nd-Fe-B magnet material, having an inner diameter of 8. 8 cm and pole gaps of 2. 4 cm has been adopted. Models indicate that the field strengths at the chamber wall, 4 cm in radius, will be 9. 3 kG along the magnet poles and 5. 6 kG along the pole gaps. The individual magnet bars will be housed in austenitic stainless steel allowing the magnet housing within the aluminum plasma chamber {{to be used as a}} water channel for direct cooling of the magnets. Eight solenoid coils from the existing ECR will be enclosed in an iron yoke to produce the axial mirror.

40|$|To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} {{a framework for}} simulating low-field proton-density weighted MRI acquisitions based on high-field acquisitions, {{which could be used}} to predict the <b>minimum</b> <b>B</b> 0 <b>field</b> strength requirements for MRI techniques. This framework would be particularly useful in the evaluation of de-noising and constrained reconstruction techniques. Given MRI raw data, lower field MRI acquisitions can be simulated based on the signal and noise scaling with field strength. Certain assumptions are imposed for the simulation and their validity is discussed. A validation experiment was performed using a standard resolution phantom imaged at 0. 35 T, 1. 5 T, 3 T, and 7 T. This framework was then applied to two sample proton-density weighted MRI applications that demonstrated estimation of minimum field strength requirements: real-time upper airway imaging and liver proton-density fat fraction measurement. The phantom experiment showed good agreement between simulated and measured images. The SNR difference between simulated and measured was ≤ 8 % for the 1. 5 T, 3 T, and 7 T cases which utilized scanners with the same geometry and from the same vendor. The measured SNR at 0. 35 T was 1. 8 - to 2. 5 -fold less than predicted likely due to unaccounted differences in the RF receive chain. The predicted minimum field strength requirements for the two sample applications were 0. 2 T and 0. 3 T, respectively. Under certain assumptions, low-field MRI acquisitions can be simulated from high-field MRI data. This enables prediction of the minimum field strength requirements for a broad range of MRI techniques...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are generated around the equatorial regions and propagate toward the high latitude ionospheres in both hemispheres. Here we describe a prolonged EMIC wave {{event in the}} Pc 2 (0. 1 – 0. 2 Hz) frequency band above the He⁺ cyclotron frequency detected by the four Cluster satellites as they traversed sunward from L~ 13 in the outer magnetosphere to the magnetopause, over 13 °– 20 ° magnetic latitude north of the equator and across the high latitude cusp region near local magnetic noon. Wave packet energy propagated dominantly along the geomagnetic field direction, confirming this was a traveling EMIC wave rather than a toroidal field line resonance. The energy packets propagated in alternating directions rather than uni-directionally from the equator, implying the wave source was located in a high latitude region away from the equator, where a <b>minimum</b> in the <b>B</b> <b>field</b> is located. The CIS-CODIF H⁺ion data provided evidence that the waves were generated locally via the ion cyclotron instability.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} gradient fields used in {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) have a component which {{is parallel to the}} uniform <b>field</b> <b>B</b> 0 = B 0 z, as well as a component perpendicular to B 0. The component parallel to B 0 is used in spatial encoding. The component perpendicular to B 0, called the ``concomitant gradient," causes image distortions (by altering the magnitude and direction of the total field) if its magnitude approaches B 0 at any point in the field of view (FOV). In a conventional imaging sequence, the presence of the concomitant gradients limits the maximum gradient that can be used with a given <b>B</b> 0 <b>field</b> or, conversely, limits the <b>minimum</b> <b>B</b> 0 <b>field</b> that can be used with a given gradient field. This thesis describes an implementation of the so-called ``zero-field MRI" (ZFMRI) pulse sequence, which allows for imaging in an arbitrarily low <b>B</b> 0 <b>field.</b> The ZFMRI sequence created an effective unidirectional gradient field by using a train of π pulses to average out the concomitant gradient components during encoding. The signals were acquired using a low-transition temperature dc Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (low-T c dc SQUID) coupled to a first-order axial gradiometer. The experiments were carried out in a liquid helium dewar which was magnetically shielded with a single-layer mu-metal can around the outside and a superconducting Pb can contained within the helium space. We increased the filling factor of the custom-made, double-walled Pyrex insert by placing the liquid alcohol sample, at a temperature of approximately - 50 °C, at the center of one loop of the superconducting gradiometer, which was immersed in the helium bath. Using the aforementioned sequence and apparatus, images were acquired in the limit of zero static field, using gradients of up to 100 μT/m over a 23 mm FOV. The change in field magnitude over the FOV due to gradients was up to 10 times larger than the magnitude of any static field present in the dewar (static fields arose from residual magnetic fields and were 1 μT or less). These images were free of concomitant gradient distortions. Images encoded using aconventional imaging sequence under similar conditions were also acquired; the conventional images were irreparably distorted. The limitations of the present ZFMRI sequence implementation are considered, as well as how the procedure could be made more practical with regard to imaging time. The extension of the technique to unshielded operation in a uniform ambient field is discussed, as are other methods of mitigating or eliminating concomitant gradient distortions...|$|R

Thanks to the sensitive and high-angular-resolution observations, {{we are able}} to resolve the morphology of the <b>B</b> <b>field</b> in the plane of sky and detect a great turn of 90 degree in the <b>B</b> <b>field</b> direction: Over {{the northern part of the}} clump, where a velocity gradient is evident, the <b>B</b> <b>field</b> is largely aligned with the long axis of the clump, whereas in the southern part, where the velocity field appears relatively uniform, the <b>B</b> <b>field</b> is slightly pinched with its mean direction perpendicular to the clump elongation. We suggest that the clump forms as its parent cloud collapses more along the large scale <b>B</b> <b>field.</b> In this process, the northern part carries over most of the angular momentum, forming a fast rotating system, and pulls the <b>B</b> <b>field</b> into a toroidal configuration. In contrast, the southern part is not significantly rotating and the <b>B</b> <b>field</b> remains in a poloidal configuration. A statistical analysis of the observed polarization dispersion yields a <b>B</b> <b>field</b> strength of ~ 1 mG, a turbulent-to-magnetic energy ratio of order unity, and a mass-to-magnetic flux ratio of ~ 2 [...] 3 in units of the critical value.

Our observations, in conjunction with early single-dish data, suggest that the <b>B</b> <b>field</b> may play a critical role in the formation of the dense clump, whereas rotation and turbulence could also be important in further dynamical evolution of the clump.

40|$|Thermonuclear fusion is a {{promising}} energy {{source for the}} future. If an economically efficient thermonuclear reactor would be built {{it has to be}} a cheap, safe, and highly productive electric power plant, or, a heating plant. The emphasis of this thesis is on the single cell mirror trap with a marginally stable <b>minimum</b> <b>B</b> vacuum magnetic <b>field,</b> the straight field line mirror field, which provides MHD stability of the system, absence of the radial drift even to the first order in plasma β, and a reduced magnetic flux tube ellipticity. Strong density depletion at the mirrors is proposed as a mean to build up a strong potential barrier for the electrons and thereby increase the electron temperature. Conditions to obtain an energy gain factor Q> 10 are briefly analyzed. Current coils which could generate the derived magnetic field are proposed. A sloshing ion distribution function is constructed for the three dimensional ‘straight line mirror field’. The gyro centre Clebsch coordinates are found to be a new pair of motional invariants for this magnetic field. The gyro centre Clebsch coordinate invariants can be used to obtain complete solutions of the Vlasov equation, including the diamagnetic drift. These solutions show that the equilibria satisfy the locally omniginuity criterion to the first order in β. Contributions of the plasma diamagnetism to the magnetic flux tube ellipticity are studied for the straight field line mirror vacuum magnetic field and a sloshing ion distribution. Computations employing ray tracing have shown that there is a modest increase in the ellipticity, but the effect is small if β < 0. 2. Adiabatic charged particle motion in general field geometry has been studied.

40|$|Using the Tsyganenko {{magnetic}} field model (TSYGANENKO, Planet. Space Sci., 37, 5, 1989) we make {{an attempt to}} determine the outer boundary of the closed region when the interplanetary {{magnetic field}} (IMF) is southward. As a simple magnetic field model including the effect of IMF B_z< 0, the B_z component of a constant value of minus a few nanoTeslas {{is added to the}} magnetic field in the Tsyganenko model with low K_p values. In this paper, if the magnetic <b>field</b> strength, <b>B,</b> is not less than 2 nT in the whole range of a field line (namely the <b>minimum</b> <b>B</b> along a <b>field</b> line is greater than 2 nT), this field line is judged to be "firmly" closed. The firmly closed field lines are thought to be definitely closed as long as the fluctuation amplitude of B_z (around its average level) in the interplanetary (solar wind) magnetic field is less than 2 nT. The outer boundary of the firmly closed region is then constituted by field lines with the <b>minimum</b> <b>B</b> of 2 nT. This boundary is found to be close to (just inside of) the open-closed boundary, which can be determined with accuracy of 0. 01 ° in latitude of the foot point of a field line. It is found that a circle with the center at a latitude of about 85 ° on the midnight meridian can be fitted to the outer boundary of the firmly closed region, as it is projected to the ionosphere. Interestingly this circle coincides with a typical auroral circle; the auroral circles are those delineating the poleward boundary of the quiet auroral belt, which were earlier identified from the statistical analysis of satellites 2 ̆ 7 auroral images by MENG et al. (J. Geophys. Res., 82, 164, 1977).

This kind of the boundary distortion may be one of the possible causes of the generation of the nightside region 1 field-aligned current, which has been first suggested by HRUSKA (J. Geophys.

If the {{transverse}} jet <b>B</b> <b>fields</b> {{observed in}} BL Lac objects on parsec scales represent the toroidal {{component of the}} jet <b>B</b> <b>fields,</b> this should give rise to rotation-measure gradients across the jets, due to the systematic change in the line-of-sight component of the jet <b>B</b> <b>field.</b> We have found evidence for such rotation-measure gradients in one-third to one-half of the 1 Jy BL Lac objects we have analyzed. We present and discuss these new results, together with some of their implications for {{our understanding of the}} parsec-scale jets of AGN.
