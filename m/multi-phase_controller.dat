40|$|In this research, {{the line}} of sight (L. O. S.) control of a hub beam system is studied. The goal {{of this study is}} to {{maneuver}} the system from its original position to the target position so that the L. O. S. error at the tip of one of the beam is less than 5 arc-second. It turns out that one of the main obstacles to get high precision pointing but has been ignored by most similar researches is the friction, especially the static friction that exists in the system. In this research, a new friction model is adopted and included as part of the system model. This greatly enhances the fidelity of system description, especially in the stick phase. What is more important is that this modified model makes the active control still available in the stick phase to fine tune the L. O. S. of the beam. Based on this system model, a <b>multi-phase</b> <b>controller</b> is designed. In this way, we get the L. O. S. error of the specified beam to be less than 5 arc-second in 30 seconds with a rotation of about 180 degrees...|$|E
