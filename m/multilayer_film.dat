40|$|The giant {{magnetoresistance}} (GMR) effect {{was discovered in}} 1988 in nanoscale metallic ferro-magnetic/non-magnetic (FM/NM) multilayers. By now, devices based on this phenomenon have been widely commercialized which use multilayered structures manufactured via physical deposition (PD) methods, mainly sputtering. It was shown in the early 1990 s that electrodeposition (ED) is also capable of producing multilayered magnetic nanostructures exhibiting a significant GMR effect. These layered structures include <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> similar to those prepared by PD methods on macroscopic substrates and multilayered nanowires deposited into nanosized template pores, the latter ones being unique to the ED technique. Whereas ED multilayered nanowires can exhibit a GMR effect comparable to the values obtained on PD <b>multilayer</b> <b>films,</b> the GMR values achieved on ED <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> still remain inferior to them and, quite often, require high magnetic fields for saturation. Therefore, {{in spite of the}} relative simplicity and cost-effectiveness of the ED method, the GMR characteristics of ED <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> are still not competitive with the corresponding parameters of their PD counterparts. The main purpose of the present review is to give a summary of the progress achieved over the last one and a half decades on ED <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> with GMR effect and to critically evaluate the GMR results reported for various element combinations accessible to the ED technique for the preparation of FM/NM <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> (ED <b>multilayered</b> nanowires will be treated very briefly only). In order to promote an understanding of the inferior behavior of ED <b>multilayer</b> <b>films,</b> a detailed discussion of the magnetoresistance effects oc-curring in bulk homogeneous ferromagnets as well as in magnetic nanostructures (FM/NM multilayers and granular alloys) will be provided. Particular attention will be paid to the case of non-ideal magnetic nanostructures which contain both FM and superparamagnetic (SPM) regions. This is an essential in-gredient in explaining the high saturation field of GMR commonly observed in ED <b>multilayer</b> <b>films.</b> In addition to the GMR magnitude, this is another characteristic decisively influencing the magnetic field sensitivity, a key feature concerning applications in sensor devices. The controversial results reported for the spacer layer thickness dependence of GMR in ED <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> will also be discussed. It is pointed out that the still inferior GMR characteristics of ED <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> can be to a large extent ascribed to microstructural features leading to the appearance of SPM regions, pinholes in the spacer layers and probably not sufficiently perfect interfaces between the FM and NM layers. The origin of the latter deficiency is not yet well understood although it is clearly one of the main causes of a weak inter-layer coupling (if there is any coupling at all) and, thus, a small degree of antiparallel alignment leading to a reduced GMR effect. Works will also be described in which attempts were made to produce ED <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> with view on possible applications in GMR sensor devices.

40|$|The layer-by-layer {{assembly}} (LBL) is {{a technique}} for production of the films in nanometer range. The modified electrode of <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> of polyoxometalate (POM) K- 17 [Ce(P 2 Mo 17 O 61) (2) ] and polyelectrolyte by the layer-by-layer assembly were prepared and investigated. The stable <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> were assembled by alternate adsorption of negatively charged POM and positively charged polyelectrolytes from their aqueous dispersions. UV-Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to monitor the regular growth of the <b>multilayer</b> <b>films.</b> The proposed novel immobilized method exhibited a good high sensitivity for the determination of electrocatalyst, which is important for practical applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{photonic crystal}} {{consisting of the}} fourth-order Fibonacci <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> has been studied by {{the finite-difference time-domain method}} and transfer matrix method. The refractive indices for two layers of the Fibonacci <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> are similar with that of manganese and silicon in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) band. The simulation result shows that there is an isotropic negative refractive index for the one-dimensional photonic crystal. Based on the character above, a kind of transmission-type plano-concave lens, which can be used in the EUV band (or soft X-ray), is designed. The distributions of the electromagnetic field for the lens and transimissivity of the Fibonacci <b>multilayers</b> <b>films</b> have also been calculated. The result demonstrates that the lens can focus the incoming EUV radiation, and its transmissivity is bigger than 5 %- 9 % compared with that of the Fibonacci <b>multilayers</b> <b>films,</b> having the same structure with the lens. This letter has potential applications in the tansmission-type lens for EUV lithography...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePolyelectrolyte <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> were {{recently}} investigated to favour attachment of Human Vein Umbilical Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) on non-adhesive surfaces. In this study, we evaluated the initial adhesion of HUVECs after 3 h of seeding on two polyelectrolyte <b>multilayer</b> <b>films</b> ending by poly(D-lysine) (PDL) or poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). In {{order to obtain}} information about initial adhesion of HUVECs, cell morphology {{as well as the}} expression of beta 1 integrins, specific receptors of adhesion, were evaluated after 3 h of seeding on polyelectrolyte <b>multilayer</b> <b>films.</b> The data were also compared to PDL or PAH monolayers (polyelectrolytes terminating the multilayer architecture). The expression of beta 1 integrins was not different, whatever are the studied surfaces. However, HUVECs spreading on polyelectrolyte <b>multilayer</b> <b>films,</b> in particular on PAH ending film, was more important as compared to polyelectrolyte monolayers or glass. In conclusion, the best initial adhesion conditions of HUVECs on polyelectrolyte films could not be elucidated, moreover the results suggested also that beta 1 integrins could only play a limited role...|$|R
