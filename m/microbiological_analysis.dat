50|$|A {{recent review}} article {{suggested}} the following {{line of treatment}} for suspected breast abscess: initially, antibiotics treatment, ultrasound evaluation and, if fluid is present, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of the abscess with an 18 gauge needle, under saline lavage until clear. The exudate is then sent for <b>microbiological</b> <b>analysis</b> for identification of the pathogen and determination of its antibiotic sensitivity profile (antibiogram), which may in turn give an indication for changing the antibiotics prescription. At follow-up, a mammography is performed if the condition has resolved; otherwise the ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with lavage and <b>microbiological</b> <b>analysis</b> is repeated. If three to five aspirations still do not resolve the condition, percutaneous drainage in combination with placement of an indwelling catheter is indicated, and only if several attempts at ultrasound-guided drainage fail, surgical resection of the inflamed lactiferous ducts (preferably performed after the acute episode is over) should be considered. It is noted, however, that even the excision of the affected ducts does not necessarily prevent recurrence.|$|E

40|$|The {{perspective}} {{on the development of}} nano and microsystems for chemical and biological measurements is presented. The use of nano and microfabrication approaches allows to create miniaturized analytical devices that are inherently smaller, have lower power consumption, give lower cost of analysis, are more reproducible and can be produced in high volumes. The behavior of fluids in microchannels is different from that under macro conditions and the channel depth or channel diameter determines the Reynolds number. The force is mechanically driven by a pump, pressure driven, centrifugal or electrically driven by a potential difference, electro-osmotic flow. Numerical simulations provide an understanding of the chemical and physical processes that take place in microfludic devices and are used in their design.
