5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} accusing him of <b>murder,</b> <b>or</b> implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known bias of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated by Parker's {{perseverance}} {{despite everything}} that's been inflicted, Osborn publicly reveals that he's alive on Halloween. During the battle that ensues between them, Osborn attempts to kill Parker by impaling his nemesis with his goblin glider. When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker (and immediately deteriorates on death as all clones do), Parker realises {{he is actually}} the original. During this same period, Osborn {{may or may not}} have been responsible for the <b>murder</b> <b>or</b> abduction of Peter's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently prematurely induces Mary Jane's pregnancy and the stillbirth of the baby.|$|E
5|$|Melvin {{therefore}} {{resorted to}} arresting suspects– including juveniles, {{some of them}} regarded as vulnerable– and holding them for days without access to lawyers. Of the 359 people arrested {{in connection with the}} inquiry in 1985 and 1986, just 94 were interviewed {{in the presence of a}} lawyer. Many of the confessions that resulted, whether directly about the <b>murder,</b> <b>or</b> about having taken part in the rioting, were made before the lawyer was given access to the interviewee.|$|E
5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} exonerated Robert Dudley from <b>murder</b> <b>or</b> a cover-up. Apart from {{alternatives}} for a murder plot as causes for Amy Robsart's death, his correspondence with Thomas Blount and William Cecil {{in the days}} following has been cited as proofs of his innocence; the letters, which show signs of an agitated mind, making clear his bewilderment and unpreparedness. It has also been judged as highly unlikely that he would have orchestrated the death of his wife in a manner which laid him open to such a foreseeable scandal.|$|E

In United States v. Cook (1872), the Court held that indictments need not plead facts establishing that these limitations periods have not run.|$|E
5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in about three hours. They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final testimony, and her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital <b>murder</b> <b>or</b> conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought the death penalty for both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
5|$|Halotus is {{primarily}} remembered for his suspected {{involvement in the}} conspiracy and poisoning of Emperor Claudius on 13 October (times of death are in dispute; see below) 54 AD. It is possible that Claudius died of natural causes, and the actual manner of the poisoning, in regards to which poison may have been used, in which food {{it could have been}} hidden, etc., remains unclear. It is considered most likely, considering the writings of various ancient historians, that the poison was concealed in mushrooms (as Claudius was known to have been particularly fond of them), and Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' wife, is thought to have been the most likely to have instigated the <b>murder</b> <b>or</b> to have been the lead conspirator in the plot to overthrow Claudius.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the films}} noir of the classic period were {{similarly}} low- and modestly budgeted features without major stars—B movies either literally or in spirit. In this production context, writers, directors, cinematographers, and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big-picture constraints. There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole: the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi-documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies. Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non-noir commercial productions. In terms of content, enforcement of the Production Code ensured that no film character could literally get away with <b>murder</b> <b>or</b> be seen sharing a bed with anyone but a spouse; within those bounds, however, many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqué for the time.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Huie's {{interview}} with Bryant and Milam was explosive. Their brazen admission {{that they had}} murdered Till caused prominent civil rights leaders to push the federal government harder to investigate the case. Till's murder contributed to congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957: it authorized the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in local law enforcement issues when individual civil rights were being compromised. Huie's interview, in which Milam and Bryant said they had acted alone, overshadowed inconsistencies in earlier versions of the stories. As a consequence, details about Collins and Loggins and others who had possibly been involved in Till's abduction and <b>murder,</b> <b>or</b> the subsequent cover-up, were forgotten, according to historians David and Linda Beito.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} {{to ask about}} Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black to believe she is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions {{he is capable of}} seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for <b>murder</b> <b>or</b> torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E

Shashi Tharoor {{discovered}} her body, when she did not wake up from her sleep in the evening. He informed the Delhi Police, who recovered the body from the hotel and sent it for postmortem. According to initial reports, Sunanda was suspected to have committed suicide. Later reports stated that {{the cause of death was}} unnatural; the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences gave a preliminary autopsy report that revealed injury marks on her body. They said that these injuries may or may not be the cause of death. The autopsy indicated that she died of drug overdose, most likely a combination of sedatives, other strong medicines and probably alcohol. An investigation has been ordered by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to examine the cause of poisoning and to ascertain if it was <b>murder</b> <b>or</b> suicide. Her body was cremated at Lodhi Crematorium in South Delhi.|$|E
