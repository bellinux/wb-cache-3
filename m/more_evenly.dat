5|$|Further south, in Victoria and New South Wales, {{rainfall}} {{is spread}} <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> {{throughout the year}} and the driest season lasts from December to May. At this time, southern populations congregate in inland flocking areas which include upland marshes, the edges of reservoirs and lakes, pastures and agricultural land. When rain arrives in June and July, they disperse to the coastal freshwater marshes, shallow lakes, wet meadows and other wetlands where they breed.|$|E
5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis <b>more</b> <b>evenly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pollack {{believed}} {{that the success of}} the WSOP was not determined based upon the number of participants every year, but rather upon the players' experiences. For example, in 2007 the WSOP flattened its award structure. The cash awards were distributed <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> so that people who went out earlier earned more money, while those who made it to the final table won less.|$|E

5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern {{studies suggest that the}} battle was smaller and that both sides were <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted the morale of the Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
5|$|The social {{structure}} of the golden-crowned sifaka {{is very similar to}} that of Verreaux's sifaka, both averaging between five and six individuals per group, with a range between three and ten. Unlike the Verreaux's sifaka, group sex ratios are <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> balanced, consisting of two or more members of both sexes. Females are dominant within the group, and only one female breeds successfully each season. Males will roam between groups during the mating season.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E

5|$|In {{computational}} geometry, the duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations {{implies that}} any algorithm for constructing a Voronoi diagram can be immediately converted into an algorithm for the Delaunay triangulation, and vice versa. The same duality {{can also be}} used in finite element mesh generation. Lloyd's algorithm, a method based on Voronoi diagrams for moving a set of points on a surface to <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> spaced positions, is commonly used as a way to smooth a finite element mesh described by the dual Delaunay triangulation. This method improves the mesh by making its triangles more uniformly sized and shaped.|$|E
5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} criticised by big game hunter and {{politician}} Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that {{every aspect of}} animal coloration is effective as camouflage. Roosevelt's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of examples to suit Abbott Thayer's thesis and the book's reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence. The book was <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott, who valued Thayer's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage. Thayer was mocked {{to a greater or}} lesser extent by other scientific reviewers.|$|E

50|$|Ethnikos and Olympiacos F.C. were <b>more</b> or less <b>evenly</b> matched and {{had great}} battles for Piraeus {{supremacy}} in the 1920s and 1930s, but thereafter Olympiacos became increasingly {{more powerful and}} successful and began to pass Ethnikos by.|$|R
5|$|The virgin forests cooled {{the land}} and streams, and centuries of {{accumulated}} organic matter in the forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall into the creeks and runs so that they flowed <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> year-round. Pine Creek and its tributaries were home to large numbers of fish, including trout, but dams downstream on the Susquehanna River have eliminated the shad and eels once found here by blocking their migrations. Habitat for land animals was destroyed by the clearcutting of forests, {{but there was also}} a great deal of hunting, with bounties paid for large predators.|$|E
5|$|Titanium has the {{inherent}} ability to osseointegrate, enabling use in dental implants that {{can last for}} over 30 years. This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications. These benefit from titanium's lower modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still {{more than twice that}} of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} time in three years, Žigić was chosen as {{domestic}} player {{of the year in the}} captains' poll, and was also honoured by the Red Star Sport Association as best male athlete of 2005, an award open to athletes representing the club in any sport, not just in football. After Pantelić's departure for Hertha BSC, Red Star's goals were spread <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> among the remaining forward players. In the league, Žigić and Boško Janković were joint-top scorers with 12, and Purović contributed one fewer, as the club won their 24th title. They completed the double with a defeat of city rivals OFK in the cup final, coming back from 2–0 down via Žigić's 67th-minute free kick under the defensive wall and Purović's equaliser to take the match into extra time, during which Žigić gave Red Star the lead with a header and Dušan Basta made the final score 4–2. After the match, Žigić refused to answer questions about his Red Star future.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Sisimpur {{aired in}} Bangladesh. This co-production's {{goal was to}} improve school {{achievement}} and decrease drop-out rates for children before the third grade. This difficult co-production, which was beset by political difficulties and severe flooding that delayed production, was depicted in the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street. Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production (Rruga Sesam/Ulica Sezam) chose to present the languages of the region <b>more</b> <b>evenly.</b> Instead of showing words on screen, children were challenged to label objects verbally, thus learning that there are different ways {{to say the same}} thing. The Workshop worked in conjunction with UNICEF to produce this show, to aid in the peace process between Albanians and Serbs. One of its goals was to demonstrate to Albanian and Serbian children that their counterparts were like them.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, {{incumbent}} Pryce {{announced her}} retirement {{at the end}} of her elected term. The Democrats felt that the seat continued to be vulnerable. Kilroy announced her intention to again seek the 15th District seat in 2008. She ran against Republican Steve Stivers, a State Senator from the 16th District, Libertarian Mark M. Noble, and Independent candidate Don Elijah Eckhart. The race was considered to be one of the most important U.S. House of Representatives races to watch in the country. The last Democrat to hold the 15th district was Robert T. Secrest in the mid-1960s, but with Republican voters moving out of the district into the northern suburbs of Columbus, Ohio since the 1990s, the district became <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> matched.|$|E
5|$|Patagonia, in the south, {{is mostly}} arid or semi–arid {{except in the}} extreme west where {{abundant}} precipitation supports dense forest coverage, glaciers, and permanent snowfields. Its climate is classified as temperate to cool temperate with the surrounding oceans moderating temperatures on the coast. Away from the coast, areas on the plateaus have large daily and annual temperature ranges. The influence of the Andes, in conjunction with general circulation patterns, generates {{one of the strongest}} precipitation gradients (rate of change in mean annual precipitation in relation to a particular location) in the world, decreasing rapidly to the east. In much of Patagonia precipitation is concentrated in winter with snowfall occurring occasionally, particularly in the mountainous west and south; precipitation is <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> distributed in the east and south. One defining characteristic is the strong winds from the west which blow year-round, lowering the perception of temperature (wind chill), while being a factor in keeping the region arid by favouring evaporation.|$|E

5|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} {{volatile}} compounds {{such as water}} and carbon dioxide, if present, might evaporate in the scorching heat of the sunward side, migrate to the cooler night side, and condense to form ice caps. Over time, the entire atmosphere might freeze into ice caps on the night side of the planet. However, it remains unknown if water and/or carbon dioxide are even present {{on the surface of}} Gliese 581c. Alternatively, an atmosphere large enough to be stable would circulate the heat <b>more</b> <b>evenly,</b> allowing for a wider habitable area on the surface. For example, although Venus has a small axial inclination, very little sunlight reaches the surface at the poles. A slow rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's produces prolonged days and nights. Despite the uneven distribution of sunlight cast on Venus at any given time, polar areas and the night side of Venus are kept almost as hot as on the day side by globally circulating winds.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Chinese historiography {{celebrated the}} battle of Caishi as an {{important}} victory for China. Caishi {{was held in the}} same esteem as the Battle of Fei River in 383, when the Eastern Jin defeated the northern invaders of the Former Qin. However, its portrayal as a victory against overwhelming odds, in which 18,000 Song soldiers overcame an army of nearly half a million men, is likely an exaggeration. Modern historians believe that the number of Jin soldiers was far lower. The Song possessed multiple advantages, and the battle was <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> matched than contemporaneous historians suggest. The Song had larger ships and ample time to prepare while the Jin army gathered supplies and ships for the crossing. It was also impossible for the Jin to use cavalry, the most important asset of the Jurchen military, during a naval engagement.|$|E
5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be more {{important}} to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are <b>more</b> <b>evenly</b> distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm at a distance of up to , and may be able to pick up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.|$|E
5000|$|Haggis is a {{shedding}} {{card game}} similar to Tichu, Zheng Fen, and other East Asian climbing games. Haggis has received praise {{for being the}} first to successfully create a climbing, trick-taking game, designed from the start {{for two to three}} players, where most previous games required four players or <b>more.</b> The <b>evenly</b> distributed, face card [...] "bombs" [...] are a notable innovation for the genre, helping even out hand strength enough to make two-person play workable, and enhancing the strategic element of the game.|$|R
50|$|Climate is {{generally}} classified {{in terms of}} rainfall difference due to combined influence of topography and air stream direction prevailing in the locality.

25|$|During {{this time}} European {{settlement}} accelerated and in about 1859 {{the number of}} Pākehā came to equal the number of Māori, at around 60,000 each. By now Pākehā had largely forgotten the painful lessons of the earlier conflicts. They tried to use military might to push through a very dubious land sale that the courts later repudiated. The result was the First Taranaki War. Once again the local British forces were <b>more</b> than <b>evenly</b> matched by Māori, and after twelve months both sides were happy {{to settle for a}} draw.|$|R
