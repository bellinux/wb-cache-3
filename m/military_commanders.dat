After Savimbi's death, the government {{came to a}} crossroads over how to proceed. After initially indicating the counter-insurgency might continue, the government announced it would halt all military operations on 13 March. <b>Military</b> <b>commanders</b> for UNITA and the MPLA met in Cassamba and agreed to a cease-fire. However, Carlos Morgado, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said the UNITA's Portugal wing had been under the impression General Kamorteiro, the UNITA general who agreed to the ceasefire, had been captured {{more than a week}} earlier.

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the <b>military</b> <b>commanders</b> or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Amidst growing {{concerns}} amongst Australian <b>military</b> <b>commanders</b> about Japanese intentions, {{the scheduled}} {{replacement of the}} 22nd Brigade was cancelled, and the 2/18th remained in Seremban until they were transported east to Jemaluang in August.

5|$|Despite these successes, Matilda {{was unable}} to {{consolidate}} her position.

On 4 August, convinced that the government in Montevideo was unwilling to work toward a settlement, a frustrated Saraiva delivered an ultimatum, which the Uruguayans rebuffed.

With some 5,300 men, he defeated 25,000 Russians led by General Michail Kachovski. Despite the tactical victory, Kościuszko had to retreat from Dubienka, as the Russians crossed the nearby Austrian border and began flanking his positions.|$|E

5|$|As Austria {{was short}} of {{experienced}} <b>military</b> <b>commanders,</b> Maria Theresa released Marshall Neipperg, {{who had been}} imprisoned by her father for his poor performance in the Turkish War.

France drew up a plan to partition Austria between Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Spain. Marshall Belle-Isle joined Frederick at Olmütz. Vienna was in a panic, as none of Maria Theresa's advisors expected France to betray them. Francis Stephen urged Maria Theresa to reach a rapprochement with Prussia, as did Great Britain. Maria Theresa reluctantly agreed to negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{buildings}} of Fort Yellowstone, the army left {{a legacy of}} policies and practices that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks. The army <b>military</b> <b>commanders</b> implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service {{as part of their}} resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E
