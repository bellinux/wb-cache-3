5|$|Smith was {{instrumental}} in the inauguration of the air <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the summer of 1919. He had logged 900 hours of flying time in the Army before he joined the U.S. <b>Mail</b> <b>Service</b> at age nineteen. His first assignment was to fly mail from Omaha, Nebraska, to California, essentially following the same route as the Oregon Trail. His mother had taken this trail by covered wagon from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother and grandparents had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within a week with several stops along the way.|$|E

Due to the widespread demand for <b>mail</b> <b>services,</b> performance degradation may occur for mail servers. Performance {{is an open}} issue that is affected by many factors including the technical factors. To identify the factors that {{have an impact on}} the performance of the <b>mail</b> <b>services,</b> we have carried out an experimental study by focusing on few prominent <b>mail</b> <b>services.</b> In this paper, the results of the experimental study and the results obtained from activity-based performance prediction approach are compared and discussed. Regression analysis is used for comparison, and the obtained value shows that both are closure to each other...|$|R

A rural <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> was {{discussed}} for the Ashburton District in September 1924 {{and after the}} contracts were let in February 1925, the Barrhill post office was closed. The school closed in 1938.|$|E
5|$|RMS (later HMT) Royal Edward was a {{passenger}} ship {{belonging to the}} Canadian Northern Steamship Company that was sunk during the First World War with a large loss of life while transporting Commonwealth troops. She was launched in 1907 as RMS Cairo for a British <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|By {{utilizing}} a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional stagecoaches, they proposed {{to establish a}} fast <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per , then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, {{but that did not}} come about.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm {{striking}} Réunion, officials advised residents to remain inside. Officials ordered residents in Saint-Leu along the coast to evacuate inland, and at least 300people evacuated island-wide. The airport at Saint-Denis was closed, but reopened after the storm passed the island; several flights were canceled as a result. The main port was also closed, as were most childcare facilities, and <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> was suspended. Officials issued a red alert for the island, the first since Cyclone Dumile a year prior.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, it covered the {{entertainment}} industry, such as circuses, fairs, and burlesque shows. It also created a <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> for travelling entertainers. Billboard began focusing more on the music industry as the jukebox, phonograph, and radio became commonplace. Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines, including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, so that it could focus on music. After Donaldson died in 1925, Billboard was passed down to his children and Hennegan's children, until it was sold to private investors in 1985, and has since been owned by various parties.|$|E
5|$|Japan began {{considering}} airline deregulation in {{the late}} 1970s, with the government announcing the abandoning of the 45/47 system in 1985. In 1987 Japan Airlines was completely privatised, {{and the other two}} airlines in Japan, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Air System (JAS), were permitted to compete with JAL on domestic and international routes. Increased competition resulted in changes to the airline's corporate structure, and it was reorganised into three divisions: international passenger service, domestic passenger service, and cargo (including <b>mail)</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many {{progressive}} {{reforms and}} developments {{were made in}} Chamba under the British. In 1863, the first Post office was established in Chamba and a daily <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> and a primary school. In December, 1866, a hospital was opened by Doctor Elmslie of the Kashmir Medical Mission. In the late 1860s two new roads to Dalhousie via Kolri and Khajiar were built. Gopal Singh, who ruled from 1870 to 1873, after abdicating, was responsible for building the grand Jandarighat Palace as his summer residence.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{was struck}} {{particularly}} {{hard by the}} storm. It is estimated that 42 people perished, and several hundred more people were injured. The storm disrupted the city for days, and forced schools to close. Streets throughout Queens became impassable; <b>mail</b> <b>service,</b> buses, taxis, delivery vehicles, and trash collection were all disrupted. Thousands of motorists became trapped on the New York State Thruway. A snow emergency was issued in the city, and the Long Island Rail Road suspended all service at the time. The snowstorm left approximately 6,000 travelers stranded at Kennedy Airport. They slept on chairs and floors. Over 1,000 vehicles were stalled or abandoned on the Tappan Zee Bridge; most of these were removed within a day.|$|E
5|$|Paddington was {{extended}} again from 1930 to 1934. Platforms 2 to 11 were extended past the Bishop's Road bridge {{and a new}} parcel depot was built. Suburban services, which had never been considered important at Paddington, were increased as new housing estates in the Home Counties started being built. Bishop's Road station was rebuilt, giving an extra four platforms to Paddington (Nos.13–16) and providing a new ticket office and entrance for suburban services next to the bridge. A public address system was introduced in 1936. By this time, around 22,000 parcels a day were being forwarded from Paddington, with the Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>service</b> processing around 4,500 mailbags and 2,400 parcel bags every day.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{reported}} in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, {{that he had}} had to ditch into a pasture, landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were part of the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In {{the first five years of}} US Post Office air <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|That November, Parry {{released}} a tender for North Atlantic monthly <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> to Halifax beginning in April 1839 using steamships with 300 horsepower. The Great Western Steamship Company, which had opened its pioneer Bristol–New York service earlier that year, bid £45,000 for a monthly Bristol–Halifax–New York service using three ships of 450 horsepower. While British American, the other pioneer transatlantic steamship company, did not submit a tender, the St. George Steam Packet Company, owner of Sirius, bid £45,000 for a monthly Cork–Halifax service and £65,000 for a monthly Cork–Halifax–New York service. The Admiralty rejected both tenders because neither bid offered to begin services early enough.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the ultimatum, both Lithuania and Poland named their ambassadors. Kazys Škirpa was sent to Warsaw, and Franciszek Charwat was sent to Kaunas before March 31, the {{deadline}} indicated in the ultimatum. Negotiations over practical matters began on March 25, in Augustów, and by June three agreements covering rail transit, <b>mail</b> <b>service,</b> and river navigation had been concluded. The railroad, torn apart for several kilometers at the border, was repaired. A customs post was established in Vievis, and consulates were opened in Klaipėda and Vilnius. Lithuania closed the League for the Liberation of Vilnius and the Vilnius Foundation; the latter organization had given financial support to Lithuanian activities in the Vilnius Region. Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim Vilnius as its de jure capital. In May 1938 a new constitution was adopted, which echoed the previous constitution's statement that Vilnius was the permanent capital of Lithuania and that Kaunas was merely a temporary capital. Poland continued to suppress Lithuanian organizations in Vilnius.|$|E

5|$|During the Crimean War Cunard {{supplied}} 11 ships for war service. Every British North Atlantic route {{was suspended}} until 1856 except Cunard's Liverpool–Halifax–Boston service. While Collins' fortunes improved {{because of the}} lack of competition during the war, it collapsed in 1858 after its subsidy for carrying mail across the Atlantic was reduced by the US Congress. Cunard emerged as the leading carrier of saloon passengers and in 1862 commissioned Scotia, the last paddle steamer to win the Blue Riband. Inman carried more passengers because of its success in the immigrant trade. To compete, in May 1863 Cunard started a secondary Liverpool–New York service with iron-hulled screw steamers that catered for steerage passengers. Beginning with China, the line also replaced the last three wooden paddlers on the New York <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> with iron screw steamers that only carried saloon passengers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s Davis hired Ralph Munroe to oversee his Key Biscayne property. Munroe had begun visiting Biscayne Bay in 1877. He soon built a home, the Barnacle, on {{land on the}} {{mainland}} in Coconut Grove that he bought from John Frow, keeper of the Cape Florida Light and Fowey Rocks Light. Munroe engaged in wrecking in the waters around Key Biscayne, built sailboats, worked as a pilot for the Cape Florida Channel and opened a pineapple cannery, to which Davis sent his pineapples. Before <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> to the Miami area improved, Munroe would camp out on Key Biscayne every Tuesday evening {{so that he could}} sail out {{to the edge of the}} Gulf Stream early Wednesday morning to retrieve a package of newspapers and magazines dropped for him in waterproof pouches by a passing steamship. Munroe was also one of the founding members of the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club.|$|E
5|$|It {{became a}} halting post along the newly {{introduced}} regular mail routes connecting Damascus and Cairo, which were run by horse-mounted messengers with colored sashes. Syrian historian Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari {{did not mention}} Darum in his list of the route's stopping points in 1349, instead noting that al-Salqah was the only post between Rafah and Gaza, suggesting that Darum was not a major settlement at the time. However, 14th-century Egyptian historian Ahmad al-Qalqashandi counters al-Umari's account, writing that Darum was the last halting post before Gaza. Roads, bridges, postal stations and a khan (caravanserai) {{were built in the}} town to accommodate the messengers. Pigeon <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> was introduced for which towers were built. Produce available in Darum during this time period included barley, wheat, grapes and grape leaves, olives, raspberries, lemons, figs, sweet melons, pomegranates and dates. Surrounding the town were the encampments of the Batn Jarm, an Arab clan that also lived around Gaza.|$|E
