The results demonstrate that optimum rejuvenator content in the <b>alginate</b> <b>fibre</b> is of 70 : 30 rejuvenator/alginate ratio. The fibres are of sufficient thermal and mechanical strength to survive harsh asphalt mixing and compaction processes. Furthermore, results illustrate that zeer open asfalt beton (ZOAB) asphalt mix containing 5 % of 70 : 30 rejuvenator/alginate ratio compartmented <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> has higher strength, stiffness and better healing properties in comparison to the control asphalt mix, i. e., mix without fibres, and mix containing fibres with lower rejuvenator content.

40|$|The {{prospects}} for successful peripheral nerve repair using fibre guides {{are considered to}} be enhanced by the use of a scaffold material, which promotes attachment and proliferation of glial cells and axonal regeneration. Macroporous <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> were produced by extraction of gelatin particle porogens from wet spun fibres produced using a suspension of gelatin particles in 1. 5 % w/v alginate solution. Gelatin loading of the starting suspension of 40. 0, 57. 0, and 62. 5 % w/w resulted in gelatin loading of the dried <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> of 16, 21, and 24 % w/w respectively. Between 45 and 60 % of the gelatin content of hydrated fibres was released in 1 h in distilled water at 37 °C, leading to rapid formation of a macroporous structure. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and image processing provided qualitative and quantitative analysis of mean equivalent macropore diameter (48 - 69 μm), pore size distribution, estimates of maximum porosity (14. 6 %) and pore connectivity. CLSM also revealed that gelatin residues lined the macropore cavities and infiltrated into the body of the alginate scaffolds, thus, providing cell adhesion molecules, which are potentially advantageous for promoting growth of glial cells and axonal extension. Macroporous <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> encapsulating nerve cells [primary rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) ] were produced by wet spinning alginate solution containing dispersed gelatin particles and DRGs. Marked outgrowth was evident over a distance of 150 μm at day 11 in cell culture, indicating that pores and channels created within the alginate hydrogel were providing a favourable environment for neurite development. These findings indicate that macroporous <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> encapsulating nerve cells may provide the basis of a useful strategy for nerve repair...|$|R
40|$|The {{prospects}} for successful peripheral nerve repair using fibre guides {{are considered to}} be enhanced by use of a scaffold material which provides a good substrate for attachment and growth of glial cells and regenerating neurons. Alginate polymers exhibit a highly favourable balance of properties and exhibit the unique property of forming hydrogels under mild crosslinking conditions. As a result alginate has been widely applied for cell encapsulation. However the polysaccharide exhibits extremely poor cell adhesion properties, which limits its application for tissue regeneration. <b>Alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> were modified by gelatin a) to improve cell adhesion b) to investigate the potential for polypeptide growth factor incorporation in the fibres and c) to provide a method for macropore production by extraction of the gelatin particles from the fibres (Chapter 2).

In the case of <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> containing the nanoadditive tricalcium phosphate (TCP), the traditional method of forming fibres wet from solution was used. However {{in the case of the}} other two polymers the electrospinning method was used. Two model systems were tested for biocompatibility.

The proposed hybrid systems composed of micrometric fibres (zinc and calcium alginates containing TCP) and submicron fibres (DBC and PCL) meet the requirements of regenerative medicine.

The internal reaction volume of cellulosic matrices served as compartments for the controlled precipitation of iron oxides, biomimicking magnetic bacteria such as Aquispirillum magnetotacticum. Nanocomposites were prepared {{from a range of}} materials, both ionic and nonionic. The ionics were sulfonated thermomechanical wood pulp (TMP), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), calcium <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> and chemically modified rayon tirecord, in addition to a model synthetic system which consisted of a Nafion$ sp circler$ 117 ion-exchange membrane. Two never-dried, water-swollen, nonionic cellulose gels were also used as substrates for in situ synthesis: a bacterial cellulose membrane and a wet-spun model cellulose filament. Characterization of the resulting magnetic materials was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The ionic substrates produced a non-uniform distribution of fine ferrites. However, the water-swollen, neutral cellulose gels yielded a uniform distribution of ferrites which, in turn, were used to propose a model for matrix-mediated synthesis of superparamagnetic cellulosics...|$|R
40|$|Fibres {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in wound dressing applications as they provide a high surface area for absorption, ease of fabrication and softness. It is common practice for commercial wound dressings to be produced from natural materials, such a marine polysaccharides, as they are predominantly biocompatible, non-toxic, and often display bioactive properties, such as inherent antimicrobial activity. In this study hydrolysed chitosans were utilised as a sole coagulant {{for the production of}} alginate-chitosan fibres via a one-step, direct wet-spinning extrusion process. The levels of chitosan incorporated into the fibres were analysed quantitatively via elemental analysis and qualitatively by staining using Amido Black 10 B. It was estimated that the fibres contained between 4. 50 and 5. 10 % (wt. %) chitosan. The presence of chitosan improved tensile properties such as elongation and tenacity of the base <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres.</b> The increased incorporation of chitosan into the fibres also improved the absorption of the fibres in both saline and distilled water; reaching maximum of > 30 g/g and > 50 g/g, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The {{cytotoxicity}} and anti-influenza virus (IFV) {{activity of}} calcium or zinc alginate fibers were investigated {{to explore the}} feasibility {{of them to be}} used as biomaterials. African Green Monkey kidney cell (Vero) and human cervical cancer cell (Hela) cultured with <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> were used to screen cytotoxic effects. After 48 h, MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 -thiazol) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H tetrazolium bromide) assays were performed. Then cytotoxicity was evaluated with six grades according to cell relative growth rate (RGR). In anti-IFV activity assay, IFV were added to all fibers and the Vero cell survival were detected by MTT assays with calculating the percentage of protection. The cytotoxity of calcium alginate fibers on Vero were grade 0 or 1 in contrast to zinc alginate fibers which was grade 0. The cytotoxity of calcium or zinc alginate fibers on Hela were grade 0. Furthermore, partial calcium or zinc alginate fibers could promote Vero or Hela cell growth. In antiviral assay the highest percentage of protection of calcium alginate fibers was 34. 42 %, while that of zinc alginate fibers was 59. 42 %. The results showed that calcium or zinc alginate fibers had a good cellular biocompatibility and the large weight zinc alginate fibers had a better anti-IFV activity than calcium alginate fibers, which is potential for tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} methods for evaluating a healing system for asphalt pavements. The healing system under investigation involves compartmented calcium-alginate fibres encapsulating an asphalt binder healing agent (rejuvenator). This system presents a novel method of incorporating rejuvenators into asphalt pavement mixtures. The compartmented fibres {{are used to}} distribute the rejuvenator throughout the pavement mixture, thereby overcoming {{some of the problems}} associated with alternate asphalt pavement healing methods, i. e., spherical capsules and hollow fibres. The asphalt healing efficiency methods to be evaluated in this paper include: (i) standard test methods for asphalt pavements, such as the Indirect Tensile Strength test and the 4 Point Bending Fatigue test; and (ii) alternative fracture tests such as the Semi Circular Bend test. The study employs fracture theory in order to evaluate the efficiency of the damage repair. The research findings demonstrate that including compartmented calcium-alginate fibres encapsulating a rejuvenator into an asphalt pavement mix does not significantly improve the healing properties of the asphalt pavement. Nevertheless, the findings indicate that, with further enhancement, compartmented calcium <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> may present a promising new approach for the development of self-healing asphalt pavement systems. Additionally, the test results indicate that the 4 point bend fatigue test is the most suitable test for evaluating the performance of self healing asphalt pavements...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the intragastric {{structuring}} ability of o/w emulsions either stabilised (1 – 4 %, w/w of sodium alginate (SA)) or structured with sheared ionic gel (1 – 3 %, w/w of SA crosslinked with Ca 2 +) {{in the absence}} (saliva and gastric phases constituted of deionised water) or presence of in vitro pre-absorptive conditions (physiological simulated saliva and gastric fluids) was investigated. Visualisation of the morphological aspects of the gastric chymes, {{in the absence of}} multivalent counterions, demonstrated that SA stabilised systems underwent a remarkable swelling in the pH range of 2 – 3, whilst at the same pH range, ionic SA gel structured systems maintained their major structure configuration. When the aforementioned systems were exposed to physiological intragastric fluids, a reduction of the length and the hydrodynamic volume of the <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres</b> was detected regardless the structuring approach. On their exposure to physiological intragastric conditions (pH = 2), SA stabilised emulsions underwent sol–gel transition achieving a ca. 3 - to 4 -order increase of storage modulus (at 1 Hz). In the case of ionic sheared gel structured emulsions, exposure to physiological intragastric fluids resulted in a 10 -fold reduction ability of their acid structuring ability, most likely due to the dialysis of egg-box dimer conformations by monovalent cations and protons and the sterical hindering of hydrogen bonding of MM and GG sequences under acidic conditions. Using of non-physiological simulated intragastric fluids was associated with overestimated structuring performance of SA regardless its physical state...|$|R
40|$|In chronic wound management, {{alginate}} dressings {{are used}} to absorb exudate and reduce the microbial burden. Silver alginate offers {{the added benefit of}} an additional antimicrobial pressure on contaminating microorganisms. This present study compares the antimicrobial activity of a RESTORE silver alginate dressing with a silver-free control dressing using a combination of in vitro culture and imaging techniques. The wound pathogens examined included Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, β-haemolytic Streptococcus, and strictly anaerobic bacteria. The antimicrobial efficacy of the dressings was assessed using log 10 reduction and 13 -day corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI) time-course assays. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to visualise the relative proportions of live/dead microorganisms sequestered into the dressings over 24 hours and estimate the comparative speed of kill. The RESTORE silver alginate dressing showed significantly greater log 10 reductions and CZOIs for all microorganisms compared with the control, indicating the antimicrobial effect of ionic silver. Antimicrobial activity was evident against all test organisms for up to 5 days and, in some cases, up to 12 days following an on-going microbial challenge. Imaging bacteria sequestered in the silver-free dressing showed that each microbial species aggregated in the dressing and remained viable for more than 20 hours. Growth was not observed inside of the dressing, indicating a possible microbiostatic effect of the <b>alginate</b> <b>fibres.</b> In comparison, organisms in the RESTORE silver alginate dressing were seen to lose viability at a considerably greater rate. After 16 hours of contact with the RESTORE silver alginate dressing, > 90 % of cells of all bacteria and yeast were no longer viable. In conclusion, collectively, the data highlights the rapid speed of kill and antimicrobial suitability of this RESTORE silver alginate dressing on wound isolates and highlights its overwhelming ability to manage a microbial wound bioburden in the management of infected wounds...|$|R

40|$|An {{inherent}} difficulty {{associated with}} the application of suitable bioscaffolds for tissue engineering is the incorporation of adequate mechanical characteristics into the materials which recapitulate that of the native tissue, whilst maintaining cell proliferation and nutrient transfer qualities.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Tendon {{injuries}} {{can result}} from tendon overuse or trauma, resulting in substantial pain and disability. Given that natural or surgical repair of tendons lead to a poor outcome in terms of mechanical properties and functionality, {{there is a great}} need for tissue engineering strategies. Textile platforms enable the generation of biomimetic constructs [1]. Therefore, the main goal of this study is the development of cell-laden hybrid hydrogel fibers reinforced with a mechanically robust core fiber and their assembly into braided constructs towards replicating tendon mechanical properties and architecture. METHODS: To fabricate mechanically reinforced hydrogel fibres, a commercially available suture was coated using a cell-hydrogel mixture of methacryloyl gelatine (GelMA) and <b>alginate.</b> Composite <b>fibres</b> (CFs) were obtained by ionic crosslinking of alginate followed by photocrosslinking of GelMA. CFs were assembled using braiding technique and the mechanical properties of single fibres and braided constructs were evaluated. Different cells were encapsulated in the hydrogel layer, including MC- 3 T 3, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human tendon-derived cells (TDCs). Cell viability and metabolic activity were evaluated by LIVE/DEAD staining and presto blue assay of metabolic activity. The expression of tendon-related markers and matrix deposition were also investigated. RESULTS: CFs were fabricated with a GelMA:alginate hydrogel layer and using multifilament twisted cotton or biodegradable suturing threads. The biocompatibility of this system was evaluated on encapsulated cells (Fig. 1 a). Cells (MC- 3 T 3, MSCs and TDCs) were homogeneously distributed along the hydrogel layer, being viable up to 14 days in culture. In addition, TDCs were spreading inside the hydrogel after less than 48 h. Moreover, to further improve the mechanical properties of CFs, braided constructs were generated (Fig. 1 b). Braiding CFs together enhanced their tensile strength and the process did not affect the viability of encapsulated cells. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: CFs were generated with a load bearing core and a hydrogel layer towards mimicking both mechanical properties and the matrix-rich microenvironment of tendon tissue. Accordingly, cell behaviour can be further modulated by modifying the hydrogel composition or, ultimately, through the addition of bioactive cues. Finally, braiding CFs together allows tuning the mechanical properties of developed constructs to match those of native tendon tissues.

40|$|Polymers {{reinforced}} with high performance fibres are successfully replacing metal alloys in lightweight aircraft structures. A {{critical factor in}} structural design is the resistance of a structure to progressive damage which develops during its service time. The brittle nature of matrix cracking is {{the main source of}} composite failure initiating ply delamination and fibre to matrix debonding. Bio-inspired autonomous healing systems, embedded in a polymer matrix, are being developed to improve the fracture resistance of structural composites [1, 2, 3]. An exemplary system can consist of fibres with individual compartments, i. e. compartmented fibres, which are filled with a healing liquid. The healing agent is distributed within the fibre in the form of long elongated compartments of ellipsoidal shape with high aspect ratio. The fibres are designed to release the liquid healing agent at multiple specific microcrack sites developed in the polymer matrix as a result of structural loading during its life-time. The advantage of such a fibre as a healing agent carrier is obvious - compartmented fibres enable multiple local healing events. Neither is the whole healing agent consumed in the first damage/healing event (as for hollow fibres) nor is the functionality of remaining compartments affected by the healing event (compared to vascular networks). Compartmented fibres were spun from an oil/water emulsion of a healing agent in an aqueous solution of sodium alginate. The retention of the liquid healing agent (orthodichlorobenzene) in a solid fibre was provided by the coagulation of the <b>alginate</b> polymer during <b>fibre</b> formation. Spun fibres were embedded in polymethylmethacrylate, pre-cracked in 3 point bending and allowed {{a certain period of time}} to self-heal before they were loaded again. Computed micro-tomography was used to visualise damage and healing sites. Test samples with the new fibres located at the likely damage sites were able to recover, (in part) their mechanical properties. The concept of multiple release of healing agent from a compartmented fibre into the surrounding polymer matrix was demonstrated successfully.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{degradation}} of dietary fibres in the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the large intestine, is monitored using in vitroand in vivostudies. First, an in vitromethod to simulate the conditions in the mouth, stomach and small intestine was adapted for food products, which were used in an in vivosatiation study as well. <b>Alginate,</b> a dietary <b>fibre</b> that is able to form a gel under stomach conditions, {{was found to be}} more satiating than cellulose and guar gum. Next, in vitrofermentation were performed in addition to in vivostudies using pigs as models for humans. The rates and products of dietary fibre fermentation depend on the constituent monosaccharide and linkage compositions, degree of polymerisation and molecular conformation of the dietary fibres, {{as well as on the}} adaptability of the microbiota to the dietary fibres. The dietary fibres investigated in the in vivopig studies included resistant starch, alginate and non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) from other feed components. The large intestinal digesta and faecal samples were analysed to study how dietary fibres are degraded in the large intestine. Resistant starch was found to be preferred by the microbiota over NSPs. Hence, the utilisation of NSPs was delayed in the presence of resistant starch. The alginate used in the study was not fully utilised by the microbiota and more than 40 %(w/w) of the alginate intake was excreted in the faeces. The degradation products of alginate included an insoluble alginate fraction with increased guluronic acid content compared to the parental alginate. In addition, alginate oligosaccharides were formed. The time needed by the microbiota to adapt to different dietary fibres varied. For resistant starch, two weeks of adaptation was sufficient, but more than 39 days was required to adapt to alginate. The fermentability differences among diverse dietary fibres led to the conclusion that consumption of a changing diet containing various dietary fibres may ensure that fermentation occurs throughout the colon.    ...|$|R
