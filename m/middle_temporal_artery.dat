40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Understanding the {{vascular}} {{variability of}} the inferior temporal occipital regions {{is essential for}} microsurgical approaches to this cerebral zone. To this end, we carried out a microanatomical study of the inferior temporal cortical branches of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) in order to define their vascularisation territories. METHODS: We studied 40 cerebral hemispheres (20 brains) under an operating microscope. Three brains were fixed in Winkler's solution with latex arterial perfusion and the other 17 brains were fixed in formaldehyde solution. RESULTS: Our revised classification {{was based on the}} following findings. First, the anterior hippocampal artery was always associated with the anterior <b>temporal</b> <b>artery,</b> with the two sharing the vascularisation of the anterior part of the inferior temporal lobe. Second, the middle hippocampal and <b>middle</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> were never present together. Third, the presence of an anterior <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> always involved the presence of a posterior <b>temporal</b> <b>artery.</b> Hence, we classified the temporal branches of the PCA into three new patterns. The first pattern includes the anterior and posterior <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> without the anterior hippocampal artery. The second pattern includes the anterior hippocampal artery and anterior and posterior <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries.</b> The third pattern includes the common <b>temporal</b> <b>artery.</b> The first pattern was found most frequently (n =  23, 57. 5 %), followed by the second (n =  9, 22. 5 %) and third patterns (n =  8, 20 %). CONCLUSIONS: We propose a revised classification of the inferior temporal branches of the PCA that takes into account their vascularisation territories...|$|R
40|$|Histamine induces {{relaxation}} of human cranial arteries. Studies {{have revealed that}} the relaxant histamine H 1 -receptor predominates in human cerebral and the H 2 -receptor in <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries,</b> while H 1 - and H 2 -receptors are of equal importance in the middle meningeal artery. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the role of the endothelium and nitric oxide in histamine-induced responses and to show the presence of mRNA encoding H 1 - and H 2 -receptors in human cranial arteries. Electrophoresis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from human cerebral, <b>middle</b> meningeal and <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries,</b> demonstrated products corresponding to mRNA encoding both H 1 - and H 2 -receptors in arteries with and without endothelium. The amplified PCR products were sequenced and showed 100 % homology with the published sequences of these histamine receptors. A sensitive in vitro system was used to study vasomotor responses to histamine. In precontracted cerebral, <b>middle</b> meningeal and <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> with and without endothelium, histamine caused a concentration-dependent relaxation with Imax values between 87 % and 81 % and pIC 50 values between 8. 14 and 7. 15. In arteries without endothelium the histamine-induced relaxation was significantly less potent (Imax values between 87 % and 66 % and pIC 50 values between 7. 01 and 6. 67) than in cranial arteries with an intact endothelium. The addition of histamine to arteries without endothelium and pretreated with the histamine H 2 -antagonist, cimetidine (10 − 5 [*]M), caused a concentration-dependent contraction of the cranial arteries with Emax values between 86 % and 29 % and pEC 50 values between 7. 53 and 6. 77. This contraction was blocked by the histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist, mepyramine (10 − 7 [*]M), and even turned into a relaxation with Imax values between 84 % and 14 % and pIC 50 values between 7. 42 and 5. 86. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 3 × 10 − 5 [*]M) significantly inhibited the relaxant response to histamine in cerebral and <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> (pIC 50 values between 7. 43 and 7. 13). The combined treatment with L-NAME (3 × 10 − 5 [*]M) and cimetidine (10 − 5 [*]M) caused a further displacement of the concentration-response curve (pIC 50 values between 7. 14 and 6. 57) and decreased the maximum relaxant responses in all three cranial arteries (Imax values between 62 % and 39 %). In conclusion, this is the first study which show mRNA encoding histamine H 1 - and H 2 -receptors in human cranial arteries. The results indicate that histamine-induced {{relaxation of}} human cranial arteries is partially mediated via an endothelial H 1 -receptor coupled to the production of nitric oxide and partially via a H 2 -receptor associated with the smooth muscle cells. In addition, there is evidence for a contractile H 1 -receptor in the smooth muscle cells in these arteries...|$|R
30|$|They {{are usually}} unique lesions, {{although}} cases of multiple cranial cavernomas {{have been described}} [28]. They usually have a size {{at the time of}} diagnosis that ranges between 15 and 25  mm, although lesions of up to 8  cm diameter have been described [78]. Its origin is in the vessels of the diploic space, and their blood supplies are branches of the external carotid artery. The <b>middle</b> and superficial <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> are the main sources of blood supply. Within the lesion, the capillaries are widely dilated and separated by fibrous tissue [77]. Its pathogenesis remains unknown. It was believed that it could be congenital, but this has not yet been proven. A previous trauma could also be an important etiology to consider [77]. The typical presentation is given by the presence of a hard, painless mass that slowly increases in size under an overlying intact skin. Sometimes they are associated with headache, which can be of high intensity when the hemangioma expands [79]. The most common clinical feature is a solid tumor in the skull, painful or painless.|$|R

40|$|Introduction : For {{more than}} a century, the temporalis muscle {{has been used for}} facial reconstructions. More recently, a split temporalis muscle flap {{elevated}} on the superficial temporal pedicle has been described, for which the resulting gain of length makes crossing of the midline possible, as well as reconstruction of substance losses exceeding the midline. Materials and methods : Fourteen fresh cadaveric dissections were performed to study the different techniques for splitting the temporalis muscle. Dissections with catheterization and injection of radio-opaque contrasting agent in the external carotid artery were then performed to specify the vascularization of the flap split on the superficial temporal pedicle. Results : The duplication of the superficial temporal pedicle grants greater length compared to that of the deep pedicles, 57 mm versus 40 (p = 0. 036). The <b>middle</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> is capable of ensuring the vascularization, and therefore the viability, of the split flap.

40|$|Knowledge as to {{the blood}} supply of the human temporalis muscle is limited to its extramuscular path and relations, little {{information}} existing about the intramuscular vascular architecture. To investigate the 3 -dimensional vascular network in the human temporalis muscle, in 5 fresh cadavers an infusion of methylmethacrylate resin was made via the carotid vessels with subsequent removal of the organic tissues by a corrosion process. The vascular corrosion casts of the temporalis muscle were studied by stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In 6 well perfused muscle specimens, the temporalis muscle {{was found to be}} consistently supplied by 3 arteries: the anterior and posterior deep temporal arteries, and the <b>middle</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>artery.</b> Each primary artery branched into the secondary arterioles and then terminal arterioles. The venous network accompanied the arteries, and double veins pairing a single artery was a common finding. Arteriovenous anastomosis was absent, whereas arterioarterial and venovenous anastomoses were common. The capillaries formed a dense interlacing network with an orientation along the muscle fibres.

40|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{application}} of the temporalis muscle flap and its modifications, understanding of the vascular pattern and territories within the muscle remains poor. This study aimed to evaluate the vascular architecture in the human temporalis muscle for surgical application. The material comprised 15 fresh cadavers (30 muscle specimens), which were divided into three groups for vascular infusion by either Indian ink solution, lead oxide solution, or methylmethacrylate resin. The vascular network in the temporalis muscle was analyzed by stereomicroscopy, radiography, and scanning electron microscopy. The human temporalis muscle {{was found to have}} vascular supply from three primary arteries: the anterior deep temporal artery (ADTA), the posterior deep temporal artery (PDTA), and the <b>middle</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> (MTA). Each primary artery branched into the secondary arterioles and then the terminal arterioles. The venous network accompanied the arteries, and double veins pairing one artery was a common finding. The capillaries formed a dense, interlacing network with orientation along the muscle fibres. Arteriovenous anastomosis was absent. In the coronal plane, the vessels were located mainly on the lateral and medial aspects of the muscle with a significantly lower vascular density in the midline. Morphometric analysis of the arterial network showed that the PDTA was larger in size at primary and secondary branching levels than the ADTA and the MTA, whereas no differences were present at the terminal arteriolar levels. The distribution of the arterial territories was as follows: the ADTA occupied 21 % anteriorly, the PDTA occupied 41 % in the middle region, and the MTA occupied 38 % in the posterior region. This improved understanding of the vascular architecture within the temporalis muscle complements the anatomic basis of the flap-splitting technique and increases the safety of its application. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
