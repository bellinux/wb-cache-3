25|$|An October 2014 {{publication}} {{by researchers}} from the University of Queensland stated that the compound eyes of mantis shrimp can detect cancer and the activity of neurons, because they are sensitive to detecting polarised light that reflects differently from cancerous and healthy tissue. The study claims that this ability can be replicated through a camera {{through the use of}} aluminium nanowires to replicate polarisation-filtering microvilli on top of photodiodes. In February 2016 it was also revealed that the shrimps are using a form of reflector of polarised light not seen in nature or human technology before. It allows the manipulation of light across the structure rather than through its depth, the typical way polarisers work. This allows the structure to be both small and <b>microscopically</b> <b>thin,</b> and still be able to produce big, bright, colourful polarised signals.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{a million}} was {{originally}} budgeted {{to heat the}} third rail to prevent ice buildup, but later removed as a cost-cutting move. It was believed that the rapid operation (short headways) would keep the rail free of snow as the passing cars heated the rail. This proved not to work, and in operations at just the wrong conditions close to freezing the opposite occurred; when the train passed and heated the rail, <b>microscopically</b> <b>thin</b> layers of snow would be melted, and if the rail was below zero as a whole, the water would freeze to the rail and cause ice buildup. [...] Another retrofit was required to solve this problem, by adding wooden covers over the rail, a system used throughout Toronto's subway system. Even with these covers in place, the line can be shut down with any heavy snowfall that covers the fourth rail to a depth that fills {{the distance between the}} rail and the linear motor.|$|E

Among the sedimentary rocks, chert and flint are cryptocrystalline. Carbonado, a form of diamond, is also cryptocrystalline. Volcanic rocks, especially of the acidic type such as felsites and rhyolites, may have a cryptocrystalline groundmass as distinguished from pure obsidian (acidic) or tachylyte (basic), which are natural rock glasses.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how till bulk porosity and pore shape, size and connectivity relate to till deformation processes. Methods {{have been developed}} to examine till pores <b>microscopically</b> using <b>thin</b> section analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray computed micro tomography (μCT). Porosity is quantified using digital image analysis of thin section images from the petrographic microscope and SEM and from X-ray μCT. These methods were applied to a selection of Pleistocene tills with diverse properties. The micromorphological techniques have allowed porosity to be related to other till microstructures. Most of the microstructures examined, including the pores, have been interpreted to be indicative of either plastic or brittle subglacial deformation and the type and extent of till deformation has been interpreted to affect bulk porosity, pore type and pore connectivity...|$|R

Thrombotic occlusion was ruled out by direct visualization at reoperation, when a fibrin fusion of two leaflets was released to relieve the stenosis. After a fatal arrhythmia (79 days following insertion of the prosthesis), histological evaluation of the xenograft revealed a reaction on the leaflets, interpreted as predominantly transformed or blast lymphocytes. <b>Microscopically,</b> a <b>thin</b> layer of fibrin was visible over these cells. This fibrin layer could have stitched the commissure closed, producing the aortic stenosis. Such a sequence of events is unique in our past experience with 68 porcine xenograft valves. We believe that this case {{is an example of}} an immune mediated host response caused by rapid early fibrin fusion of prosthetic aortic leaflet margins, which resulted in prosthetic stenosis...|$|R

40|$|Growth layers {{occurring}} in shells of 98 species of pelecypods were examined <b>microscopically</b> in <b>thin</b> section and as natural and etched surfaces. Study began with shells of eleven species known from life history investigations to have annual cycles of growth. Internal microstructural {{features of the}} annual layers in these shells provided criteria for recognition of similar, apparently annual shell increments in eighty-six of eighty-seven other species. All of the specimens feature growth laminae, commonly {{on the order of}} 50 microns in thickness. The specimens from shallow marine environments show either a clustering of growth laminae related to the formation of concentric ridges or minor growth bands on the external shell surface. Based on observations of the number of growth laminae and clusters per annual-growth layer, it was hypothesised that the subannual increments may be related to daily and fortnightly (and in some cases monthly) cycles in the environment. Possible applications of the paleogrowth method in the fields of paleoecology and paleoclimatology are discussed...|$|R

The volume fraction of the coarse aggregate was determined macroscopically from polished plates of the concrete samples. The volume fractions of the cement paste, the fine aggregate and the air voids were determined <b>microscopically</b> from <b>thin</b> sections. Both analyses were carried out by means of point-counting. The mass by volume of the samples was determined according to RILEM Recommendation CPC 11. 3. The cement content of the concrete samples was calculated from the point-counting results combined with the estimated water-cement ratio, the estimated mass by volume of the cement paste and the measured mass by volume of the concrete samples.

Blood was collected by vein puncture from 500 pregnant women in different trimesters (300 from Aba and 200 from Okigwe) and 200 non- pregnant women, 100 from each town. Presence of Malaria parasite was observed <b>microscopically</b> on <b>thin</b> and thick blood smears prepared from each sample. Personal data were collected both orally and from maternity records of the women. The results were analysed statistically using the Chi- square tes t. Only the ring trophozoite and gametocyte forms of Plasmodium falciparum were observed in the infected samples. A total of 270 (54 %) pregnant women out of the 500 examined were infected with P. falciparum whil e 66 (33 %) of the non- pregnant women sampled were infected.

Wood and cloth (such as portions of planes and balloons used to be commonly made) or plastic and fibreglass are less reflective or indeed transparent to radar making them suitable for radomes.

50|$|The {{interference}} {{phenomenon in}} optics occurs {{as a result}} of the wave propagation of light. When light of a given wavelength is reflected back upon itself by a mirror, standing waves are generated, much as the ripples resulting from a stone dropped into still water create standing waves when reflected back by a surface such as the wall of a pool. In the case of ordinary incoherent light, the standing waves are distinct only within a <b>microscopically</b> <b>thin</b> volume of space next to the reflecting surface.|$|E

By adding this coating we are limiting the amount of radiation that leaves the window thus increasing the amount of heat that is retained inside the window.|$|E
40|$|The Dwyka diamictite {{preserves}} {{a record}} of horizontal shortening related {{to the development of}} the Cape Fold Belt at subgreenschist conditions. This shortening was accommodated by folding and thrust faulting, but pressure solution may also have contributed significantly to bulk deformation. Cleavage within the Dwyka group is, in the studied part of the Karoo Basin, subvertical to moderately south dipping, and approximately axial planar to regional folds. The cleavage is anastomosing, leading to the development of ‘tombstone cleavage’, and defined <b>microscopically</b> by <b>thin</b> seams of fine grained dark material. X-ray diffraction analyses show that the diamictite matrix is made up of quartz, feldspars, muscovite and chlorite. Element maps further indicate that the cleavage is defined predominantly by phyllosilicates and minor oxides, implying that it is made up of relatively insoluble material and hydrothermal alteration products. Overall, the cleavage therefore formed by dissolution and removal of mobile elements. This indicates that pressure solution likely accommodated a significant component of shortening during the Cape Orogeny, and provides an example of low temperature cleavage development during orogenesis...|$|R

40|$|The keels of icebergs and ice-pressure ridges plough through unconsolidated sea/lake sediments gouging {{out long}} grooves known as ice keel scour marks. Although {{the surface and}} (more recently) {{subsurface}} morphology of scours are well-documented, little is known {{of the effect of}} grain size on the detectability, style and intensity of sub-scour deformation. This investigation macroscopically and <b>microscopically</b> (two-dimensional <b>thin</b> sections) examines suspected ice keel scour in: (i) glaciolacustrine pebbly sandy mud and (ii) fine-grained sands at Scarborough Bluffs, Ontario, Canada. In this investigation, there is an almost identical suite of deformation structures (individual structures and overprinted structural patterns) to those identified in icebergscoured clays from former Glacial Lake Agassiz (Manitoba, Canada); this confirms that deformation in the pebbly sandy mud and fine-grained sands at Scarborough Bluffs is likely to be indicative of ice keel scour. Discrete differences in the detectability, style and intensity of deformation between the Scarborough Bluffs and Glacial Lake Agassiz sediments are probably a function of grain size in response to ice keel scour. This research provides additional information on the types of structures that are associated with sediment deformation by processes of ice keel scour in a variety of grain sizes. This information is particularly valuable to inform palaeoenvironmental reconstruction and offshore engineering in areas where ice keel scour occurs in a variety of grain sizes. It also demonstrates the potential value of micromorphology where, for example, the study of cores is necessary...|$|R
5000|$|Fuming is a {{technique}} that has been developed in the past 15 years and was popularized by Bob Snodgrass. Fuming consists of heating silver or gold in the flame, so that the metals vaporize or [...] "fume" [...] <b>microscopically</b> <b>thin</b> layers of particles onto the glass. These particles stick to the hot glass surface changing its color with interesting effects. Silver turns clear glass into a yellowish color, giving shades of blues and greens when backed with a dark color, while gold turns clear glass shades of pinks and reds.

50|$|With the {{exception}} of parylene, most organic coatings are readily penetrated by water molecules. A coating preserves the performance of precision electronics primarily by preventing ionizable contaminants such as salts from reaching circuit nodes, and combining there with water to form a <b>microscopically</b> <b>thin</b> electrolyte film. For this reason, coating is far more effective if all surface contamination is removed first, using a highly repeatable industrial process such as vapor degreasing or semi-aqueous washing in a special machine. Extreme cleanliness also greatly improves adhesion.

40|$|Icebergs are {{important}} {{as agents of}} deposition and seafloor reworking on glacier-influenced continental margins. When the keel of an iceberg exceeds water depth it ploughs through soft sediments producing scours/ploughmarks that can be kilometres long, hundreds of metres wide and sometimes tens of metres deep. Because the influence of iceberg keels on sediment is a critical factor when offshore structures (e. g. pipelines, power cables) are installed, the surface morphology of iceberg scours on the seafloor is relatively well-documented. Less however, is known about sub-scour deformation below the seafloor. This is particularly true of iceberg scoured diamicton (poorly sorted sediment comprising a variety of particle sizes), which is present in many high-latitude fjords and continental shelves. The aim {{of this research is}} to examine directly (macroscopically and <b>microscopically,</b> with <b>thin</b> sections) the style and intensity of deformation caused by the scouring action of iceberg keels in diamicton offshore of East Greenland. Results show that a distinctive suite of deformation structures (individual structures and overprinted structural patterns) dominated by planar shear, sediment mixing and high porewater, and dropstones characterises iceberg scoured diamicton. In addition, diamicton from areas of high-intensity iceberg scouring tends to show a wider variety, higher frequency and distribution, more abundant and better-developed deformation structures than diamicton from areas of intermediate- and low-intensity iceberg scouring. Characterising the effects of iceberg scour in diamicton is important more widely to inform: i) reconstruction of the geometry and dynamics of former ice sheets; and ii) installation and protection of offshore engineering structures in diamicton where iceberg scouring presents a geohazard. The value of micromorphology is significant especially in the absence of macroscopic sediment expo- sures/outcrops where the study of cores is necessary instead...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{system of}} spinless fermions in d = 1 + ǫ dimensions, at zero-temperature and in random {{external}} potential is studied using the perturbative renormalization group to first order in disorder and to second order in interaction. We find a superconductor-to-Anderson insulator quantum fixed point at an infinitesimal value of disorder and calculate the correlation length and the dynamical exponents {{to the lowest}} order in ǫ and in interaction. The scaling of conductivity with temperature and the behavior of characteristic temperature scales {{on both sides of}} the transition is determined. The model is expected to be relevant for a p-wave superconductor at low temperatures in strongly disordered media. PACS: 74. 20. MnThe effect of Anderson localization on superconductivity or superfluidity represents a fundamental but still incompletely understood problem in condensed matter physics. The effects of disorder may be expected to be particularly pronounced in low dimensions, d ≤ 2, where arbitrarily weak disorder localizes all single-particle states [1] in a non-interacting system. Experiments on <b>thin,</b> <b>microscopically</b> disordered films at low temperatures, for example, have revealed a sharp separation between the insulating and superconducting regimes as some parameter controlling the amount of disorder is varied [2].

40|$|Abstract. A 12 -month-old American Miniature horse colt was {{presented}} to the Virginia Tech Veterinary Teaching Hospital with a 7 -month history of progressive ataxia. Physical examination revealed a head intention tremor, base-wide stance, and ataxia. Necropsy findings were confined to the brain. There were bilateral areas of liquefactive necrosis and cavitation corresponding to the dorsal accessory olivary and lateral (accessory) cuneate nuclei. Cerebellar folia of the dorsal vermis were <b>thin.</b> <b>Microscopically,</b> the cerebellar cortex was characterized by patchy areas of Purkinje cell loss with associated variable thinning of the molecular and granule cell layers and astrogliosis. Dorsal accessory olivary and lateral cuneate nuclei were cavitated and had mild glial response around their periphery. Additionally, a focus of necrosis and neuropil vacuolization was found in the right putamen. These findings indicate the presence of a neurodegenerative disorder centered, but not confined to, the cerebellum and its connections in this American Miniature horse colt.

For instance, a photo of a yellow flower would expose the emulsion beneath the red and green masks and not the blue mask. The developing process removed the exposed emulsion (under the red and green masks) and diffused the unexposed dye developer (under the blue mask) to its receiving layer, blocking light from coming through.
