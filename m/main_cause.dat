5|$|In the 2001 National Institute of Statistics census, El Hatillo Municipality had 54,225 inhabitants, but {{demographics}} show {{a rapidly}} rising population. With the progressive demographic increase, El Hatillo's population {{is no longer}} exclusive to any particular ethnic group. In 2001 there were 997 births in El Hatillo, equivalent to a rate of 18.4 births per one thousand citizens. The death rate for that same year was 2.9 per one thousand citizens. 2001 data shows {{that there is an}} average of 21.3 years of potential life lost.

5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle tone is the <b>main</b> <b>cause</b> of a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Potchefstroom Hospital, situated in North-West Province, for 2000 - 2002. The <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> of maternal deaths in Potchefstroom Hospital were determined and compared to the <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> for maternal deaths nationally. Methods: Data were collected in a retrospective manner from Potchefstroom Hospital's yearbooks and statistics, 2000 - 2002. The number of deliveries per month, the total number of maternal deaths and the <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> for these deaths were recorded. Results: The MMR for Potchefstroom Hospital in 2000 - 2002 was 354. 7 / 100000 live births, compared to the estimated MMR for SA in 1999 - 2001 of 170 - 200 / 100 000 live births. The <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> of maternal deaths in Potchefstroom Hospital include non-pregnancy-related infection (mainly AIDS), complications of hypertension in pregnancy, obstetrical haemorrhage, pre-existing maternal disease and pregnancy-related sepsis. Conclusions: The <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> for maternal deaths in Potchefstroom Hospital correlated well with the <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> nationally. Of interest was that, compared to national statistics, there was a higher percentage of indirect causes of maternal death (mainly due to HIV/AIDS) than direct causes of deaths in Potchefstroom Hospital. However, it has been observed nationally that the percentage of indirect deaths compared to direct deaths is on the increase. This national trend is caused by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. General recommendations are made, which can be instituted to help lower the MMR in Potchefstroom Hospital and nationally. Articl...|$|R

The <b>main</b> <b>cause</b> of withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew {{to be with their}} husbands when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some left because of the realities of a nursing career.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies contain unique {{chemical}} compounds that {{are derived from}} phenylpropanoids. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in the joints, a <b>main</b> <b>cause</b> of gouty arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce this side effect. The natural function of these compounds may be to quench reactive oxygen species produced by plants as a defensive response to fungal infection.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} primarily addresses mortality {{patterns and}} trends by <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> {{of death in}} the post-communist countries of Central Asia, Central Europe and the Baltic region together with low mortality populations such as those of France, Spain and the USA. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the changes in the mortality levels and its structure by the <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> of death by sex and age, and confronted with low mortality populations between the period of 1985 and 2005, respectively. The first (and main) part of the work therefore focuses on cause-specific mortality levels and its relative structure by <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> {{of death in the}} selected countries. Moreover, the different patterns of excess male mortality were also observed. The second part is concentrated at the age-standardized mortality levels by <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> of death. The research identified several important issues encasing the field of mortality, especially in the cause-specific mortality situation in Central Asian republics.

5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, {{especially in the}} peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as the <b>main</b> <b>cause</b> of dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the <b>main</b> <b>cause</b> of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The <b>main</b> <b>cause</b> of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E
