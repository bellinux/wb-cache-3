2500|$|Ladies of the Canyon was {{an instant}} smash on FM radio and sold briskly, {{eventually}} becoming Mitchell's first gold album (selling over a half million copies). She {{made a decision to}} stop touring for a year and just write and paint, yet she was still voted [...] "Top Female Performer" [...] for 1970 by Melody Maker, a leading UK pop music magazine. On the April 1971 release of James Taylor's <b>Mud</b> <b>Slide</b> Slim and the Blue Horizon album, Mitchell is credited with backup vocals – along with Carole King – on the track [...] "You've Got a Friend". The songs she wrote during the months she took off for travel and life experience appeared on her next album, Blue, released in June 1971. Comparing Joni Mitchell's talent to his own, David Crosby said, [...] "By the time she did Blue, she was past me and rushing toward the horizon".|$|E
2500|$|His {{career success}} {{so far and}} appeal to female fans of various ages piqued {{tremendous}} interest in him, prompting a March 1, 1971, Time magazine cover story of him as [...] "the face of new rock." [...] It compared his strong-but-brooding persona to that of Wuthering Heights Heathcliff and to The Sorrows of Young Werther, and said, [...] "Taylor's use of elemental imagery—darkness and sunlight, references to roads traveled and untraveled, to fears spoken and left unsaid—reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music." [...] One of the writers described his look as [...] "a cowboy Jesus," [...] to which Taylor later replied, [...] "I thought I was trying to look like George Harrison." [...] Released in April, <b>Mud</b> <b>Slide</b> Slim and the Blue Horizon also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor's biggest hit single in the US, {{a version of the}} Carole King standard [...] "You've Got a Friend" [...] (featuring backing vocals by Joni Mitchell), which reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late July. The follow-up single, [...] "Long Ago and Far Away," [...] also made the Top 40 and reached #4 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The album itself reached #2 on the album charts, which would be Taylor's highest position ever until the release of his 2015 album, Before This World, which went to #1, superseding Taylor Swift.|$|E
