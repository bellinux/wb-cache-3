40|$|Not {{many women}} can {{claim to have}} changed history, but Nafis Sadik set that goal in her youth, and change the world she did. Champion of Choice tells the {{remarkable}} story of how Sadik, born into a prominent Indian family in 1929, came to be the world’s foremost advocate for women’s health and reproductive rights, the first female director of a United Nations agency, and “one {{of the most powerful}} women in the world” (London Times). An obstetrician, wife, mother, and devout Muslim, Sadik has been a courageous and tireless advocate for women, insisting on discussing the difficult issues that impact their lives: education, contraception, abortion, as well as rape and other forms of violence. After Sadik joined the fledgling UN Population Fund in 1971, her groundbreaking strategy for providing females with education and the tools to control their own fertility has dramatically influenced the global birthrate. This book is the first to examine Sadik’s contribution to history and the unconventional methods she has employed to go head-to-head with world leaders to improve millions of women’s lives. Interspersed between the chapters recounting Sadik’s life are vignettes of females around the globe who represent her campaign against domestic abuse, child <b>marriage,</b> <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation,</b> and other human rights violations. With its insights into the political, religious, and domestic battles that have dominated women’s destinies, Sadik’s life story is as inspirational as it is dramatic...|$|E

50|$|In Liberia, men {{and women}} have clear gender {{divisions}} of labor. Women typically clean, cook, and take care of children, but their contributions to the family are rarely recognized as work. Men are seen {{as the head of the}} households and the breadwinners. Women are held back in society by biases in education, health care, land ownership, and credit, along with cultural practices like pre-arranged <b>marriages</b> and female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation.</b> These factors constrain women from entering the workforce. The traditional role of women as caretaker in Liberian society is an example of Martha Nussbaum's idea of a resource-based approach, favoring protection of the status quo.|$|R

The analysis resulted in the finding that gender problem revealed in the novel was due to the violations of the gender equality principles. The violations of the gender equality principles included the practice of honor killing, women‘s face covering, the construction of women‘s inferiority, the prohibition of entering mosque for women, segregation of sexes, divorced women‘s getting no child custody rights, no obligationof educating women, forced marriage, temporary <b>marriage,</b> female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> and improper polygamy practice.

5000|$|The {{history of}} the {{evolution}} of the traits of women in Kenya can be divided into Women within Swahili culture, Women in British Kenya, and Kenyan Women post-Independence. The condition and status of the female population in Kenya has faced many changes over the past century. The British colonized Kenya from 1888-1963. British imperialism had a large impact on Kenyan culture and still does today. Before British colonization, women played important roles in the community from raising children and maintaining the family to working on farms and in marketplaces. The influence of a patriarchy became even stronger with colonization which stripped women of many responsibilities and opportunities they once had. Even after Kenya regained independence in 1963, women were still oppressed and not given many opportunities like education except for a small number of young women. Women still faced many problems such as child marriages and arranged <b>marriages,</b> Female <b>Genital</b> <b>Mutilation</b> (FGM), the AIDS epidemic as well as lack of education. There are very few women in power in Kenya which also plays a role in the continued oppression of the female population.|$|R

Since political, religious and local community leaders are most often men, men and boys have great influence over any effort to improve girls' lives and achieve gender equality. PLAN International's 2011 Annual Report points out that men have more influence and {{may be able to}} convince communities to curb early <b>marriage</b> and female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> (FGM) more effectively than women. Egyptian religious leader Sheikh Saad, who has campaigned against the practice, is quoted in the report: “We have decided that our daughter will not go through this bad, inhumane experience ...

25|$|The {{concept of}} human {{security}} has developed {{out of the}} precepts put forth by the United Nations, wherein there has been critique of Human Security's focus on what is deemed acceptable behaviors. Human security perspectives view practices such as child <b>marriage</b> and female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> {{as a threat to}} human (more specifically women) security and well-being in the Global North, while it is more common that these events occur predominately in the Global Southern states. Thus it is seen by states with a traditional human security outlook, to see it as their duty to intervene and perpetuate this eurocentric ideal of what human security looks like, and what is best to protect the familiar concept of women. This can be seen as an infringement on the traditional practices found within some sovereign states of the Global South, and a threat to ways of life and processes of development.|$|R

40|$|Over the years, {{women have}} {{experienced}} discrimination {{in many parts}} of the world. Besides being regarded as the weaker sex, women have endured workplace discrimination, sexual harassment and even domestic violence. Among some communities, wife battering which is perpetrated by their husbands is considered to be an art. Other discriminatory practices include pornification of women in advertisements, victim-blaming, where women rape victims are accused of dressing provocatively, and general marginalization and misogynistic practices. Other undesirable practices include forced marriages and child marriages where underage girls are married off to old men who pay bride price. When bride price is viewed from this angle, it acquires a different significance as it commercializes women and the <b>marriage</b> institution. Female <b>Genital</b> <b>Mutilation</b> (FGM) is another practice that demeans and dehumanizes women depending on the reasons advanced for its practice. FGM is one of the major human violations meted against women. This paper looks at female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> (FGM) and attempts to outline some of the reasons for the persistence of the practice {{in many parts of}} the world despite concerted efforts to eradicate the practice. Although the practice is criminalized in many countries, the perpetrators receive low sentences for the crime thus failing to act as a deterrent. This paper is significant in that it gives an insight into the socio-cultural justification and hence perpetuation of FGM...|$|R

5000|$|Like other {{domestic}} violence victims, immigrant battered women {{have often been}} subjected to multiple forms of violence and exploitation, from rape and workplace sexual harassment to child sexual abuse. Lawyers representing battered women who have endured other forms of gender-based violence must be aware that these experiences of abuse often intensify the victim’s trauma and may require referrals to specialized social service and health care providers {{as well as to}} other legal professionals. Advocates for immigrant women may find this situation particularly daunting. Because the violence may have taken place in a different culture, in a form with which you are unfamiliar, your client may have urgent needs that you are unaware of and rights that, as a consequence, are never vindicated. Some of these forms of violence, like trafficking in persons and exploitation in internet marriages, are more common in the cases of clients from industrialized societies.

40|$|Violence {{against women}} is a {{worldwide}} malaise, eating {{deep into the}} fabric of society. It has become common to see women violated in different aspects of life by their male counterparts, be it their fathers, brothers, husbands or for that matter total strangers. Unfortunately women bear the brunt of a lot of violence in our society and silently cover them up so as to avoid stigmatization or protect their families. In recent times in Nigeria, there have been several cases of violence against women and, most of these cases are kept silent despite their pervasiveness. Issues like sexual harassment, trafficking in women and girls, sex selection, early <b>marriage,</b> female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> etc are fast becoming epidemics plaguing Nigeria as it is the case globally. This situation is unabatting globally and has elicited public outcry leading to the intervention of the United Nations General Assembly as well as member states coming out with several treaties, laws and policies on women in a bid to protecting the woman from the dehumanizing violation of human rights. This work among other issues examined violence against women and its diverse ramifications and exposed {{the fact that it is}} a human rights violation that must be stopped.

40|$|Gender disproportions {{have been}} {{part and parcel of}} most African {{cultures}} since time immemorial. Demographically, women are over a half population in most of the African countries but their participation in sectors of socio-economic and political spheres have remained inadequately represented. The enduring and biased beliefs on gender roles that view women much less important as compared to men are what forms the basis of concern to the welfare of women and most importantly the women entrepreneurs. This study reveals the long-standing cultural practices that have contributed to gender inequality and goes further to demystify areas in which women have continually experienced inequality and thus affecting their entrepreneurial spirit. Through the desk research methodology, it can be deduced that the following are key areas that pause a threat to women socio-economic and political development and hence the inequality being experienced even today in the twenty first century: harmful <b>marriage,</b> female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation,</b> wife inheritance and HIV scourge, access to land including land rights and right to property, over-emphasizing patriarchal system of family, and gender violence. These factors compounded together, have resulted for unfortunate experiences that have been witnessed in the education sector, political participation, participation in policy making, gender division of labour and inaccess to credit facility. These experiences have severely thwarted entrepreneurial growth of women. The study therefore recommends that there is imperative need for a paradigm shift in these areas to ensure women are not only liberated and empowered but also their full participation in the entrepreneurship activities are highly strengthened and promoted...|$|R
