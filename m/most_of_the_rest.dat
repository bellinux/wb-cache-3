By the year 2007 the Internet clearly dominated and captured 97% of all the information in telecommunication networks (<b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> (2%) through mobile phones). , an estimated 21.9% of the world population {{has access to the}} Internet with the highest access rates (measured {{as a percentage of the}} population) in North America (73.6%), Oceania/Australia (59.5%) and Europe (48.1%). In terms of broadband access, Iceland (26.7%), South Korea (25.4%) and the Netherlands (25.3%) led the world.|$|E

30|$|Elevated {{temperature}} from fire may not penetrate {{far into}} the soil because soil temperature declines exponentially with depth (Anderson 1990, Auld and Bradstock 1996). Therefore, the subsurface soil temperature may not have increased enough to impact subsurface invertebrate resting stages even if impacts occurred at <b>the</b> surface. Crustacean <b>resting</b> stages are not found only at the soil surface and those buried 0.25 cm beneath the surface in playas readily hatch (Bright 2015). Therefore, fire treatments would likely not affect <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> stages within <b>the</b> top two centimeters. Instead, exposure to the correct environmental cues for hatching (inundation, light, and temperature) produced similar hatching of crustaceans regardless of fire treatment.|$|R

In early 1920, the ship was in the Black Sea supporting the Whites against the Bolsheviks. Cardiff spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of her time between the world wars overseas or in reserve. The ship played a minor role in World War II as she was initially assigned to the Northern Patrol, but became a training ship in late 1940 and continued in that role for the rest of the war.

40|$|Akt is encoded by a {{gene family}} for which each isoform serves {{distinct}} but overlapping functions. Based on <b>the</b> phenotypes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> germ line gene disruptions, Akt 1 {{has been associated}} with control of growth, whereas Akt 2 has been linked to metabolic regulation. Here we show that Akt 1 serves an unexpected role in <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> energy metabolism, as mice deficient for Akt 1 exhibit protection from diet-induced obesity and its associated insulin resistance. Although skeletal muscle contributes <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> and exercising energy expenditure, muscle-specific deletion of Akt 1 does not recapitulate the phenotype, indicating that <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> Akt 1 in skeletal muscle is cell nonautonomous. These data indicate a previously unknown function of Akt 1 in energy metabolism and provide a novel target for treatment of obesity...|$|R

He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.|$|E

About 70% of bat species are insectivores. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> are frugivores, or fruit eaters.

From the 1960s {{until the}} early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused {{the use of the}} railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle.

To reach 100percent, BES listed but did not differentiate by zoning type the roughly 20percent of the watershed that lies beyond the Portland city limits.
