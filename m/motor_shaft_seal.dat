40|$|The use of rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> made of PTFE {{material}} is ever increasing in the sealing of moving machine elements {{as a consequence}} of their high thermal and chemical resistance. Primarily in the sector of pressure-loadable rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> there is a high development demand. High circumferential velocity and high pressure of the liquid to be sealed make the use of elastomer seals impossible. A promising alternative is presented by PTFE rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals.</b> The relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> lip <b>seal</b> represents a special design among PTFE rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals.</b> Not relying on thermal resistance of the PTFE material alone, the relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> as far as possible reduces the heat generating frictional moment for the permissible pressure range of the liquid to be sealed. Besides a high relative velocity at the sealing edge, thus, at the same time, high pressure of the liquid to be sealed is possible. Within the scope of this report, a contribution was made to the optimization of the relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seal.</b> Earlier designs of the relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seal,</b> similar to other commercially available rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> sometimes exhibited temporary surge-like leakages, the cause of which is the thermal expansion of the PTFE material. This was remedied by a functional analysis of the sealing system, experimental investigations, and by the use of FE simulations. In this way, the plastic memory effect, the temperature-dependent re-deformation capability of pre-deformed workpieces, proved to be a helpful measure against thermal expansion. (orig.

40|$|Evidence of {{propellant}} leakage across ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> {{has been}} noted during the disassembly of five flight engines and one test engine at the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, White Sands Test Facility. Based on data collected during the disassembly of these five engines, the consequences of propellant leakage across the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> {{can be divided into}} four primary areas of concern: Damage to the ball-valve pinion shafts, damage to sleeved bearings inside the ball-valve and actuator assemblies, degradation of the synthetic rubber o-rings used in the actuator assemblies, and corrosion and degradation to the interior of the actuator assemblies. The exact time at which leakage across the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> occurs has not been determined, however, the leakage most likely occurs during engine firings when, depending on the specification used, ball-valve cavity pressures range as high as 453 to 550 psia. This potential pressure range for the ball-valve cavities greatly exceeds the acceptance leakage test pressure of 332 psia. Since redesign and replacement of the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> is unlikely, the near term solution to prevent damage that occurs from shaft-seal leakage is to implement a routine overhaul and maintenance program for engines in the fleet. Recommended repair, verification, and possible preventative maintenance measures are discussed in the paper...|$|R

Generally, the combination of vessel pressure, shaft diameter, and fan speed encountered in autoclaves is such as to make the use of a <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> reasonably practicable.|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage is an {{innovator}} approach to fight climate changes through {{the reduction of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Abandoned coal mines are currently less studied than other reservoirs but {{could also be used}} for the storage of carbon dioxide. However the problem of <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> appears to be central as far as the safety, economic, ecologic and health stakes of geological storage are concerned. The purpose of the present work is the study of <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> in the framework of CO 2 storage projects. More precisely the problem consists in the numerical study, with the LAGAMINE finite elements code, of gas transfers around a <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> system. A coupled hydro-mechanical model of unsaturated geomaterials is presented. The response of the flow model is first studied through a simple synthetic problem simulating the injection of gas in a concrete-made column. It stands out of this first modeling that the advection of the gas phase represents the main transfer mechanism of CO 2 in highly unsaturated materials. Furthermore the setting of a bentonite barrier seal allows limiting considerably gas influx to the biosphere. A 2 D axisymetric hydromechanical modeling of the Anderlues natural gas storage site is then performed. The design of the <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> system appears to be a determinant element to evaluate the risks of CO 2 leakage...|$|R

The newly developed Canned Lube Oil Pump is the solution. It combines the proven screw pump design with the proven Oil-Through motor design. The resulting compact pumping unit is substantially smaller and lighter than the legacy unit. The motor is cooled by a portion of the oil, that is being pumped to the system. This eliminates the motor cooling fan and eliminates grease packed motor bearings, further reducing maintenance.
