40|$|One of {{the main}} {{hallmarks}} of the fronto-temporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP- 17) is the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain as an outcome of the aggregation of <b>mutated</b> tau protein. This process occurs due {{to a number of}} genetic mutations in the MAPT gene. One of these mutations is the ∆K 280 mutation in the tau R 2 repeat domain, which promotes the aggregation vis-à-vis that for the wild-type tau. Experimental studies have shown that in Alzheimer's disease Aβ peptide forms aggregates both with itself and with wild-type tau. By analogy, in FTDP- 17, it is likely that there are interactions between Aβ and <b>mutated</b> tau, but the molecular mechanisms underlying such interactions remain to be elucidated. Thus, to investigate the interactions between Aβ and <b>mutated</b> tau, we constructed fourteen ∆K 280 <b>mutated</b> tau-Aβ 17 - 42 oligomeric complexes. In seven of the <b>mutated</b> tau-Aβ 17 - 42 oligoemric complexes the <b>mutated</b> tau oligomers exhibited hydrophobic interactions in their core domain, and in the other seven <b>mutated</b> tau-Aβ 17 - 42 oligoemric complexes the <b>mutated</b> tau oligomers exhibited salt-bridge interactions in their core domain. We considered two types of interactions between <b>mutated</b> tau oligomers and Aβ oligomers: interactions of one monomer of the Aβ oligomer with one monomer of the <b>mutated</b> tau oligomer to form a single-layer conformation, and interactions of the entire Aβ oligomer with the entire <b>mutated</b> tau oligomer to form a double-layer conformation. We also considered parallel arrangements of Aβ trimers alternating with <b>mutated</b> tau trimers in a single-layer conformation. Our results demonstrate that in the interactions of Aβ and <b>mutated</b> tau oligomers, polymorphic <b>mutated</b> tau-Aβ 17 - 42 oligomeric complexes were observed, with a slight preference for the double-layer conformation. Aβ trimers alternating with <b>mutated</b> tau trimers constituted a structurally stable confined β-structure, albeit one that was energetically less stable than all the other constructed models...|$|R

In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him. He could also levitate, {{and he was able}} to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could <b>mutate</b> to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread of cold viruses are {{physical}} measures such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they <b>mutate</b> rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the player}} can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition. The player has {{a limited amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by monsters. Nevertheless, players can regain their health by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and <b>mutate</b> into much deadlier opponents.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Neo Cortex and his {{assistant}} Doctor Nitrus Brio create the Evolvo-Ray, a device they use to <b>mutate</b> the various animals living on the islands into beasts with superhuman strength. They experiment on Crash, a peaceful bandicoot who Cortex intends {{to be the leader}} of his growing military of animal soldiers. Despite Brio's warnings, Cortex subjects Crash to the untested Cortex Vortex in an attempt to control him. The Vortex rejects Crash, allowing him to escape. After Crash leaps out a window and falls to the ocean below, Cortex prepares a female bandicoot named Tawna for experimentation.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV. However, SIV is a weak virus, and it is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to <b>mutate</b> into HIV. Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, it can only spread throughout {{the population in the}} presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa prior to the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} role {{of the immune system}} is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly <b>mutate</b> into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to <b>mutate.</b> After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can <b>mutate</b> to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E

5|$|The Powerpuff Girls Movie was {{released}} in the United States on July 3, 2002, by Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network. The movie, a prequel to the series, {{tells the story of}} how the Powerpuff Girls were created, and how Mojo Jojo became a supervillain. After Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were created by Professor Utonium to help the city against crime, they end up only causing chaos in Townsville. Down about how everyone refers to them as freaks, they turn to Mojo Jojo, a monkey who says he is there to help make people like them again. Unknown to the girls, Mojo Jojo was Professor Utonium's lab chimp helper who was mutated as a cause from the Powerpuff Girls being made and has become super smart as a result and jealous of them. Mojo Jojo ends up tricking the girls into helping him make a machine to <b>mutate</b> other chimps. Seeing what they have done the kids run away in shame but come back after seeing Professor Utonium in trouble, and Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup end up beating Mojo Jojo and his army of mutated smart chimps and saving the day, thus becoming Townsville's new defenders. The movie received a rating of 63% at Rotten Tomatoes and received some criticism for the violence involved. In all, the movie grossed $16 million worldwide with an $11 million budget.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the {{immunoglobulin}} variable heavy chain (IgVH) genes have revealed that B-cell chronic lympho-cytic leukemia (B-CLL) consists of at least 2 clinical entities with either so-matically <b>mutated</b> or unmutated VH genes. We have analyzed the VH gene mutation status and VH gene usage in 119 B-CLL cases and correlated them to overall survival. A novel finding was the preferential use of the VH 3 - 21 gene in <b>mutated</b> cases, whereas biased VH 1 - 69 gene usage was found in unmutated cases as previously re-ported. Interestingly, the subset of <b>mutated</b> cases using the VH 3 - 21 gene displayed distinctive genotypic/pheno-typic characteristics with shorter average length of the complementarity determining region 3 and clonal expres-sion of l light chains. In addition, this <b>mutated</b> subset showed significantly shorter survival than other <b>mutated</b> cases and a similar clinical course to unmutated cases. We therefore sug-gest that B-CLL cases with <b>mutated</b> VH 3 - 21 genes may constitute an addi-tional entity of B-CLL. (Blood. 2002; 99...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the normal/mutated allelic {{ratio of the}} Ha-ras- 1 gene in mouse skin squamous cell carcinomas induced by initiation with dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and promotion with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate. DNA for these studies was obtained from short-term tumor cultures (24 - 72 hr) to eliminate the contribution of stromal and inflammatory cells to the sample. The allelotypic analysis was performed in 25 squamous cell carcinomas by quantitative radio-analysis of the Xba I {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} as detected by BS 9, a v-Ha-ras probe, and rehybridization of the Southern blots with probes for chromosomes 7 and 8. Approximately 85 % of the tumors presented overrepresentation of the <b>mutated</b> allele in the form of 1 normal/ 2 <b>mutated</b> (12 tumors), 0 normal/ 3 <b>mutated</b> (4 tumors), 0 normal/ 2 <b>mutated</b> (3 tumors), and gene amplification (3 tumors). No tumor was found with a 2 normal/ 1 <b>mutated</b> allelic ratio. These results support our previous cytogenetic studies, indicating that trisomy of chromosome 7 is present in the majority of these tumors and show that nonrandom duplication of the chromosome carrying the <b>mutated</b> Ha-ras- 1 allele appears to be a major mechanism by which the <b>mutated</b> gene is overrepresented...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} introduced random {{mutations in}} the sugar-binding loops of a leguminous lectin and screened the resulting <b>mutated</b> lectins for novel specificities using cell surface display. Screening of a <b>mutated</b> peanut agglutinin (PNA), revealed a <b>mutated</b> PNA {{with a distinct}} preference for heparin. Glycan microarray analyses using the <b>mutated</b> lectin fused to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin, revealed that a particular sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG), heparin, had the highest binding affinity for <b>mutated</b> PNA among 97 glycans tested, although wild-type PNA showed affinity towards Galβ 1 - 3 GalNAc and similar galactosylated glycans. Further analyses of binding specificity using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay demonstrated that the <b>mutated</b> PNA specifically binds to heparin, and weakly to de- 2 -O-sulfated heparin, but not to other GAG chains including de- 6 -O-sulfated and de-N-sulfated heparins. The <b>mutated</b> PNA had six amino acid substitutions within the eight amino acid-long sugar-binding loop. In this loop, the heparin-binding like motif comprised three arginine residues at positions 124, 128, and 129, and a histidine at position 125 was present. Substitution of each arginine or histidine residue to alanine reduced heparin-binding ability, indicating {{that all of these}} basic amino acid residues contributed to heparin binding. Inhibition assay demonstrated that heparin and dextran sulfate strongly inhibited <b>mutated</b> PNA binding to heparin in dose-dependent manner. The <b>mutated</b> PNA could distinguish between CHO cells and proteoglycan-deficient mutant cells. This is the first report establishing a novel leguminous lectin that preferentially binds to highly sulfated heparin and may provide novel GAG-binding probes to distinguish between heterogeneous GAG repeating units...|$|R
