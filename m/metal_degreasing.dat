40|$|Degreasing is {{a process}} for {{cleaning}} products from water-insoluble substances as grease, fats, oils, waxes, carbon deposits, fluxes and tars.

40|$|This article reviews {{exposure}} {{information available}} for trichloroethylene (TCE) and assesses {{the magnitude of}} human exposure. The primary sources releasing TCE into the environment are <b>metal</b> cleaning and <b>degreasing</b> operations. Releases occur into all media but mostly into the air due to its volatility. It is also moderately soluble in water and can leach from soils into groundwater. TCE has commonly been found in ambient air, surface water, and groundwaters. The 1998 air levels in microg/m(3) across 115 monitors can be summarized as follows: range = 0. 01 - 3. 9, mean = 0. 88. A California survey of large water utilities in 1984 found a median concentration of 3. 0 microg/L. General population exposure to TCE occurs primarily by inhalation and water ingestion. Typical average daily intakes have been estimated as 11 - 33 microg/day for inhalation and 2 - 20 microg/day for ingestion. A {{small portion of the}} population is expected to have elevated exposures as a result of {{one or more of these}} pathways: inhalation exposures to workers involved in degreasing operations, ingestion and inhalation exposures occurring in homes with private wells located near disposal/contamination sites, and inhalation exposures to consumers using TCE products in areas of poor ventilation.

40|$|Dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) are {{chemical}} compounds that can contaminate soil and groundwater {{to the point}} of irreparability. These substances are only slightly soluble in water, and are much denser than water. Because of their solubility, DNAPLs form separate liquid phases in groundwater, and because of their density, DNAPLs sink in aquifers instead of floating at the water table, making it extremely difficult to detect their presence. If left untreated in the ground, they can taint fresh water sources. Common DNAPLs include chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds such as carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene. Trichloroethylene was used during {{the early days of the}} Space Program, as a solvent for flushing rocket engines, and for <b>metal</b> cleaning and <b>degreasing</b> of equipment, electronics, and heavy machinery.

Evidence of excess cancer incidence among occupational cohorts with the most rigorous exposure assessment is found for kidney cancer (relative risk [RR] = 1. 7, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 1 - 2. 7), liver cancer (RR = 1. 9, 95 % CI(1. 0 - 3. 4), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR = 1. 5, 95 % CI 0. 9 - 2. 3) as well as for cervical cancer, Hodgkin's disease, and multiple myeloma.

Currently, producing a good painted metal surface involves a lengthy and costly process. The <b>metal</b> surface is <b>degreased,</b> conversion coated, painted, and finally dried. The conversion coating is necessary when ordinary paints are used. An ordinary paint does not adhere very well to the bare metal surface. An ordinary paint does adhere to a conversion coating. The process for applying the conversion coating is time consuming, energy wasting, and often involves toxic compounds which are detrimental to the environment. A process which eliminates the use of a conversion coating is desirable. A novel technique of in-situ phosphatizing coatings is a possible alternative coating process. A single-step in-situ phosphatizing coating (ISPC) is formulated by predispersing a phosphatizing reagent into the paint. Ideally, the in-situ phosphatizing reagent (ISPR) reacts with the metal surface and simultaneously bonds with the paint film. An ISPC is formulated differently than an ordinary paint. Therefore, it adheres to a meted surface without the use of a conversion coating. The ISPR is acidic by nature. Polyester-melamine coatings are catalyzed by an acid catalyst. In a polyester-melamine coating the ISPR serves a dual purpose. First, the ISPR phosphatizes the metal surface. Second, the ISPR catalyzes the cross-linking reaction between polyester polyol and melamine in a polyester-melamine coating. The polyester-melamine ISPC is successfully applied to aluminum and steel. A comparison is made between the ISPC and the regular polyester-melamine coating which is catalyzed with p-toluenesulfonic acid. The resulting coatings are compared using electrochemical methods, thermal methods, and standard accelerated corrosion tests. The electrical equivalent circuits are also compared. The adhesion of the ISPC is far superior to the adhesion of the control on both the steel and the aluminum. The results suggest that polyester-melamine coatings can be altered into an ISPC. Also, the ISPR is able to catalyze the cross-linking reactions needed to cure the paint...|$|R

Due to its prevalence and toxicity, TCE has been listed {{as one of the}} most hazardous organic compounds. Physical displacement methods (air stripping and carbon adsorption) are not as desirable as the catalytic breakdown of TCE into ethane using palladium-based materials. This thesis reports on the design, synthesis, characterization, and testing of Pd supported on gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) as a remediation catalyst for the hydrodechlorination (HDC) of TCE in water at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. The unique surface, structural, and electronic properties of 20 nm Pd/Au particles were found to contribute to the significantly enhanced HDC activity. Pd/Au NPs synthesized with smaller diameters (4 nm) reduced metals cost and increased effectiveness. Mass transfer effects during batch reactions were analyzed for the NP catalysts. Pd/Au NPs were immobilized on a support through electrostatic attractions, and demonstrated higher HDC activity compared to conventionally impregnated Pd and Pd-Au supported catalysts. Pd/A 1 2 O 3, Pd NPs, and Pd/Au NP catalysts were found to be active for HDC of other chlorinated ethenes, with reaction mechanism studies supporting a sequential dechlorination pathway for TCE HDC. The reaction was found to be first-order in TCE and half-order in H 2 for our Pd/Au catalysts, but was different from the half-order TCE and first-order H 2 dependence of pure Pd catalysts. The Pd/Au nanostructure was more resistant to catalyst deactivation from chlorides and sulfides, relative to pure Pd catalysts. As a different example of using NPs as a catalyst support, a sol-gelation method was developed for the synthesis of molybdenum oxide (MoO 3) supported on zirconia (ZrO 2) NPs. It was hypothesized that ZrO 2 NPs can support amorphous MoO 3 as a thermally stable, highly active oxidation catalyst. MoOX/ZrO 2 containing up to 23 wt% amorphous MoOX was successfully synthesized and the nanostructure was analyzed in the context of colloid chemistry.

A number of leaks of radioactive liquors to ground {{are known to have}} occurred from several plant buildings, vaults and disposal trenches within and around the Separation area at the Sellafield nuclear site over the past 50 years 1. The most significant of these leaks have occurred from the Magnox Silo, the Caesium Extraction Plant, the Magnox Reprocessing Pump House, the Sludge Storage Tanks, the Burial Pits and the Medium Active Evaporation and Thermal Denitration Plant. The radioactive contamination will be accompanied by other components of spent fuel reprocessing, including inorganic salts from neutralised acids, solvents and other organic compounds along with the typical contaminants commonly associated with large industrial activity such as heavy <b>metals,</b> fuel, oils, <b>degreasing</b> agents etc. The research in this thesis describes the effects of common industrial contaminants on the behaviour of Cs and Sr sorption to bentonite and montmorillonite clay minerals. Batch sorption experiments of Cs and Sr uptake onto bentonite and montmorillonite in a number of complex systems were investigated as follows: 1. 	Initial batch sorption experiments investigating the normal behaviour of the clay minerals. 2. 	Introduction of anthropogenic organic ligands EDTA, NTA and picolinic acid into the system and their influence on Sr and Cs uptake. 3. 	Time dependent studies investigating the effect that residence time of the anthropogenic organic ligands has on the sorption properties of montmorillonite and bentonite. 4. 	Quaternary systems where simulant Magnox sludge equilibrated water, at a number of concentrations, was introduced to ternary systems containing anthropogenic organic ligands. 5. 	Time dependent studies investigating the effect of hydrocarbons TCE, toluene and naphthalene on the uptake of Cs and Sr to bentonite and montmorillonite. The batch sorption experiments show that the presence of anthropogenic organic ligands reduces the uptake of Cs and Sr by both montmorillonite and bentonite. It is also shown that the presence of simulant Magnox sludge in quaternary systems can also reduce the uptake of Cs and Sr, with significant reductions in sorption observed for Sr sorption in EDTA quaternary systems. Further, the uptake of Cs and Sr to bentonite and montmorillonite appears to decrease with increasing anthropogenic organic ligand residence time. This suggests that the ligands are altering the surface of the clay minerals reducing the number of available binding sites. The influence of hydrocarbons shows a significant decrease in sorption after 3 months for Cs and Sr sorption to montmorillonite. There were no further significant changes for all other hydrocarbon systems investigated...|$|R
