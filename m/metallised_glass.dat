40|$|A {{process for}} the {{production}} of a protective layer with reflecting and/or absorbent properties, in which a protective layer with a thickness of 5 - 150 microns consisting of an organically modified silicic acid polycondensate and/or (hetero) - polycondensate is applied to the substrate, and in which this layer contains 2 - 30 wt% of an additive (A) with reflecting and/or absorbent properties, and/or at least one additional layer with such properties is applied between the substrate and the protective layer with or without additive (A). USE - For the production of protective layers with infrared heat reflecting and/or absorbing properties, e. g. on the transparent sides and lids of refrigerated cabinets for food shops. ADVANTAGE - Enables the production of a protective layer with good adhesion, especially to PMMA or polycarbonate, which is itself transparent to visible light while showing an opacity towards IR radiation comparable with that of <b>metallised</b> <b>glass...</b>|$|E
50|$|Materials such as metal are {{strongly}} radar reflective {{and tend to}} produce strong signals. Wood and cloth (such as portions of planes and balloons used to be commonly made) or plastic and fibreglass are less reflective or indeed transparent to radar making them suitable for radomes. Even a very thin layer of metal can make an object strongly radar reflective. Chaff is often made from <b>metallised</b> plastic or <b>glass</b> (in a similar manner to metallised foils on food stuffs) with microscopically thin layers of metal.|$|R
