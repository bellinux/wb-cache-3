25|$|In 1950 a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive {{was built for}} use in the <b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> of Templeborough steelworks. The duty had special requirements for a locomotive to fit through a small opening and around tight curves while being powerful enough to haul heavy ‘Casting Cars’. The weight of the locomotive had to be high to give better grip. The design featured a Paxman engine and British Thompson-Houston electric equipment powering and 0-4-0 chassis. The first locomotive (Works number 2480) left the works at the end of 1950 with a second (No. 2481) leaving in early 1951. No.2480 was displayed and demonstrated before final delivery while No.2481 was delivered direct from the works (a journey of about 1 mile). Both locomotives survived to be preserved in the late 1980s.|$|E

The Benrath cold rolling mill was to relocate to Krefeld, to make a range of grades, dimensions and surface finishes. The Dahlerbrück cold rolling mill is located in Sauerland producing precision strip and looks back on a 300-year tradition of iron and steelmaking. The cold rolling mill in Dillenburg specializes on surface finishes for example in architecture, building and construction. The Bochum <b>melt</b> <b>shop</b> is on fast track for closure since October 2012, to close by 2014.|$|R

50|$|In 1992 {{the site}} {{was taken over by}} Avesta Sheffield Ltd, a company formed from the merger of British Steel Stainless Ltd and the Swedish company Avesta AB. Between 1992 and 1996, {{worldwide}} investment in the Stainless Long Products industry reached an intense level and competition from larger steel works put the Panteg <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop</b> under severe pressure. Although the work-force made determined efforts to remain competitive, closure of the <b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> was announced in September 1996. On 12 December 1996, the last furnace of cast steel was made at Panteg, but stainless steel coil processing of over 50,000 tonnes per annum continued.|$|E

In April 2008 OTK exited the copper business by selling its remaining copper tube and brass division to Cupori Group Oy.|$|R
50|$|Bokaro has two Steel <b>Melting</b> <b>Shops</b> - SMS-I and SMS-II. SMS-I has 5 LD {{converters}} of 130T capacity each. It {{is capable}} of producing Rimming steel through the ingot route. SMS-II has 2 LD converters, each of 300 T capacity, with suppressed combustion system and Continuous Casting facility. It produces various Killed and Semi-Killed steels.|$|R
50|$|The {{steel making}} plant was changed in 1897 when the Bessemer {{converters}} {{were replaced by}} three open hearth furnaces and the processing plant increased {{with the addition of}} cogging mills, rail mills and specialist plant for the manufacture of steel springs and railway axles. In 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War many iron and steel companies began producing munitions. In this case the work was added to the normal production, which included many component orders for the military. The Ickles site was proving too small to handle the production, and with steel in such demand, the company extended their works towards the Sheffield boundary, to occupy a site between the main Sheffield to Rotherham road and the Great Central Railway line. The new <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop</b> and Rolling Mills were built over the site of the old Roman fort at Templeborough. The Templeborough <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop,</b> when opened, was the largest <b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> of its type in Europe and contained 14 open hearth furnaces where steel scrap was melted down.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> was not {{demolished}} but, after {{a period}} of [...] "sleep", was to become the Magna Science Adventure Centre, one of the more successful of the Millennium projects. The surrounding site is being redeveloped as a Business park.|$|E

50|$|Scrap metal is {{delivered}} to a scrap bay, located {{next to the}} <b>melt</b> <b>shop.</b> Scrap generally comes in two main grades: shred (whitegoods, cars and other objects made of similar light-gauge steel) and heavy melt (large slabs and beams), along with some direct reduced iron (DRI) or pig iron for chemical balance. Some furnaces melt almost 100% DRI.|$|R
40|$|The {{recycling}} options of spent MgO-C refractories from an electrical arc furnace (EAF) have been evaluated. The economic, quality of spent refractories and products made from it, {{the ease of}} implementation of a recycling practice and the interest of steel <b>melt</b> <b>shops</b> were considered. It was decided that the best option of most EAF shops would be to recycle spent MgO-C refractory as a foaming slag conditioner because of their MgO content. Crushed MgO-C spent refractories can be reused directly back into an EAF without complex and costly beneficiation. Even though this practice is simple, {{it is critical to}} know the optimum amount of MgO in the slag to achieve the best foaming quality. A computer model was designed to find the optimum MgO amount. This modeling also helps the <b>melt</b> <b>shop</b> extend refractory service life, increase the energy efficiency, increase productivity, and decrease the amount of slag. Issues related to the refractory recycling will be discussed...|$|R
50|$|In 1954 {{construction}} work started in Ravenscraig, turning a green field into {{a site for}} steelworks. By 1957 several coke ovens, a by-products plant, a blast furnace and an open hearth <b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> with three steelmaking furnaces were built, and by 1959 a stripmill was complete.|$|E

50|$|Steel {{manufacture}} at {{the site}} ended in 1978; the site had manufactured steel with an open hearth furnace, the type of <b>melting</b> <b>shops</b> that British Steel wanted to discontinue. In the mid-1970s, it employed around 3,500. The plate mill at Clydebridge plate works rolled its last plate on 12 November 1982. As of 2016 it is currently owned by Liberty House Group and employs 45 workers in its heat treatment and quenching facilities. The M74 motorway now runs through the works site adjacent to the remaining buildings.|$|R
5000|$|The Electric <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop</b> {{was home}} to two Héroult {{electric}} arc furnaces, installed in 1912, still working when the site closed.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with BBC Radio Sheffield, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Government may reconsider loaning the company money for expansion. However, in 2011, following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the company decided to no longer try to finance a 15,000 ton forging press due to uncertainty {{about the future of}} nuclear energy. On 31 October 2011 the UK Government announced new lending of up to £36m to the firm, as part of £950m of investment nationwide from the Regional Growth Fund for a variety of equipment in areas like the <b>melt</b> <b>shop,</b> forge and the machine shops.|$|R

40|$|Atualmente, é considerável o interesse no desenvolvimento de estratégias que sejam eficientes e duráveis na remediação de solos contaminados com metais pesados. Objetivou-se, com este trabalho, avaliar o desenvolvimento de duas espécies Eucalyptus urophylla e Eucalyptus saligna, cultivadas em substrato contaminado com Mn coletado em área próxima ao Porto de Itaguaí e ao local de disposição de resíduo perigoso da Cia Mercantil e Industrial Ingá em Itaguaí, RJ. O substrato foi tratado com dois resíduos industriais, um com característica alcalina (escória de aciaria) e outro com alto teor de óxido de ferro (carepa de laminação). Verificou se que o substrato não tratado apresentava alto teor de Mn nas frações fitodisponíveis, valores esses tóxicos para as espécies estudadas. Os tratamentos causaram redução nas concentrações de Mn em solução e trocável (frações fitodisponiveis) e aumento nas fases mais estáveis. A menor dose de Escória de Aciaria foi suficiente para que ocorresse diminuição nas concentrações de Mn em solução, sendo este efeito evidenciado pelo desenvolvimento das plantas e na maior dose de Escória de Aciaria o crescimento das espécies estudadas foi maior. O Eucalyptus urophylla apresentou maior desenvolvimento e maior extração deste elemento.

50|$|The {{primary focus}} of Taking the Heat is Sarver's 20 year stretch in his steel mill’s <b>melt</b> <b>shop.</b> The book {{describes}} adverse working conditions that include exposure to extreme heat, working in excessive dirt and air-borne dust, and functioning in a high-noise environment. Sarver also recounts the interactions of steelworkers {{with each other and}} their supervisors under what are often difficult circumstances. In similar fashion to Moby-Dick, Taking the Heat is, on one level, a book about a vocation, replete with detailed descriptions of work processes and equipment. Sarver borrows several chapter titles from Moby-Dick and quotes from the Melville novel at one point. Taking the Heat attempts to balance the serious and tedious themes of work and endurance with light humor.|$|R
