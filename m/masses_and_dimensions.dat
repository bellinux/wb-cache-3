40|$|PURPOSE: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} in {{a longitudinal study}} the effect of intensive training on cardiac autonomic control in athletes using 24 -h heart rate variability analysis. METHODS: Time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability were calculated from 24 -h Holter monitoring in 15 high level bicyclists (mean age 21 +/- 4 yr) after 1 month of detraining and after 5 months of vigorous training. At the same times echocardiographic left ventricular <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) were assessed. RESULTS: In detrained athletes, VO 2 max values, left ventricular <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>dimensions,</b> <b>and</b> time and frequency domain measures of vagal modulation of heart rate were higher than {{in a group of}} untrained subjects of similar age while heart rate and the low-to-high frequency ratio were lower, indicating an enhanced vagal modulation of heart rate in athletes as compared with that in control subjects. After 5 months of vigorous training, left ventricular <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> VO 2 max increased in athletes, while heart rate decreased further. In contrast, no changes were detectable in time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability over the entire 24 -h and in both waking and sleeping hours. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that an increased cardiac vagal control is detectable in detrained athletes; however, after intensive training, despite a significant decrease in heart rate, time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability reflecting cardiac vagal control remain unchanged. Thus, other mechanisms than changes in cardiac autonomic control could be involved in determining the profound bradycardia of athletes...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relations}} of electrocardiographic QRS duration to left ventricular (LV) measurements in individuals without heart failure (HF) or prior myocardial infarction (MI). BackgroundIncreased electrocardiographic QRS duration (≥ 120 ms) is a marker of ventricular dyssynchrony. MethodsWe evaluated the relations of maximal electrocardiographic QRS duration to echocardiographic LV dimensions in 4, 534 Framingham Heart study participants (mean age 54 years, 57 % women) without prior HF or MI. QRS duration was analyzed as a continuous variable and as categories (< 100, 100 to 119, and ≥ 120 ms). ResultsIn linear regression models, LV <b>mass,</b> end-diastolic <b>dimension,</b> <b>and</b> septal and posterior wall thicknesses were positively related to log-QRS duration, whereas fractional shortening (FS) was inversely related (p < 0. 001).

40|$|The capsid of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{is a major}} viral antigen and important diagnostic indicator. HBV capsids have prominent protrusions ('spikes') on their surface and are unique in having either T = 3 or T = 4 icosahedral symmetry. Mouse monoclonal and also human polyclonal antibodies bind either near the spike apices (historically the 'α-determinant') or in the 'floor' regions between them (the 'β-determinant'). Native mass spectrometry (MS) and gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (GEMMA) were used to monitor the titration of HBV capsids with the antigen-binding domain (Fab) of mAb 3120, which has long defined the β-determinant. Both methods readily distinguished Fab binding to the two capsid morphologies and could provide accurate <b>masses</b> <b>and</b> <b>dimensions</b> for these large immune complexes, which range up to ~ 8 MDa.

It simulates tree growth plasticity in response to changes of their internal level of trophic competition, especially topological development and cambial growth. The model includes a simplified representation of tree architecture, based on a species-specific description of branching patterns. We study whether those simplifications allow enough flexibility to reproduce with the same set of parameters the growth of two observed understorey beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) of different ages in different environmental conditions. The parametric identification of the model is global, i. e. all parameters are estimated simultaneously, potentially providing a better description of interactions between sub-processes. As a result, the source-sink dynamics throughout tree development is retrieved.

This thesis {{presents}} {{design and}} construction details of a 12 Dofs biped walking robot. Bipedal walking {{is one of the}} most challenging research fields on humanoid robots. So this work aimed at providing experience on bipedal walking and to be pre-study of {{design and construction}} of a full humanoid robot. Therefore, biped robot design has no head and arms. Robot structure is formed by four subassemblies with torso, hip, knee and ankle. Kinematic structure is 6 -Dof at the leg, 3 Dof at the hip, one at the knee and two at the ankle. The biped robot’s total weight is 55 kg and its height is 142 cm. Humanoid robots are autonomous robots, because they can adapt to changes in their environments or their self and continue to reach their goal. This is the main difference between humanoid and other kinds of robots. In this context, some of the capacities of a humanoid robot may include, among others: self-maintenance, autonomous learning, avoiding harmful situations to people, property and itself, safe interacting with human beings and the environment. Humanoid robots are created to imitate some of the same physical and mental tasks that humans undergo daily. Scientists and engineers from many different fields combine their efforts to create a robot as human-like as possible. The main goal for the robot is that one day it will be able to both understand human intelligence, reason and act like humans. If humanoids are able to do so, they could eventually work in collaboration with humans to create a more productive and higher quality future. Another important benefit of developing humanoid robot is to understand the human body s biological and mental processes. Asimo {{is one of the most}} successful humanoid robot project for all times. Honda and Wako Fundamental Technical Research Center develop it since middle of the 1980 ’s. Until today, 12 different prototypes are developed and manufactured. The most popular one of these prototypes is announced in 2005 with name of New Asimo. HRP is another milestone humanoid robot prototype, is developed by AIST, METI and NEDO in Japan. In the past several years, successful prototypes HRP 4 -C and HRP- 4 are announced to public. In order to define design criteria belongs to assembly groups; hip, knee and ankle, a beam model simulation is used with a pre-defined dimensions and mass. Bipedal robots in literature are considered in defining <b>masses</b> <b>and</b> <b>dimensions</b> for beam model simulation. Beam robot model has 12 Dofs and 35 kg mass totally. Joints’ angular displacements, angular velocities and torques are revealed form results of computer simulation based on beam model. Simulated walking speed of the beam model is 1 km/h under condition of predefined foot trajectories. In the presence of the simulation results, an inquiry list is generated and design criteria of bipedal robot studied in this thesis is derived from results and that inquiry list. After clarification of the goals and defining the frame of the project, verbal construction structures of joints’ mechanical systems are derived. These schemes, states systems inputs and outputs in terms of energy, signal, matter, and defines interactions between them. System’s elementary function structure is expressed with Koller elementary function figures using the verbal construction structure. A concept design that meets the requirements of design criteria and project goals, is introduced and improvements and detailing of project is made based of this concept design. Concept design describes location, shapes, manufacturing techniques and power transmission system of the joints. Mechanical structure and units such as motors, couplings etc. are explained in the section of robots joints detailed design. During the design phase, parts that are seem to be critical according to their structure, are analyzed with finite element methods and necessary improvements are done. All Dofs are driven by dc motors. Harmonic drive units are used to reduce the velocity which is provided by motors. Also, it provides stiff and robust mechanical structure because of it has no backlash. Axes of the at hip joint, intersect at one point. Thus, inverse kinematic calculations are fairly straightforward. Incremental encoders are mounted to motor shafts to feedback the system. Moreover, initial conditions are defined by absolute encoders, are located to rotary axes of the each hip joints. Lower and upper legs consist of U-profiles containing all actuation and transmission mechanism of the knee and ankle joints. An industrial computer with real-time operating system, all motor drivers and sensors interfaces and a battery are situated on an upper body upon the hip joints. Knee and ankle joints are driven by vertically placed actuators through ball screw mechanism. Actuators and transmission driving higher than the driven rotating Dofs. In such a kinematic configuration, the center of mass of the robot moves also higher in vertical with respect to that of robots with direct driven joints. The knee joint has 90 degrees motion range, and it is driven by a ball screw mechanism which is actuated by a dc actuator placed in the upper leg. To provide the required conversion ratio, ball screw mechanism is used to as velocity reducer. In a same way to the hip joint, the incremental encoder is mounted to the dc motor shaft of the knee joint, and also, the absolute encoder is placed on the knee joint shaft to get rid of the measurement errors which may occur because of transmission mechanisms. In the lower leg, 2 Dofs of the ankle joints are driven by dc electrical actuators. Driving torque of the actuators is transmitted to the ankle joints by ball screw mechanism similar to the knee joint. The ball screw mechanism are guided on a polyamide part which is mounted on lower leg, therefore only linear displacements are allowed to the mechanism. Complexity of the power transmission of the ankle joint causes uncertain feedback by only incremental encoder. Therefore, additional absolute encoders are mounted to each ankle joints. Besides, 6 axes force-torque sensors are placed over feet to measure the forces and torques which are required for the control loop. The sensory system of the biped robot includes incremental and absolute encoders at all 12 joints and two force-torque sensors at each ankle. The components of the interaction forces exerted by the ground on the biped robot will be measured. The incremental encoders attached to the motor shafts to measure the angular displacements relative to initial values of each joint. Resolution of the incremental encoder which is 500 increments per revolution satisfies qualified measurement with highly stiff harmonic drive gears. Since an incremental encoder measures differentiation of angular positions, initial angular position of all joints must be measured by absolute encoders. The absolute encoders which are integrated to shafts of joints measure the initial values of joints before the biped robot stars walking. Measurement errors of the absolute encoders are negligible thanks to its 12 -bit resolution pre revolutions. The biped robot consist of 12 Maxon dc motors driven by Epos motor drivers. The motor drivers drive dc motors with respect to trajectory data which is received from the computer via canbus. The embedded computer receives data from absolute encoders and force-torque sensors and transmits data to motor drivers via canbus. The computer which is installed embedded real time Linux operating system will provide the trajectories for static walking and control algorithms for dynamic walking. To simulate the biped robot model and control algorithm, Msc-Adams and Matlab-Simulink software packages are used. Simulink is responsible for the pattern generation and the dynamic controller, and Adams is responsible for the biped robot model. Reference joint trajectories are generated by Simulink and are sent to Adams. Adams solves the inverse dynamics of the biped robot and sends joint torques and contact forces back to Simulink. Feet paths are generated off-line and also desired ZMP references are generated off-line in accordance with the foot placements. To solve the inverse kinematics problem of the biped robot model, feet and torso paths must be known simultaneously. Torso path is generated to ensure dynamic balance of the robot. In torso path generation model predictive control and linear inverted pendulum model is used. Adams takes reference joint trajectories as inputs and gives joint torques and contact forces as outputs. CAD drawings of the parts are imported into Adams and all material properties and constraints are defined in Adams environment. Subsequent to selection of ready to use units and final design, electronic components and control equipments that takes place in the project are defined and interactions between each other is explained. Besides, computer simulation derived for beam model, is rerun for new designed model and angular displacements, angular velocities and torques are calculated with a high accuracy. Design and selection of ready to use units are validated with new simulation results. Following to design cycle, technical drawings for manufacturing and assemblies are drawn according to convenient manufacturing techniques and tolerances are defined. Manufacturing folder which contains technical drawings and all necessary information for manufacturing is created. Sequent, in the light of problems encountered during assemblies and first trials, some modifications are done and final design is released. After construction and assembly process and integration electrical components, joint’s basic functions and control system has been tested with movements in the air. The transmission mechanism of the hip, knee and ankle joints, are tested under various input. All sensors have been put in use and joint position references successfully controlled. The next step is, put the robot on ground and perform the actions are done in air. After test stage, experimentation of biped walking will start. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

The high ratio between the resolution and the outer diameter of the motor and the particular compactness of the system make the developed Servo-Motor of great interest for its use in space missions and for future industrial production...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{annihilation}} {{cross section of}} dark matter which interacts with the standard model sector over the scalar unparticle propagator. We observe that the annihilation cross section of dark matter pair is sensitive to the dark matter <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> the scaling <b>dimension</b> of scalar unparticle. We estimate a range for the dark matter <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> the scaling <b>dimension</b> of scalar unparticle by using the current dark matter abundance. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to clarify the effect of RH on the solute diffusivity. Water {{evaporation}} and the swelling-shrinkage behavior of wood impregnated with an aqueous solution of PEG polymers were examined during conditioning at several RHs including the lower RHs. Conditioned wood was dried under vacuum <b>and</b> its <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>dimension</b> were measured. A cross section of a dried sample was observed using a micro-focus X-ray computed tomography (CT) system. The effect of RH on the polymer diffusivity was interpreted based on theoretical factors. Temporal variability in the water evaporation rate and swelling rate were examined in terms of solute diffusivity.|$|R

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{assessing}} the behavior of tomato fruits subjected to increasing concentrations of gibberellic acid (GA 3), research {{was carried out in}} the municipality of Irati, Paraná State, Brazil, within a commercial area of tomato crops, cultivar Fanny, in September under the crossing fence system with a single branch per plant. The adopted treatments were as follows: 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 ppm of GA 3, applied whenever the diameter of the fi rst fruits of the second clusters reached roughly 10 mm. At harvest when the fruits had achieved 30 to 50 % of reddish color, the fresh <b>mass,</b> length, <b>and</b> longitudinal and transversal diameters were measured. The application of 120 ppm of GA 3 provided maximum fresh <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>dimensions...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to clarify the effect of {{concentration}} of impregnated solution on solute diffusing into cell walls during the conditioning process of impregnated wood. The PEG polymers and water were employed as the solute and solvent, respectively, because the <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>mass</b> of the impregnated wood in this case reflect the amount of the polymers and water in it. The <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>dimensions</b> of wood samples impregnated with aqueous solutions of PEG polymers at different concentrations were examined during the conditioning and subsequent drying processes, and are discussed with respect to the water evaporation and the amount of the polymers in the cell walls. The <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> volume of the polymers in the cell walls just before conditioning and after all processes, respectively, were estimated and normalized to analyze the amount of the polymers diffusing into the cell walls during conditioning.|$|R
