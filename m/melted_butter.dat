25|$|In {{the cooler}} climates of {{northern}} Europe, people could store butter longer before it spoiled. Scandinavia has the oldest tradition in Europe of butter export trade, dating {{at least to}} the 12th century. After the fall of Rome and through much of the Middle Ages, butter was a common food across most of Europe—but had a low reputation, and so was consumed principally by peasants. Butter slowly became more accepted by the upper class, notably when the early 16th century Roman Catholic Church allowed its consumption during Lent. Bread and butter became common fare among the middle class, and the English, in particular, gained a reputation for their liberal use of <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> as a sauce with meat and vegetables.|$|E
25|$|Alternately {{attributed}} to the 16th and 17th centuries, Groote Wafelen from the Belgian Een Antwerps kookboek was published as the first recipe to use leavening (beer yeast): Take white flour, warm cream, fresh <b>melted</b> <b>butter,</b> yeast, and mix together until the flour is no longer visible. Then add ten or twelve egg yolks. Those {{who do not want}} them to be too expensive may also add the egg white and just milk. Put the resulting dough at the fireplace for four hours to let it rise better before baking it. Until this time, no recipes contained leavening and could therefore be easily cooked in the thin moule à oublies. Groote Wafelen, in its use of leavening, was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons (wafelijzers) depicted in the Beuckelaer and Bruegel paintings of the time.|$|E
25|$|McChicken LT (McDonald's Chicken Lettuce and Tomato) was {{the chicken}} {{version of the}} McDLT {{featuring}} the same two-sided container as the McDLT except the packaging was yellow instead of white. It was introduced {{about the same time}} as the McDLT in the mid-1980s. The chicken was a grilled, unbreaded chicken breast placed on the heel of the bun in one of the compartments. The toppings were shredded lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise assembled on the top half of the bun in the other compartment. Cheese was an optional addition for an extra US$0.10. The grilled chicken breast was then basted with a brushing of <b>melted</b> <b>butter.</b> As with the McDLT, the consumer would finalize preparation of the sandwich by combining the hot and cool sides just prior to eating. The McChicken LT was discontinued in the Fall of 1987.|$|E

50|$|Clarified {{butter is}} milk fat {{rendered}} from butter {{to separate the}} milk solids and water from the butterfat. Typically, it is produced by <b>melting</b> <b>butter</b> and allowing the components to separate by density. The water evaporates, some solids float {{to the surface and}} are skimmed off, and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the butter fat (which would then be on top) is poured off.|$|R

500|$|In Warsaw, Tremo {{enjoyed the}} {{reputation}} of being one of the finest chefs in Europe. However, some of his contemporaries complained that his meats were too tough, his sauces too heavy, and his idea of west European culinary trends not always up-to-date. British traveller Elizabeth Craven could not conceal her amusement when, at a banquet given by the Polish king, she was served meat and fish doused generously with <b>melted</b> <b>butter,</b> supposedly in the English style. German-Polish traveller [...] was surprised when a peasant boy whom he had given Tremo's almond cake, did not enjoy the treat.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Melted</b> <b>butter</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the preparation of sauces, most obviously in French cuisine. Beurre noisette (hazelnut butter) and Beurre noir (black butter) are sauces of <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> cooked until the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of vinegar or lemon juice. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are emulsions of egg yolk and melted butter; they are in essence mayonnaises made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful emulsifiers in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own. Beurre blanc (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. Beurre monté (prepared butter) is melted but still emulsified butter; it lends its name to the practice of [...] "mounting" [...] a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.|$|E

They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own, and never before known him so little disconcerted by the <b>melted</b> <b>butter's</b> being oiled.|$|R
50|$|Beurre fondue is a food {{prepared}} by <b>melting</b> <b>butter</b> in water. The preparation serves {{to maintain the}} butter as an emulsified and creamy concoction. Beurre fondue is used by chefs {{because it has a}} lesser feel of greasiness on the palate, and the sauce is also easy for chefs to use compared to whole butter. Its uses are myriad, such as for braising and basting meats, poaching seafood such as lobster, cooking vegetables, and adding flavor to various foods and dishes.|$|R

2500|$|Food critic Mimi Sheraton {{wrote that}} her {{favorite}} dishes included the [...] "Huckleberry pie (not blueberry), biscuits and Manhattan clam chowder" [...] No {{mention of the}} fare at Lundy's should properly omit mention {{of a couple of}} items: the bucket of steamed clams ("steamers") and its eating ritual: dip each clam first in salt water to get rid of any sand, then in the <b>melted</b> <b>butter.</b> Also, the multi-course Shore Dinner, frequently misread as the ShAre Dinner, because of its excess.|$|E
2500|$|As a garnish to meat {{dishes in}} the past the most common were porridges and cereals, in which the meat was boiled, later on boiled or rather steamed and baked root {{vegetables}} (turnips, carrots) as well as mushrooms; additionally the meat, without taking account its type, was garnished with pickled products—pickled cabbage, or sour and [...] "soaked" [...] (marinated) apples (mochoniye yabloki) or cranberries. Pan juices, alone or mixed with sour cream or <b>melted</b> <b>butter,</b> were used as gravy to pour on garnishing vegetables and porridges. Meat sauces, i.e. gravies based on flour, butter, eggs and milk, are not common for traditional Russian cuisine.|$|E

Some of these appliances also accept a small volume of oil or <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> to assist thermal transfer from a stationary heating element, but others are [...] "air poppers" [...] which rapidly circulate heated air up through the interior, keeping the un-popped kernels in motion to avoid burning and then blowing the popped kernels out through the chute. The majority of popcorn sold for home consumption is now packaged in a microwave popcorn bag for use in a microwave oven.|$|E
25|$|Food is {{prepared}} {{as if for}} an oven or stove top. However, because food cooks faster when it is in smaller pieces, food placed inside a solar cooker is usually cut into smaller pieces than it might otherwise be. For example, potatoes are usually cut into bite-sized pieces rather than roasted whole. For very simple cooking, such as <b>melting</b> <b>butter</b> or cheese, a lid may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered tray or in a bowl. If several foods are to be cooked separately, then they are placed in different containers.|$|R

2500|$|Tea tree oil {{has been}} {{promoted}} {{as a treatment for}} head lice; however, evidence of its effectiveness is weak. A 2012 review of head lice treatment recommended against the use of tea tree oil for children because it could cause skin irritation or allergic reactions, because of contraindications, and {{because of a lack of}} knowledge about the oil's safety and effectiveness. Other home remedies such as putting vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, or <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> in the hair have been partially disproven, The use of plastic bags may be dangerous. [...] Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that swimming has no effect on treating lice, and can in fact harm the treatment by commercial products. Ethanol (ethyl alcohol, common alcohol) is toxic to arthropods including lice and an external application of it is harmless to humans.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{potatoes}} {{have become}} one of the most widely consumed crops and thus have a variety of preparation methods and condiments. French fries and often hash browns are commonly found in typical American fast-food burger joints and cafeterias. One popular favorite involves a baked potato with cheddar cheese (or sour cream and chives) on top, and in New England [...] "smashed potatoes" [...] (a chunkier variation on mashed potatoes, retaining the peel) have great popularity. Potato flakes are popular as an instant variety of mashed potatoes, which reconstitute into mashed potatoes by adding water, with butter or oil and salt to taste. A regional dish of Central New York, salt potatoes are bite-size new potatoes boiled in water saturated with salt then served with <b>melted</b> <b>butter.</b> At more formal dinners, a common practice includes taking small red potatoes, slicing them, and roasting them in an iron skillet.
