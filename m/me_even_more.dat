500|$|In 1962 Littleton’s first {{pieces in}} blown glass were, like his earlier works in pottery, {{functional}} forms: vases, bowls and paperweights. His breakthrough to non-functional form came in 1963 when, with no purpose in mind, he remelted and finished a glass piece {{that he had}} earlier smashed {{in a fit of}} pique. The object lay in his studio for several weeks before he decided to grind the bottom. As Littleton recounts in his book Glassblowing: A Search for Form, he brought the object into the house where [...] "it aroused such antipathy in my wife that I looked at it much more closely, finally deciding to send it to an exhibition. Its refusal there made <b>me</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> obstinate, and I took it to New York ... I later showed it to the curators of design at the Museum of Modern Art. They, perhaps relating it to some other neo-Dada work in the museum, purchased it for the Design Collection." [...] This led to Littleton’s mid-1960s series of broken-open forms, and [...] "Prunted," [...] "Imploded" [...] and [...] "Exploded" [...] forms.|$|E

2500|$|... "Billy's Olympic Nightmare" [...] is a one-off {{spin-off}} {{episode of}} EastEnders, broadcast via the BBC Red Button on 16 July 2012, {{to tie in}} with the episode where Billy is a torch bearer. This episode features Billy missing several promotional events. The episode stars comedian Omid Djalili as a cab driver named Hercules, plus athletes Kelly Holmes, Tessa Sanderson, Kriss Akabusi, Mark Foster, newsreader Sonali Shah, and television presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones as themselves. Perry said of the spin-off, [...] "Filming this was like a dress rehearsal of my worst nightmare! It was strange filming at West Ham as again, like Billy, I feel it's my home. I'm over the moon to be carrying the torch through Walford, {{and working with the}} likes of Dame Kelly Holmes has made <b>me</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> excited to do so!" [...] Fenwick revealed that Djalili improvised some of his lines.|$|E
60|$|This {{incident}} gave <b>me</b> <b>even</b> a <b>more</b> favorable {{opinion of}} Meade than did his great victory at Gettysburg the July before. It is men who {{wait to be}} selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may always expect the most efficient service.|$|R

60|$|At this moment, {{happening}} to cast my eyes upon the stone, whose characters a transverse light from my southern window brings out with singular distinctness, another interpretation has occurred to <b>me,</b> promising <b>even</b> <b>more</b> interesting results.

2500|$|Luo Tong {{was from}} Wushang County (烏傷縣), Kuaiji Commandery, which is around present-day Yiwu, Zhejiang. His father Luo Jun (駱俊), {{who served as}} the Chancellor (相) of Chen State (陳國) in the Eastern Han dynasty, was killed by the warlord Yuan Shu. Luo Tong's mother {{remarried}} after her husband's death, and became a concubine of the official Hua Xin. Luo Tong, who was seven years old then, returned to Kuaiji Commandery with his close friends. Before he left, his mother tearfully saw him off, but Luo Tong did not look back when he boarded the carriage. When the carriage driver told him his mother was behind him, Luo Tong said, [...] "I don't want to make my mother miss <b>me</b> <b>even</b> <b>more.</b> That's why I don't look back." [...] Luo Tong was also known for being filial to his stepmother (Hua Xin's official spouse).|$|E

6000|$|... "Twenty {{minutes to}} eight," [...] he answered, {{looking at his}} watch. And his voice drew <b>me</b> towards him <b>even</b> <b>more</b> than had his {{beautiful}} strong face. I thanked him, and we fell back into silence.|$|R

60|$|It was the {{relation}} of those horrors, I think, which, stirring my indignation, spurred <b>me</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> than the thought of redressing the wrongs which the Pontifical or Farnesian government would permit my mother to do me.|$|E

40|$|When I was fifteen, I {{was having}} {{serious doubts about}} the {{existence}} of a supernatural entity benevolently looking over <b>me,</b> and—perhaps <b>even</b> <b>more</b> disturbingly—about the possibility of an afterlife in which I would again see my friends and relatives and exist happily ever after.

5000|$|Miller {{received}} his diploma from Oklahoma A&M College sometime in 1933. Fourteen years later, in his commencement {{address to the}} newest graduates of his alma mater, he expressed his regret at having [...] "never sat as you are today to receive a degree from A&M" [...] And he added in his unique style of self-deprecating humor: [...] "Mine came by mail, a year after I had left the campus, by dint of special work by <b>me,</b> and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> special dispensation by a long suffering faculty." ...|$|R

The painter obviously starts from a situation in everyday life. The shape, the structure impose themselves and create some disturbance. The canvas is almost empty. No cumbersome details. No technical tricks. I understand that it’s the ” details ”, the small objects of the life which surround us and which form the framework through which we perceive the world, which stimulate and encourage the thought.

60|$|All {{that you}} so earnestly {{say about the}} {{goodwill}} and devotion of all engaged, I perceived and deeply felt last night.

When I got up to speak, but for taking a desperate hold of myself, I should have lost my sight and voice and sat down again.|$|E
5000|$|The season five premiere {{was well}} received. Most critics praised the season premiere, stating [...] "The {{original}} {{tenor of the}} series {{is one of the}} things that made it so appealing in the first place. Add to this that the tempo of the narrative is ideal, and episodes never drag.", with Gwen Ihnat from the A.V. Club criticizing the series, stating [...] "Nashville now almost always bums <b>me</b> out, <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so because it used to be a show I once looked forward to every week.
