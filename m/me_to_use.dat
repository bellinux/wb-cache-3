500|$|Suvorov {{invited the}} {{captured}} general {{to dinner and}} {{found it impossible to}} coax any military information from him. The Russian wondered why such a reputable man should be fighting for the First French Republic. Sérurier retorted, [...] "My father, in giving me my sword, expressly ordered <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it only to defend my country". Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps considered Verderio to be the biggest blunder of Sérurier's career. He suggested that the general was accustomed to seeing Bonaparte save dire situations with brilliant maneuvers. When Moreau next saw the paroled general, he severely reprimanded him but later admitted to the government that Sérurier's only mistake was hewing to his orders too rigidly. This was the last time Sérurier led troops in combat.|$|E
500|$|Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch who {{praised the}} iPhone 5S {{as the best}} {{smartphone}} available said [...] "looks may not {{be different from the}} iPhone 5, but the internal components have a dramatic impact on day-to-day activities normal for a smartphone user," [...] and went into detail explaining the impact of the improved camera and specifications on the phone. Etherington suggested that the 64-bit A7 processor will not reach its full potential until developers create applications supporting it. Myriam Joire of Engadget found that the iPhone 5S could benefit significantly from the A7 if developers created applications optimized for the 64-bit processor. Anand Lal Shimpi of AnandTech praised the phone's A7 processor, describing it as [...] "seriously impressive", and stated that it was the most [...] "futureproof of any iPhone ever launched. As much as it pains <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the word futureproof, if you are {{one of those people who}} likes to hold onto their device for a while - the iPhone 5S is as good a starting point as any." [...] Scott Lowe of IGN also speaking highly of its 64-bit processor, [...] "which has a substantial lead in processing power over the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4, accounting for a graphics boost of up to 32% and 38% in CPU benchmarks." [...] The debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 processor took rival Android smartphone makers by surprise, particularly Qualcomm whose own 64-bit system-on-chip was not released until 2015.|$|E
2500|$|At first, Bliss {{found little}} useful {{work to do}} in England. He joined the BBC's {{overseas}} music service in May 1941, but was plainly under-employed. He suggested to Sir Adrian Boult, who {{was at that time}} both the chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the BBC's director of music, that Boult should step down in his favour from the latter post. Bliss wrote to his wife: [...] "I want more power as I have a lot to give which my comparatively minor post does not allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> fully." [...] Boult agreed to the proposal, which freed him to concentrate on conducting. Bliss served as director of music at the BBC from 1942-44, laying the foundations for the launch of the Third Programme after the war. During the war, he also served on the music committee of the British Council together with Vaughan Williams and William Walton.|$|E

2500|$|T. Rex vastly {{influenced}} the glam rock, punk rock, post-punk and Britpop genres. Johnny Marr of The Smiths stated: [...] "The influence of T. Rex is very profound on certain {{songs of the}} Smiths like [...] "Panic" [...] and [...] "Shoplifters of the World Unite". Lead singer Morrissey also admired Bolan. While writing [...] "Panic" [...] he was inspired by [...] "Metal Guru" [...] and wanted to sing in the same style. He didn't stop singing it {{in an attempt to}} modify the words of [...] "Panic" [...] to fit the exact rhythm of [...] "Metal Guru". Marr later stated: [...] "He also exhorted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the same guitar break so that the two songs are the same!" [...] Marr rated Bolan in his ten favourite guitarists. Siouxsie and the Banshees released a cover version of [...] "20th Century Boy" [...] early in their career in 1979.|$|E

2500|$|The Weilüe {{recorded}} {{more details}} of the events leading to Cui Yan's death. It mentioned that Cui Yan's letter to Yang Xun fell {{into the hands of}} Cui Yan's enemies, who accused him of defaming Cao Cao. Cao Cao felt that Cui Yan was discrediting him so he had the latter arrested, imprisoned, head shaved, and sent to perform hard labour. Later, Cui Yan's enemies told Cao Cao, [...] "When Cui Yan serves his sentence, he glares at people straight in the eye as if he is filled with resentment." [...] Cao Cao believed them and wanted Cui Yan to die so he sent an official to inform Cui, [...] "You've three days to live." [...] Cui Yan did not understand what the official meant and he continued to live on for several days. When the official reported to Cao Cao that Cui Yan was alive and well, Cao furiously said, [...] "Cui Yan is forcing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the sword on him!" [...] The official went to see Cui Yan again and explained to the latter that Cao Cao actually wanted him to kill himself within three days. Cui Yan said, [...] "How silly of me. I didn't know that he actually wanted me to do this." [...] He committed suicide after that.|$|E

2500|$|On {{character}} interactions, Greenberg noted {{how there}} was [...] "a lot of dialogue between Jimmy and Mandy in the car. We {{used a lot}} of car mounts. I would light the alien so that he looked good, but if he passed into a shadow while going down the street you could see all the seams in his make-up. So I sometimes had to block all the streets with black paper." [...] The aliens were not too different from humans, and an incorrect lighting or camera angle could give away seams in the makeup. In attempting {{to identify with the}} aliens regarding a unique look, Greenberg chose a deep blue color for filming. He said, [...] "We ended up with very deep, strong blue – a sort of moonlight blue. We tried to do all the scenes in the movie that appear to be their places heavily favored by this deep blue color. The Encounters Club was one of those places." [...] Greenberg used Arriflex cameras and Zeiss lenses along with Fuji stock. Commenting on film grain he said, [...] "I figured out from tests that it is better for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Fuji. Once film is blown up to 70mm the grain will stand out more and Fuji has smaller grain than Kodak. I can control the contrast with light, but I {{have to live with the}} grain." [...] Making use of multiple cameras, Greenberg noted, [...] "Photographically, of course, one camera is best. But as a movie maker, and because I want the film to be a success, I realize that the photography is not the most important thing. The whole movie is most important. So in pre-production, I was the one pushing the director to always shoot with two or three cameras." ...|$|E
