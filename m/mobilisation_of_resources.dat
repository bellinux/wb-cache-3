40|$|In the {{development}} of new technologies, actors will pursue their private interests, but they may also try to improve the conditions for the new technology in general. This we call ‘collective action’. In this thesis, the contribution of collective action in the commercialisation process of high technology is investigated, following indications that this occurs and is intended to benefit industries as a whole. By means of conducting interviews with involved actors, performing document analysis, six cases of innovation in the microsystem technology industry in the Netherlands are reconstructed, in which the contribution of collective action is investigated. Aspects under observation are: the coordination within networks, the <b>mobilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and attention in networks, and the representation of networks to the outside world. Finding partners to cooperate with was found to be important for the success of commercialising microsystem technology, but no clarity on the role of collective action was found. The <b>mobilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> was very important for acquiring public funding, collective action positively influences this. The mobilisation of attention and the representation also profited from collective action, but innovators regard the involvement of users as very important. Current collective action leaves room for improving this. Future research should focus on the macro scale effects of collective action as well as incorporate quantitative analysis...|$|E
