5|$|The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was {{established}} in 1988 in the United States by {{the passing of the}} National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and is funded by a 75-cent tax on each vaccine dose. The program's aims were to maintain a steady supply of vaccines while, at the same time, allowing victims of vaccine injury to be compensated more efficiently than was previously possible. The program operates according to a no-fault principle. The family of Michelle Cedillo sought compensation from this program. Cedillo, a then 12-year-old female wheelchair user from Yuma, Arizona, was involved in the first of three test cases chosen by the government to represent the approximately 4,900 other vaccine-autism cases that had been brought before the court. Michelle Cedillo was born on August 30, 1994, and received thimerosal-containing vaccines during the first fifteen months of her life. On December 20, 1995, she received an <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Theresa and Michael Cedillo filed a vaccine injury claim on behalf of their daughter on December 9, 1998 for encephalopathy, but on January 14, 2002, changed their petition to a causation-in-fact claim, meaning they were arguing that Michelle developed autism {{as a result of the}} combined effects of thimerosal and the <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine.</b> They did this as a result of a meeting that had taken place the previous year, between Theresa Cedillo and Andrew Wakefield, at a Defeat Autism Now! conference.|$|E
5|$|Michelle Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, {{also known}} as the omnibus autism {{proceeding}} (OAP), was a court case involving the family of Michelle Cedillo, an autistic girl whose parents sued the United States government because they believed that her autism was caused by her receipt of both the measles-mumps-and-rubella vaccine ({{also known as}} the <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine)</b> and thimerosal-containing vaccines. The omnibus proceeding required the petitioners to present three test cases for each proposed mechanism by which vaccines had, according to them, caused their children's autism; Michelle was the first such case for the MMR-and-thimerosal hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{opened on}} June 11, 2007 in Washington, DC. The Cedillos' six expert {{witnesses}} argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded Michelle's immune system, {{which in turn}} {{made it possible for}} the weakened measles virus in the <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine</b> to cause a persistent infection leading to autism. In support of this hypothesis, the Cedillos' witnesses relied on the reported detection of measles virus in Michelle's gastrointestinal tract by John O'Leary's Unigenetics laboratory in Dublin. However, the government's expert witnesses conclusively demonstrated that O'Leary's positive results were caused by contamination in the Unigenetics lab rather than an actual infection.|$|E

5|$|The factual {{accuracy}} of the series is often criticised by legal professionals and journalists; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to happen in a real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman caused a judge to issue a warning to a jury {{not to let the}} series influence their view of trials—referring to an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury service. A complaint was made by a viewer about one episode claiming biased and incorrect information about the <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine,</b> leading the BBC to unilaterally ban repeats of it in its original form. All six series (with the exception of the two banned episodes from Series Five) have been released on DVD in the UK.|$|E
25|$|These {{possible}} triggers {{were reported}} as MMR in eight cases, and measles infection in one. The paper was instantly controversial, leading to widespread publicity in the UK and the convening of a special panel of the UK's Medical Research Council the following month. One 2005 study done based in Japan {{found that there was}} no causal relationship between the <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine</b> and autism in groups of children given the triple <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine</b> and children who received individual measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations. In Japan, the <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine</b> had been replaced with individual vaccinations in 1993.|$|E
25|$|The CDC, the IOM of the National Academy of Sciences, and the UK National Health Service {{have all}} {{concluded}} {{that there is no}} evidence of a link between the <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine</b> and autism. A systematic review by the Cochrane Library {{concluded that there}} is no credible link between the <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine</b> and autism, that MMR has prevented diseases that still carry a heavy burden of death and complications, that the lack of confidence in MMR has damaged public health, and that the design and reporting of safety outcomes in <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine</b> studies are largely inadequate.|$|E
2500|$|Safety {{concerns}} often {{follow a}} pattern: a potential adverse effect is hypothesized; a premature announcement is made; the initial study is not reproduced; and finally, it takes several {{years for the}} vaccine to regain public confidence. A modern and notable example involved Andrew Wakefield's discredited claim that <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccines</b> cause autism, which, in 2011, was described as [...] "perhaps, the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years". Immunization programs depend on public confidence to be effective. Evidence surrounding vaccination shows that prevented suffering and death from infectious diseases outweighs the rare adverse effects of vaccination.|$|R

The claims in the paper were widely reported, leading to {{a sharp drop in}} vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland and increases in the incidence of measles and mumps, resulting in deaths and serious permanent injuries. Following the initial claims in 1998, multiple large epidemiological studies were undertaken. Reviews of the evidence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences, the UK National Health Service, and the Cochrane Library all found no link between the <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccine</b> and autism.|$|E
50|$|The omnibus autism {{proceeding}} (OAP) is {{a coordinated}} proceeding before the Office of Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims—commonly called the vaccine court. It is structured {{to facilitate the}} handling of nearly 5000 vaccine petitions involving claims that children who have received certain vaccinations have developed autism. The Petitioners' Steering Committee have claimed that <b>MMR</b> <b>vaccines</b> can cause autism, possibly in combination with thiomersal-containing vaccines. In 2007 three test cases were presented to test the claims about the combination; these cases failed. The vaccine court ruled against the plaintiffs in all three cases, stating that the evidence presented did not validate their claims that vaccinations caused autism in these specific patients or in general.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether a relationship exists between ethnicity and uptake of the first dose of mumps, measles and rubella (MMR 1) vaccination, and to study important factors influencing the parental decision about vaccination.

In 2012, doctor Christa Todea-Gross published a free downloadable book online, this book contained misinformation about vaccination from abroad translated into Romanian, which significantly stimulated the growth of the anti-vaccine movement. The government of Romania officially declared a measles epidemic in September 2016, and started an information campaign to encourage parents to have their children vaccinated.

In all, 453 119 children (65 423 children aged 16 – 24 months and 329 211 children aged 5 – 7 years) received MMR. The control groups which, as a result of local health regulations, were slightly younger than vaccinees, comprised 12 253 and 46 232 children, respectively. Using questionnaires, the parents recorded solicited local, systemic and neurological adverse events for up to 42 days post-vaccination. All data were analysed externally on an intention-to-treat basis by individuals not participating in the study. Local and/or systemic reactions were reported in a small percentage of participants, with pain, fever and parotitis being the most common signs among vaccinees in both age groups. No case of aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, anaphylaxis or convulsions was observed in any participant.
