40|$|Fox, AlanThis {{paper is}} written for {{students}} of Western Psychology who wish {{to gain a better}} understanding of the psychological aspects of Buddhism and how these aspects have impacted, and continue to impact, Western psychotherapy. As the prominent Buddhist psychoanalyst Dr. Mark Epstein put it, "In order for Buddhism to be understood by our culture, it must be reinterpreted in the psychological language of our time". This statement perfectly summarizes my objective for writing this paper. I want to introduce Buddhism to students of Western psychology who are unfamiliar with its insights and techniques in a language that is familiar and understandable to them. The underlying theme I want to convey throughout this paper is that despite the fact many consider Buddhism to be an Eastern religion or philosophy; I believe it should be most appropriately classified within the context of Western thought as psychotherapy. Even though it clearly has aspects of both a religion and a philosophy, the focus in Buddhism, just as it is in the field of psychotherapy, is to study and analyze the human mind in order to better understand it and to alleviate its suffering. Furthermore, both Buddhism and psychotherapy have the same basic assumption concerning human potential: the belief that human beings have the ability to make positive psychological and behavioral changes that will improve the quality of their experiences. Some examples of the changes human beings have the capability of making are: enhancing self-]awareness, developing better habits/coping skills, learning to control emotional responses, and constructing more accurate perceptions of reality. There are many students who are not fully aware of how various aspects of Buddhism not only resemble but have also inspired many theories found in Western psychology. Moving forward, the more Western psychologists embrace the insights and techniques found in Buddhist thought and practice, the more it will benefit the field of psychotherapy. I am clearly not the first person to attempt to apply Buddhist literature in the context of modern psychological research. Over the years there has been an increasing acknowledgment by psychologists, counselors, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists of the positive impact Buddhism can have on our contemporary understanding of human nature and human behavior. My hope is for these students of psychology to take a new, and less ethnocentric, look at the insights and techniques found in Buddhism. In short, I have <b>three</b> main <b>goals</b> I wish to accomplish in this paper. <b>My</b> <b>three</b> <b>goals</b> include: (1) Enable students of Western psychology to appreciate Buddhism's rich history and its contributions to the study of the mind. (2) Introduce the basic psychological principles of Buddhism in an understandable way to those who are unfamiliar with Buddha's teachings. (3) Allow those in the fields of mental health and/or behavioral sciences to benefit from Buddhism within their own work by explaining its insights and techniques using the psychological language of our time.

40|$|One and a {{half million}} new cancer cases are {{reported}} each year in the United States. Despite this overwhelming burden of disease, current preventative treatments and early detection techniques are inadequate. With cancers, as with many aggressive diseases, time is of the essence; earlier detection begets better patient prognoses. While contemporary technology offers physicians the ability to battle cancers via stage-one detection, few reliable biomarkers have been developed to assist in detection of upstream tumorigenesis or interpretation of early genomic assault. The objective of the work described here is to identify early biomarkers specific to tumorigenesis, which correlate with initial genomic assault and subsequent mutation in the gpt-delta (B 6 C 3 F 1) mouse model. The test compound used in this work is aflatoxin B 1, a known human carcinogen produced by fungal spoilage of food materials. Aflatoxin B 1 was one of the carcinogens used in the "training set " of compounds that defined the B 6 C 3 F 1 animal model. <b>My</b> work had <b>three</b> <b>goals</b> with regard to upgrading this model as a tool for contemporary toxicology.

40|$|In the Czech Republic all {{activities}} of individual groups {{of health care}} workers are defined by various regulations and laws. All nurses' competences are stipulated by 424 / 2004 Decree of Coll. of Laws and that defines activities and responsibilities for health care workers {{as well as other}} professionals and experts in the medical field. In <b>my</b> thesis <b>three</b> <b>goals</b> and hypotheses were set. The first goal of my thesis was to find out what level of awareness of the existence and of the content of the 424 / 2004 Decree doctors and nurses was. For that purpose the hypothesis Hl was set. It was worded as the following:,Doctors are aware of the existence and the content of the 424 / 2004 Decree. The second goal was to find out what doctors' opinoions on the relevant competences were. To reach this goal hypotheses H 2 were set. They were worded as the following:" Doctors have not become familiar with the importance of a qualification study that is backed up with having the relevant competences stipulated in 424 / 2004 Decree. H 3 was worded as the following : "Activities required by doctors for nurses to be carried out go over their competences stipulated in 424 / 2004 Decree. H 4 : Activities going beyond nurses' competences do not enable the nurses providing relevant nursing care which should be focused on saturation and meeting patients' needs. The third goal was to find out what doctors think of the Decree's implementation in everyday life. I set a hypothesis that doctors do not feel any need to change nurses competences...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has largely ignored {{the potential impact}} of goal-related constructs on behaviour. Three studies addressed this issue by examining the direct and moderated effects of <b>goal</b> <b>desires</b> on behaviour. All of the studies required participants to complete baseline measures and then a follow-up indicator of behaviour. In the first study (N= 119) that focused on fruit intake, and studies 2 (N= 123) and 3 (N= 96) concerned with drinking alcohol, <b>goal</b> <b>desires</b> interacted with behavioural intentions to affect behaviour. Specifically, behavioural intentions were more reliably related to behaviour when <b>goal</b> <b>desires</b> were strong. The results of the third study suggested that in order to obtain such interactive effects, the strength of the overarching goal must remain stable. The findings reveal that goals and behavioural intentions can operate simultaneously and jointly influence action, a view that contradicts postulations that the effects of goals are fully mediated by more proximal behavioural determinants...|$|R
