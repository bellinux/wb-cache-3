He joined Conference Premier club Ebbsfleet United on 9 October 2009, making his debut a day later in a 4–0 defeat to Cambridge United. His first goal was with the winner in a 2–1 victory over Mansfield Town on 28 November 2009, scoring from close range from a <b>Magno</b> Vieira pass. He made 29 appearances and scored two goals for Ebbsfleet during the 2009–10 as they were relegated to the Conference South.|$|E
5|$|In 1444, Skanderbeg {{had managed}} to unite the major Albanian princes under his {{leadership}} at the League of Lezhë, where a confederation of all the Albanian Principalities was created. Stresses within the alliance were felt, when Nicholas Dukagjini, {{a member of the}} Dukagjini family, a powerful family in northern Albania, ambushed and killed Lekë Zaharia Altisferi, prince of Dagnum and also League member. Since Zaharia had no children, he organized the killing to more easily gain Dagnum. The year in which Zaharia was killed is not recorded. A Venetian document dated to 4 January 1445, mentions Zaharia as the once lord of Dagnum which was given to Boxia, Zaharia's mother. The Venetian chronicler Stefano <b>Magno</b> says that Zaharia was killed close to the advent of the year 1445.|$|E

Elements of the facade, including the 17th-century travertino portal decorated with cherubs, are in the comune storehouse at the Bastione Ardeatino. The two relics (of Isaac's sacrifice and the presentation of Jesus in the temple) were placed in the church of the Santi Michele e <b>Magno,</b> the national church of the Dutch in Borgo, during the early 1990s; the latter is now the church's main altar.|$|E

5|$|The {{golden goal}} was used during extra-time, {{which meant that}} {{whatever}} team scored first would win. Liverpool kicked off {{the first half of}} extra-time and within three minutes, Alavés looked like they had scored a golden goal. Ivan Alonso had put the ball in the Liverpool goal, but it was ruled out as Alonso was offside. A minute later, Óscar Téllez was booked for fouling Robbie Fowler. Within four minutes, Alavés had been reduced to 10 men. <b>Magno</b> was shown a second yellow card for a two-footed challenge on Markus Babbel. With a minute {{of the first half of}} extra-time remaining, Fowler thought he had scored the winning goal, however it was disallowed as he was offside.|$|E

Two minutes later, Liverpool substituted Michael Owen for Patrik Berger. In the 82nd minute, Alavés had an appeal for a penalty after Hamann was adjudged to have brought <b>Magno</b> down, the Brazilian was subsequently booked for diving. With two minutes remaining, Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld conceded a corner. The subsequent corner is headed into the goal by Jordi Cruyff to make the scoreline 4–4. Two minutes into injury-time, Contra went down under pressure from Gerrard in the Liverpool penalty area. Again, the referee deemed that there was no penalty. Following this, the referee blew his whistle to signal the end of 90 minutes if play. The match would now go into a 30-minute extra-time period.|$|E

He also wrote the preface to physician and scientist William Gilbert's great work De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de <b>Magno</b> Magnete Tellure (The Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet the Earth, 1600), in which Gilbert described his experiments which led {{to the conclusion that the}} Earth was magnetic, and introduced the term electricus to describe the phenomenon of static electricity produced by rubbing amber (called ēlectrum in Classical Latin, derived from ήλεκτρον (elektron) in Ancient Greek). According to the mathematician and physician Mark Ridley, chapter 12 of book 4 of De Magnete, which explained how astronomical observations could be used to determine the magnetic variation, was actually Wright's work.|$|E

5|$|The 2/15th was {{subsequently}} withdrawn to Gaza, where it stayed {{into the new}} year, before moving to Syria, where it formed part of the Allied occupation force established {{there at the end}} of the Syria–Lebanon campaign. In July 1942, in the face of a heavy German onslaught that threatened to break through to Suez, the 9th Division was hurriedly moved back to North Africa. The 2/15th subsequently took part in the First and Second Battles of El Alamein during the remainder of the year. Throughout August, the 2/15th subsequently held a position in the north-east sector of the line from Hill 33 to the coast. On 1 September, the 2/15th participated in the 9th Division's diversionary attack south of Tel-el-Eisa, codenamed Operation Bulimba, which was planned as a response to German offensive actions further south during the lead-up to the final assault in late October and early November 1942. In heavy fighting near Point 23, a low rocky outcrop, the battalion lost about half of its fighting strength, sustaining 183 casualties, amidst heavy hand-to-hand fighting as the battalion came up against heavy resistance after penetrating a German minefield. Ogle's carrier struck a mine during the operation, and he was seriously wounded. The battalion's role in the September attack, including the efforts of Corporal Horton McLachlan, who received the Distinguished Conduct Medal, was later depicted in a painting by Ivor Hele. Among the casualties at El Alamein was the 2/15th's recently appointed replacement commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Keith <b>Magno,</b> who was mortally wounded by artillery fire after the battalion was heavily shelled while forming up during an attack around Trig 29– a valuable piece of high ground south-west of Tel-el-Eisa– on 28 October. Casualties over both periods the battalion fought around Alamein totaled 81 killed, 23 died of wounds, 276 wounded and seven captured.|$|E

50|$|The newly {{introduced}} mobile {{weapons of}} Taraak. These machines carry {{an assortment of}} melee weapons, ranging from swords, axes, spears to chainsaws. As well, they can easily withstand artillery fire. Initially, along with the Ikazuchi battleship, the Vanguards were used to eliminate any hostiles (mainly, space pirates and the women of Mejere) that threatened Taraak airspace, until <b>Magno's</b> pirate ship hijacked the battleship. Hibiki's Vanguard (though it really was not his), like the Dreads, was also affected by the Paksis, transforming it into an even bulkier version of its original self. Later, when fused with either Dita's, Meia's or Jura's Dreads, it becomes the all-powerful Vandread. In Vandread: Second Stage, after becoming the Super Vandread, the Vanguard receives a small physical transformation, and possibly an additional boost of power from the fusion.|$|R

Concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} oxygen in the gas leaving the bioreactor were determined by the measuring devices Uras 10 E and <b>Magnos</b> 6 G 1 (both Hartmann & Braun AG). A pH of 7 was maintained by the addition of 4 M HCl and NaOH. A drop in the amount of dissolved oxygen was compensated by increasing the stirrer speed (100 – 400 rpm) or the airflow rate (100 – 400 L min- 1). Foam was controlled by a mechanical foam destroyer or by the addition of a 50 % (v/v) Struktol (Schill & Seilacher) solution.|$|R

When the Paksis created the wormhole the Dreads of Dita, Meia and Jura underwent changes. All three Dreads became structurally different from the others, while possessing greater firepower than an average Dread.
