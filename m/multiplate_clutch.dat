2500|$|The {{first ever}} series {{production}} DCT was the Volkswagen Group DQ250 six-speed dual-clutch transmission, with dual concentric wet <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutches.</b> [...] It was produced at the Group's Kassel plant under exclusive license from BorgWarner {{for use in}} transverse powertrain installations, of either front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive (4WD) layouts. The 4WD versions are fundamentally identical to the FWD versions, but the 4WD versions use an additional bolt-on power take-off unit to direct engine torque to the Haldex Traction rear axle. [...] This DQ250 variant is used {{in a wide range}} of models: Volkswagen Passenger Cars (Polo, Golf/Rabbit/Golf Plus, Scirocco, Jetta, Eos, Passat, and Touran); Audi cars (A3, and TT); SEAT cars (Ibiza, León, Altea, and Toledo); Škoda cars (Octavia and Superb); and Volkswagen commercial vehicles (Caddy and T5 Transporter).|$|R
50|$|While {{most other}} {{manufacturers}} use wet clutches (with the spinning parts bathed in oil) Ducati previously used <b>multiplate</b> dry <b>clutches</b> {{in many of}} their motorcycles. The dry clutch eliminates the power loss from oil viscosity drag on the engine, even though the engagement {{may not be as}} smooth as the oil-bath versions, but the clutch plates can wear more rapidly. Ducati has converted to wet clutches across their current product lines.|$|R
5000|$|This type of clutch {{has several}} driving members {{interleaved}} or [...] "stacked" [...] with several driven members. It {{is used in}} racing cars including Formula 1, IndyCar, World Rally and even most club racing. <b>Multiplate</b> <b>clutches</b> see much use in drag racing, which requires the best acceleration possible, and is notorious for the abuse the clutch is subjected to. Thus motorcycles, automatic transmissions and in some diesel locomotives with mechanical transmissions. It is also used in some electronically controlled all-wheel drive systems {{as well as in}} some transfer cases. They can also be found in some heavy machinery such as tanks and AFV's (T-54) and earthmoving equipment (front-end loaders, bulldozers), as well as components in certain types of limited slip differentials. The benefit in the case of motorsports is that you can achieve the same total friction force with a much smaller overall diameter (or conversely, a much greater friction force for the same diameter, important in cases where a vehicle is modified with greater power, yet the maximum physical size of the clutch unit is constrained by the clutch housing). In motorsports vehicles that run at high engine/drivetrain speeds, the smaller diameter reduces rotational inertia, making the drivetrain components accelerate more rapidly, as well as reducing the angular velocity of the outer areas of the clutch unit, which could become highly stressed and fail at the extremely high drivetrain rotational rates achieved in sports such as Formula 1 or drag racing. In the case of heavy equipment, which often deal with very high torque forces and drivetrain loads, a single plate clutch of the necessary strength would be too large to easily package as a component of the driveline.|$|R

50|$|The K-type chassis {{was first}} {{designed}} by LGOC in 1914, but development was delayed by the First World War. The first chassis {{was completed in}} August 1919. The chassis was fitted with a 30 hp 4.4-litre four-cylinder engine and had a three-speed chain gearbox and <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanical}} transmission {{in the rear}} part of the hull consists of a change gear quadrant, a primary <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch</b> unit with metallic friction pads, a manual gearbox with five forward gears, two multiplate planetary steering clutches with band brakes and two in-line final drive groups.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{transmission}} {{was invented by}} Frenchman Adolphe Kégresse just before World War II, although he never developed a working model. The first development of the twin-clutch or dual-clutch transmission started {{in the early part}} of 1980 under the guidance of Harry Webster at Automotive Products (AP), Leamington Spa, with prototypes built into the Ford Fiesta Mk1, Ford Ranger, and Peugeot 205. Initially, the control systems were based on purely analogue/discrete digital circuitry with patents filed in July 1981. All of these early AP twin-clutch installations featured a single dry <b>clutch</b> and <b>multiplate</b> wet <b>clutch.</b> Following discussions with VW/Porsche, DCT work continued from Porsche in-house development, for Audi and Porsche racing cars later in the 1980s, when computers to control the transmission became compact enough: the Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (...) (PDK) used in [...] the Porsche 956 and 962 Le Mans race cars from 1983, and the Audi Sport Quattro S1.|$|R
50|$|The 500 cc Meteor and Comet singles were introduced, {{along with}} a 500 cc racer, the Vincent Grey Flash. The Grey Flash racer used Albion gears, for the greater choice of ratios available. The 500 cc bikes used a wet <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch,</b> while the 998 cc V-twins used a dry, drum-type servo clutch.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{right hand}} gear-change leverThe clutch's thrust and {{withdrawal}} races are oiled by hand and {{it is necessary to}} unscrew the alloy front floorboards for access but the gearbox has a quickly detachable filler. The <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch</b> is run with graphite and coupled by a fabric joint to the 4-speed gearbox then to the spiral-bevel driven rear axle located by torque girders ...|$|E
50|$|The {{range was}} to include both a touring and sports model in {{capacities}} of 1,000 cc (RTV1000) and 1,200 cc (RTV1200). Complete new engines {{would also be}} made available for separate purchase. Production was initially to begin for the larger capacity machine designated the RTV1200. These were to be fitted, as standard, with state of the art; Bosch electric start, Brembo brakes, adjustable Paioli upside down forks, Ohlins rear monoshock and V-2 <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch.</b> The first factory prototype RTV was built in 1998, other RTV prototypes were in various stages before the company went into voluntary liquidation {{towards the end of}} that year.|$|E
50|$|Dual-clutch {{transmissions}} use two {{fundamentally different}} types of clutches: either two wet multiplate clutches, bathed in oil (for cooling), or two dry single-plate clutches. The wet clutch design is generally used for higher torque engines that can generate 350 Nm and more (the wet <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch</b> DCT in the Bugatti Veyron is designed to cope with 1250 Nm), whereas the dry-clutch design is generally suitable for smaller vehicles with lower torque outputs up to 250 Nm. However, while the dry-clutch variants may be limited in torque compared to their wet-clutch counterparts, the dry-clutch versions offer an increase in fuel efficiency, {{due to the lack}} of pumping losses of the transmission fluid in the clutch housing.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the later}} Honda CB750 and other Japanese superbikes which had {{horizontally}} split crankcases, the Trident engine {{was essentially a}} vertically split parallel twin with a separate central chamber to accommodate the third cylinder. Whereas the Speed Twin was a traditional British twin with a 360° crankshaft, this new triple had crankpins offset 120° and so inherently had much smoother primary balance, albeit with a rocking couple. Although most British motorcycles used a wet <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch,</b> this triple had a dry single-plate clutch in a housing between the primary chaincase and the gearbox. Mounted {{on the end of}} the gearbox mainshaft (where the clutch would be expected) was a large transmission shock-absorber.|$|E
50|$|While the 750 cc and 500 cc racers {{were very}} similar, the 500 {{had a much}} shorter 58 mm stroke, with the same 74 mm bore as the 750. The 500 had the same bore and stroke as the later 500 Pantah. It had 10.5:1 {{compression}} and initially produced 61.2 bhp at 11,000 rpm. All Ducati's 500 cc GP engines used desmodromic two-valve heads with an 80 degree included valve angle. They used remote float bowl Dell'Orto 40 mm carburettors, and had a six-speed gearbox with a dry, <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch.</b> Ignition was electronic, provided by nearby Ducati Elettrotecnica, but was initially unreliable. Dual spark plugs were used, and the final ignition system used four coils, two {{on each side of}} the frame.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, in {{less than}} six months, Fabio Taglioni and his team had {{designed}} and built their own complete bike (The industry norm for concept to production is three years). While the 750 and 500 racers were very similar, the 500 had a much shorter 58 mm stroke with its 74 mm bore. It had 10.5:1 compression and initially produced [...] at 11,000 rpm. (Same bore and stroke as the later 500 Pantah) All Ducatis 500 cc GP engines used desmodromic two valve heads with an 80 degree included valve angle.

5000|$|Another, {{different}} theme on the <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch</b> is {{the clutches}} {{used in the}} fastest classes of drag racing, highly specialized, purpose-built cars such as Top Fuel or Funny Cars. These cars are so powerful that to attempt a start with a simple clutch would result in complete loss of traction. To avoid this problem, Top Fuel cars actually use a single, fixed gear ratio, {{and a series of}} clutches that are engaged one at a time, rather than in unison, progressively allowing more power to the wheels. A single one of these clutch plates (as designed) can not hold more than a fraction {{of the power of the}} engine, so the driver starts with only the first clutch engaged. This clutch is overwhelmed by the power of the engine, allowing only a fraction of the power to the wheels, much like [...] "slipping the clutch" [...] in a slower car, but working not requiring concentration from the driver. As speed builds, the driver pulls a lever, which engages a second clutch, sending a bit more of the engine power to the wheels, and so on. This continues through several clutches until the car has reached a speed where the last clutch can be engaged. With all clutches engaged, the engine is now sending all of its power to the rear wheels. This is far more predictable and repeatable than the driver manually slipping the clutch himself and then shifting through the gears, given the extreme violence of the run and the speed at which is all unfolds. Another benefit is that there is no need to break the power flow in order to swap gears (a conventional manual cannot transmit power while between gears, which is important because 1/100ths of a second are important in Top Fuel races). A traditional <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch</b> would be more prone to overheating and failure, as all the plates must be subjected to heat and friction together until the clutch is fully engaged, while a Top Fuel car keeps its last clutches in [...] "reserve" [...] until the cars speed allows full engagement. It is relatively easy to design the last stages to be much more powerful than the first, in order to ensure they can absorb the power of the engine even if the first clutches burn out or overheat from the extreme friction.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deal with}} a {{calculation}} and a construction concept of a PTO coupling used in Tatra vehicles. The coupling allows turn on an accessory machinery when the engine is on. It is designed as an <b>multiplate</b> <b>clutch</b> with a wet surrounding. The operating is managed by a pneumatic system. The construction solution was restricted mainly by space needs. The calculation includes torque issues and aslo a part considering a heat question. The construction section includes individual clutch parts design...|$|E
