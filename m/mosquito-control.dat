Thus, {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate latent classes of users in Mozambique based on their preferences for <b>mosquito-control</b> technology attributes and covariates of these classes, as well as to explore which current technologies meet these preferences. Methods Surveys were administered in five rural villages in Mozambique. The data were analysed with latent class analysis. Results This study showed that users' preferences for malaria technologies varied, and people could be categorized into four latent classes based on shared preferences. The largest class, constituting almost half of the respondents, would not avoid a <b>mosquito-control</b> technology because of its cost, heat, odour, potential to make other health issues worse, ease of keeping clean, or inadequate mosquito control. The other three groups are characterized by the attributes which would make them avoid a technology; these groups are labelled as the bites class, by-products class, and multiple-concerns class. Statistically significant covariates included literacy, self-efficacy, willingness to try new technologies, and perceived seriousness of malaria for the household. Conclusions To become widely diffused, best practices suggest that end-users should be included in product development to ensure that preferred attributes or traits are considered. This study demonstrates that end-user preferences can be very different and that one malaria control technology will not satisfy everyone. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective. The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of an educational intervention about dengue in a group of fifth-grade science students. Training in <b>mosquito-control</b> may help students become effective public health agents. Background. Dengue, a potentially fatal mosquito-borne viral disease, is spreading rapidly including in previously unaffected areas in the southern United States. Public health officials consider vector control and personal protection the best ways to control the spread of dengue in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine. Children are especially vulnerable to the severe complications of dengue and must be educated about the disease. Methods. Thirty- seven Naples, Florida fifth-graders participated in a quasi-experimental study to assess differences between the scores of pre- and posttests about dengue and its prevention. An active, hands-on educational intervention preceded the administration of the posttest. Results. Significant (p 3 ̆c. 001) improvement in dengue knowledge test scores followed the educational intervention, and participants discovered several containers in which mosquitoes could breed during a search of the school grounds.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between environmental factors and the {{spatial distribution of}} maintained and actively used burrows of the grapsid crab Helograpsus haswellianus was studied at three saltmarsh sites in southeast Queensland, Australia. The sites had been modified by runnelling for <b>mosquito-control,</b> a method that transports low-amplitude tides to areas of saltmarsh. The study investigated the {{relationship between}} burrow density, burrow aperture size, and runnelling, {{as well as the}} effect of flooding or non-flooding tides and distance from a tidal source. Responses differed at the three sites. The most consistent pattern across all sites was that active burrows were most numerous between 30 and 50 m from the saltmarsh / mangrove interface at the landward side of the tidal source. At particular sites, there were significant relationships between burrow aperture size, tidal period, and the presence of runnels. Generally, few small burrows occurred low on the shore, while larger burrows were distributed across the shore to 50 m. At naturally dry sites, more burrows occurred within 5 m of the runnel, whereas at naturally wet sites, fewer burrows were found close to the runnel. As runnels transport low-amplitude tides, moisture conditions required for burrowing may very between flooding and non-flooding tides. Overall, the influence of tides on the density of crab burrows and their aperture sizes was of more importance than the presence of runnels alone.

40|$|Background: Bromeliads can be epiphytic, {{terrestrial}} or saxicolous and use {{strategies to}} allow water to be re­tained in their leaf axils, where various arthropods can be found. These include mosquitoes, whose larvae {{are the most}} abundant and commonly found organisms in the leaf axils. The objective {{of this study was}} to look for im­mature forms of mosquitoes (the larval and pupal stages) in bromeliads in municipal parks in São Paulo and to discuss the ecological and epidemiological importance of these insects. Methods: From October 2010 to July 2013, immature mosquitoes were collected from bromeliads in 65 munici­pal parks in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, using suction samplers. The immature forms were maintained until adult forms emerged, and these were then identified morphologically. Results: Two thousand forty-two immature-stage specimens belonging to the genera Aedes, Culex, Trichoprosopon, Toxorhynchites, Limatus and Wyeomyia were found in bromeliads in 15 of the 65 parks visited. Aedes albopictus was the most abundant species (660 specimens collected), followed by Culex quinquefasciatus (548 specimens) and Cx. (Microculex) imitator (444). The taxa with the most widespread distribution were Ae. aegypti and Toxorhynchites spp, followed by Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Conclusion: Bromeliads in urban parks are refuges for populations of native species of Culicidae and breeding sites for exotic species that are generally of epidemiological interest. Hence, administrators and surveillance and <b>mosquito-control</b> agencies must constantly monitor these microenvironments as the presence of these species endangers the health of park users and employees as well as people living near the parks.  </p...|$|E

Treatments were monitored for one year. Results: A key finding was that mating history did not predict establishment success, which was 88 % in both treatments. Furthermore, analysis of behavioural traits revealed that the descendants of singly-mated females retained antipredator behaviours, and that adult males showed no decrease in courtship vigour. Also, we detected no differences in behavioural variability between treatments. Conclusions: These results suggest that even when denied the option of multiple mating, singly-mated female guppies can produce viable populations, at least at the founder stage.

40|$|Abstract Dengue is a {{vector-borne disease}} that is {{estimated}} to affect millions of individuals each year in tropical and subtropical areas, and it is reemerging in areas that have been disease-free for relatively long periods of time. In {{this issue of the}} journal, Peng et al. report on a Dengue outbreak in a city in southern China that had been disease-free for more than two decades. The infection, which was due to serotype 1, was introduced by a traveler from South-east Asia and transmitted by Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito. Compared to Aedes aegypti, which is the most important vector of Dengue, Ae albopictus is a less competent vector of arboviruses, and the epidemics it causes are milder. However, Ae albopictus is becoming an increasingly important vector because of its rapidly changing global distribution. In particular, the worldwide trade in second hand tires, which often contain water and are an ideal place for eggs and larvae, has been a key factor in the large-scale conquest of Ae albopictus, which easily adapts to new environments, even in a temperate climate. This expansion is creating new opportunities for viruses to circulate in new areas, becoming a common cause of epidemics in Ae aegypti -free countries, from Hawaii to Mauritius. The outbreak in China, like similar events, was mild and short-lived. Because epidemics due to Ae albopictus are milder, the replacement of Ae aegypti with the tiger mosquito could even result in public-health benefits. However, there is no solid evidence of this, and the milder course of the outbreak could be in part explained by the relatively short duration of the hot season in some affected areas. Since {{it is almost impossible to}} prevent Ae albopictus from being introduced in a country, <b>mosquito-control</b> measures at local level remain the most effective means of controlling arbovirus outbreaks. </p...|$|E
40|$|Anopheles gambiae Giles {{sensu stricto}} (Diptera: Culicidae) {{is the most}} {{important}} vector of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting the lives of millions of people. Existing tools such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor-residual sprays are not only effective, but also have limitations {{as a result of the}} development of resistance to insecticides and behavioural adaptations in biting time. Therefore, novel <b>mosquito-control</b> tools are needed. Odour-releasing traps have a potential for both trapping and surveillance purposes. Based on the outcome of ex vivo gene expression assays and in vivo electrophysiological assays on hundreds of volatile organic compounds, 29 ‘candidate behaviourally-disruptive organic compounds' (cBDOCs) are selected, belonging to 10 chemical categories, to be assayed in the laboratory using dual-choice olfactometers for the ability to modify the ‘attractiveness’ (i. e. significantly more insects being caught in the associated trap) of a basic volatile blend consisting of ammonia, lactic acid and tetradecanoic acid but without additional carbon dioxide. Compounds that either reduce or increase trap catches by the basic blend in the olfactometer experiments are tested under African conditions in choice experiments in a semi-field facility in Kenya. The release rates of cBDOCs are determined gravimetrically to allow the calculation of aerial concentrations at the trap outlet. Aerial concentrations in the sub-p. p. m. range are reported for the first time to influence mosquito behaviour. The results of the olfactometer and semi-field assays generally correspond. Under semi-field conditions, three compounds, 3 -heptanol (0. 025 p. p. m.), 2 -methylpropanal (0. 05 p. p. m.) and 4, 5 -dimethylthiazole (0. 73 p. p. m.), significantly increase trap catches relative to the basic blend consisting of ammonia, lactic acid, tetradecanoic acid and carbon dioxide. 2 -Acetylthiophene, 2 -nonanone and 2 -phenylethanol decrease the number of mosquitoes caught at all concentrations tested under semi-field conditions.

40|$|Background Aedes albopictus is an {{aggressive}} invasive mosquito species {{that represents a}} serious health concern not only in tropical areas, but also in temperate regions due to its role as vector of arboviruses. Estimates of mosquito biting rates are essential to account for vector-human contact in models aimed to predict the risk of arbovirus autochthonous transmission and outbreaks, as well as nuisance thresholds useful for correct planning of mosquito control interventions. Methods targeting daytime and outdoor biting Ae. albopictus females (e. g., Human Landing Collection, HLC) are expensive and difficult to implement in large scale schemes. Instead, egg-collections by ovitraps are {{the most widely used}} routine approach for large-scale monitoring of the species. The aim of this work was to assess whether ovitrap data can be exploited to estimate numbers of adult biting Ae. albopictus females and whether the resulting relationship could be used to build risk models helpful for decision-makers in charge of planning of <b>mosquito-control</b> activities in infested areas. Method Ovitrap collections and HLCs were carried out in hot-spots of Ae. albopictus abundance in Rome (Italy) along a whole reproductive season. The relationship between the two sets of data was assessed by generalized least square analysis, taking into account meteorological parameters. Result The mean number of mosquito females/person collected by HLC in 15 ′ (i. e., females/HLC) and the mean number of eggs/day were 18. 9 ±  0. 7 and 39. 0 ±  2. 0, respectively. The regression models found a significant positive relationship between the two sets of data and estimated an increase of one biting female/person every five additional eggs found in ovitraps. Both observed and fitted values indicated presence of adults in the absence of eggs in ovitraps. Notably, wide confidence intervals of estimates of biting females based on eggs were observed. The patterns of exotic arbovirus outbreak probability obtained by introducing these estimates in risk models were similar to those based on females/HLC (R 0 >  1 in 86 % and 40 % of sampling dates for Chikungunya and Zika, respectively; R 0   1 for Chikungunya is also to be expected when few/no eggs/day are collected by ovitraps. Discussion This work provides the first evidence of the possibility to predict mean number of adult biting Ae. albopictus females based on mean number of eggs and to compute the threshold of eggs/ovitrap associated to epidemiological risk of arbovirus transmission in the study area. Overall, however, the large confidence intervals in the model predictions represent a caveat regarding the reliability of monitoring schemes based exclusively on ovitrap collections to estimate numbers of biting females and plan control interventions...|$|E
40|$|Biographical) From Wikipedia: John Frank Stevens (25 April 1853 – 2 June 1943) was an American {{engineer}} {{who built the}} Great Northern Railway in the United States and was chief engineer on the Panama Canal between 1905 and 1907. Biography: Stevens was born in rural Maine, near West Gardiner to John Stevens, a tanner and farmer, and Harriet Leslie French. He attended Maine State Normal School (now the University of Maine at Farmington) for two years. At the conclusion of his schooling in 1873, bleak economic conditions held little promise of a job, and he chose to go west. Entry into the field of civil engineering evolved from his experience in the Minneapolis city engineer's office. For two years he carried out a variety of engineering tasks, including surveying and building railroads, {{and at the same}} time gained experience and an understanding of the subject. He became a practical engineer, self-taught and driven by a self-described "bull-dog tenacity of purpose. " In 1878 Stevens married Harriet T. O'Brien. They had five children, two of whom died in infancy. By the age of 33, in 1886, Stevens was principal assistant engineer for the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway, and in charge of building the line from Duluth, Minnesota to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, across the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Although a large part of his work involved surveying, he assisted in all phases of railroading: reconnaissance, locating, organizing, and construction. In 1889, Stevens was hired by James J. Hill as a locating engineer for the Great Northern Railway. Stevens earned wide acclaim in 1889 when he explored Marias Pass, Montana, and determined its practicability for a railroad. Stevens was an efficient administrator with remarkable technical skills and imagination. He discovered Stevens Pass through the Cascade Mountains, set railroad construction standards in the Mesabi Range of northern Minnesota, and supervised construction of the Oregon Trunk Line. Hill promoted him to chief engineer in 1895, and later to general manager. During his time at the Great Northern, Stevens built over a thousand miles of railroad, including the original Cascade Tunnel. Stevens Pass in the Cascade Range was named for him. (Most other Pacific Northwest landmarks with the word "Stevens" are named after Isaac Stevens, who is of no relation.) Panama Canal: Stevens left the Great Northern in 1903 for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, where he was promoted to vice-president. Then, in 1905, at Hill's recommendation, he was hired by Theodore Roosevelt as chief engineer on the Panama Canal. Stevens' primary achievement in Panama was to build the infrastructure needed for the completion of the canal. "The digging," he said, "is the least thing of all. " He proceeded immediately to build warehouses, machine shops, and piers. Communities for the personnel were planned and built to include housing, schools, hospitals, churches, and hotels. He authorized extensive sanitation and <b>mosquito-control</b> programs that eliminated yellow fever and other diseases from the Isthmus. Reflecting his background, he saw the early stage of the canal project itself as primarily a problem in railroad engineering, which included rebuilding the Panama Railway and devising a rail-based system for disposing of the soil from the excavations. Stevens argued the case against a sea level canal like the French had tried to build. He successfully convinced Theodore Roosevelt of the necessity of a high-level canal built with dams and locks. Resignation: Stevens resigned suddenly from the Canal project in 1907 to Roosevelt's great annoyance, as the focus of the work turned to construction of the canal itself. As a railroad engineer, Stevens had little expertise in building locks and dams, and probably realized he was no longer the best person for the remainder of the job. Stevens would also have been aware that the original great Cascade Tunnel, for which he was responsible, was in hindsight built in error too close to the ruling grade and was perhaps turning from a credit to a debit. The true reasons for his resignation have never been known. Subsequent career: Following the collapse of Imperial Russia in 1917, leaders of the provisional government appealed to President Wilson for help with their transportation systems. Stevens was selected to chair a board of prominent U. S. railroad experts sent to Russia to rationalize and manage a system that was in disarray; among his work was on the Trans-Siberian Railway. After the overthrow of the provisional government, the board's work ceased. Stevens remained in Allied-occupied Manchuria and in 1919 headed the Inter-Allied Technical Board charged with the administration and operation of the Chinese Eastern and Siberian railways. He remained in an advisory capacity until occupying Allied troops were withdrawn; he finally left in 1923. After his return to the United States Stevens continued to work as a consulting engineer, ending his career in Baltimore in the early 1930 s. He was awarded the Franklin Institute's Franklin Medal in 1930. He then retired to Southern Pines, North Carolina, where he died at the age of 90 in 1943.
