5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} shown that the current species concept for H.repandum may need {{revision}} as there is a poor overlap between morphological and <b>molecular</b> <b>species</b> concepts. Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based on internal transcribed spacer and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicates that H.repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences may indicate the presence of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation.|$|E

40|$|Cells, whether bacterial, fungal or mammalian, are all {{equipped}} with metabolic pathways {{capable of producing}} an assortment of structurally and functionally distinct lipid species. Despite the structural diversity of lipids being recognized and correlated to specific cellular phenomena and disease states, the molecular mechanisms that underpin this structural diversity remain poorly understood. In part, {{this is due to}} the lack of adequate analytical techniques capable of measuring the structural details of lipid species in a direct, comprehensive and quantitative manner. The aim of my thesis study was to establish methodology for automated and quantitative analysis of <b>molecular</b> lipid <b>species</b> based on mass spectrometry. From this work a novel high-throughput methodology for lipidome analysis emerged. The main assets of the methodology were the structure-specific mass analysis by powerful hybrid mass spectrometers with high mass resolution, automated and sensitive infusion of total lipid extracts by a nanoelectrospray robot, and automated spectral deconvolution by dedicated Lipid Profiler software. The comprehensive characterization and quantification of <b>molecular</b> lipid <b>species</b> was achieved by spiking total lipid extracts with unique lipid standards, utilizing selective ionization conditions for sample infusion, and performing structure-specific mass analysis by hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight and ion trap mass spectrometry. The analytical routine allowed the comprehensive characterization and quantification of <b>molecular</b> glycerophospholipid <b>species,</b> <b>molecular</b> diacylglycerol <b>species,</b> <b>molecular</b> sphingolipid <b>species</b> including ceramides, glycosphingolipids and inositol-containing sphingolipids, and sterol lipids including cholesterol. The performance of the methodology was validated by comparing its dynamic quantification range to that of established methodology based on triple quandrupole mass spectrometry. Furthermore, its efficacy for lipidomics projects was demonstrated by the successful quantitative deciphering of the lipid composition of T cell receptor signaling domains, mammalian tissues including heart, brain and red blood cells, and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae...|$|R

25|$|It {{is clear}} that an {{explicit}} description, which lists all possible <b>molecular</b> <b>species</b> (including all their possible states), all possible reactions or transitions these species can undergo, and all parameters governing these reactions, very quickly becomes unwieldy as {{the complexity of the}} biological system increases. Modelers have therefore looked for implicit, rather than explicit, ways of specifying a biological signaling system. An implicit description is one that groups reactions and parameters that apply to many types of <b>molecular</b> <b>species</b> into one reaction template. It might also add a set of conditions that govern reaction parameters, i.e. the likelihood or rate at which a reaction occurs, or whether it occurs at all. Only properties of the molecule or complex that matter to a given reaction (either affecting the reaction or being affected by it) are explicitly mentioned, and all other properties are ignored in the specification of the reaction.|$|E

25|$|Consider a solid {{consisting}} of a single <b>molecular</b> <b>species</b> and subjected to melting. Ultimately it is rendered to an isotropic state classically referred to as liquid. Mesophases occur before then when an intermediate state of order is still maintained as in the nematic, smectic, and columnar phases of liquid crystals. Mesophases thus exhibit anisotropy. For instance, LCD devices work on the optical switch principle that obscures light or lets it pass. This switch is turned off and on by an electric field applied to the mesogen with director. The response of the director to the field is expressed with viscosity parameters, as in the Ericksen-Leslie theory in continuum mechanics developed by Jerald Ericksen and Frank Matthews Leslie.|$|E

25|$|In {{the example}} above the atomic weight of carbon is given as 12.011, not 12. This is because {{naturally}} occurring carbon {{is a mixture}} of the isotopes 12C, 13C and 14C which have relative atomic masses of 12, 13 and 14 respectively. Moreover, the proportion of the isotopes varies between samples, so 12.011 is an average value. By contrast, there is less variation in naturally occurring hydrogen so the average atomic weight is known more precisely. The precision of the molecular mass is determined by precision of the least precise atomic mass value, in this case that of carbon. In high-resolution mass spectrometry the isotopomers 12C1H4 and 13C1H4 are observed as distinct molecules, with molecular weights of 16 and 17, respectively. The intensity of the mass-spectrometry peaks is proportional to the isotopic abundances in the <b>molecular</b> <b>species.</b> 12C 2H 1H3 can also be observed with molecular weight of 17.|$|E

With short labeling periods (10 and 25 min) there is a major labeled species with an apparent molecular weight of 22, 000 and a smaller peak comigrating with purified βNGF chains (13, 260). As time proceeds, the radioactivity in the 22, 000 molecular weight peak plateaus, while the label in βNGF continues to increase, until by 4 hr it greatly exceeds the radioactivity of the 22, 000 <b>molecular</b> weight <b>species.</b> When glands incubated for 10 min are transferred to medium containing a large excess of unlabeled L-cystine, the 22, 000 molecular weight peak gradually declines, and there is a corresponding increase in radioactivity at the βNGF position.

When a methionine auxotroph of P. aeruginosa was starved for methionine, chemotaxis toward serine, measured by a quantitative capillary assay, was reduced 80 %, whereas background motility was unaffected or increased. When unstarved bacteria were labeled with L-[methyl- 3 H]methionine, a labeled species of 73, 000 molecular weight which was methylated in response to stimulation by L-serine was identified. Under appropriate electrophoretic conditions, the 73, 000 <b>molecular</b> weight <b>species</b> was resolved into two bands, both of which responded to stimulation by L-serine, L-arginine, and alpha-aminoisobutyrate (AIB) with an increased incorporation of methyl label.

The physical characteristics of released radionuclides can vary considerably in morphology and structure, size, shape, density, valence and charge. Radionuclide forms can be transformed with time through interaction with various ecosystem components and this may affect their subsequent bioavailability. Low <b>molecular</b> mass <b>species</b> are often more bioavailable than high <b>molecular</b> mass <b>species</b> such as colloids and particles. Various techniques {{have been developed to}} estimate bioavailability of radionuclides in soils and sediments, which often act as the major sink for radionuclides, such as estimation of Kd and sequential extraction.

For radioiodine, gut absorption is complete and independent of source whereas radiostrontium bioavailability is highly dependent on calcium intake. To reliably predict the environmental impact of radioactive contamination of different ecosystems, we need to link information on radionuclide composition and speciation to an understanding of the influence this might have on environmental transfer. Current information linking radionuclide speciation to bioavailability and environmental transfer is limited and this restricts our capability to adequately integrate the effect of speciation into predictive models of radionuclide behaviour in the environment.
