40|$|The {{release of}} the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics in 2010 {{resulted}} in a new focus on <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> in United States curricula. <b>Mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> represents {{a way of doing}} and understanding mathematics new to most teachers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the conceptions and misconceptions held by teachers about <b>mathematical</b> <b>models</b> and modeling in order to aid in the development of teacher education and professional development programs. The study used a mixed methods approach. Quantitative data were collected through an online survey of a large sample of practicing and prospective secondary teachers of mathematics in the United States. The purpose of this was to gain an understanding of the conceptions held by the general population of United States secondary mathematics teachers. In particular, basic concepts of <b>mathematical</b> <b>models,</b> <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling,</b> and <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> in education were analyzed. Qualitative data were obtained from case studies of a small group of mathematics teachers who had enrolled in professional development which had <b>mathematical</b> <b>models</b> or modeling as a focus. The purpose of these case studies was to give an illustrative view of teachers regarding modeling, as well as to gain some understanding of how participating in professional development affects teachers' conceptions. The data showed that US secondary mathematics teachers hold several misconceptions about models and modeling, particularly regarding aspects of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> process. Specifically, the majority of teachers do not understand that the <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> process always requires making choices and assumptions, and that <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> situations must come from real-world scenarios. A large minority of teachers have misconceptions about various other characteristics of <b>mathematical</b> <b>models</b> and the <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> process...|$|R

25|$|Even before {{becoming}} {{a president of the}} American Economic Association, Galbraith was considered as an iconoclast by many economists. This is partly because he rejected the technical analysis and <b>mathematical</b> <b>modelling</b> of neoclassical economics as being divorced from reality. Following Thorstein Veblen, he believed that economic activity could not be distilled into inviolable laws, but rather was a complex product of the cultural and political milieu in which it occurs. In particular, he posited that important factors, such as the separation between corporate ownership and management, oligopoly, and the influence of government and military spending had been largely neglected by most economists because they are not amenable to axiomatic descriptions. In this sense, he worked as much in political economy as in classical economics.|$|E

25|$|Research using <b>mathematical</b> <b>modelling</b> {{is indeed}} demonstrating that {{predation}} can indeed stabilize lumps of very similar species.

Also trees in the rain forest can serve as an example of all high canopy species basically following the same strategy. Other examples of nearly identical species clusters occupying the same niche were water beetles, prairie birds and algae.The basic idea is that there can be clusters of very similar species all applying the same successful strategy and between them open spaces. Here the species cluster takes the place of a single species in the classical ecological models.|$|E
500|$|The book {{begins with}} an {{introductory}} discussion {{of the principles of}} steam engines and the relevant physical principles, as well as designs for the Evans high-pressure steam engine, boilers, screw-mills and others. Evans developed a similar suite of tools and tables for potential steam engineers as he had for potential millers, such as tables itemizing the heat and pressure tolerances of various metals, instructions for assembling the basic components of a steam-powered system, and schematics for useful components such as valves and boilers. Evans also used the book to justify the safety of high-pressure steam engines if properly constructed, despite the fact that by this time Evans himself had experienced several boiler explosions in his workshop. However, thermodynamics were little understood in his time. As such, many of Evans's theoretical contentions, including the 'grand principle' of steam he develops to guide the <b>mathematical</b> <b>modelling</b> of pressure and fuel in steam engines, were substantially flawed. Although Evans was to be quite successful in the development of high-pressure steam engines (and his designs were widely used), his theoretical understanding of them was limited and he was generally unable to accurately predict the inputs and outputs of his machines. The guide also indulged in a far wider range of topics of interest to Evans, including a compendium of inventions from others which he deemed to be worthy of further circulation—such as a straw-cutter and flour press developed by his brother Evan, and a horse-drawn scraper and earth mover invented by Gershom Johnson. Evans also used the opportunity to encourage government sponsorship of research: ...|$|E
