60|$|By {{this time}} I have wakened (I am through the wall) and join them anxiously: so often has my mother been taken ill {{in the night}} that the {{slightest}} sound from her room rouses the house. She is in bed again, looking {{as if she had}} never been out of it, but I know her and listen sternly to the tale of her misdoings. She is not contrite. Yes, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> promise not to venture forth on the cold floors of daybreak, but she had risen for a moment only, and we just t’neaded her with our talk about draughts—there were no such things as draughts in her young days—and it is more than she can do (here she again attempts to rise but we hold her down) to lie there and watch that beautiful screen being spoilt. I reply that the beauty of the screen has ever been its miserable defect: ho, there! for a knife with which to spoil its beauty and make the bedroom its fitting home. As there is no knife handy, my foot will do; I raise my foot, and then—she sees that it is bare, she cries to me excitedly to go back to bed lest I catch cold. For though, ever careless of herself, she will wander the house unshod, and tell us not to talk havers when we chide her, the sight of one of us similarly negligent rouses her anxiety at once. She is willing now to sign any vow if only I will take my bare feet back to bed, but probably she is soon after me in hers to make sure that I am nicely covered up.|$|E
60|$|Joan was {{a victim}} to swift vagaries of thought and {{conflicting}} emotions. She was riding away with a freebooter, a road-agent, {{to be held for}} ransom. The fact was scarcely credible. She could not shake the dread of nameless peril. She tried not to recall Roberts's words, yet they haunted her. If she had not been so handsome, he had said! Joan knew she possessed good looks, but they had never caused her any particular concern. That Kells had let that influence him--as Roberts had imagined--was more than absurd. Kells had scarcely looked at her. It was gold such men wanted. She wondered what her ransom would be, where her uncle would get it, and if there really was a likelihood of that rich strike. Then she remembered her mother, who had died {{when she was a little}} girl, and a strange, sweet sadness abided with her. It passed. She saw her uncle--that great, robust, hearty, splendid old man, with his laugh and his kindness, and his love for her, and his everlasting unquenchable belief that soon he would make a rich gold-strike. What a roar and a stampede he would raise at her loss! The village camp might be divided on that score, she thought, because the few young women in that little settlement hated her, and the young men would have more peace without her. Suddenly her thought shifted to Jim Cleve, the cause of her present misfortune. She had forgotten Jim. In the interval somehow he had grown. Sweet to remember how he had fought for her and kept it secret! After all, she had misjudged him. She had hated him because she liked him. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> more! That gave her a shock. She recalled his kisses and then flamed all over. If she did not hate him she ought to. He had been so useless; he ran after her so; he was the laughing-stock of the village; his actions made her other admirers and friends believe she cared for him, was playing fast-and-loose with him. Still, there was a difference now. He had terribly transgressed. He had frightened her with threats of dire ruin to himself. And because of that she had trailed him, to fall herself upon a hazardous experience. Where was Jim Cleve now? Like a flash then occurred to her the singular possibility. Jim had ridden for the border with the avowed and desperate intention of finding Kells and Gulden and the bad men of that trackless region. He would do what he had sworn he would. And here she was, the cause of it all, a captive of this notorious Kells! She was being led into that wild border country. Somewhere out there Kells and Jim Cleve would meet. Jim would find her in Kells's hands. Then there would be hell, Joan thought. The possibility, the certainty, seemed to strike deep into her, reviving that dread and terror. Yet she thrilled again; a ripple that was not all cold coursed through her. Something had a birth in her then, and the part of it she understood was that she welcomed the adventure with a throbbing heart, yet looked with awe and shame and distrust at this new, strange side of her nature.|$|E

When Martha goes to meet Lady Mary, who has {{returned}} to Misselthwaite, she tells Mary of the garden's untended state, {{even though it has}} been well-tended in her absence. Lizzie realises that the garden has been starved of children's love and fun; with the help of Robert she gathers the orphans, who run to the quickly-reviving garden.|$|R
6000|$|It {{is due to}} her {{to admit}} that, taking her as a class, the American girl is a {{distinct}} gain to European Society. Her influence is against convention and in favour of simplicity. One of her greatest charms, {{in the eyes of}} the European man, is that she listens to him. I cannot say whether it does her any good. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not remember it all, but while you are talking <b>she</b> <b>does</b> give you her attention. The English woman <b>does</b> not always. <b>She</b> greets you pleasantly enough: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I guess <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{belong in}} it. From all I can hear she's in {{everything}} and behind everything {{that looks like}} a reform--lot more than most folks realize. She lets Mrs. Reverend Warren, the president of this-here Thanatopsis Club, think she's running the works, but Miss Sherwin is the secret boss, and nags all the easy-going dames into doing something. But way I figure it out----You see, I'm not interested in these dinky reforms. Miss Sherwin's trying to repair the holes in this barnacle-covered ship of a town by keeping busy bailing out the water. And Pollock tries to repair it by reading poetry to the crew! Me, I want to yank it up on the ways, and fire the poor bum of a shoemaker that built it so it sails crooked, and have it rebuilt right, from the keel up." ...|$|R
40|$|Handarbeitskränzchen in Tabase'' (''A {{handicraft}} {{meeting in}} Tabase"). Seventeen girls {{and one woman}} are sitting and kneeling outside, {{in front of a}} house. The woman (maybe a European) is sitting on a chair, surrounded by girls, wearing a light-coloured blouse, a dark skirt and pinned-up hair. She is holding needles in her hands, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> is knitting. Some girls are holding needles and different material pieces in their hands (maybe they are knitting, sewing or stitching). One girl, wearing a dark dress, is standing with entangled arms close to the woman, watching to the woman's activity. The girl who is sitting rightmost, wearing a polka-dotted blouse and a dark skirt, is kneeling. Next to her a little basket, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> is <b>doing</b> wickerwork. The girls are wearing different clothes. Some are wearing light-coloured or dark dresses, others are wearing skirts and blouses...|$|R
5000|$|Moretz {{has shown}} {{interest}} in returning {{for a third}} installment and would also be interested in exploring Hit-Girl's dark side: [...] "I want to see something we haven't seen yet. Now we've seen who Mindy is, now we've seen who Hit-Girl is, I {{think we need to}} meld the characters together and have Mindy become Hit-Girl and Hit-Girl become Mindy. Maybe her natural hair has a streak of purple in it, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> really <b>does</b> go kind of crazy and go a bit darker since she lost her father." [...] She also added, [...] "I would only do the third one if it was logical. It needs to be a good script and a director, probably Matthew (Vaughn). The third film needs to fully wrap up the series and has to be a good note to end on." ...|$|R
50|$|At home, Scarlett {{is upset}} that Alex has not {{returned}} her calls {{for the last two}} days, and questions why John is there. John returns to his room to find his clothes scattered. He gathers his gun from the closet and investigates, finding Bartholomew in the kitchen. He shoots at the creature, with Scarlett nearby, who runs away screaming. Elizabeth, Will, and Lachlan (Lyric Lennon) return. While unpacking, Liz reveals to Elizabeth that she and Tristan have been carrying on an affair for a few weeks. Elizabeth says that <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not share, but <b>maybe</b> when <b>she</b> is <b>done</b> with Tristan. Liz pleads her case again, and Elizabeth says they will talk it over.|$|R
50|$|If {{one finds}} oneself believing all three propositions of an {{inconsistent}} triad, then (in {{order to be}} rational) one must give up or modify {{at least one of}} those beliefs. Maybe Alice doesn't love me, or <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't send flowers to me if <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> or <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> actually has sent flowers.|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{resisting}} Masons advances at first, Kate becomes jealous {{when she}} sees him with Rhiannon. Brewer admitted {{that she was not}} sure her character should be with Mason, especially after she had previously been involved with someone younger. She explained [...] "But its different, hes very cheeky and it takes its time. Rhiannon turns up and Kate is like Why am I getting jealous? And thats when it starts to unravel that <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> really <b>does</b> like this guy. But hes really fun and opposites attract there and she just dives in." [...] Kate and Mason begin dating, but soon after, Kates ex-boyfriend, Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor), returns and asks Kate to come away with him. Kate had assumed Mark was dead, so when she begins spending time with him, Mason feels left out of Kates life. He is threatened by the history between Kate and Mark and eventually he and Mark fight. Kate is left torn between Mark and Mason, but she eventually commits to a relationship with Mason. However, Mason feels like second best and when he learns Kate kissed Mark, he breaks up with her.|$|R

2500|$|Taylor often loses out to Brooke, as Thorne (Ridge's brother) loses out to Ridge. When {{asked in}} 2011 {{where she would}} like her storyline to go, Tylo said: [...] "I think we should see Thorne and Taylor get strong and stand up to these people who mowed them down." [...] In March 2012, Tylo said that Taylor is finally {{learning}} to pursue what she wants instead of always putting others first. She said, [...] "In psychology, they tell you {{to be true to}} yourself. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> is finally <b>doing</b> that, even though in her moral compass she knows that it is better to put other people first. She has been going after what she wants instead. It is a very good growing place for Taylor to go back to reality and realize that she is not perfect and that she needs to try not looking so perfect so much." ...|$|R
500|$|Cast member Wil Wheaton rewatched {{the episode}} for AOL TV in November 2006. He criticised {{the writing of}} Fontana in this episode, saying that around this time she {{appeared}} on a panel at a convention about how to solve [...] "The Wesley Problem", but when rewatching the episode he thought that [...] "maybe instead of sitting on this panel and trashing me, D.C Fontana could have written intelligent dialogue for me and helped solve the [...] "Wesley problem" [...] herself. I don't know, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> tried to <b>do</b> that and didn't {{get a lot of}} support {{from the rest of the}} producers and writing staff, but even I know of Dr. Channing's theory of not writing cliched dialogue for kids in science fiction, and then blaming the actor who is forced to deliver it." [...] Overall he criticised the [...] "very stiff" [...] dialogue throughout the episode, and called the set-up [...] "incredibly forced". He did highlight that Data acting out as Sherlock Holmes laid the foundation of future episodes which would expand on this.|$|R
5000|$|During this visit, Barbara felt {{distressed by}} a drive within her. The drive {{resolved}} {{itself into a}} single command: [...] "Write!" [...] She spoke of this command to another Sister, {{who had come to}} visit. Barbara said <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know how to write. The visiting Sister told her to try; <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> would be able to write down what was necessary. Barbara wrote down single letters and syllables, as best she could.|$|R
5000|$|Monica, {{the hostess}} at Pepper's, is spacey and oblivious. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> sees things others don't, or <b>maybe</b> <b>she's</b> just crazy. She is hopelessly {{in love with}} Rob, {{although}} the feeling is not mutual.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Brown, don't now! She's {{not one of}} us. There's no saying what's {{going on}} there in her. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she's</b> praying; <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> sees more than we do, over the sea there." ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, back in New York, Cantor Rabinovich confronts Rivka about Jess {{going to}} California, and reminds {{her that her}} place is by her husband's side, and if she goes to California, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> can bring him home. <b>She</b> relents and <b>does</b> just that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Master, {{you know}} I {{like you and}} I am sorry Kilmeny thinks as <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> though <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> is right. I {{would be glad to}} see you often for your own sake and I'll miss you much; but as things are I tell you plainly you'd better not come here any more. It will do no good, and the sooner you and she get over {{thinking}} about each other the better for you both. Go now, lad, and God bless you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cornelia now {{thought she}} was really angry {{with him for the}} first time since their marriage. She would not speak at once, but when <b>she</b> <b>did</b> speak, it was to say, [...] "No, let her keep it. I know Charmian made her buy it and I wouldn't like to take it from her. She has so much {{imagination}} that <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> can see some meaning in it and it will always be such a pleasure to her to explain it even if she can't." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the thing}} became {{a dream to}} Genevieve. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> had fainted, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know, but for what other reason should Silverstein have {{his arm around her}} {{supporting}} her? All the faces seemed blurred and unreal. Fragments of a discussion came to her ears. The young fellow who had been her guide was saying something about reporters. [...] "You vill get your name in der papers," [...] she could hear Silverstein saying to her, as from a great distance; and she knew she was shaking her head in refusal.|$|R
5000|$|A fourth graphic novel named Kick-Ass 3 was {{released}} in 2013 and is intended to close the story of both Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl. Millar has stated that if Kick-Ass 2 is successful, a third film will go into production soon. Taylor-Johnson, Moretz, and Mintz-Plasse have all stated they would reprise their roles for a third film with Moretz stating [...] "I want to see something we haven't seen yet.

While at a press conference for Godzilla, Taylor-Johnson stated that he was prepared to act in a third film, but he wasn't contracted for it and that there weren't plans for one at the time. In May 2014, while promoting his new film Neighbors, Christopher Mintz-Plasse said that he hadn't heard anything about a new film, but expressed doubt that a third would be made due to the second installment's disappointing box office performance.|$|R

2500|$|In early April 2006, Harris {{told the}} Tampa Tribune {{that some of}} her ex-campaign staffers and the {{national}} Republican party were deliberately sabotaging her campaign by [...] "putting knives in her back" [...] and had warned her that if <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not {{back out of the}} campaign, she would get an [...] "April surprise". Former campaign staffer Ed Rollins said [...] "They were all good professionals...There was no backstabbing. It's insulting that she would even say that.
