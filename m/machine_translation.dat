25|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>translation</b> (MT) is {{a process}} whereby a {{computer}} program analyzes a source text and, in principle, produces a target text without human intervention. In reality, however, <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> typically does involve human intervention, {{in the form of}} pre-editing and post-editing.|$|E
25|$|With proper {{terminology}} work, with {{preparation of}} the source text for <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> (pre-editing), and with reworking of the <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> by a human translator (post-editing), commercial machine-translation tools can produce useful results, especially if the machine-translation system is integrated with a translation-memory or globalization-management system.|$|E

40|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>translations</b> {{often have}} to be {{manually}} post-edited {{in order to meet}} quality demands. Since this is a labour-intensive task, it is desirable to find ways to automate (parts of) the post-editing process. This thesis presents a method for generation of rule sets for automatic post-editing of <b>machine</b> <b>translations.</b> The basic idea of the method is to generate a set of candidate rules from a parallel corpus of raw <b>machine</b> <b>translations</b> and manually post-edited translations, and to filter this set by measuring the effect of applying its individual rules to the raw <b>machine</b> <b>translations</b> of another corpus. As indicated by three frequently used evaluation metrics (BLEU, Meteor, and TER), rule sets created using this method are capable of increasing the translation quality of previously unseen translations from the same domain as the corpus used for filtering.

The subjects were tested for comprehension of the passages read, and were also asked to judge the clarity of individual sentences. Although the human translations generally gave better results than the <b>machine</b> <b>translations,</b> the differences were frequently not significant. Most subjects regarded the <b>machine</b> <b>translations</b> as comprehensible and clear enough to indicate whether a more polished human translation was desirable. The reading comprehension test and the judgment of clarity test were found to give more consistent results than an earlier procedure for evaluating translations, since the questions asked in the current series of tests were more precise and limited i...|$|R

40|$|Constructing a {{classifier}} {{that distinguishes}} <b>machine</b> <b>translations</b> from human transla-tions is a promising approach to automati-cally evaluating machine-translated sentences. We developed a classifier {{with this approach}} that distinguishes transla-tions based on word-alignment distribu-tions between source sentences and human/machine translations. We used Support Vector Machines as machine-learning algorithms for this classifier. Our experimental results revealed that our method of evaluation had a weak correla-tion with human evaluations. We further found that our method outperformed well-known automatic-evaluation metrics with respect to correlation with the manual evaluation, {{and that it could}} identify the qualitative characteristics of <b>machine</b> <b>translations,</b> which greatly help improve their quality. ...|$|R
