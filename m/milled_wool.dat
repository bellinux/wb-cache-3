40|$|The {{effect of}} {{moisture}} regain was examined on the stress relaxation for a <b>milled</b> <b>wool</b> serge. The influence of fabric hygral expansion behavior was also investigated on the stress relaxation. The measruement conditions of strain, temperature and moisture regain for stress relaxation were 3. 5 - 15 %, 30 ℃ and 5 - 25 %, respectivery. The {{relation between the}} stress ratio or the apparent stress relaxaton modulus and the relaxation time was discussed. The following results were obtained under these measurement conditions: Fabric stress relaxation depended largely on the weave crimp and moisture regain. The stress relaxation rate was large when moisture regain was high or low. Fabric stress reasxation was closely related with fabric hygral expansion behavior. Apparent hygral expansion increased rapidly in the range until about moisture regain 25 %, then reached the maximum value 1. 3 %...|$|E

5000|$|The term wool alien is {{used for}} any plant species whose {{occurrence}} at a particular site is due to transportation there {{as a result of}} the making of wool products. The most common source of wool aliens is when a plant, seed, or bur attaches to the wool of a sheep or other wool-producing animal prior to shearing. After the animal is shorn and the raw wool is transported to a refinery mill, the impurities are discarded along with the attached seed, which then successfully germinates. [...] Wool aliens are typically found on waste ground near woollen <b>mills.</b> <b>Wool</b> cleanings have also been used as soil conditioners in orchards and fields, which may also contain wool alien species.|$|R

50|$|The river {{formed as}} the last glacier retreated from New England about 12,000 years ago, when glacial melting {{increased}} the sea level and low - lying coastal areas were flooded.

During the 20th century, the Army Corps of Engineers conducted two projects on the river, completed in 1912 and 1943. The first created a large channel (12 feet deep, 200 ft wide) from the river mouth to a former fertilizer company wharf, about one mile (1.6 km) upstream. The second deepened the channel to 15 ft.|$|R
