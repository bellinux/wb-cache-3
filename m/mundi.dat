5|$|Kepler is a {{key figure}} in the 17th-century {{scientific}} revolution. He {{is best known for his}} laws of planetary motion, based on his works Astronomia nova, Harmonices <b>Mundi,</b> and Epitome of Copernican Astronomy. These works also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation.|$|E
5|$|Philippe Herreweghe's 2002 {{recording}} of BWV 243a with Collegium Vocale Gent {{was released by}} Harmonia <b>Mundi</b> in 2003. In 2003 Ton Koopman recorded the Christmas version of Bach's Magnificat with Amsterdam Baroque in the St. Thomas church in Leipzig. A DVD of the recording, which included a performance of Kuhnau's Magnificat with his four Christmas interpolations, and of Bach's German Magnificat BWV 10, was released in 2004. Thomas Hengelbrock's {{recording of}} BWV 243a, with the Balthasar-Neumann-Chor and Ensemble, was released by Deutsche Harmonia <b>Mundi</b> in 2008. In 2009 Philippe Pierlot performed the D major version of the Magnificat with the Ricercar Consort, with five vocal soloists without choir.|$|E
5|$|In 1708, E. Hatton {{recorded}} the inscription below the clock as Ex hoc Momento pendat Eternitas in his New View of London {{and did not}} mention a figure above it. The date 1715 is shown on the clock-case in the 1717 volume of Vitruvius Britannicus, so perhaps indicates the clock had been replaced and the inscription changed to Sic transit gloria <b>mundi</b> as shown here.|$|E
5|$|As Chapter 66 of his On the Reckoning of Time, in 725 Bede {{wrote the}} Greater Chronicle (chronica maiora), which {{sometimes}} circulated {{as a separate}} work. For recent events the Chronicle, like his Ecclesiastical History, relied upon Gildas, upon {{a version of the}} Liber pontificalis current at least to the papacy of Pope Sergius I (687–701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on Eusebius's Chronikoi Kanones. The dating of events in the Chronicle is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the anno <b>mundi.</b>|$|E
5|$|Of Messager's non-operatic works, his Messe des pêcheurs de Villerville, written {{jointly with}} Fauré, has been {{recorded}} by Harmonia <b>Mundi,</b> conducted by Philippe Herreweghe (1989). Messager's other collaboration with Fauré, the Wagner send-up Souvenirs de Bayreuth, {{has been recorded}} by several piano duettists, including Kathryn Stott and Martin Roscoe (1995, Hyperion), and Patrick de Hooge and Pierre-Alain Volondat (2000, Naxos). A suite from Les deux pigeons has been recorded several times, and in 1993 Decca recorded the complete score, with the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera conducted by Richard Bonynge.|$|E
5|$|Other early {{versions}} of the charters survive today. Only one exemplification of the 1216 charter survives, held in Durham Cathedral. Four copies of the 1217 charter exist; three of these are held by the Bodleian Library in Oxford and one by Hereford Cathedral. Hereford's copy is occasionally displayed alongside the Mappa <b>Mundi</b> in the cathedral's chained library and has survived along with a small document called the Articuli super Cartas that was sent along with the charter, telling the sheriff of the county how to observe the conditions outlined in the document. One of the Bodleian's copies was displayed at San Francisco's California Palace of the Legion of Honor in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to running the museum, Nettie {{had a large}} role in running the Master Building as a whole; however, the exact division of responsibilities between Nettie and her husband is unclear. She was secretary of the corporation, although this may have been a nominal position as Louis and his lawyer prepared most of the corporation's correspondence and its filings. She also probably helped her husband decide to provide more than one million dollars toward achieving the Roeriches' spiritual and cultural ambitions. She met with the Roeriches and their other supporters in making plans for the Roerich Museum, Master Institute, Corona <b>Mundi,</b> and the other organizations housed in the Master Building. She was active as president of the Roerich Society and, after its demise, directed the Riverside Museum for many years.|$|E
5|$|Nikki, meanwhile, is {{determined}} to catch the actual thieves and bring forth the truth. After meeting Loudon, Nikki cons him into taking her shopping. After taking a Rolls Royce into Harlem to buy a gun– and nearly being arrested during a police raid– she explains her story to Loudon who believes that she is innocent, and decides to help her. She's also {{on the run from}} a pimp named Raoul (Coati <b>Mundi)</b> and his lackey Benny (Dennis Burkley), the people who killed Johnny. Only after dangling off a car smashed through the top floor of a parking garage, does he tell her the bank and the box number of Nikki's slain boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The first Penrose tiling (tiling P1 below) is an {{aperiodic}} set of six prototiles, {{introduced by}} Roger Penrose in a 1974 paper, {{but it is}} based on pentagons rather than squares. Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but Johannes Kepler showed, in his 1619 work Harmonices <b>Mundi,</b> that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams (star polygons), decagons and related shapes. Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of Albrecht Dürer. Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules (which can be imposed by decorations of the edges) for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. His tiling {{can be viewed as a}} completion of Kepler's finite Aa pattern.|$|E
5|$|The first astrological book {{published}} in Europe was the Liber Planetis et <b>Mundi</b> Climatibus ("Book of the Planets and Regions of the World"), which appeared between 1010 and 1027 AD, {{and may have}} been authored by Gerbert of Aurillac. Ptolemy's second century AD Tetrabiblos was translated into Latin by Plato of Tivoli in 1138. The Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas followed Aristotle in proposing that the stars ruled the imperfect 'sublunary' body, while attempting to reconcile astrology with Christianity by stating that God ruled the soul. The thirteenth century mathematician Campanus of Novara is said to have devised a system of astrological houses that divides the prime vertical into 'houses' of equal 30° arcs, though the system was used earlier in the East. The thirteenth century astronomer Guido Bonatti wrote a textbook, the Liber Astronomicus, a copy of which King Henry VII of England owned {{at the end of the}} fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The panels contain {{quotations}} in Latin {{from several}} biblical texts. They appear either as lettering seemingly sewn into {{the edges of}} the figures' clothes (mostly hidden in the folds), or directly {{on the surface of the}} central inner panel. The latter occur in four instances; two pairs of text float on either side of Christ, two around Michael. Beneath the lily, in white paint are the words of Christ: VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI POSSIDETE PARATUM VOBIS REGNUM A CONSTITUTIONE <b>MUNDI</b> ("Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world"). The text beneath the sword reads: DISCEDITE A ME MALEDICTI IN IGNEM ÆTERNUM QUI PARATUS EST DIABOLO ET ANGELIS EJUS ("Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels").|$|E
5|$|Who's That Girl: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is {{the first}} soundtrack album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records to promote the film of the same name. It also contains songs by her label mates Scritti Politti, Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, Coati <b>Mundi</b> and Michael Davidson. The soundtrack is credited as a Madonna album, despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album. After the commercial success of her film Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Madonna wanted to act in another comedy film titled Slammer, about a woman named Nikki Finn who was falsely accused of homicide. However, due to the critical and commercial failure of her adventure film Shanghai Surprise (1986), Warner Bros. were initially reluctant to green light the project, but later agreed, after Madonna convinced them and also {{because they wanted to}} cash in on Madonna's success with soundtracks.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Huntingdon, {{the medieval}} chronicler, {{wrote a letter}} {{entitled}} De contemptu <b>mundi</b> where he related a story from right before Bloet's death that Bloet felt he had fallen from King Henry's favour. Bloet allegedly told Huntingdon that the bishop had lost two lawsuits. However, the whole letter is concerned with setting out examples of prominent men who suffered a fall from grace, so possible bias on Huntingdon's part must be kept in mind. There are also records of two legal proceedings involving Bloet {{at the end of}} Bloet's life, and although Bloet lost both cases, neither was a loss of much income or prestige. In one, he was allowed to continue to hold the property, although instead of it being judged as his land alone, the settlement was that Bloet held it of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury. The other lawsuit involved Bloet's attempt to hold a manor free of dues owed to Westminster Abbey, which was settled in the Abbey's favour, although Bloet continued to hold the land. Nor is there any lessening of the rate of Bloet's witnessing to royal documents. It appears that Bloet's lost lawsuits were decided by other royal justices, and while he may have lost some favour with the king, he did not fall completely out of favour either.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than half}} the pages in the atlas are maps. The title page shows King Atlas holding a globe, not {{supporting}} it, then the portrait of Mercator, a dedication to the Dukes of Cleves (father and son), a eulogy on the portrait, two epitaphs, the biography by Ghim, another epitaph by his grandson, two 'testimonial' letters, an ode on King Atlas by a grandson and Mercators own genealogy of Atlas in which he outlines his intended plans {{for the rest of}} the atlas: a description of the creation events, then a description of all that was created in the heavens (astronomy and astrology) and finally a description of the Earth, its geography. Of this grandiose plan all that was completed were the first and last objectives. The first part of the atlas, De <b>mundi</b> creatione ac fabrica liber (The creation of the world and the structure of the book), consists of 27 pages of text on the theology of creation, the events of creation, the elements created (such as animals, plants, sun, moon, stars, man), the Fall of Man and finally the salvation of creation through Christ.|$|E
25|$|Mappa <b>mundi</b> are the Medieval European {{maps of the}} world. Approximately 1,100 mappae <b>mundi</b> {{are known}} to have survived from the Middle Ages. Of these, some 900 are found {{illustrating}} manuscripts and the remainder exist as stand-alone documents.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been speculated by Georges Declercq that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a {{calendar}} based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world. At the time, it was believed by some that the Resurrection {{and end of the}} world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old Anno <b>Mundi</b> calendar theoretically commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Old Testament. It was believed that, based on the Anno <b>Mundi</b> calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno <b>Mundi</b> calendar marking the end of the world. Anno <b>Mundi</b> 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the resurrection {{and the end of the}} world but this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius.|$|E
