Two flow {{models are}} proposed, one each for {{vertical and horizontal}} tube orientation. The limits of each flow regime were determined and heat transfer correlations obtained.

The {{density of}} the binary mixture 40 / 60 wt% of <b>monochlorodifluoromethane</b> (HCFC 22) and 1 -chloro- 1, 1 -difluoroethane (HCFC 142 b) in the liquid phase, has been {{measured}} between 300 and 370 K and pressures up to 19 MPa, with an oscillating fork sendimeter, operating in a relative mode.

40|$|ABSTRACT Refrigeration repair {{workers may}} be {{intermittently}} exposed to fluorocarbons and their thermal decomposition products. A case of peripheral neuropathy (distal axonopathy) in a commer-cial refrigeration repairman prompted an epidemiological {{investigation of the}} health of refrigeration repair workers. No additional cases of peripheral neuropathy were identified among the 27 refrig-eration repair workers studied. A reference group of 14 non-refrigeration repair workers was also studied. No differences were noted between groups for the ulnar (motor and sensory), median (motor and sensory), peroneal, sural, or tibial nerve conduction velocities. Refrigeration repair workers reported palpitations and lightheadedness significantly more often than workers in the reference group. No clinical neurological or electroneurophysiological abnormalities were detected in eight refrigeration repair workers followed up for three years during continuous employment. Fluorocarbons are used in industry as refrigerants, solvents, and propellants. In the refrigeration industry three widely used fluorocarbons are dichlorodifluoromethane (Fluorocarbon 12, FC 12), <b>monochlorodifluoromethane</b> (Fluorocarbon 22, F...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} rapid {{freezing}} in supercooled Freon 22 (<b>monochlorodifluoromethane)</b> followed by cryoultramicrotomy is described and shown to yield ultrathin sections {{in which both}} the cellular ultrastructure {{and the distribution of}} diffusible ions across the cell membrane are preserved and intracellular compartmentalization of diffusible ions can be quantitated. Quantitative electron probe analysis (Shuman, H., A. V. Somlyo, and A. P. Somlyo. 1976. Ultramicros. 1 : 317 - 339.) of freeze-dried ultrathin cryo sections was found to provide a valid measure of the composition of cells and cellular organelles and was used to determine the ionic composition of the in situ terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the distribution of C 1 in skeletal muscle, and the effects of hypertonic solutions on the subcellular composition of striated muscle. There was no evidence of sequestered C 1 in the terminal cisternae of resting muscles, although calcium (66 mmol/kg dry wt-+ 4. 6 SE) was detected. The values of [C 1]l determined with small (50 - 100 nm) diameter probes over cytoplasm excluding organelles and over nuclei or terminal cisternae were not significantly different. Mitochondria partially excluded C 1, with a cytoplasmic/ mitochondrial C 1 ratio of 2. 4 -+ 0. 88 SD. The elemental concentrations (mmol/kg dry wt-+ SD) of muscle fibers measured with 0. 5 - 9 -/zm diameter electron probes in normal frog striated muscl...|$|E

Quantitative electron probe analysis (Shuman, H., A. V. Somlyo, and A. P. Somlyo. 1976. Ultramicros. 1 : 317 - 339.) of freeze-dried ultrathin cryto sections was found to provide a valid measure of the composition of cells and cellular organelles and was used to determine the ionic composition of the in situ terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the distribution of CI in skeletal muscle, and the effects of hypertonic solutions on the subcellular composition if striated muscle. There was no evidence of sequestered CI in the terminal cisternae of resting muscles, although calcium (66 mmol/kg dry wt +/- 4. 6 SE) was detected. The values of [C 1](i) determined with small (50 - 100 nm) diameter probes over cytoplasm excluding organelles over nuclei or terminal cisternae were not significantly different. Mitochondria partially excluded C 1, with a cytoplasmic/ mitochondrial Ci ratio of 2. 4 +/- 0. 88 SD. The elemental concentrations (mmol/kg dry wt +/- SD) of muscle fibers measured with 0. 5 - 9 -μm diameter electron probes in normal frog striated muscle were: P, 302 +/- 4. 3; S, 189 +/- 2. 9;C 1, 24 +/- 1. 1;K, 404 +/- 4. 3, and Mg, 39 +/- 2. 1. It is concluded that: (a) in normal muscle the "excess CI" measured with previous bulk chemical analyses and flux studies is not compartmentalized in the SR or in other cellular organelles, and (b) the cytoplasmic C 1 in low [K](0) solutions exceeds that predicted by a passive electrochemical distribution. Hypertonic 2. 2 X NaCl, 2. 5 X sucrose, or 2. 2 X Na isethionate produced: (a) swollen vacuoles, frequently paired, adjacent to the Z lines and containing significantly higher than cytoplasmic concentrations of Na and Cl or S (isethionate), but no detectable Ca, and (b) granules of Ca, Mg, and P = approximately (6 Ca + 1 Mg) / 6 P in the longitudinal SR. It is concluded that hypertonicity produces compartmentalized domains of extracellular solutes within the muscle fibers and translocates Ca into the longitudinal tubules...|$|E
