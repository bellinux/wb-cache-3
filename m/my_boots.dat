500|$|In June 2013, May {{signed for}} Conference South side Ebbsfleet United. On joining Ebbsfleet, May said — [...] "It's all {{exciting}} stuff; Steve Brown showed {{an interest in}} signing {{me as soon as}} he knew he would be manager of Ebbsfleet. I’m currently enjoying a nice little break from football but I’m itching to lace <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> up and get back on the pitch". He eventually left the club in January 2015.|$|E
500|$|Borland {{is known}} for {{performing}} in costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits, and painted as a skeleton and {{what he describes as}} a [...] "burnt match". Describing the character, he stated, [...] "I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> on, and I paint my whole head black—from the neck up—and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth." [...] Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series Babylon 5.|$|E

500|$|The {{death of}} Mara in February 1959 {{unsettled}} Bell and he experienced {{a heart attack}} later that month. He converted to Catholicism {{in the summer of}} 1959 because of the lifelong urging of his wife, Mara's death, and his enduring friendship with Rooney, a practicing Catholic. Bell was advised by his doctor to avoid going to football games, to which he quipped, [...] "I'd rather die watching football than in my bed with <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> off." [...] Bell and his children attended an Eagles game at Franklin Field on October 11, 1959. The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to watch the game, but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the other fans. Sitting behind the end zone during the fourth quarter of the game, he suffered a heart attack and died later that day.|$|E
500|$|Shaw Jeffrey was {{the first}} known witness of what was later deemed to be paranormal {{activity}} at Borley Rectory. In 1885 he spent time at the rectory with his friend Henry [...] "Harry" [...] Bull with whom he was studying at Oxford, during which he experienced [...] "lots of small adventures at the Rectory. Stones falling about, <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> found {{on top of the}} wardrobe, etc." [...] He also stated that he had seen the nun who was reputed to haunt the rectory several times and had often heard the ghostly coach during the night. In his view, however, the most striking of the phenomena, which he later recounted to the researcher and author on the subject Harry Price, was the loss of a French dictionary which was later thrown on the floor of his bedroom in the night.|$|E
500|$|McCall {{was picked}} for England and Scotland under-21 sides {{on the same}} day in 1984, and chose to join the England under-21 squad for their game against Turkey. However he was only picked as a {{substitute}} and the referee blew the final whistle, with McCall waiting to come on. He later told Scottish newspaper Glasgow Herald, [...] "I felt it was a mistake almost from the start. I was put on the bench and they tried to bring me on with a minute to go. But I took my time re-tying <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> and generally warming up and luckily didn't get on, otherwise that would have been that." [...] Since he had not actually played for England, McCall was still eligible for Scotland. He eventually switched allegiances to the latter, for whom he qualified through his father. He made his Scotland debut at under-21 level in March 1988, ironically against England. McCall made one more appearance for Scotland under 21s, against France in 1990.|$|E

500|$|Trumble's last cricketing tour of England was in 1902, with Darling {{returning}} to captain the Australian team. Early in the tour, Trumble broke his thumb at practice, {{causing him to}} miss {{the first month of}} the English season. Despite this, when he returned for the final three Tests he took 26wickets. In the [...] at Old Trafford, Trumble took 10wickets. This included 6wickets in the second innings when he combined with Jack Saunders to bowl England out for 120; securing an Australian victory by 3runs. Trumble, recalling his final over of the match, said [...] "With the ball greasy [...] and <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> unable to get a proper foothold on slippery turf, it was the most trying over I ever bowled." [...] In the [...] at The Oval, Trumble made 64runs in the first innings and followed this with 8wickets for 65runs in the English first innings. He took another 4wickets in the English second innings, but this was not sufficient to prevent an English victory by one wicket. Darling bowled Trumble unchanged from the Pavilion end throughout both innings of the match. [...] Wisden praised Trumble's bowling saying [...] "Trumble, paying us his fifth visit, bowled perhaps better than ever", but remarked that [...] "it must be said that the wet weather and soft wickets were all in his favour" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{chorus of}} [...] "Workingman's Blues" [...] {{features}} the line, [...] "Meet {{me at the}} bottom, don't lag behind, bring me <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> and shoes." [...] The unusual phrasing {{appears to have been}} borrowed from cool jazz singer June Christy's 1946 song [...] "June's Blues", which contains the words, [...] "Meet me in the bottom, bring me <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> and shoes". Dylan has shown an affinity for Christy's music, and played a number of her songs throughout the course of his Theme Time Radio Hour XM program. The line also appears as [...] "Meet me in the bottom, bring me my running shoes", in the Willie Dixon song [...] "Down in the Bottom" [...] (itself an adaptation of [...] "Rollin' and Tumblin' [...] "), recorded by Howlin' Wolf. A similar variant appears in Big Joe Williams' song [...] "Meet Me Around the Corner" [...] ("Meet me around the corner, bring me <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> and shoes").|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} Heartbreak & Triumph, Michaels states [...] "It was about seven o'clock when I {{walked into the}} locker room. There {{were only a few}} people in there and none were close to Earl. He was putting on his referee gear and I started to put <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> on. 'Earl, I need you to listen to me very carefully.' I was {{speaking}} very softly. 'We are doing a big swerve tonight. I am going to get Bret in the Sharpshooter and I need you to ring the bell.'"

2500|$|In 2008, Ramsay was in Iceland's Westman Islands {{filming a}} puffin hunting segment {{when he lost}} his footing and fell during a descent off an [...] cliff, landing in the icy water below. He said, [...] "I thought I was a goner." [...] He reached {{the surface of the}} water by {{removing}} his heavy boots and waterproof clothing. His film crew, who rescued Ramsay by throwing him a rope, reported that he was submerged for at least 45 seconds. During the ordeal, he remembers how he felt: [...] "I was panicking and my lungs were filling with water. When I got to the top after getting <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> off, I was dazed and my head was totally massive." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first West End revival {{was at the}} Apollo Theatre in 1944 {{starring}} John Clements and Kay Hammond. Googie Withers {{took over}} as Amanda during the run. [...] Over the years, the play has been revived on Broadway six times. [...] The first of these, in 1948, starred Tallulah Bankhead as Amanda and Donald Cook as Elyot, with Barbara Baxley as Sybil and William Langford as Victor, in a production directed by Martin Manulis at the Plymouth Theatre, where it ran for 248 performances. The production toured all but three states of the U.S., and grossed more than $1.5 million. Coward {{went to see the}} production [...] "with my heart in <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> and was very pleasantly surprised ... her vitality was amazing, and, strange to say, she played the love scene quite beautifully." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of his sentence, Williams maintained his innocence regarding the four murders, alleging prosecutorial misconduct, exclusion of exculpatory evidence, ineffective assistance of counsel, biased jury selection, and the misuse of jailhouse and government informants. [...] Williams claimed that the police found [...] "not a shred of tangible evidence, no fingerprints, no crime scenes of bloody boot prints. They didn't match <b>my</b> <b>boots,</b> nor eyewitnesses. Even the shotgun shells found conveniently at each crime scene didn't match the shotgun shells that I owned." [...] However, the prosecution's firearms expert, a sheriff's deputy, testified during trial that the shotgun shell recovered from the Yang murder crime scene matched test shells from the shotgun owned by Stanley Williams. No second examiner verified his findings. The defense claims this expert's methodology was [...] "junk science at best." ...|$|E

I was standing in ice cold water {{up to the top}} of <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> all the time, and rowing continuously for nearly five hours. We took off about fifteen more people who were standing on a capsized boat. In all, our boat had by that time sixty-five or sixty-six people. There was no room to sit down in our boat, so we all stood, except some sitting along the side.|$|E
2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and <b>my</b> <b>boots</b> are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
