5|$|Polonium was {{discovered}} in 1898 by <b>Marie</b> <b>and</b> Pierre Curie, when it was extracted from uranium ore and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: {{it was the first}} element to be so discovered.

Polonium has few applications, and those are related to its radioactivity: heaters in space probes, antistatic devices, and sources of neutrons and alpha particles. Polonium's intense radioactivity makes it dangerously toxic.|$|E

5|$|After {{being drafted}} to the SmackDown brand {{as part of}} the 2016 WWE draft which took place on 19 July, Lynch made her first {{appearance}} for the brand on 26 July, defeating Natalya before being confronted by the brand female talents. On the 16 August episode of SmackDown Live, Lynch teamed with Carmella in a successful victory against Alexa Bliss and Natalya, after a distraction provided by Eva <b>Marie</b> <b>and</b> Naomi. It was later announced a six-woman tag team match for SummerSlam between Lynch, Carmella and Naomi against Bliss, <b>Marie</b> <b>and</b> Natalya, but following Marie's suspension on 18 August, her place was taken by the returning Nikki Bella, and Lynch's team would ultimately lose the match at evet on 21 August. At Backlash on 11 September, Lynch won a six-pack elimination challenge by last eliminating Carmella to become the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion, marking her first title victory in WWE. Lynch's first title defense against Alexa Bliss was scheduled for No Mercy on 9 October, but the match was postponed due to Lynch suffering a legitimate out-of-ring injury. The match was rescheduled for the 8 November episode of SmackDown Live, where Lynch successfully defended the title, albeit in controversial fashion (the referee did not see Bliss' foot on the rope when she submitted to her finishing maneuver, the Dis-arm-her). Lynch was a part of Team SmackDown at Survivor Series on 20 November, where she was the last woman from the team to be eliminated during the traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match.|$|E
5|$|And {{where in}} modern {{dramatic}} literature can such pearls be matched—Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love {{she had always}} been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he is to be a father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; <b>Marie</b> <b>and</b> Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves' song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven....

5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, {{but by the end of}} the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by <b>Marie</b> <b>and</b> unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|Curium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Cm and atomic number 96.

The discovery was kept secret and only {{released to the public}} in November 1945. Most curium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 20grams of curium.|$|E
