40|$|<b>Spare</b> <b>Rib</b> {{became part}} of my {{developing}} feminist consciousness and its effect was considerable. Only in retrospect can I see the long-lasting relevance of this iconic publication to my teaching career {{and its impact on}} a personal worldview that is still unfolding. <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib</b> foregrounded empowerment of women, recognised tensions and published politically focussed debates. It neither carried the message that feminism is not a monolith nor located to any one group or location. <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib</b> set itself up as a dialogical space for women’s liberation with all its inherent power differences and became for me, a key monthly update on the living reality of feminist politics...|$|R

40|$|When <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib</b> first {{launched}} in July 1972, its glossy pages promised to ‘put women’s liberation on the newsstands’ by spreading ‘new politics through familiar forms’ (Fell 1979 : 2). From editorials exploring how it ‘feels’ to work collectively to letters from readers expressing the emotional toll of discrimination, <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib</b> makes a consistent {{effort to provide}} spaces in which the feelings associated with women’s liberation can be articulated and explored. This article examines {{the extent to which}} affect theory might help to illuminate the virulent discourse of feeling in <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib.</b> Foregrounding the high premium placed on personal testimony, both within the women’s liberation movement and in <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib</b> specifically, it explores a mixed selection of published correspondence and reflective editorials in order to assess how ‘bad feelings’ (Ahmed 2010 a: 50), in particular, might serve as an ‘affective magnet’ around which the politics of feminism can be negotiated and critiqued (Berlant 2008 : 7) ...|$|R
40|$|This is an edited {{conversation}} between {{two generations of}} readers. Lynn Edmonds and Rosie White were reading <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib</b> {{at a time when}} they had little or no direct involvement with feminist activism or other self-identified feminists. Their discussion examined the role of <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib</b> as a form of outreach, information and textual solidarity for feminist women outside the major British cities. For both women, the material in <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib</b> was interesting and often contentious. It represented a feminism borne of the second wave – and was frequently parodied, as in The Viz’s Milly Tant. The discussion begins with general questions about <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib,</b> after which Lynn and Rosie examine a selection of the digital material available via the British Library online in order to reflect upon how their memories of the time compare with the facsimiles in the archive. In this way the chapter examines feminist praxis (‘memory work’) as a means of reflecting upon the impact of this key British feminist periodical...|$|R

The trajectory of <b>Spare</b> <b>Rib</b> charted the rise and demise of the Women’s Liberation Movement and as a consequence is of interest to feminist historians, academics and activists and to those studying social movements and media history".|$|R
