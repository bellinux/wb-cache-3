5|$|Meg {{catches the}} <b>mumps</b> when the Griffins attend Quahog's annual Star Trek convention, because Peter {{forced her to}} stand next to an irresponsible {{attendee}} with <b>mumps</b> to take a picture, believing him to be in costume as an alien. While recovering in bed, Meg becomes a born-again Christian after watching Kirk Cameron on television and begins irritating everyone with her beliefs. Meg is horrified to learn that Brian is an atheist and attempts to convince him to repent and convert to Christianity, but he repeatedly refuses. Finally taking drastic measures, Meg spreads the word of Brian's atheism around Quahog, which generally hates atheists, making him a social outcast.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} November 1915, Sing {{suffered}} from myalgia and was confined to the hospital ship HMHS Gloucester Castle for almost two weeks. During this time, he was conveyed to Malta, then Ismaïlia, Egypt. While in Egypt, he was also hospitalised with parotitis and <b>mumps,</b> but rejoined his unit {{at the end of}} March 1916.|$|E
5|$|The parlous {{state of}} the children's health is {{apparent}} when at one point, 400 were suffering from dysentery, 300 had measles, 200 had typhoid, 200 had diphtheria and another 100 had <b>mumps.</b> Many children were also suffering from scurvy due to the poor diet. Monthly mortality figures were: July– 153; August– 216; September– 67; and October– 8. To these can be added five children who died in hospital in Zagreb, {{for a total of}} 449.|$|E
5|$|Vaccines {{have been}} made using animals since their {{discovery}} by Edward Jenner in the 18th century. He noted that inoculation with live cowpox afforded protection against the more dangerous smallpox. In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur developed an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for rabies. In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases <b>mumps</b> and polio were developed using animal cells grown in vitro.|$|E
5|$|A {{breakthrough}} came in 1948 when {{a research}} group headed by John Enders at the Children's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human {{tissue in the}} laboratory. This group had recently successfully grown <b>mumps</b> in cell culture. In March 1948 Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he noticed {{that there were a}} few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with polio virus and added it to the remaining test tubes, on the off chance that the virus might grow. The varicella cultures failed to grow but the polio cultures were successful.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was kept}} under the strict tutorship of Hansell until almost {{thirteen}} years old. Private tutors taught him German and French. Edward took the examination to enter Osborne Naval College, and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but the prince's father had disagreed. Following {{two years at}} Osborne College, {{which he did not}} enjoy, Edward moved on to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. A course of two years, followed by entry into the Royal Navy, was planned. A bout of <b>mumps</b> may have made him infertile.|$|E
5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, <b>mumps,</b> rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
5|$|He {{contracted}} <b>mumps</b> in September 2009 {{and made}} his return to action against Rushden on 3 October. Young's first goal of 2009–10 came was a close-range finish from a corner on 70 minutes in a 1–0 home win over Wrexham in an FA Trophy first round replay on 15 December 2009. His first league goal of the season came after scoring in a 2–1 victory away to Ebbsfleet United on 16 January 2010 with a header from a Doughty corner. He finished the season with 44 appearances and 6 goals.|$|E
5|$|When old enough, Brunt was {{enrolled}} at Ellesmere College, where his mischievous streak became quickly apparent through pranks and dares; once, {{while in the}} sanatorium with <b>mumps,</b> he slipped a laxative into the matron's tea. Nevertheless, he is fondly remembered at the school. It was {{while he was at}} Ellesmere that he contracted measles, resulting in his need to wear glasses. An enthusiastic sportsman, Brunt played cricket, hockey, rugby, water polo and wrestling. He was the only pupil at the school to tackle the headmaster while playing rugby, injuring the older man's knee in the process.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, <b>mumps</b> and rubella.|$|E
5|$|The men {{arrived in}} Singapore on 18 February 1941 {{and moved into}} barracks at Port Dickson, {{in the north of}} Malaya. While there, the {{battalion}} undertook further training to prepare it for jungle warfare, before moving to Seremban in March. Further drafts of reinforcements arrived during this time as the battalion was brought up to its wartime establishment. The rigours of jungle training and the tropical heat affected the men, and a number of personnel were hospitalised during this time with illnesses such as malaria, measles, <b>mumps</b> and serious tropical skin diseases. Some of these were repatriated back to Australia, {{and by the end of}} March, the 2/18th was still below its authorised establishment, with an actual strength of 898.|$|E
5|$|There are two railway {{stations}} in Wigan town centre. Wigan North Western {{is on the}} electrified north–south West Coast Main Line. Virgin Trains West Coast provides express trains to London Euston, Birmingham, Lancaster, Carlisle, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Northern operated trains to Preston and Blackpool North and a regular local service along the line to St Helens and Liverpool Lime Street. Wigan Wallgate serves lines running east and west from Wigan. Northern operate trains to Southport and Kirkby (with connections to Liverpool Central and the Merseyrail system). Frequent local services also operate (in co-operation with TfGM) to Bolton and Manchester (Victoria and Piccadilly), with most trains from Wigan continuing through to other destinations such as Manchester Airport, Stockport, Rochdale, Huddersfield, Todmorden and (until a line closure in October 2009) Oldham <b>Mumps.</b> Pemberton station serves the Pemberton area of the town.|$|E
5|$|Vaccination is a {{cheap and}} {{effective}} way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before {{the discovery of the}} actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, <b>mumps</b> and rubella. Smallpox infections have been eradicated. Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans, and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or viral proteins (antigens). Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are called attenuated. Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines. These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the <b>mumps</b> vaccine, the <b>mumps</b> virus was the leading cause of viral meningoencephalitis in the United States. However, encephalitis occurs rarely (less than two per 100,000). In one of the largest studies in the literature, the most common symptoms of <b>mumps</b> meningoencephalitis were found to be fever (97 percent), vomiting (94 percent) and headache (88.8 percent). The <b>mumps</b> vaccine was introduced into the United States in December 1967: since its introduction there has been a steady decrease in the incidence of <b>mumps</b> and <b>mumps</b> virus infection. There were 151,209 cases of <b>mumps</b> reported in 1968. From 2001 to 2008, the case average was only 265 per year, excluding an outbreak of less than 6000 cases in 2006 attributed largely to university contagion in young adults.|$|E
25|$|A {{licensed}} {{vaccine to}} prevent measles first became available in 1963, and an improved one in 1968. Vaccines for <b>mumps</b> and rubella became available in 1967 and 1969, respectively. The three vaccines (for <b>mumps,</b> measles, and rubella) were combined in 1971 {{to become the}} measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mumps</b> {{is spread}} {{from person to}} person through contact with {{respiratory}} secretions, such as saliva from an infected person. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets aerosolize and can enter the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person. <b>Mumps</b> can also be spread by sharing eating utensils or cups. The virus can also survive on surfaces and then be spread after contact in a similar manner. A person infected with <b>mumps</b> is contagious from approximately seven days before the onset of symptoms until about eight days after symptoms start. The incubation period (time until symptoms begin) can be from 12–25 days, but is typically 16–18 days. 20-40 percent of persons infected with the <b>mumps</b> virus do not show symptoms, so it is possible to be infected and spread the virus without knowing it.|$|E
25|$|Psychosis {{can even}} be caused by {{familiar}} ailments such as flu or <b>mumps.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Mumps</b> {{is usually}} {{preceded by a}} set of prodromal {{symptoms}} including low-grade fever, headache, and malaise. This is followed by progressive swelling of one or both parotid glands. Parotid gland swelling usually lasts about one week. Other symptoms of <b>mumps</b> can include dry mouth, sore face and/or ears and some patients find it difficult to talk. A vaccine has been available since the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The WHO, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the British Medical Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain {{currently}} recommend {{routine vaccination}} of children against <b>mumps.</b> The British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain had previously recommended against general <b>mumps</b> vaccination, changing that recommendation in 1987.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} reports on {{neurological}} disorders is very small, other than evidence for {{an association between}} a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe <b>mumps</b> strain and rare adverse events of aseptic meningitis, a transient mild form of viral meningitis. The UK National Health Service stopped using the Urabe <b>mumps</b> strain in the early 1990s due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis, and switched to a form using the Jeryl Lynn <b>mumps</b> strain instead. The Urabe strain remains in use {{in a number of}} countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the Jeryl Lynn strain, and a strain with higher efficacy along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have reached}} differing {{conclusions}} regarding {{whether or not}} infection with the <b>mumps</b> virus during pregnancy leads to an increased rate of spontaneous abortion.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Hilleman was {{the most}} {{prolific}} vaccine inventor, developing successful vaccines for measles, <b>mumps,</b> hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, meningitis, pneumonia and 'Haemophilus influenzae'.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mumps</b> is {{preventable}} by two {{doses of}} the <b>mumps</b> vaccine. Most of the developed world includes it in their immunization programs, often in combination with measles, rubella, and varicella vaccine. Countries that have low immunization rates may see an increase in cases among older age groups and thus worse outcomes. There is no specific treatment. Efforts involve controlling symptoms with pain medication such as paracetamol (acetaminophen). Intravenous immunoglobulin {{may be useful in}} certain complications. Hospitalization may be required if meningitis or pancreatitis develops. About one per ten thousand people who are infected die.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} devastating {{diseases}} was smallpox, but other deadly diseases included typhus, measles, influenza, bubonic plague, cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, <b>mumps,</b> yellow fever and pertussis, which were chronic in Eurasia.|$|E
25|$|Facial nerve {{disorders}} may {{stem from}} a myriad of contributing factors: Bell’s palsy, injury resulting from surgical error, trauma to the temporal bone, otitis media, multiple sclerosis, <b>mumps,</b> chicken pox, and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|Before {{vaccination}} approximately 10 {{percent of}} cases of aseptic meningitis were due to <b>mumps.</b> The symptoms would generally resolve within 10 days. Infection of the brain itself (encephalitis) occurs in between 0.02% and 0.3% of cases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mumps</b> is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} <b>mumps</b> virus. Initial signs and {{symptoms}} often include fever, muscle pain, headache, and feeling tired. This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after seven to ten days. Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. About a third of people have mild or no symptoms. Complications may include meningitis (15 percent), pancreatitis (four percent), permanent deafness, and testicular inflammation which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling but this does not increase the risk of infertility.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} human diseases are caused by paramyxoviruses. These include <b>mumps,</b> measles, which caused around 733,000 deaths in 2000, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children.|$|E
25|$|In July 1893, Stimson {{married the}} former Mabel Wellington White, a great-great granddaughter of American {{founding}} father Roger Sherman and {{the sister of}} Elizabeth Selden Rogers. An adult case of <b>mumps</b> had left Stimson infertile {{and they had no}} children.|$|E
25|$|Immunotherapy — Intralesional {{injection}} of antigens (<b>mumps,</b> candida or trichophytin antigens USP) {{is a new}} wart treatment which may trigger a host immune response to the wart virus, resulting in wart resolution. It is now recommended as a second-line therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mumps</b> is {{considered}} most contagious {{in the five}} days after the onset of symptoms, and isolation is recommended during this period. In someone who has been admitted to the hospital, standard and droplet precautions are needed. People who work in healthcare cannot work for five days.|$|E
25|$|The MMR vaccine {{controversy}} {{started with}} the 1998 publication of a fraudulent research paper in The Lancet linking the combined measles, <b>mumps,</b> and rubella (MMR) vaccine to colitis and autism spectrum disorders. The claims in the paper were widely reported, leading to {{a sharp drop in}} vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland and increases in the incidence of measles and <b>mumps,</b> resulting in deaths and serious permanent injuries. Following the initial claims in 1998, multiple large epidemiological studies were undertaken. Reviews of the evidence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences, the UK National Health Service, and the Cochrane Library all found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.|$|E
25|$|During an outbreak, a {{diagnosis}} {{can be made}} by determining recent exposure and parotitis. However, when the disease incidence is low, other infectious causes of parotitis should be considered such as HIV, coxsackievirus, and influenza. Some viruses such as enteroviruses may cause aseptic meningitis that is very clinically similar to <b>mumps.</b>|$|E
25|$|The MMR vaccine (also {{known as}} the MPR vaccine after the Latin names of the diseases) is an {{immunization}} vaccine against measles, <b>mumps,</b> and rubella (German measles). It {{is a mixture of}} live attenuated viruses of the three diseases, administered via injection. It was first developed by Maurice Hilleman while at Merck.|$|E
25|$|Without {{immunization}} about 0.1 {{percent to}} {{one percent of}} the population are affected per year. Widespread vaccination has resulted in a more than 90 percent decline in rates of disease. <b>Mumps</b> is more common in the developing world where vaccination is less common. Outbreaks, however, may still occur in a vaccinated population. Before the introduction of a vaccine, <b>mumps</b> was a common childhood disease worldwide. Larger outbreaks of disease would typically occur every two to five years. Children between the ages of five and nine were most commonly affected. Among immunized populations often those in their early 20s are affected. Around the equator it often occurs all year round while in the more northerly and southerly regions of the world it is more common in the winter and spring. Painful swelling of the parotid glands and testicles was described by Hippocrates in the 5th century BCE.|$|E
25|$|Hormone {{deficiency}} is {{a relatively}} rare cause of erectile dysfunction. In individuals with testicular failure like in Klinefelter syndrome, or those who have had radiation therapy, chemotherapy or childhood exposure to <b>mumps</b> virus, the testes may fail and not produce testosterone. Other hormonal causes of erectile failure include brain tumors, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism or disorders of the adrenal gland.|$|E
