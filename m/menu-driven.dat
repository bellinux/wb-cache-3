500|$|Ann M. Marcus of Electronic Entertainment {{summarized}} Hodj 'n' Podj as [...] "charming", {{and considered}} it an [...] "exquisitely illustrated, hilariously funny medieval romp". Despite some [...] "minor quibbles," [...] she considered the game [...] "a true delight." [...] The reviewer for Next Generation wrote that it [...] "won't appeal to those hungry for action", {{but that it}} was ideal [...] "for laid back fun on a rainy afternoon." [...] In Entertainment Weekly, Bob Strauss summarized, [...] "This impeccable British production is one of those rare CD-ROMs that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults—and its simple <b>menu-driven</b> interface guarantees that you'll keep it on your hard drive long after your other software has vanished." ...|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy IV was lead {{designer}} Takashi Tokita's first {{project at}} Square {{as a full-time}} employee. Before this, Tokita wanted {{a career as a}} theater actor, but working on the game made him decide to become a [...] "great creator" [...] of video games. Initially Hiromichi Tanaka, the main designer of Final Fantasy III, was also involved {{in the development of the}} game. However, Tanaka wanted to create a seamless battle system that had no separate battle screen and was not <b>menu-driven,</b> and since Final Fantasy IV was not going in that direction, he changed development teams to work on the action RPG Secret of Mana instead. The development team of Final Fantasy IV contained 14 people in total, and the game was completed in roughly one year.|$|E
500|$|Combat is {{initiated}} {{when the}} player encounters an enemy, which changes the {{map to the}} [...] "battle screen". The enemy appears at the top, above the current party characters; each battle uses a <b>menu-driven</b> turn-based system. At {{the beginning of each}} turn, the player selects whether to fight or attempt to run. If the fight option is selected, the player selects an action for each party member from his or her equipment or skills to attack, defend, use magic, or use equipped items. Once the player has chosen actions for each player character, the player characters and enemy begin battle. Participants move one at a time determined by their agility statistic. If the player tries the [...] "attempt to run" [...] option and it fails, the party skip their turn and the enemy attacks. Combat ends if the party successfully flees, all enemies are defeated, or all player characters are defeated; in the last case, the game ends and must be reloaded from the last save.|$|E
500|$|Like the Final Fantasy {{games before}} it, Final Fantasy VIII {{consists}} of three main modes of play: the world map, the field map, and the battle screen. The world map is a 3D display in which the player may navigate freely across a small-scale rendering of the game world. Characters travel across the world map {{in a variety of}} ways, including by foot, car, Chocobo, train, and airship. The field map consists of controllable 3D characters overlaid on one or more 2D pre-rendered backgrounds, which represent environmental locations such as towns or forests. The battle screen is a 3D model of a location such as a street or room, where turn-based fights between playable characters and CPU-controlled enemies take place. The interface is <b>menu-driven,</b> as in previous titles, but with the typical weapon and armor systems removed and new features present, such as the Junction system. Also featured is a collectible card-based minigame called [...] "Triple Triad".|$|E
500|$|In most Dragon Quest games, players {{control a}} {{character}} or party of characters that {{can walk into}} towns and buy weapons, armor, and items to defeat monsters outside of the towns: on the world map or in a dungeon. However, in the original Dragon Quest, {{there was only one}} character walking on the map. In most of the games, battles occur through random monster attacks and improving the characters' levels requires players to grind. The series uses cursed items, difficult dungeons where players need to use their resources wisely to complete them, and difficult boss battles. When the party encounters monsters the view switches perspective and players are presented with several options on a menu; these turn-based <b>menu-driven</b> battles have become a staple of the series. Players use the menus to select weapons, magic, and other items used to attack and defeat the monsters, or can attempt to flee the fight; though characters cannot flee during a boss battle. Once the party defeats the monsters by winning the battle, each party member gains experience points in order to reach new levels. When a character gains a new level, the statistics (stats) of the character are upgraded. Winning battles also rewards players with gold which can be used to purchase items. [...] In addition to the experience points and gold awarded for successfully defeating monsters, occasionally, items will be dropped as well that are added to the player's inventory.|$|E
500|$|In Final Fantasy games, players {{command a}} party of {{characters}} as they progress through the game's story by exploring the game world and defeating opponents. Enemies are typically encountered randomly through exploring, a trend which changed in Final FantasyXI and Final FantasyXII. The player issues combat orders—like [...] "Fight", [...] "Magic", and [...] "Item"—to individual characters via a <b>menu-driven</b> interface while engaging in battles. Throughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. Prior to Final FantasyXI, battles were turn-based with the protagonists and antagonists on different sides of the battlefield. Final FantasyIV introduced the [...] "Active Time Battle" [...] (ATB) system that augmented the turn-based nature with a perpetual time-keeping system. Designed by Hiroyuki Ito, it injected urgency and excitement into combat by requiring the player to act before an enemy attacks, and was used until Final FantasyX, which implemented the [...] "Conditional Turn-Based" [...] (CTB) system. This new system returned to the previous turn-based system, but added nuances to offer players more challenge. Final FantasyXI adopted a real-time battle system where characters continuously act depending on the issued command. Final FantasyXII continued this gameplay with the [...] "Active Dimension Battle" [...] system. Final Fantasy XIIIs combat system, designed by {{the same man who}} worked on X, was meant to have an action-oriented feel, emulating the cinematic battles in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The latest installment to the franchise, Final Fantasy XV, introduces a new [...] "Open Combat" [...] system. Unlike previous battle systems in the franchise, the [...] "Open Combat" [...] system (OCS) allows players to take on a fully active battle scenario, allowing for free range attacks and movement, giving a much more fluid feel of combat. This system also incorporates a [...] "Tactical" [...] Option during battle, which pauses active battle to allow use of items.|$|E
2500|$|The {{operating}} system is object-based. [...] Features include a RDBMS (DB2/400), a <b>menu-driven</b> interface, support for multiple users, block-oriented terminal support (IBM 5250), and printers. [...] It supports security, communications, and web-based applications {{which can be}} executed inside the optional IBM WebSphere Application Server or as PHP/MySQL applications inside a native port of the Apache web server.|$|E
2500|$|Although Btrieve {{was fairly}} popular, {{it was an}} API {{database}} engine. The killer-app database manager on the PC, dBase II and its successors, were database management systems (DBMS) {{which could be used}} either as a free-standing, general-purpose application, or a database programming language. Btrieve was also more expensive than dBase, although run-time licensing was free of charge. Btrieve grew to a developer base of over 5,000 users and was widely used in the financial area. The company took some time to create a user-interface for the product, however in 1984 they released Xtrieve, a <b>menu-driven</b> program that used a new [...]DDF data dictionary to enforce relational database rules.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} role-playing video game on a microcomputer was Dungeon n Dragons, written by Peter Trefonas and published by CLOAD (1980). This early game, published for a TRS-80 Model 1, was just 16K long and included a limited word parser command line, character generation, a store to purchase equipment, combat, traps to solve, and a dungeon to explore. Other contemporaneous CRPGs (Computer Role Playing Games) were Temple of Apshai, [...] and , the precursor to Ultima. Some early microcomputer RPGs (such as Telengard (1982) or Sword of Fargoal) were based on their mainframe counterparts, while others (such as Ultima or Wizardry, the most successful of the early CRPGs) were loose adaptations of D. They also included both first-person displays and overhead views, sometimes in the same game (Akalabeth, for example, used both perspectives). Most of the key features of RPGs were developed in this early period, prior {{to the release of}} , one of the prime influences on both computer and console RPG development. For example, Wizardry featured <b>menu-driven</b> combat, Tunnels of Doom featured tactical combat on a special [...] "combat screen", and Dungeons of Daggorath featured real-time combat which took place on the main dungeon map.|$|E

5000|$|RATS can be run {{interactive}}ly, or {{in batch}} mode. In the interactive mode, the user can run existing programs, or perform new tasks either by using <b>menu-driven</b> [...] "wizards" [...] or by typing in commands directly (or {{a combination of}} both approaches). The <b>menu-driven</b> wizards automatically generate the corresponding commands, allowing users to interactively construct complete programs that can be saved and re-run later.|$|E
50|$|The PC {{operates}} on a Windows NT-based, <b>menu-driven</b> user interface, which makes operating the BFSR extremely simple.|$|E

50|$|Command-line {{interfaces}} {{to computer}} operating systems are less widely used by casual computer users, who favor {{graphical user interfaces}} or <b>menu-driven</b> interaction.|$|E
50|$|TSO {{interacts with}} users {{in either a}} line-by-line mode or in a full screen, <b>menu-driven</b> mode. In the line-by-line mode, the user enters {{commands}} by typing them in at the keyboard; in turn, the system interprets the commands, and then displays responses on the terminal screen. But most mainframe interaction is actually via ISPF, which allows for customized <b>menu-driven</b> interaction. This combination is called TSO/ISPF. TSO can also provide a Unix-style environment on OS/390 and z/OS via the UNIX System Services command shell, with or without ISPF.|$|E

50|$|The HP-28C and HP-28S {{were two}} {{graphing}} calculators produced by Hewlett-Packard from 1986 to 1992. The HP-28C {{was the first}} handheld calculator capable of solving equations symbolically.They were replaced by the HP 48 series of calculators, which grew from the <b>menu-driven</b> RPL programming language interface first introduced in these HP-28 series.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the {{underlying}} gameplay, {{not a great deal}} had been changed since the original Championship Manager. The look and feel had been improved but it was still very much a text-based, <b>menu-driven</b> game and the user interface was almost identical to previous games, albeit at a much higher resolution.|$|E
50|$|The default PRO-3xx {{operating}} system was DEC's Professional Operating System (P/OS), {{a modified version}} of RSX-11M with a <b>menu-driven</b> core user interface. Industry critics complained that this user interface was awkward, slow, and inflexible, offering few advantages over the command-line based MS-DOS user interface that was coming into widespread use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Menu-driven</b> designs. These {{still may}} feature a main loop, {{but are not}} usually thought of as event driven in the usual sense.
