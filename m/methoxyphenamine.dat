50|$|<b>Methoxyphenamine</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} at the Upjohn company by Woodruff and co-workers. A later synthesis by Heinzelman, {{from the same}} company, corrects the m.p. given for <b>methoxyphenamine</b> hydrochloride in the earlier paper, and describes an improved synthetic procedure, as well as resolution of the racemic <b>methoxyphenamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Methoxyphenamine</b> (trade names ASMI, Euspirol, Orthoxine, Ortodrinex, Proasma), {{also known}} as 2-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine (OMMA), is a β-adrenergic {{receptor}} agonist of the amphetamine class used as a bronchodilator.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Methoxy{{amphetamine}} (2-MA), {{also known}} as ortho-methoxyamphetamine (OMA), is a drug of the amphetamine class. It is substantially weaker in inhibiting the reuptake of and inducing {{the release of the}} monoamine neurotransmitters compared to related agents such as amphetamine, MMA, and PMA, and may instead act as a β-adrenergic receptor agonist similarly to its N-methylated analogue <b>methoxyphenamine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... (c) any {{compound}} (not being <b>methoxyphenamine</b> or {{a compound}} {{for the time}} being specified in sub-paragraph (a) above) structurally derived from phenethylamine an N-alkylphenethylamine, a methylphenethylamine, an N-alkyl-α-methylphenethylamine, an ethylphenethylamine, or an N-alkyl-α-ethylphenethylamine by substitution in the ring to any extent with alkyl, alkoxy, alkylenedioxy or halide substituents, whether or not further substituted in the ring by one or more other univalent substituents.|$|E
50|$|Substituted amphetamines are a {{class of}} {{compounds}} based upon the amphetamine structure; it includes all derivative compounds which are formed by replacing, or substituting, one or more hydrogen atoms in the amphetamine core structure with substituents. The compounds in this class span a variety of pharmacological subclasses, including stimulants, empathogens, and hallucinogens, among others. Examples of substituted amphetamines are amphetamine (itself), methamphetamine, ephedrine, cathinone, phentermine, mephentermine, bupropion, <b>methoxyphenamine,</b> selegiline, amfepramone, pyrovalerone, MDMA (ecstasy), and DOM (STP).|$|E
40|$|Until {{about thirty}} years ago, the extract of adrenal medulla (epinephrine) {{was the only}} {{available}} sympathomimetic bronchodilator. The major limitations in its clinical use {{for the treatment of}} bronchial asthma have been its ineffectiveness by the oral route and its powerful stimulant action on the cardiovascular system. Five other sympathomimetic amines have been introduced to obviate the undesirable features of epinephrine. Such drugs are as follows: ephedrine and its optical isomer, pseudoephedrine (see refs. cited by Chen and Schmidt, 1930; and by Chopra et al., 1931), isoproterenol (see refs. cited by Lands, 1949), <b>methoxyphenamine</b> (Graham and Kuizenga, 1948) and isoprophenamine (Powell et al., 1956). Their chemical structures a. re as follows...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 12 {{sympathomimetic}} amines was studied on the guinea pid tracheal chain preparation. All of the compounds, except methoxamine, produced some relaxation {{of the normal}} tracheal chain preparation and this relaxation was blocked by propranolol. For those compounds which had no hydroxyl groups in their structure this relaxation was due to release of noradrenaline since it was absent on preparations from reserpinized animals. Compounds {{with two or three}} hydroxyl groups had potent activity directly on β-receptors. As the concentration of amine was increased contractions of the trachea were observed with all of the compounds except ethylnoradrenaline, corbasil, nylidrin and isoxsuprine. These contractions were antagonized by α-receptor blocking drugs. Another type of relaxation which was not blocked by propranolol was observed with most of the drugs at still higher concentrations. There was considerable overlap in the concentration ranges producing these three types of response. Ephedrine, methoxamine and <b>methoxyphenamine</b> were found to possess β-receptor blocking activity...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} by survey whether {{the frequency of}} use of performance enhancing drugs (drug doping) is significant in elite players of Australian Rules football, and to compare this frequency with that in other competitions. METHODS: Randomised unannounced prospective urine testing during the period 1990 - 95 of players from the Australian Football League out of competition, in competition matches, and in finals matches; testing was performed according to Olympic International Committee protocols and standards. The players' identities and clubs were unknown during testing. RESULTS: Of 900 random urine tests, no positive results were obtained for anabolic steroids, diuretics, caffeine, or peptide hormones. Five positive results (0. 6 %) were obtained-for pseudoephedrine in two instances, and for probenecid, <b>methoxyphenamine,</b> and dextropropoxyphene in one instance each. Each were inadvertent medical doping and declared before testing. CONCLUSIONS: Drug doping {{is not a problem}} in the Australian Football League. This is probably because no doping method is considered to be of value to Australian Rules football, because an educational programme is run by football authorities, and because random during season and out of season testing for drugs occurs...|$|E
40|$|Pediveliger larvae of Mytilus galloprovincialis were {{subjected}} {{to a series of}} bioassays to investigate the induction of metamorphosis using neuroactive compounds, K(+), NH(4) (+) and organic solvents. Growth and survival of post-larvae obtained using ethanol and methanol were also observed. Epinephrine, phenylephrine, clonidine and metanephrine induced larval metamorphosis at 10 (- 6) to 10 (- 4) M in both 24 -h and continuous exposure assays. In 24 -h exposure assays, alpha-methyldopa at 5 x 10 (- 5) M and <b>methoxyphenamine</b> at 5 x 10 (- 5) - 10 (- 4) M induced 55 - 94 % metamorphosis. Similarly, excess K(+) at 3 x 10 (- 2) M induced 39 % metamorphosis and NH(4) (+) at 1 - 5 x 10 (- 2) M induced 63 - 78 % metamorphosis. The EC 50 s of seven organic solvents ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 82 M. Post-larvae that metamorphosed using ethanol and methanol survived as juveniles and grew {{at the same rate as}} those from microbial biofilm. Thus, the above compounds can be useful inducers of metamorphosis for antifouling studies using larvae and juveniles of M. galloprovincialis...|$|E
