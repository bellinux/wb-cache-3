25|$|Aside from prohormones and {{testosterone}} undecanoate, {{almost all}} orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. A few AAS {{that are not}} 17α-alkylated are orally active. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers <b>mepitiostane,</b> mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). As these AAS are not 17α-alkylated, they show minimal potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mepitiostane,</b> {{also known}} as {{epitiostanol}} 17β-(1-methoxy)cyclopentyl ether, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of DHT. It is the C17β (1-methoxy)cyclopentyl ether of epitiostanol, which itself is 2α,3α-epithio-DHT or 2α,3α-epithio-5α-androstan-17β-ol. A related AAS is methylepitiostanol (17α-methylepitiostanol), which is an orally active variant of epitiostanol similarly to <b>mepitiostane,</b> though also has a risk of hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mepitiostane</b> shows a {{high rate}} of virilizing side effects such as acne, hirsutism, and voice changes in women.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mepitiostane</b> is {{described}} as similar to tamoxifen as an antiestrogen, and through its active form epitiostanol, binds directly to and antagonizes the ER. It is also an AAS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mepitiostane</b> {{is used as}} an {{antiestrogen}} and antineoplastic {{agent in}} the treatment of breast cancer. It has also been found to be effective {{in the treatment of}} gynecomastia.|$|E
50|$|Methylepitiostanol, {{also known}} as 2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-4,5α-dihydrotestosterone (2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-DHT) or as 2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol, is a {{synthetic}} androstane steroid and a 17α-alkylated derivative of DHT. It {{is closely related to}} epitiostanol (2α,3α-epithio-DHT) and <b>mepitiostane</b> (epitiostanol 17-methyloxycyclopentyl ether).|$|E
50|$|A prodrug of epitiostanol, <b>mepitiostane,</b> {{which is}} also marketed for the {{treatment}} of breast cancer, is reported to show a high rate of virilizing side effects such as acne, hirsutism, and voice changes in women.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mepitiostane</b> (brand name Thioderon) is an orally active steroidal {{antiestrogen}} and anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) of the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) {{group which}} is marketed in Japan as an antineoplastic {{agent for the}} treatment of breast cancer. It is a prodrug of epitiostanol. The drug was patented and described in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mepitiostane</b> {{is used as}} an {{antiestrogen}} and antineoplastic {{agent in}} the treatment of breast cancer. It is also used as an AAS {{in the treatment of}} anemia of renal failure. A series of case reports have found it to be effective in the treatment of an estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent meningiomas as well.|$|E
50|$|Epitiostanol, {{also known}} as 2α,3α-epithio-4,5α-dihydrotestosterone (2α,3α-epithio-DHT) or as 2α,3α-epithio-5α-androstan-17β-ol, is a {{synthetic}} androstane steroid and a derivative of DHT. <b>Mepitiostane,</b> a derivative of epitiostanol with a C17α methoxycyclopentane ether substitution, is an orally active prodrug of epitiostanol. Another derivative, methylepitiostanol (2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol), has a methyl group at the C17α position and is similarly an orally active variant of epitiostanol; it has surfaced as a novel designer steroid.|$|E
50|$|Methylepitiostanol (online product names Epistane, Hemapolin, Havoc, Epi Plex) is an orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) of the {{dihydrotestosterone}} (DHT) {{group which}} was first {{described in the}} literature in 1974 but was never marketed. It is the 17α-methylated derivative of epitiostanol, an AAS and antiestrogen which was formerly used {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer in Japan. Similarly to <b>mepitiostane,</b> methylepitiostanol is an orally active variant of epitiostanol. Due to its C17α methyl group, the drug is considered to have a high potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
