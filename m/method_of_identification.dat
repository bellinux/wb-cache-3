5|$|The {{psilocybin}} {{contents of}} dried herbarium specimens of Psilocybe semilanceata {{in one study}} were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> or determining a mushroom's potency.|$|E

25|$|Seals {{are still}} used for {{official}} purposes {{in a number}} of contexts. When collecting parcels or registered post, the name seal serves as an identification, akin to a signature. In banks, traditionally the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> was also by a seal. Seals remain the customary form of identification on cheques in mainland China and Taiwan but not in Hong Kong where signatures are required. Today, personal identification is often by a hand signature accompanied by a seal imprint. Seals can serve as identification with signatures because they are difficult to forge (when compared to forging a signature) and only the owner has access to his own seal.|$|E
25|$|Lépine is {{credited}} as {{the founder of}} modern French policing. At {{the time of his}} first tenure the police had become renowned for corruption and low standards, trust between the police and the public was very low. Lépine recognised that if France was not to relapse into military government the relationship between the civil police and the public had to change to become one of mutual trust. The assassination in Lyon in June 1894 of President Carnot, the 5th President of the Republic was the impetus for Lépine to introduce measures to overhaul policing in France. Thus he set an agenda of reform beginning by carefully codified police procedures and regulations, improving the professional quality of the police force with the introduction of examinations and promotions and by introducing forensic science into the work of the detective. It was during his time as prefect of police that fingerprinting became established as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> The examinations for police that he instituted were very thorough: the tests for example included determining methods of forgery and examining lock components involved in a burglary so as to tell if a lock had been picked. As befits his training as a lawyer, his was the first prefecture to introduce criminology into policing and to examine the psychology of criminals.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{identification}} of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> is for the hound to jump up, and place its paws on the subject’s chest. In {{the case of a}} lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, {{and in the case of}} a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification was the first thing learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone who walks a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to the wrong person it is chastised, but gets the liver if it goes to the right one. When the hound goes to the right person almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.|$|E

40|$|Human {{life should}} be good life {{in the real world}} which is not merely a {{function}} of objective facts but also a function of subjective factors like hopes, fears, interests, etc. Goodness, or excellence, is an ethical notion. The factors of good life cannot be identified solely by using the so-called factual (descriptive) <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> This means that the identification cannot be fully “objective” or fully “public”. Furthermore, {{there is a need for}} other <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> that also take into account certain “subjective” aspects of the object <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> Following Jaakko Hintikka we call these methods contextual (perspectival) <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> Here ethics is not a set of ethical rules but rather the practical study of human life.

500|$|The MediaWiki {{software}} that Wikipedia runs on can interpret X-Forwarded-For (XFF) headers, allowing Wikipedia {{to identify a}} user's main IP address rather than the proxy IP address, allowing the ability to block proxy users individually by their client's IP rather than the proxy server IP (avoiding the need to block the whole proxy due to {{the actions of a}} single user).

500|$|The {{wide range}} of {{instrumentation}} for forensic chemical analysis also began to be developed during this time period. [...] The early 19th century saw {{the invention of the}} spectroscope by Joseph von Fraunhofer. In 1859, chemist Robert Bunsen and physicist Gustav Kirchhoff expanded on Fraunhofer's invention. [...] Their experiments with spectroscopy showed that specific substances created a unique spectrum when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. [...] Using spectroscopy, the two scientists were able to identify substances based on their spectrum, providing a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> for unknown materials. [...] In 1906 botanist Mikhail Tsvet invented paper chromatography, an early predecessor to thin layer chromatography, and used it to separate and examine the plant proteins that make up chlorophyll. [...] The ability to separate mixtures into their individual components allows forensic chemists to examine the parts of an unknown material against a database of known products. [...] By matching the retention factors for the separated components with known values, materials can be identified.|$|E

Controversy surrounding DNA barcoding stems not so much from the method itself, but rather from extravagant claims that it will supersede or radically transform traditional taxonomy. Other critics fear a [...] "big science" [...] initiative like barcoding will make funding even more scarce for already underfunded disciplines like taxonomy, but barcoders respond that they compete for funding not with fields like taxonomy, but instead with other big science fields, such as medicine and genomics. Barcoders also maintain that they are being dragged into long-standing debates over the definition of a species and that barcoding is less controversial when viewed primarily as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification,</b> not classification.|$|E
6000|$|Sir William Herschel has {{presented}} me {{with one of}} the two original [...] "Contracts" [...] in Bengali, dated 1858, which suggested to his mind the idea of using this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> It was so difficult to obtain credence to the signatures of the natives, that he thought he would use the signature of the hand itself, chiefly with the intention of frightening the man who made it from afterwards denying his formal act; however, the impression proved so good that Sir W. Herschel became convinced that the same method might be further utilised. He finally introduced the use of finger prints in several departments at Hooghly in 1877, after seventeen years' experience {{of the value of the}} evidence they afforded. A too brief account of his work was given by him in Nature, xxiii. p. 23 (Nov. 25, 1880). He mentions there that he had been taking finger marks as sign-manuals for more than twenty years, and had introduced them for practical purposes in several ways in India with marked benefit. They rendered attempts to repudiate signatures quite hopeless. Finger prints were taken of Pensioners to prevent their personation by others after their death; they were used in the office for Registration of Deeds, and at a gaol where each prisoner had to sign with his finger. By comparing the prints of persons then living, with their prints taken twenty years previously, he considered he had proved that the lapse of at least that period made no change sufficient to affect the utility of the plan. He informs me that he submitted, in 1877, a report in semi-official form to the Inspector-General of Gaols, asking to be allowed to extend the process; but no result followed. In 1881, at the request of the Governor of the gaol at Greenwich (Sydney), he sent a description of the method, but no further steps appear to have been taken there.|$|E
