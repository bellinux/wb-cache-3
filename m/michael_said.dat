5|$|Boyars {{could no}} longer be {{executed}} without the knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes {{could no longer}} be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
5|$|Heidfeld {{was finally}} {{announced}} as Webber's 2005 teammate at the Williams season launch on 31 January, with Webber admitting {{he was pleased}} with the eventual decision. Webber's move to Williams brought about comparisons to Alan Jones, Australia's last F1 World Champion, also in a Williams. Expectations were high as Webber's former team boss Paul Stoddart predicted Webber would take his first victory in 2005 while Williams technical director Sam <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> Webber would eventually win the World Championship with Williams.|$|E
5|$|Sutil {{was given}} a 20-second time penalty by the {{stewards}} as he was deemed to gain an advantage by taking the outside line at turn seven on the first lap. This demoted him from eighth to tenth, and promoted Hülkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth. Following a protest from Force India, Hülkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the stewards deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner cutting. This ruling meant Hülkenberg was demoted to tenth while Massa moved up to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth. Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil's penalty following the decision, and Williams technical director Sam <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> that his team had accepted the stewards' judgement. The stewards elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi. Kobayashi admitted {{that he was at}} fault for his retirement and Senna believed the marshals were late reacting to Kobayashi's accident and felt his own accident was unavoidable.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with VH1's Behind the Music, <b>Michaels</b> <b>said</b> {{the inspiration for the}} song came from a night when he was in a laundromat waiting for his clothes to dry, and called his girlfriend on a pay phone. <b>Michaels</b> <b>said</b> he heard a male voice in the background and was devastated; he said he went into the laundromat and wrote [...] "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" [...] as a result.|$|R

25|$|He {{said that}} as Menezes entered the Stockwell Tube station, no member of the {{surveillance}} team had positively identified him as Hussain Osman. Regarding {{the decision of the}} two marksmen to shoot Menezes, Sir <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> that they had fired nine rounds between them, seven of which had struck Menezes's head at point blank range. He added that the two officers concerned were convinced that Menezes was a suicide bomber about to detonate a device, and that the only option open was an instant killing.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{handing out}} candy bars during his lectures is a {{reference}} to the third season episode, [...] "Business School", where Michael passed out chocolate bars during his speech to a business school classroom. Michael expresses regret for insulting Tony Gardner, the heavyset man who briefly transferred from the Stamford branch of Dunder Mifflin to the Scranton branch, who Michael drives to quit by trying to lift onto a table for an orientation demonstration in the third season episode, [...] "The Merger". Among the Dunder Mifflin branches Michael visits is Nashua, New Hampshire, where Holly works, and Utica, New York, where Karen works. <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> he can only prepare for his lectures by listening to [...] "silence or Sam Kinison", an American stand-up comedian known for his extreme and vulgar sense of humor. <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> he learned the Pledge of Allegiance, the lyrical oath of loyalty to the United States flag, by setting the lyrics to the rhythm of [...] "Old McDonald Had a Farm", a children's song about the various animals on a farm. During one lecture, Michael and Pam both do impressions of the protagonist from Forrest Gump, the 1994 film starring Tom Hanks as a mentally handicapped man. Michael also uses the title from the films Good Morning, Vietnam (at his Nashua lecture by saying [...] "Good morning, Vietna...shua!") The Princess Bride, Gone with the Wind and Jerry Maguire in his lectures. Holly's computer has a screensaver with images of Ed Grimley, the nerdy character with a cowlick played by comedian Martin Short in the comedy shows SCTV and Saturday Night Live.|$|E
500|$|Joshua Alston of Newsweek {{criticized the}} episode and the {{introduction}} of the Charles character. Although Alston said Elba's acting was fine, he said the character [...] "sucked the funny out of every scene he was in" [...] and created an awkwardness inappropriate for the show. During the week following the episode's original broadcast, many fans theorized on the Internet that <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I acquit" [...] rather than [...] "I quit", and that Michael's supposed resignation was something of a prank. Jenna Fischer, who plays Pam on The Office, addressed this issue on her MySpace blog, saying, [...] "He said 'I quit'. [...] And he meant it.

500|$|During their dance competition, Andy does a dance {{involving}} a chair {{from the music}} video of the Madonna song [...] "Vogue", and Kelly does a reenactment of the silhouette chair dance from the 1983 romance film Flashdance, which inspired elements of a dance done by actress Vanessa Ferlito in the 2007 Quentin Tarantino film Death Proof. Jim and Pam plan to drive to Youngstown, a city in Mahoning County, Ohio, to get married in a courthouse. Dwight does an impression of actor Jack Nicholson's character Jack Torrance from the 1980 Stanley Kubrick film The Shining. Michael described the positive office atmosphere to that of Dave & Buster's, a restaurant and entertainment business. To signify the care-free atmosphere of Cafe Disco, Michael {{hung on the wall}} a lei, a Hawaiian flower necklace. When his Cafe Disco idea was initially rejected, <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> he could understand how it felt to be the tobacco company Philip Morris.|$|E
500|$|Robert Prince tells Michael {{he started}} his {{business}} after Vietnam, {{a reference to the}} Vietnam War, but Michael mistakes it for a reference to the country itself and says he has heard it is a nice place. During one scene, <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> to David Wallace, [...] "What'chu talking 'bout, Wallace?" [...] in the style of Gary Coleman's catchphrase [...] "What'chu talking 'bout, Willis?" [...] from the sitcom Diff'rent Strokes. While discussing Hilary Swank, Kevin said he finds her so unattractive that he expected her to have a real penis in Boys Don't Cry, the 1999 drama film in which Swank played a transgender man. When Angela votes that Hilary Swank is hot, she declares her [...] "a female Boris Becker", a reference to the German professional tennis player. Michael plans to meet Dwight at the IHOP pancake eatery after they visit Prince Family Paper, but Dwight insists IHOP is [...] "socialist" [...] and prefers the American restaurant chain Denny's.|$|E
500|$|During the {{suggestion}} box scene, Larry Wilmore envisioned Dwight as an Ed McMahon-type character, repeating everything <b>Michael</b> <b>said.</b> Paul Lieberstein claimed that {{figuring out the}} logistics for the conference room scene was [...] "the heart" [...] of the episode. Hardin recalled that it was extremely difficult to stay in character, due to the humorous nature of the dialogue and the cast members' reactions. In fact, the cast broke more than usual during filming. During the scene, Michael reads a suggestion from someone named Tom, who asks for better help for people with depression. After inquiring who this mysterious Tom is, Phyllis tells Michael that he worked in accounting several years ago and committed suicide. Wilmore claimed during the DVD commentary for the episode that the writers would be bringing {{him back in the}} show's third season, in which his backstory would be explained, although this never panned out. However, during the Writer's Block Q session at The Office Convention in 2007, the writers, perhaps sardonically, suggested that Tom's death was the reason that Ryan was brought in as a temporary worker. Tom's name is briefly seen on Dwight's organization chart in the fourth season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?", where his name is revealed to be Tom Peets.|$|E

2500|$|Questions of Michael's sexual {{orientation}} persisted until 7 April 1998, {{when he was}} arrested for [...] "engaging in a lewd act" [...] in a public restroom of the Will Rogers Memorial Park, in Beverly Hills, California. In 2007, <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> [...] "that hiding his sexuality made him feel 'fraudulent', and his eventual outing, {{when he was arrested}} [...] in 1998, was a subconsciously deliberate act." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 9 December, {{the jury}} asked the coroner {{whether they were}} {{required}} to find unanimity on the short form verdict and all of the additional questions.

2500|$|Michael {{is a less}} {{complicated}} {{person than}} Selene. At {{the beginning of the}} events of the first film, Michael seems to be living a very stale and routine life. One of his fellow interns and fellow American at the hospital, Adam, when asked about <b>Michael,</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "He comes in. He does his job. And then he goes home: Other than that, I really don't know what to tell you. Interns pretty much work round the clock. We don't have much of a life".|$|E
2500|$|On 2 December Sir Michael {{ordered the}} jury, shortly before it retired to {{consider}} its verdict, {{that they may}} not return one of 'unlawful killing,' leaving their options as 'lawful killing,' or an open verdict. Sir <b>Michael</b> <b>said</b> that the verdict could not be inconsistent with the earlier criminal trial. As well as the short form verdict of 'lawful killing' or 'open', Sir Michael also asked them to respond to three questions of fact, and nine possible contributory factors with simple 'yes,' 'no,' or 'cannot decide' answers. [...] The Menezes family lodged an immediate application for a judicial review of the decision.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} stages of editing, Anderson was {{dismissed}} by Wham!'s management, the editing team quit, and the film was entirely re-edited, renamed and released as Foreign Skies: Wham! In China. [...] According to a 2006 interview with The Independent, Andy Stephens, manager of George <b>Michael,</b> <b>said</b> that the film [...] was simply not good enough to be shown in public: [...] "It's a dreadful film... It's 20 years old and it's rubbish. Why on earth should we allow it to be shown?", although after viewing it in 2008 critic and journalist John Harris described it as [...] "a rich, poetic, panoramic portrait of China's strangeness to the eyes of outsiders".|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Michael {{performed}} a free concert for NHS nurses in London {{to thank the}} nurses who had cared for his late mother. He told the audience: [...] "Thank you for everything you do — some people appreciate it. Now if we can only get {{the government to do}} the same thing." [...] In 2007, Michael sent the £1.45million piano that John Lennon used to write [...] "Imagine" [...] around the US on a [...] "peace tour", displaying at places where violence had taken place, such as Dallas's Dealey Plaza, where US President John F. Kennedy had been shot. He devoted his 2007 concert in Sofia, from his [...] "Twenty Five Tour" [...] to the Bulgarian nurses prosecuted in the HIV trial in Libya.

2500|$|An {{assassination}} attempt against Mengistu occurred on 4 November 1995, {{while he was}} out walking with his wife, Wubanchi Bishaw, {{near his home in}} the Gunhill suburb of Harare.

He was later tried for this {{assassination attempt}}, pleading not guilty in a Zimbabwean court on 8 July 1996. The Eritrean Ambassador to South Africa, Tsegaye Tesfa Tsion, flew to Harare to attend the trial. The attacker was sentenced to ten years in prison, while his accomplice Abraham Goletom Joseph, who had been arrested in a police raid, was sentenced to five years. They said that they had been tortured under Mengistu, and on appeal their sentences were reduced to two years each due to [...] "mitigatory circumstances". The Ethiopian ambassador to Zimbabwe, Fantahun Haile <b>Michael,</b> <b>said</b> his government was not involved in the assassination attempt, and that he heard about the incident from the media.|$|E
