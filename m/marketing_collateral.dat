Although some argue that the {{high-end}} VSes and their successors should qualify as mainframes, Wang avoided this term. In his autobiography, An Wang, rather than calling the VS 300 a mainframe, said that it [...] "verges on mainframe performance". He went on to draw distinction between the [...] "mainframes" [...] {{at the high end}} of IBM's line ("just as Detroit would rather sell large cars ... so IBM would rather sell mainframes")—in which IBM had a virtual monopoly—with the [...] "mid-sized systems" [...] in which IBM had not achieved dominance: [...] "The minicomputer market is still healthy.

40|$|<b>Collateral</b> <b>markets</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} important as demand for collateral assets has increased in recent years, driven by changing market practices and an evolving regulatory landscape. This report explores whether and how the design of central banks' operational frameworks influences private <b>collateral</b> <b>markets,</b> including <b>collateral</b> availability, pricing, related market practices, and market performance under stress. It studies these issues by reviewing available information {{from a range of}} sources, including central bank case studies as well as surveys and interviews with private sector participants in <b>collateral</b> <b>markets.</b> Central banks influence <b>markets</b> for <b>collateral</b> through either the supply of assets available for use as collateral (a scarcity channel), the pledgeability of assets in private transactions (a structural channel), or both. They therefore have a variety of design choices at their disposal to influence <b>collateral</b> <b>markets</b> as well as to fine-tune the effects of their operations on these markets. While central bank operating frameworks are not usually the most important factor influencing <b>collateral</b> <b>markets,</b> the evidence presented in this report indicates that the influence of central banks may at times be significant, in particular during crisis times. This highlights the importance of carefully monitoring the effects of central bank operations on <b>collateral</b> <b>markets,</b> as well as the need for central banks to examine their operational frameworks to ensure preparedness for any future crisis response...|$|R

The management of collateral {{is complicated by the}} fact that participants operate across multiple business lines that compete for these scarce resources. The choice of securities, and their related opportunity cost, is determined by the demand for payment services, relative yields and liquidity in individual financial markets, and the size of the pool of liquid assets managed by each financial institution. For short-term needs, participants typically demand Government of Canada issued securities, which can be easily re-deployed to other business needs. Interestingly, an institution’s market making activity in a specific asset class does not affect the likelihood that a security will be pledged or released.

40|$|When {{scholars}} and practitioners consider {{the implications of}} offshoring work, their primary concern is often the impact offshoring has on communication between people at different sites. When time zones and geographic boundaries separate employees, communication is limited, {{making it difficult for}} remote colleagues to form trusting and familiar relationships with one another. However, offshoring not only obstructs person-to-person interactions, it also impedes person-to-object interactions. This is potentially problematic as many organizations today still produce physical products, such as printed <b>marketing</b> <b>collaterals,</b> computers, home décor, or automobiles. Though organizations that create physical outputs may engage in digital work processes, people at these organizations may still rely on interactions with the physical objects that they produce in order to complete tasks.

40|$|We analyze a {{standard}} environment of adverse selection in credit markets. In our environment, entrepreneurs who are privately {{informed about the}} quality of their projects need to borrow from banks. Conventional wisdom says that, in this class of economies, the competitive equilibrium is typically inefficient. We show that this conventional wisdom rests on one implicit assumption: entrepreneurs can only borrow from banks. If an additional market is added to provide entrepreneurs with additional funds, efficiency can be attained in equilibrium. An important characteristic of this additional market is that it must be non-exclusive, in the sense that entrepreneurs must be able to simultaneously borrow from many different lenders operating in it. This makes it possible to attain efficiency by pooling all entrepreneurs in the new market while separating them in the market for bank loans.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{determination}} of the optimal loan contracts and resource allocation in a competitive credit market with asymmetric information. It focuses on an economy with risky investment projects that require two goods as inputs, only one of which is accepted by lenders as collateral. Results show that low-risk entrepreneurs tend to choose contracts with a combination of more collateral and lower rates of interest. Under the circumstance that low-risk entrepreneurs have insufficient general capital (which is assumed to be accepted as collateral) to secure the loan, they are forced to face the binding collateral constraint. In order to finance their production projects, entrepreneurs tend to increase the size of loan and allocate a relatively high proportion of the general capital, leading to problems of inefficient resource allocation and over-borrowing in the credit <b>market.</b> <b>Collateral</b> Resource allocation Competitive credit market Optimal loan contract...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, I study how the {{proportion}} of …xed and variable-rate mortgages in an economy can a¤ect the way shocks are propagated. Second, I analyze optimal implementable simple monetary policy rules and the welfare implications of this proportion. I develop and solve a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that features a housing market and a group of constrained individuals who need housing collateral to obtain loans. A given proportion of constrained households borrows at a variable rate, while the rest borrows at a …xed rate. The model predicts that in an economy with mostly variable-rate mortgages, an exogenous interest rate shock has larger e¤ects on borrowers than in a …xed-rate economy. Aggregate e¤ects are also larger for the variable-rate economy. For plausible parametrizations, di¤erences are muted by wealth e¤ects on labor supply and by the presence of savers. More persistent shocks, such as in‡ation target and technology shocks, cause larger aggregate di¤erences. From a normative perspective I …nd that, in the presence of collateral constraints, the optimal Taylor rule is less aggressive against in‡ation than in the standard sticky-price model. Furthermore, for given monetary policy, a high proportion of …xed-rate mortgages is welfare enhancing.

Results show that introducing the macroprudential rule or extending the interest-rate rule to respond to house prices increases welfare, since it enhances financial stability. However, for the optimal policy mix, when both policies act together, monetary policy should ensure price stability while the macroprudential authority should safeguard financial stability...|$|R
