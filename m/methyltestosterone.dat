Ukrainian athlete Lyudmyla Blonska, who {{finished}} second in the women's heptathlon, tested positive for the steroid <b>methyltestosterone.</b> On August 22, 2008, the International Olympic Committee officially stripped Blonska of her medal, and as a result, the silver medal went to Hyleas Fountain of the United States, and the bronze medal to Tatyana Chernova of Russia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone</b> and ethyltestosterone (17α-ethyltestosterone) are {{the parent}} {{structures}} of all 17α-alkylated AAS. Major 17α-alkylated AAS include the testosterone derivatives fluoxymesterone, metandienone (methandrostenolone), and <b>methyltestosterone</b> and the DHT derivatives oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and stanozolol.|$|E
25|$|Brand names {{under which}} <b>methyltestosterone</b> is or has been marketed {{for medical use}} include Afro, Agovirin, Android, Androral, Mesteron, Metandren, Methitest, <b>Methyltestosterone,</b> Methyl Testosterone, Oraviron, Oreton, Oreton Methyl, Testormon, Testovis, Testred, and Virilon, among others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone</b> {{should be}} used with caution in women and children, as it can cause {{irreversible}} virilization. Due to its estrogenicity, <b>methyltestosterone</b> can also accelerate epiphyseal closure and thereby produce short stature in children and adolescents. It can worsen symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. <b>Methyltestosterone</b> {{should not be used}} in men with prostate cancer, as androgens can accelerate tumor progression. The drug {{should be used}} with caution in patients with pre-existing hepatotoxicity, due to its own potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone,</b> {{also known}} as 17α-methyltestosterone or as 17α-methylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, 17α-alkylated androstane steroid and a {{derivative}} of testosterone differing from it only {{in the presence of}} a methyl group at the C17α position. Close synthetic relatives of <b>methyltestosterone</b> include metandienone (17α-methyl-δ1-testosterone) and fluoxymesterone (9α-fluoro-11β-hydroxy-17α-methyltestosterone).|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone</b> is also marketed in {{many other}} {{countries}} throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Because of its C17α methyl group, <b>methyltestosterone</b> has {{dramatically}} improved oral bioavailability and metabolic stability relative to testosterone, {{and for this}} reason, unlike testosterone, is orally active. The oral bioavailability of <b>methyltestosterone</b> is about 70%, and its terminal half-life is approximately 3hours (range 2.5–3.5hours), {{with a duration of}} action of 1 to 3days. Its duration is described as relatively short among AAS. <b>Methyltestosterone</b> can also be taken buccally or sublingually, and this is said to approximately double its bioavailability. The drug is highly protein-bound, by approximately 98%, including to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) with about 25% of the affinity of testosterone. It is excreted 90% in the urine as conjugates and metabolites, and 6% in feces.|$|E
25|$|The first drugs {{reported}} to cause fetal masculinization were the androgens methandriol and <b>methyltestosterone</b> {{in the mid}} 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} <b>methyltestosterone</b> include {{androgenic}} side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, increased aggressiveness and sex drive, and spontaneous erections, {{as well as}} estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia, fluid retention, and edema. In women, <b>methyltestosterone</b> can cause partially irreversible virilization, for instance voice deepening, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility. In men, the drug may also cause hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone</b> is {{used for}} physique- or performance-enhancing {{purposes}} by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters, {{although it is not}} commonly used relative to other AAS for such purposes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone</b> (brand names Agovirin, Android, Metandren, Oreton, Testred, Virilon, others) is a {{synthetic}} and orally active anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) {{which is used}} in the treatment of androgen deficiency in males and for a number of other indications. It is also used illicitly for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes by athletes and bodybuilders. The drug was synthesized in 1935 shortly following the discovery of testosterone, {{and was one of the}} first synthetic AAS to be developed. Although it is not as commonly used as other AAS for various reasons, <b>methyltestosterone</b> continues to be used medically even today.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone</b> is {{available}} at a low-dose in combination with esterified estrogens {{for the treatment of}} menopausal symptoms like hot flashes in women under the brand names Covaryx, Essian, Estratest, Menogen, and Syntest.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is not}} {{commonly}} used, <b>methyltestosterone</b> {{is one of the}} few AAS {{that remains}} available for medical use in the United States. The others are testosterone (and esters), nandrolone decanoate, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and fluoxymesterone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone,</b> {{along with}} other AAS, is a {{schedule}} III controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act and an schedule IV controlled substance in Canada under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone</b> can {{sometimes}} cause hepatotoxicity, for instance elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic jaundice, peliosis hepatis, hepatomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma, with extended use. It {{can also have}} adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. AAS like <b>methyltestosterone</b> stimulate erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) and increase hematocrit levels and at high dosages can cause polycythemia (overproduction of red blood cells), which can greatly {{increase the risk of}} thrombic events such as embolism and stroke. With long-term treatment, AAS can increase the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Violent and even homicidal behavior, hypomania/mania, depression, suicidality, delusions, and psychosis have all been associated with very high dosages of AAS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1935. It {{was the second}} synthetic AAS to be developed, following mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) in 1934, {{and was the first}} 17α-alkylated AAS to be developed. The drug was introduced for medical use in 1936.|$|E
25|$|Future {{attacks of}} {{hereditary}} angioedema {{can be prevented}} {{by the use of}} androgens such as danazol, oxandrolone or <b>methyltestosterone.</b> These agents increase the level of aminopeptidase P, an enzyme that inactivates kinins; kinins (especially bradykinin) are responsible for the manifestations of angioedema.|$|E
25|$|In low doses as a {{component}} of hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal and transgender women, for instance to increase energy, well-being, libido, and quality of life, as well as to reduce hot flashes. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although <b>methyltestosterone</b> is also used.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{combined}} {{disadvantages of}} a relatively poor ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, unusually high estrogenicity, {{and the potential for}} hepatotoxicity (as with other 17α-alkylated AAS), <b>methyltestosterone</b> has not been used as commonly as many other AAS either in medicine or for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methyltestosterone</b> is or {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of delayed puberty, hypogonadism, cryptorchidism, and erectile dysfunction in males, and in low doses to treat menopausal symptoms (specifically for osteoporosis, hot flashes, and to increase libido and energy), postpartum breast pain and engorgement, and breast cancer in women.|$|E
25|$|The dosages of <b>methyltestosterone</b> {{used are}} 10 to 50mg/day in men for common medical uses and physique- and performance-enhancing {{purposes}} and 2.5mg/day in women for menopausal symptoms. Higher dosages {{of as much}} as 200mg/day have been used to treat women with inoperable breast cancer that has failed to respond to other therapies.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone, {{which is}} {{available}} as a pharmaceutical drug, is metabolized in part to estrogens such as estradiol, and can produce significant estrogenic effects at high dosages, most notably gynecomastia in males. The {{same is true for}} some synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids, like <b>methyltestosterone</b> and metandienone. DHEA is available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement in the United States (but not in many other countries), though it is only very weakly estrogenic.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include <b>methyltestosterone,</b> oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; {{injectable}} steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Oral administration {{is the most}} convenient. Testosterone administered by mouth is rapidly absorbed, but it is largely converted to inactive metabolites, and only about one-sixth is available in active form. In order to be sufficiently active when given by mouth, testosterone derivatives are alkylated at the 17α position, e.g. <b>methyltestosterone</b> and fluoxymesterone. This modification reduces the liver's ability to break down these compounds {{before they reach the}} systemic circulation.|$|E
25|$|The major {{effect of}} estrogenicity is {{gynecomastia}} (woman-like breasts). AAS {{that have a}} high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly <b>methyltestosterone</b> show {{a high risk of}} gynecomastia, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production.|$|E
25|$|Clinical trials on humans, {{involving}} either oral {{doses of}} <b>methyltestosterone</b> or injections of testosterone propionate, began {{as early as}} 1937. Testosterone propionate is mentioned {{in a letter to}} the editor of Strength and Health magazine in 1938; this is the earliest known reference to an AAS in a U.S. weightlifting or bodybuilding magazine. There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War, the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, as yet, unproven. Adolf Hitler himself, according to his physician, was injected with testosterone derivatives to treat various ailments. AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates, and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps. President John F. Kennedy was administered steroids both before and during his presidency.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be metabolized by {{aromatase}} into estradiol, {{and many}} other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding estrogenic metabolites as well. As an example, the 17α-alkylated AAS <b>methyltestosterone</b> and metandienone are converted by aromatase into methylestradiol. 4,5α-Dihydrogenated derivatives of testosterone such as DHT cannot be aromatized, whereas 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be but to a greatly reduced extent. Some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, such as dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, cannot be aromatized due to steric hindrance provided by their 11β-methyl group, whereas the closely related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), in relation to its lack of an 11β-methyl group, can be aromatized. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but {{to a lesser extent}} than is testosterone. However, it is notable that estrogens that are 17α-substituted (e.g., ethinylestradiol and methylestradiol) are of markedly increased estrogenic potency due to improved metabolic stability, and for this reason, 17α-alkylated AAS can actually have high estrogenicity and comparatively greater estrogenic effects than testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), like {{nandrolone}} (as an ester like nandrolone decanoate or nandrolone phenylpropionate), are agonists of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) similarly to testosterone {{but are not}} usually used in HRT for transgender men or for androgen replacement therapy (ART) in cisgender men. However, {{they can be used}} in place of testosterone with similar effects, and can have certain advantages like less or no local potentiation in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase like the skin and hair follicles (which results in a reduced rate of skin and hair-related side effects like acne, oily skin, seborrhea, excessive body hair growth, and, in particular, male-pattern baldness), although this can also be disadvantageous in a few aspects of masculinization (specifically facial hair growth, body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement). Although many AAS are not potentiated in androgenic tissues, they have similar effects to testosterone in other tissues like bone, muscle, fat, and the voice box. Also, many AAS, like nandrolone esters, are aromatized into estrogens to a greatly reduced extent relative to testosterone or not at all, and for this reason, are associated with reduced or no estrogenic effects (e.g., gynecomastia). AAS that are 17α-alkylated like <b>methyltestosterone,</b> oxandrolone, and stanozolol are orally active but carry a high risk of liver damage, whereas AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like nandrolone esters, must be administered by intramuscular injection (via which they act as long-lasting depots similarly to testosterone esters) but have no more risk of liver damage than does testosterone.|$|E

2500|$|As an AAS, <b>methyltestosterone</b> is an agonist of the {{androgen}} receptor (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is a substrate for 5α-reductase like testosterone, {{and so is}} potentiated analogously in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland via transformation into the more potent AR agonist mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT). As such, <b>methyltestosterone</b> has a relatively low ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, with a similar ratio to that of testosterone (close to 1:1), and this makes it among the most androgenic AAS. Due to efficient aromatization into the potent and metabolism-resistant estrogen methylestradiol (17α-methylestradiol), <b>methyltestosterone</b> has relatively high estrogenicity and hence potential for estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia and fluid retention.
