40|$|Red meat {{consumption}} {{is associated with}} an increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, which may be due to an increased endogenous formation of genotoxic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs). To assess the impact of red meat consumption on potential risk factors of CRC, we investigated the effect of a 7 -day dietary red <b>meat</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>in</b> human subjects on endogenous NOC formation and fecal water genotoxicity in relation to genome-wide transcriptomic changes induced in colonic tissue. The intervention showed no effect on fecal NOC excretion but fecal water genotoxicity significantly increased in response to red meat intake. Colonic inflammation caused by inflammatory bowel disease, which has been suggested to stimulate endogenous nitrosation, did not influence fecal NOC excretion or fecal water genotoxicity. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that genes significantly correlating with the increase in fecal water genotoxicity were involved in biological pathways indicative of genotoxic effects, including modifications in DNA damage repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways. Moreover, WNT signaling and nucleosome remodeling pathways were modulated which are implicated in human CRC development. We conclude that the gene expression changes identified in this study corroborate the genotoxic potential of diets high <b>in</b> red <b>meat</b> and point towards a potentially increased CRC risk in humans...|$|R

40|$|Cool {{storage is}} a load {{management}} strategy for air conditioning loads, which shifts peak load by storing cooling capacity during off peak period. It allows the customer's electricity use for cooling to be shifted to off peak period, benefiting both the consumer and the utility. Reduction in peak demand and electricity cost depend on electricity tariff rates, operating strategy, cool storage capacity and climatic conditions. In this paper, a methodology {{is presented to}} determine the optimal chilled water storage (CWS) capacity and corresponding operating strategy for the air conditioning loads for different electricity tariffs. This model minimizes the total operating cost of the air conditioning plant by a trade-off between the cost involved for providing the storage and accessories and savings achieved under the specified, electricity tariff. A case study for a typical office complex shows that a reduction of 38 % in peak demand is possible by adopting the optimal CWS strategy under time of use (TOU) tariff. The corresponding saving in the operating cost for the consumer is 5. 9 %. The results show that under flat tariffs, the prevalent high consumer discount rates make cool storage unviable. This provides justification for utility <b>intervention</b> <b>in</b> cool <b>storage</b> demand side management (DSM) programs. (C) 2002. ...|$|R

40|$|Lobos, G (Lobos, German). Univ Talca, Escuela Ingn Comercial, Talca, ChileThe {{low levels}} of {{consumption}} of lamb <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> Chile {{suggest the need for}} studies on consumer preferences in order to orient production. A study with this object was carried out to evaluate preferences for various cuts, breeds, state (fresh or frozen) and price of lamb's meat among supermarket buyers in Temuco, Chile, and the existence of different market segments, through a survey of 400 persons. Using a fractional factorial design for conjoint analysis, it was determined that the state of the meat was more important than the cut, the price and the breed, with a preference for <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> half carcasses and quarters, Araucano lamb, fresh, at a medium price level. Four consumer segments were distinguished by analysis of hierarchic conglomerates. The majority group (47. 7 %) was sensitive to the state and the cut, with preference for <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> quarters, fresh, Texel breed. The second group (25. 3 %) was sensitive to the breed, presenting the strongest preferences for <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> whole carcass, fresh, Araucano lamb. The third group (14. 3 %) was sensitive to the price, preferred <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> quarters, fresh, Araucano lamb. The minority group (12. 7 %) was sensitive to the state and price, preferring <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> quarters, Texel breed, and was the only group which preferred frozen meat and would pay a higher price. The segments were distinguished by age, ethnic origin and satisfaction with food-related life. Thus the commercialisation strategy for lamb in supermarkets in Temuco should concentrate principally on the sale of fresh <b>meat</b> cut <b>in</b> quarter...|$|R
