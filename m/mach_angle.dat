Early observations by Ernst Mach used grooves in the wall of a duct to produce Mach waves in a duct, which were then photographed by the schlieren method, to obtain data about the flow in nozzles and ducts. <b>Mach</b> <b>angles</b> may also occasionally be visualized out of their condensation in air, for example vapor cones around aircraft during transonic flight.|$|R

The results {{indicate}} that increasing angle of attack from zero can produce substantial changes in the transonic flutter characteristics that are favorable or unfavorable depending on <b>Mach</b> number and <b>angle</b> of attack. The bottom of the transonic flutter-boundary 'bucket' is shown to occur at lower <b>Mach</b> number as <b>angle</b> of attack increases. These flutter results correlate well {{with the effects of}} <b>Mach</b> number and <b>angle</b> of attack on aerodynamic behavior, especially on the development of transonic flow phenomena. The calculated flutter characteristics are in good agreement with the experimental data at zero angle of attack, but at nonzero angles of attack the experiments show sharply declining and backward-turning transonic flutter boundaries that are not indicated by the calculations. These may be caused by variations in static aeroelastic deformation...|$|R

5000|$|As {{opposed to}} the flow encountering an {{inclined}} obstruction and forming an oblique shock, the flow expands around a convex corner and forms an expansion fan {{through a series of}} isentropic Mach waves. The expansion [...] "fan" [...] is composed of Mach waves that span from the initial <b>Mach</b> <b>angle</b> to the final <b>Mach</b> <b>angle.</b> Flow can expand around either a sharp or rounded corner equally, as the increase in Mach number is proportional to only the convex angle of the passage (δ). The expansion corner that produces the Prandtl-Meyer fan can be sharp (as illustrated in the figure) or rounded.

40|$|In jet quenching, a hard QCD parton, before fragmenting into a jet of hadrons, {{deposits}} {{a fraction}} of its energy in the medium. As the parton moves nearly with speed of light, much greater that {{the speed of sound}} of the medium, quenching jet can generate Mach shock wave. We have examined the possibility of Mach shock wave formation due to jet quenching. Assuming that the deposited energy quickly thermalize, we simulate the hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP fluid with a quenching jet and subsequent particle production. Angular distribution of pions, averaged over all the jet trajectories, resembles 'conical flow' due to Mach shock wave formation.

Available methods and recommendations for evaluating such effects, which are based on shifts in <b>Mach</b> number and <b>angle</b> of attack, are examined and the results are compared with measurements using the flapped supercritical SKF 1. 1 airfoil.

5000|$|The area rule {{also holds}} true at speeds {{exceeding}} {{the speed of}} sound, {{but in this case}} the body arrangement is in respect to the Mach line for the design speed. For example, consider that at Mach 1.3 the angle of the Mach cone formed off the body of the aircraft will be at about μ = arcsin(1/M) = 50.3° (where μ is the angle of the Mach cone, or simply <b>Mach</b> <b>angle,</b> and M is the Mach number). In this case the [...] "perfect shape" [...] is biased rearward; therefore, aircraft designed for high speed cruise usually have wings towards the rear. A classic example of such a design is the Concorde. When applying the transonic area rule, the condition that the plane defining the cross-section meets the longitudinal axis at the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle</b> μ no longer prescribes a unique plane for μ other than the 90° given by M = 1. The correct procedure is to average over all possible orientations of the intersecting plane.|$|E
5000|$|Isentropic {{expansion}} waves are created when a supersonic flow is redirected along a curved surface. These waves are studied {{to obtain a}} relation between deflection angle and Mach number. Each wave {{in this case is}} a Mach wave, so it is at an angle [...] , where M is the Mach number immediately before the wave. Expansion waves are divergent because as the flow expands the value of Mach number increases, thereby decreasing the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
50|$|These flow {{regimes are}} not chosen arbitrarily, but rather arise {{naturally}} from the strong mathematical background that underlies compressible flow (see the cited reference textbooks). At very slow flow speeds {{the speed of}} sound is so much faster that it is mathematically ignored, and the Mach number is irrelevant. Once the speed of the flow approaches {{the speed of sound}}, however, the Mach number becomes all-important, and shock waves begin to appear. Thus the transonic regime is described by a different (and much more difficult) mathematical treatment. In the supersonic regime the flow is dominated by wave motion at oblique angles similar to the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle.</b> Above about Mach 5, these wave angles grow so small that a different mathematical approach is required, defining the Hypersonic speed regime. Finally, at speeds comparable to that of planetary atmospheric entry from orbit, in the range of several km/s, the speed of sound is now comparatively so slow that it is once again mathematically ignored in the Hypervelocity regime.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} self-similar (pseudo-steady) shock reflection at {{an oblique}} wall. There are three parameters: wall corner <b>angle,</b> <b>Mach</b> number, <b>angle</b> of incident shock. Ever since Ernst Mach discovered the irregular reflection named after him, {{it has been}} an open problem to predict precisely for what parameters the reflection is regular. Three conflicting proposals, the detachment, sonic and von Neumann criteria, have been studied extensively without a clear result. We demonstrate that the sonic criterion is not correct. We consider polytropic potential flow and prove that there is an open nonempty set of parameters that admit a global regular reflection with a reflected shock that is transonic. We also provide a clear physical reason: the flow type (sub- or supersonic) is not decisive; instead the reflected shock type (weak or strong) determines whether structural perturbations decay towards the reflection point. ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{an object}} accelerates from subsonic toward {{supersonic}} speed in a gas, {{different types of}} wave phenomena occur. To illustrate these changes, the next figure shows a stationary point (M = 0) that emits symmetric sound waves. The speed of sound is the same in all directions in a uniform fluid, so these waves are simply concentric spheres. As the sound-generating point begins to accelerate, the sound waves [...] "bunch up" [...] {{in the direction of}} motion and [...] "stretch out" [...] in the opposite direction. When the point reaches sonic speed (M = 1), it travels at the same speed as the sound waves it creates. Therefore, an infinite number of these sound waves [...] "pile up" [...] ahead of the point, forming a Shock wave. Upon achieving supersonic flow, the particle is moving so fast that it continuously leaves its sound waves behind. When this occurs, the locus of these waves trailing behind the point creates an angle known as the Mach wave angle or <b>Mach</b> <b>angle,</b> µ: ...|$|E
40|$|A century-long {{argument}} made by Lord Kelvin {{that all}} swimming objects have an effective Mach number of 3, {{corresponding to the}} Kelvin angle of 19. 5 degree for ship waves, has been recently challenged with {{the conclusion that the}} Kelvin angle should gradually transit to the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle</b> as the ship velocity increases. Here we show that a similar phenomenon can happen for graphene plasmons. By analyzing the caustic wave pattern of graphene plasmons stimulated by a swift charged particle moving uniformly above graphene, we show that at low velocities of the charged particle, the caustics of graphene plasmons form the Kelvin angle. At large velocities of the particle, the caustics disappear and the effective semi-angle of the wave pattern approaches the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle.</b> Our study introduces caustic wave theory to the field of graphene plasmonics, and reveals a novel physical picture of graphene plasmon excitation during electron energy-loss spectroscopy measurement.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that, {{in the case}} of an airfoil of {{infinite}} aspect ratio moving at an angle of sideslip, the pressure distribution is determined solely by that component of the motion in a direction normal to the leading edge. It follows that the attachment of plane waves to the airfoil at near-sonic or supersonic speeds (Ackeret theory) may be avoided and the pressure drag may be reduced by the use of plan forms in which the angle of sweepback is greater than the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle.</b> The analysis indicates that for aerodynamic efficiency, wings designed for flight at supersonic speeds should be swept back at an angle greater than the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle,</b> and the angle of sweepback should be such that the component of velocity normal to the leading edge is less than the critical speed of the airfoil sections. This principle may also be applied to wings designed for subsonic speeds near the speed of sound, for which the induced velocities resulting from the thickness might otherwise be sufficiently great to cause shock waves...|$|E
40|$|Through the {{development}} of the high altitude rocket interest has turned to the investigation of aerodynamic problems beyond the supersonic regime. This domain of speed has been termed hypersonic, meaning high Mach number flight in a homogeneous medium whose molecules describe negligible mean free paths with respect to a chosen characteristic dimension. The thesis presented given an extension of two-dimensional supersonic airfoil theory to attack the problem of getting aerodynamic coefficients for the double-wedge and biconvex airfoils. The shock wave equations along with those for Prandtl-Meyer flow have been modified by making approximations based on the hypersonic Mach numbers. These equations have been used to treat the following three cases: (A) The <b>Mach</b> <b>angle</b> is much less than the deflection angle. (B) The <b>Mach</b> <b>angle</b> is much greater than the deflection angle. (C) The <b>Mach</b> <b>angle</b> is of the same order of magnitude as the deflection angle. A brief discussion is made of the assumptions involved in {{the development}} of each of these flows to show that they do not violate basic principles. The hypersonic approximations already mentioned are then applied to these equations. In case (A) formulas are derived giving a quick approximation to the lift, drag, and moment coefficients. In case (B) formulas are found to be similar to those already obtained by the small perturbation method for supersonic flow. The results of case (C) show that a singular investigation must be made of each airfoil. The results of each of these cases are presented in the section titled "Applications to the Double-wedge and Biconvex Airfoils.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} of a fast moving particle in the Quark Gluon Plasma with linearized hydrodynamics. We derive the linearized hydrodynamic equations {{on top of an}} expanding fireball, and detail the solutions for a static medium. There are two modes far from the jet [...] a sound mode and a diffusion mode. The diffusion mode is localized in a narrow wake behind the jet while the sound mode propagates at the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle,</b> cos(θ_M) = c_s/c. A general argument shows that the strength of the diffusion mode relative to the sound mode is directly proportional to the entropy produced by the jet-medium interaction. This argument does not rely on the linearized approximation and the assumption of local thermal equilibrium close to the jet. With this insight we calculate the spectrum of secondaries associated with the fast moving particle. If the energy loss is large and the jet-medium interaction does not produce significant entropy, the flow at the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle</b> can be observed in the associated spectrum. However, the shape of associated spectra is quite fragile and sensitive to many of the inputs of the calculation. Comment: 31 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} derived for calculating the lift and the drag due to lift of point-forward {{triangular}} wings and a restricted series of sweptback wings at supersonic speeds. The elementary or "supersonic sources" {{solution of the}} linearized equation of motion is used to find the potential function {{of a line of}} doublets. The flow about the triangular flat plate is then obtained by a surface distribution of these doublet lines. The lift-curve slope of triangular wings is found to be a function of the ratio of the tangent of the apex angle to the tangent of the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle.</b> As the apex angle approaches and becomes greater than the <b>Mach</b> <b>angle,</b> the lift coefficient of the triangular wing becomes equal to that of a two-dimensional supersonic airfoil at the same Mach number. The drag coefficient due to lift of triangular wings with leading edges well behind the Mach cone is shown to be close to that of elliptically loaded wings of the same aspect ratio in subsonic flight. The resultant force on wings with leading edges outside the Mach cone, however, is shown to act normal to the surfaces and thus an induced drag equal to the lift times the angle of attack is obtained...|$|E
