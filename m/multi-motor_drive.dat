The motivation was to reduce the magnitude of common mode electrical noise in the system ground grid and to reduce occurrence of ground fault sensor trips {{as a result of}} this noise. The phenomenon of line to ground cable charging current (Ilg) during drive switching is a main component of zero sequence current and is discussed with basic equations describing its magnitude. Results of a high frequency characterization study of all components in the zero sequence path was required to obtain estimates of surge impedance for these equations.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} industrial applications, such as paper mills, locomotive traction, oil and gas, mining and machine tools, which require high performance control {{of more than}} one electric motor simultaneously. When more than one electric motors are employed in an electric drive, it is called, ‘multi‐motor drive’. These multi‐motor drives are generally available in two configurations. The first one consists of a number of three‐phase voltage source inverters connected in parallel to a common DC link, each inverter feeding a three‐phase AC motor. This configuration allows independent control of all machines by means of their own three‐phase voltage source inverters (VSIs). Nevertheless, this configuration needs n number of voltage source inverters for supplying n number of AC machines. The second configuration comprises one inverter, which feeds multiple parallel‐connected three‐phase motors. However, the later configuration does not allow independent control of each motor and is suitable only for traction application. The power converter supplying the drive system, are conventionally, voltage source inverters. However, alternative solution could be a direct AC‐AC converter that can supply the electric drive system. Exploring this alternative solution {{is the subject of this}} thesis. Thus for decoupled dynamic control of AC machines working in a group (<b>multi‐motor</b> <b>drive)</b> is possible by employing multi‐phase (more than three‐phase) motors, where their stator windings are connected in either series or in parallel and the combination is supplied from a single multi‐phase power converter. This thesis explores the control techniques of multi‐phase direct AC‐AC converter for such specific series and parallel‐connected multi‐phase motor drives. The research presented here utilises additional degrees of freedom available in a multi‐phase system to control a number of machines independently. The concept is based on the fact that independent flux and torque control of any AC machine, regardless of the number of stator phases requires control of only two stator current components. This leaves the remaining current components free to control other machines within the group. The multi‐phase <b>multi‐motor</b> <b>drive</b> system fed using multi‐phase direct AC‐AC converter need precise Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique to independently control the drive system. The subject of this research is to propose PWM techniques for such configurations. The thesis focuses on four different cases; five‐phase, six‐phase (symmetrical and asymmetrical), and seven‐phase system. Five‐phase and six‐phase drive systems consists of two motors, and seven‐phase drive system controls three motors. The thesis presents various PWM techniques aimed at these drive configuration. Carrier‐based, carrier‐based with harmonic injection and direct duty ratio based PWM techniques are presented in the thesis. The independence of control of various motors are shown by simulation and experimentation. Although, the proposed techniques are equally applicable to series‐connected drives and parallel‐connected drives, the thesis focuses on the former drive configuration.

The second method comprises one inverter, which feeds multiple parallel-connected three-phase motors. However, this configuration does not allow independent control of each motor and is suitable only for traction. This thesis explores a novel concept for <b>multi-motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems, based on utilization of multi-phase machines and VSIs, and series connection of all the machines in the group. Application of a single multi-phase VSI in conjunction with multi-phase machines generates additional degrees of freedom. The research presented here utilises these additional degrees of freedom to control a number of machines independently within a novel multi-phase multi-machine drive. The concept is {{based on the fact that}} independent flux and torque control of any AC machine, regardless of the number of stator phases requires control of only two stator current components. This leaves the remaining current components free to control other machines within the group. It is shown that it is possible to connect the machines in such a way that what one machine sees as the flux/torque producing components the other machines see as non-flux/torque producing components, and vice versa. Therefore it is possible to connect in series a number of multi-phase machines and independently control each machine while supplying them from a single multi-phase inverter. Different configurations of the <b>multi-motor</b> <b>drive</b> are possible depending on certain properties of the supply phase number. In general, higher the supply phase number is, higher the number of connectable machines is. However, some phase numbers are more favourable than others, as discussed in detail in the thesis. Simulation studies are provided for five, six, seven, nine, ten and fifteen phase configurations in order to verify the concept. It is shown that the concept is independent of the type of AC machines used and the only requirement is that they all have sinusoidal distributed magnetomotive force. Current control in both the stationary and rotating reference frames is considered and it is concluded that current control in the rotating reference frame requires compensation of the additional voltage drops caused by the series connection. Two possible methods of compensating for these voltage drops are suggested and verified by simulation. Finally, a laboratory rig is described, which utilises two three-phase inverters connected in such a way as to form a single six-phase inverter. A six-phase two-motor drive comprising a symmetrical six-phase induction machine and a three-phase induction machine or a three-phaseP MSM is investigatede xperimentally. An analysis of the performance of the two-motor drive is presented and it is shown that decoupled control of each machine is achieved...|$|E
40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{spread of}} automation in industry puts the electrical engineer {{in a central}} role as a promoter of technological development in a sector {{such as the use}} of electricity, which is the basis of all the machinery and productive processes. Moreover the spread of drives for motor control and static converters with structures ever more complex, places the electrical engineer to face new challenges whose solution has as critical elements in the implementation of digital control techniques with the requirements of inexpensiveness and efficiency of the final product. The successfully application of solutions using non-conventional static converters awake an increasing interest in science and industry due to the promising opportunities. However, in the same time, new problems emerge whose solution is still under study and debate in the scientific community During the Ph. D. course several themes have been developed that, while obtaining the recent and growing interest of scientific community, have much space for the development of research activity and for industrial applications. The first area of research is related to the control of three phase induction motors with high dynamic performance and the sensorless control in the high speed range. The management of the operation of induction machine without position or speed sensors awakes interest in the industrial world due to the increased reliability and robustness of this solution combined with a lower cost of production and purchase of this technology compared to the others available in the market. During this dissertation control techniques will be proposed which are able to exploit the total dc link voltage and at the same time capable to exploit the maximum torque capability in whole speed range with good dynamic performance. The proposed solution preserves the simplicity of tuning of the regulators. Furthermore, in order to validate the effectiveness of presented solution, it is assessed in terms of performance and complexity and compared to two other algorithm presented in literature. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is also tested on induction motor drive fed by a matrix converter. Another important research area is connected to the development of technology for vehicular applications. In this field the dynamic performances and the low power consumption is one of most important goals for an effective algorithm. Towards this direction, a control scheme for induction motor that integrates within a coherent solution some of the features that are commonly required to an electric vehicle drive is presented. The main features of the proposed control scheme are the capability to exploit the maximum torque in the whole speed range, a weak dependence on the motor parameters, a good robustness against the variations of the dc-link voltage and, whenever possible, the maximum efficiency. The second part of this dissertation is dedicated to the multi-phase systems. This technology, in fact, is characterized by a number of issues worthy of investigation that make it competitive with other technologies already on the market. Multiphase systems, allow to redistribute power at a higher number of phases, thus making possible the construction of electronic converters which otherwise would be very difficult to achieve due to the limits of present power electronics. Multiphase drives have an intrinsic reliability given by the possibility that a fault of a phase, caused by the possible failure of a component of the converter, can be solved without inefficiency of the machine or application of a pulsating torque. The control of the magnetic field spatial harmonics in the air-gap with order higher than one allows to reduce torque noise and to obtain high torque density motor and multi-motor applications. In one of the next chapters a control scheme able to increase the motor torque by adding a third harmonic component to the air-gap magnetic field will be presented. Above the base speed the control system reduces the motor flux in such a way to ensure the maximum torque capability. The presented analysis considers the drive constrains and shows how these limits modify the motor performance. The multi-motor applications are described by a well-defined number of multiphase machines, having series connected stator windings, with an opportune permutation of the phases these machines can be independently controlled with a single multi-phase inverter. In this dissertation this solution will be presented and an electric drive consisting of two five-phase PM tubular actuators fed by a single five-phase inverter will be presented. Finally the modulation strategies for a multi-phase inverter will be illustrated. The problem of the space vector modulation of multiphase inverters with an odd number of phases is solved in different way. An algorithmic approach and a look-up table solution will be proposed. The inverter output voltage capability will be investigated, showing that the proposed modulation strategy is able to fully exploit the dc input voltage either in sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal operating conditions. All this aspects are considered in the next chapters. In particular, Chapter 1 summarizes the mathematical model of induction motor. The Chapter 2 is a brief state of art on three-phase inverter. Chapter 3 proposes a stator flux vector control for a three- phase induction machine and compares this solution with two other algorithms presented in literature. Furthermore, in the same chapter, a complete electric drive based on matrix converter is presented. In Chapter 4 a control strategy suitable for electric vehicles is illustrated. Chapter 5 describes the mathematical model of multi-phase induction machines whereas chapter 6 analyzes the multi-phase inverter and its modulation strategies. Chapter 7 discusses the minimization of the power losses in IGBT multi-phase inverters with carrier-based pulse width modulation. In Chapter 8 an extended stator flux vector control for a seven-phase induction motor is presented. Chapter 9 concerns the high torque density applications and in Chapter 10 different fault tolerant control strategies are analyzed. Finally, the last chapter presents a positioning <b>multi-motor</b> <b>drive</b> consisting of two PM tubular five-phase actuators fed by a single five-phase inverter. ...|$|E
40|$|A huge body of {{work has}} been {{published}} in recent times {{in the area of}} multi-phase machines and drives. Many aspects of these drives have been analysed, such as reduction of torque pulsations, increased reliability and fault tolerance, improved power sharing capabilities and possibilities for realisation of series-connected <b>multi-motor</b> <b>drives</b> with supply coming from a single multi-phase voltage source inverter (VSI). Various pulse width modulation (PWM) schemes have been developed for multi-phase machines with concentrated and distributed windings, utilising both carrier-based PWM and space vector PWM (SVPWM) approaches. However, no systematic analysis has been performed in order to determine properties of multi-phase PWM in general, and to establish close correlation between carrier-based PWM and space vertor PWM, for multi-phase VSIs. This thesis presents an analysis and development of multi-phase PWM schemes for sinusoidal output voltage generation with two-level muhi-phase VSIs, which are suitable for multi-phase machines with distributed windings. Therefore, attention is paid to the elimination of low order harmonics. The scope of the thesis has been narrowed down to the continuous PWM schemes and operation in the linear region of the modulation only. Both multi-phase carrier-based PWM and SVPWM schemes are considered, and, in particular, five-phase, seven-phase e-phase systems are addressed in detail. Thus, a strong link between these two different approaches is established, allowing for an easier comparison of the features offered by each method. All PWM schemes are practically implemented in a DSP and experimentally verified through extensive experimentation on the custom-built multi-phase VSI. In addition to the methods of sinusoidal output voltage generation, achieved by means of the synthesis of the reference in only the first plane of the multi-phase system with simultaneous zeroing of voltages in all the other planes.
