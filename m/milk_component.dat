40|$|To {{study the}} genetic basis of tick burden and milk {{production}} and their interrelationship, we collected {{a sample of}} 1961 cattle with multiple tick counts from northern Australia of which 973 had dairy production data in the Australian Dairy Herd Information Service database. We calculated heritabilities, genetic and phenotypic correlations for these traits and showed a negative relationship between tick counts and milk and <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> yield. Tests of polymorphisms of four genes associated with milk yield, ABCG 2, DGAT 1, GHR and PRLR, showed no statistically significant effect on tick burden but highly significant associations to <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> yield in these data and we confirmed separate effects for GHR and PRLR on bovine chromosome 20. To begin to identify some of the molecular genetic bases for these traits, we genotyped a sample of 189 of these cattle for 7397 single nucleotide polymorphisms in a genome-wide association study. Although the allele effects for adjusted milk fat and protein yield were highly correlated (r = 0. 66), the correlations of allele effects of these <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> yields and tick burden were small (|r| <= 0. 10). These results agree in general with the phenotypic correlations between tick counts and <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> yield and suggest that selection on markers for tick burden or <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> yield may have no undesirable effect on the other trait...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{examined}} {{a total of}} 518 milk samples on the following parameters: somatic cell count (SCC), total bacteria count (CFU and IBC), fat, protein, lactose and dry matter non fat (DMNF) contents, which were obtained from primiparous cows divided in three groups depending {{on the stage of}} lactation: the first group included the primiparous cows that were 10 - 100 days in lactation, the second group 101 - 200 days in lactation and the third group 201 and more days in lactation. The somatic cell count and the total bacterial count had highest values for the first group, intermediate for the third group, and lowest for the second group with these differences being statistically significant. <b>Milk</b> <b>component</b> contents varied among groups differently from previous two parameters but their differences were not significant in neither case. The somatic cell count of all three groups was positively and significantly correlated to the bacterial counts while these two parameters were generally in negative correlation with the <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> contents. No matter if the parameters that define the milk hygienic safety were positively or negatively correlated with the <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> contents, the correlation coefficients were not significant in neither case, which implies that significant reduction of milk components can be expected at somatic cell counts higher than the maximal obtained in this research of 236. 000 SCC/ml...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOur {{objectives}} were {{to determine if}} mixing and sampling of a raw milk sample at 4 °C for determination of total bacteria count (TBC) and if incubation at 14 °C for 18 h and sampling for a preliminary incubation (PI) count influenced the accuracy of subsequent fat, protein, or lactose measurement by mid-infrared (IR) analysis of milk from the same sample container due to either nonrepresentative sampling or the presence of microbial metabolites produced by microbial growth in the milk from the incubation. Milks of 4 fat levels (2. 2, 3, 4, and 5 %) reflected the range of fat levels encountered in producer milks. If the portion of milk removed from a cold sample was not representative, then the effect on a <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> test would likely be larger as fat content increases. Within the milks at each fat level, 3 treatments were used: (1) 20 vials of the same milk sampled for testing TBC using a BactoScan FC and then used for a <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> test; (2) 20 vials for testing TBC plus PI count followed by component test; and (3) 20 vials to run for IR component test without a prior micro sampling and testing. This was repeated in 3 different weeks using a different batch of milk each week. No large effect on the accuracy of component milk testing [IR fat B (carbon hydrogen stretch) and fat A (carbonyl stretch) ] due to the cold milk sample handling and mixing procedures used for TBC was detected, confirming {{the fact that the}} physical removal of milk from the vial by the BactoScan FC (Foss Electric, Hillerød, Denmark) was a representative portion of the milk. However, the representativeness of any other sampling procedure (manual or automated) of a cold milk sample before running <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> testing on the same container of milk should be demonstrated and verified periodically as a matter of routine laboratory quality assurance. Running TBC with a BactoScan FC first and then IR milk analysis after had a minimal effect on <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> tests by IR when milk bacteria counts were within pasteurized milk ordinance limits of < 100, 000 cfu/mL. Running raw milk PI counts (18 h of incubation at 13 – 14 °C) with the BactoScan FC before <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> testing by IR milk analysis had an effect on component tests. The effect was largest on fat test results and would decrease the accuracy of milk payment testing on individual producer milks. The effect was most likely due to the absorption of light by bacterial metabolites resulting from microbial growth or other chemical degradation processes occurring in the milk during the PI count incubation, not by the sampling procedure of the BactoScan. The direction of the effect on component test results will vary depending on the bacteria count and the type of bacteria that grew in the milk, and this could be different in every individual producer milk sample...|$|E

In this study, we injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS), {{one of the}} endotoxins from Escherichia coli into mouse mammary glands to disrupt milk production, and we investigated the influence of LPS on nutrient uptake, synthesis, and secretion processes for <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> production in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). The expression of genes relevant to the three-staged <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> production process (nutrient uptake, synthesis, and secretion of milk components) were down-regulated within 12 h after LPS injection in AEC. The internalization of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT- 1) from the basolateral membrane to the cytoplasm occurred {{in accordance with the}} down-regulation of gene expression 3 h after LPS injection. The abnormal localization of adipophilin and beta-casein was also observed in the LPS-injected mammary glands. SLC 7 A 1, an amino acid transporter, was up-regulated 3 and 6 h after LPS injection. Furthermore, the inactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT 5) and the activation of STAT 3 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkappaB) occurred 3 h after LPS injection.

40|$|Milk {{protein is}} the most {{valuable}} <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> for which dairy producers receive payment. Despite its high value, altering milk protein composition and production in dairy cows by diet has been challenging, particularly as compared to altering milk fat. Improving the efficiency of conversion of dietary nitrogen into productive nitrogen (as milk protein) has both financial and environmental benefits to the dairy industry. Dietary strategies to improve milk protein yield have focused on amino acid requirements, metabolizable protein, and the interaction between dietary energy and protein. However, dietary interventions have had only moderate success in improving milk protein production in well-fed dairy cows. Use of long-term hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in lactating cows has suggested that milk protein synthesis in dairy cows is not maximized under normal management conditions, as significant improvements in milk protein have been observed in this experimental context. The goal of the present research was to expand on these observations by administering slow-release insulins, from human medicine, to lactating dairy cows. The hypothesis was that administration of slow-release insulins, without provision of supplemental glucose, would increase milk protein production and alter mammary metabolism in lactating dairy cows. In experiment one, two forms of slow-release insulin were tested in a dose response study. Both Humulin-N (H) and insulin glargine (L) exerted insulin-like effects in lactating dairy cows, evidenced by linear decreases of plasma glucose with increasing dose of slow-release insulin. In experiment two, H and L were given twice daily for 10 days to evaluate their effects on <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> production. Milk fat and protein content were both increased by treatment with H and L, suggesting that these forms of slow-release insulin alter metabolism and <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> synthesis. In experiment three, L was used in a mammary metabolism study to examine its effects on mammary uptake and utilization of substrates for protein synthesis. Reduced uptake of both essential and nonessential amino acids was observed during treatment with L, while milk protein yield remained {{the same for the}} control and treatment periods. This suggests that L alters metabolism and increases amino acid efficiency of use within the cow...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{meta-analysis}} of literature data, this study aimed {{to quantify the}} dry matter (DM) intake response to changes in diet composition, and milk responses (yield, <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> yields and milk composition) to changes in dietary net energy for lactation (NEL) and metabolizable protein (MP) in dairy cows. From all studies included in the database, 282 experiments (825 treatments) with experimentally induced changes in either NEL or MP content were kept for this analysis. These treatments covered {{a wide range of}} diet characteristics and therefore {{a large part of the}} plausible NEL and MP contents and supplies that can be expected in practical situations. The average MP and NEL contents were, respectively (mean±SD), 97 ± 12 g/kg DM and 6. 71 ± 0. 42 MJ/kg DM. On a daily supply basis, there were high between-experiment correlations for MP and NEL above maintenance. Therefore, supplies of MP and NEL above maintenance were, respectively, centred on MP supply for which MP efficiency into milk protein is 0. 67, and NEL above maintenance supply for which the ratio of NEL milk/NEL above maintenance is 1. 00 (centred variables were called MP 67 and NEL 100). The majority of the selected studies used groups of multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows in mid lactation, milked twice a day. Using a mixed model, between- and within-experiment variation was split to estimate DM intake and milk responses. The use of NEL 100 and MP 67 supplies substantially improved the accuracy of the prediction of milk yield and <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> yields responses with, on average, a 27 % lower root mean square error (RMSE) relative to using dietary NEL and MP contents as predictors. For milk composition (g/kg), the average RMSE was only 3 % lower on a supply basis compared with a concentration basis. Effects of NEL and MP supplies on milk yield and <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> yields responses were additive. Increasing NEL supply increases energy partitioning towards body reserve, whereas increasing MP supply increases the partition of energy towards milk. On a nitrogen basis, the marginal efficiency decreases with increasing MP supply from 0. 34 at MP 67 =− 400 g/day to 0. 07 at MP 67 = 300 g/day. This difference in MP 67 supply, assuming reference energy level of NEL 100 = 0, equates to a global nitrogen efficiency decrease from 0. 82 to 0. 58. The equations accurately describe DM intake response to change in dietary contents and milk responses to change in dietary supply and content of NEL and MP across a wide range of dietary compositions...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Historically, most cows {{enrolled}} in a milk recording program in the United States have had milk weights recorded monthly (Voelker 1981). However, practices for collecting milk and component data have been changing rapidly. Over 30 innovative test plans were introduced between 1989 and 1995.

Often cows in innovative test programs are recorded less frequently than monthly, and some cows have as few as three <b>milk</b> <b>component</b> samples tested per year. For other innovative test plans, however, milk weights are recorded more frequently than before because technological development has made electronic recording feasible.

Average yield of <b>milk</b> and its <b>components</b> was found to increase in all milk recorded cows. Changes in the relationship between basic <b>milk</b> <b>components</b> differed between the breeds. A decrease in fat content was found in the milk from Polish Black-and-White Holstein-Friesian, Jersey, Montbeliarde and Polish Red-and-White cows, and an increase in protein content was recorded in the milk from Polish Black-and-White Holstein-Friesian, Polish Red-and-White, Simmental and Montbeliarde cows. These changes had a favourable effect on the PFR ratio in Polish Holstein-Friesian cows, especially those of the Black-and-White variety. Calving interval and age at first calving were found to increase in all the cows except the Montbeliarde breed...|$|R
