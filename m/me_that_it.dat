25|$|I'm {{a little}} baffled {{as to why}} Stirling set this book in 1998. It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{requires}} more suspension of disbelief to pretend the world ended {{in the past when}} we know it didn't.|$|E
25|$|While {{there have}} been {{animated}} cartoons based on these giant robots, {{no one has ever}} attempted a live-action feature about them. It struck <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a natural fantasy for the big screen–and a terrific opportunity {{to take advantage of the}} special effects that are available today.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E

25|$|My friend, space lawyer Andrew G. Haley, {{who likes}} to explore {{historical}} questions as a hobby, later told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is likely that the}} Russians – and not the Germans as is popularly supposed – founded the first rocket society in the world. At least Moscow had an interplanetary travel group as early as 1924, and three years later, at the time the Germans founded their first rocket society, the Russians were hosts to the first International Exhibition of Space Navigation. In 1928 and during the following four years Professor Nikolai Rynin published a formidable nine-volume encyclopedia entitled Interplanetary Communications. It was the first authoritative summary of man’s knowledge of space travel.|$|E
25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E
500|$|Another interpretation, that avoids duality, is the De Broglie–Bohm theory: known also as the pilot-wave model. In that theory, the photon is both, {{wave and}} particle. [...] "This idea {{seems to me}} so natural and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and {{ordinary}} way, {{that it is a}} great mystery to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was so generally ignored", J.S.Bell.|$|E

500|$|McCudden, {{watching}} from 900meters (3,000feet), recalled: [...] "I saw him {{go into a}} fairly steep dive and so I continued to watch, and then saw the triplane hit the ground and disappear into a thousand fragments, for it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> literally went into powder." [...] There would be debate later whether Voss {{dropped out of the}} inverted triplane.|$|E
500|$|Einstein often {{referred}} to the [...] "inner voice" [...] {{as a source of}} both moral and physical knowledge: [...] "Quantum mechanics is very impressive. But an inner voice tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings one closer to the secrets of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice." ...|$|E
500|$|At first, their {{relationship}} followed the Nation of Islam's strictures concerning marriage; MalcolmX set {{the rules and}} BettyX obediently followed them. In 1969, Shabazz wrote that [...] "his indoctrination was so thorough, even to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has become a pattern for our [...] lives." [...] Over time, the family dynamic changed, as MalcolmX made small concessions to BettyX's demands for more independence. In 1969, Shabazz recalled: ...|$|E

500|$|This terrible anti-American {{academic}} {{has finally}} passed away...The obits and commentaries mentioned his book, ‘A People’s History of the United States,’ is the ‘textbook {{of choice in}} high schools and colleges around the country.’ It is a truly execrable, anti-factual piece of disinformation that misstates American history on every page. Can someone assure <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not in use anywhere in Indiana? If it is, {{how do we get}} rid of it before more young people are force-fed a totally false version of our history? ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{tried to}} put {{different}} things in the video {{that made me feel}} under pressure and it really did! It was the hardest video I`ve ever done so I kept thinking, why on earth did I come up with this concept? People don’t realise but I definitely have that Australian tomboy side to me. I love snakes and sharks and jumping out of planes and stuff. Growing up it never occurred to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> wasn’t a girly thing to ride a bike, covered in mud holding frogs and collecting lizards!".|$|E
500|$|Sanders met MalcolmX {{again at}} a dinner party. The two had a long {{conversation}} about Sanders's life: her childhood in Detroit, the racial hostility she had encountered in Alabama, and her studies in New York. He spoke to her {{about the condition of}} African Americans and the causes of racism. Sanders began to see things from a different perspective. [...] "I really had a lot of pent-up anxiety about my experience in the South," [...] Shabazz recalled in a 1990 interview, [...] "and Malcolm reassured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was understandable how I felt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then hadn't {{you better}} pump her out?" [...] {{retorted}} Vane. [...] "After that, you can light the stove. It's beginning to dawn on <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> {{a long while}} since I had anything to eat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my dear," [...] he continued, as {{they went}} on, [...] "do you tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> decent {{for men and women}} on the stage to writhe about like eels? Is n't life bad enough already?" ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{preceded by}} {{the release of the}} first single, [...] "Don't Tell <b>Me</b> <b>That</b> <b>It's</b> Over", a week earlier on 1 March 2010. The single was {{released}} to UK radio on 11 January. Amy performed the new single on the Simon Mayo Show on BBC Radio 2 on the same day. [...] "Don't Tell <b>Me</b> <b>That</b> <b>It's</b> Over" [...] has been released to radio in countries like UK, Switzerland, Germany and France. The album's second single [...] "Spark" [...] was released on 10 May 2010 on digital download format. Macdonald also confirmed that she would tour the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe in 2010.|$|R
500|$|A {{textbook}} for {{an advanced}} undergraduate course. [...] "Experience has convinced <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is pedagogically unsound (though logically correct) {{to start off}} with the construction of the real numbers from the rational ones. At the beginning, most students simply fail to appreciate the need for doing this. Accordingly, the real number system is introduced as an ordered field with the least-upper-bound property, and a few interesting applications of this property are quickly made. However, Dedekind's construction is not omitted. It is now in an Appendix to Chapter 1, where it may be studied and enjoyed whenever the time is ripe." [...] (p. ix) ...|$|E
500|$|Lucinda Dalton was {{the fourth}} wife of Charles Wakeman Dalton, and {{they were married in}} 1868. Lucinda resented the {{expectation}} that she be meek and obedient in her marriage. Charles assured her that husbands have obligations to their wives as wives do to their husbands. She {{came to the conclusion that}} she should marry Charles because of a spiritual witness they experienced together: [...] "I felt that we were in the presence of the hosts of heaven; and a direct incontrovertible testimony was given <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the will of God and not my will that I should accept this man for my yokefellow." ...|$|E
500|$|A little {{matter that}} seems to have been {{overlooked}} by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration, and it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort. [...] As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years. [...] I should think also it might be the coin of which the greatest numbers are in circulation.|$|E
5000|$|Of the song, Greenbaum observed: [...] "It {{sounds as}} fresh today as {{when it was}} recorded. I’ve gotten letters from funeral {{directors}} telling <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> their second-most-requested song to play at memorial services, next to 'Danny Boy'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kevin J. Coyne of Country Universe {{gave the}} song an A rating. [...] "It’s no {{surprise}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it’s</b> a charming record, perfectly produced and expertly sung. And, as usual, it’s just offbeat enough to be genuinely different from anything else on the radio." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Don't Tell <b>Me</b> <b>That</b> <b>It's</b> Over" [...] is {{the first}} single {{released}} from Scottish singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald's (born 25 August 1987 in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire) second studio album, A Curious Thing, released on 26 February 2010 in Germany and on 1 March 2010 in the United Kingdom.|$|R
500|$|In December, {{the couple}} held an {{elaborate}} Christmas party at Brede, attended by Conrad, Henry James, H. G. Wells and other friends; it lasted several days. On December 29 Crane suffered a severe pulmonary hemorrhage. In January 1900 he'd recovered sufficiently {{to work on}} a new novel, The O'Ruddy, completing 25 of the 33chapters. Plans were made for him to travel as a correspondent to Gibraltar to write sketches from Saint Helena, the site of a Boer prison, {{but at the end of}} March and in early April he suffered two more hemorrhages. Taylor took over most of Crane's correspondence while he was ill, writing to friends for monetary aid. The couple planned to travel on the continent, but Conrad, upon visiting Crane for the last time, remarked that his friend's [...] "wasted face was enough to tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the most forlorn of all hopes." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the bidding}} process and {{leading up to}} the vote at the 117th IOC Session, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, {{particularly}} as its bid was the city's third in recent history (previous bids being for 1992 and 2008). London was originally seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin, but this situation began to reverse with the appointment of Sebastian Coe as the head of London 2012, on 19 May 2004. In late August 2004, reports emerged that predicted a tie between London and Paris. In the final run-up to the 117th IOC Session, London and Paris appeared to be in an increasingly close contest. On 1 July 2005, IOC president Jacques Rogge, when asked who the winner would be, told the assembled press, [...] "I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who {{came up to me and}} asked me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{means you}} agree with <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> the punkest state of things you ever struck. Well, you're quite right. It is. It's a shame {{to think of that}} {{innocent}} kid having this sort of deal handed to him. Why, just think of him at the studio!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have tried}} {{striking}} piecemeal," [...] Maraton pointed out. [...] "It doesn't seem to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a success. What {{is called the}} Government here can deal with one strike at a time. They've soldiers enough, and law enough, for that. They haven't for a universal strike." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he said dryly; [...] "and, of course, if {{you tell}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a private affair of your own and none of my business, why I'll be quite satisfied, and not ask any more questions. But if it's {{anything}} to do with Béla [...] . . ." ...|$|R
