40|$|Which Brazilian {{policy for}} regionalism? Discourse and {{institutional}} development in Mercosur La política brasileña en materia de regionalismo. Discurso y desarrollo institucional en el Mercosur Marcelo de Almeida Medeiros* Clarissa Franzoi Dri** During the past decade, Mercosur has been insistently presented as {{the priority of}} Brazilian foreign policy. Nevertheless, in this period regional integration has neither deepened nor enlarged. This article aims to ex-plain this gap between discourse and practice by examining how Brazil’s regionalism policy is characterized. The analysis {{is based on a}} case study of the creation of <b>Mercosur’s</b> <b>Parliament</b> in 2006. Theoretically, we argue that discursive institutionalism and international regimes theory can largely account for the detachment of Brazil from Mercosur and the limited interdependence that has been built among these countries. The conclusion points to the induction of a low-impact regionalism that facilitates Brazil’s actions at the international level...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} <b>Mercosur's</b> <b>Parliament</b> within <b>Mercosur’s</b> institutional design and decision-making process by associating its institutional arrangements to potential outcomes over representativeness. Generally, it discusses how representative Mercosur’s chosen mechanism for ruling seats in its Parliament, the so-called “citizen representation”, is and how that might affect coordination trends and solutions concerning political conflicts. Hence, the article investigates such mechanism {{in terms of its}} consequences for representativeness. The method relies on a Game Theoretical perspective through the application of the Banzhaf Index, which seeks to precisely measure the power of each player as their capacity to influence decisions. The article shows that, although the criteria used by the “citizen representation” is more representative than the previously used mechanism (in which all of Mercosur’s member-states had the same number of seats) in terms of the actual population within Mercosur, not all the changes brought by the mechanism are an advance when it comes to democratic participation. Brazil will be the most powerful in influencing the final decision once the mechanism is fully implemented; Argentina, in turn, will have the same amount of power in influencing the final outcome than will have Venezuela even though its population is 30 % larger than the latter...|$|R

40|$|URL] audienceSince the 1960 s, its constructors and theoreticians {{started to}} {{consider}} European integration {{as a model}} {{with the potential to}} be exported to other continents. Community institutions have thus developed an exportation policy of their conceptions and mechanisms, which states desiring to embark on the regional venture supported with technical and financial support. This is precisely the case of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), established by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, in 1991. After a long period of negotiations, the <b>Mercosur</b> <b>Parliament</b> was created in 2006. This article analyzes to what extent the European Union (EU) has influenced the institutionalization of this assembly. How was this institutional transfer organized, and which elements of the European experience do the actors involved {{in the creation of the}} Parliament effectively keep? To answer these questions, the article is divided into three parts. The first part presents a literature review of Europe's historical actions and movements toward Latin America and of the development of Mercosur, the second part considers the central policies carried out by the EU in the attempt to export its model, and the third part compares some features of the European Parliament and the <b>Mercosur</b> <b>Parliament</b> to identify the achievements of the institutional transfer...|$|E

It is argued that this experience, in response to globalization, must be discussed related to the elements that distinguish the "negative modernity", which includes the permanent diffi culty of systemic-functional differentiation of its various subsystems. This fundamental point to describe the "negative modernity" is here mobilized as an explanatory factor for the diffi culties of establishing a transnational parliament in the peripheral capitalism...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the proposals under {{discussion in the}} Brazilian Congress concerning the direct elections for <b>Mercosur</b> <b>Parliament</b> (Parlasur), originally planned to be held on 2014. The proposed rules are investigated {{in order to find}} out which changes may impact the profile of the new representation to be elected and the consequences by either strengthening or weakening the institutional role of Brazilian representation in Parlasur. Pending electoral legislation for Parlasur may represent the most important experiment in political reform in the country in recent years - changing the open list of candidates to the closed list (with strict party nomination), prohibiting party coalitions, establishing exclusive public financing of campaigns, besides rules targeting gender equality. Notwithstanding, if members of congress do not strengthen reform to provide a more robust institutional framework, Brazilian representation in Parlasur will be weakened rather than strengthened...|$|E
40|$|Some {{processes}} of integration include a parliamentary body in their institutional structures. This paper combines basic premises of neofunctionalism and intergovernmentalism {{to address the}} origin and further evolution of regional parliaments, including the necessary precautions when applying European approaches of integration to other regions. With these postulates in mind, we outline {{an explanation of the}} way in which two regional parliaments, the European Parliament and the <b>Mercosur</b> <b>Parliament,</b> emerged and developed. The combination of approaches allows us to affirm that States are important and powerful actors, but the role of regional institutions and transnational actors cannot be ignored. However, comparative analysis shows that while in Europe the dynamics of the process of integration has feedback mechanisms beyond the control of States, in the Mercosur the influence of national Governments is overwhelming and prevents any "self-reinforcing" dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{signature}} of the <b>MERCOSUR</b> <b>Parliament</b> Constitutive Protocol, in 2005, has opened new parliamentary perspectives to the integration process which {{takes place in the}} South Cone. The nomination “parliament”, the universal suffrage prevision and new legislative and control functions evidence possibilities for an outstanding actuation. But is it possible to consider that this new organ was created in the middle of political conditions favorable to an effective functionality? Looking for traces to an answer, the paper examines political and electoral characteristics common to the South American States. First, we study the daily relations between the Executive and Legislative Powers in South American presidential regimes. Then, we verify to what extent the proportional open-list electoral system, largely used in the election of the lower houses members in the continent, influences such relations. At the end, we discuss the new assembly perspectives of effectiveness based on the regional characteristics studied...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{conclusion}} of the Treaty of Asunción in 1991, the member states of MERCOSUR made an agreement to create a Common Market. However, this integration regime did not create a jurisdictional institution like the Court of Justice of the European Union. The <b>MERCOSUR</b> <b>Parliament</b> proposed in 2010 a Protocol that would modify the institutional order established by creating a Court of Justice. This Court will replace the current Permanent Court of Review and will dispose of large competences to supervise the current legislation and to control its standard application. The rule that will set up the new Court is inspired by the ones that govern the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the Court of Justice of the Andean Community. However, some differences should be pointed out. Even if this project foresees the evolution of the current dispute settlement system, certain obstacles are difficult to overcome until the Protocol comes into effect...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Mercosur</b> <b>Parliament</b> {{was created}} in 2005 to {{represent}} {{the peoples of the}} region. The constitutive documents affirm the necessity of reinforcing and deepening integration and democracy within Mercosur through an efficient and balanced institutional structure. In order to examine the potential role of the Parliament in strengthening the institutional framework of the bloc, this paper aims to analyze its first years of activities. What is the institutionalization degree reached by the assembly so far? The research is grounded on the idea that the more institutionalized the legislature is, the more it will influence the political system. The article carries a comparative approach that considers the earliest steps of the European Parliament. In terms of methodology, the qualitative analysis is based on documental research and on some direct observations of Mercosur Parliament’s meetings. The main conclusions are related to the restricted level of institutionalization of this new assembly, in spite of its innovative features regarding the Mercosur structure, and to its proximity with the initial period of the European Parliament...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Mercosur</b> <b>Parliament</b> (Parlasur), {{created in}} December 2006, is often {{considered}} an important institutional achievement. Although Parliamentâ€™s functions and competences are not large, {{it should be}} formed by directly elected representatives. Its Constitutive Protocol affirms the necessity of reinforcing and deepening the integration process. According to the document, {{it is essential to}} have an efficient and balanced institutional structure, which would contribute to the production of effective norms in an atmosphere of security and stability. Official speeches from Executive and Legislative authorities of member states tend to go in the same direction, asserting the democratic role of the assembly. Consequently, expectations about the performance of Parlasur are high among non-state actors involved with the integration process: some seem to believe that this new institution could conduct more vigorously the discussions to the political and social spheres, which would allow Mercosur to transcend the commercial aspects and strengthen the integration framework. If we accept the idea that the more institutionalized the legislature is, the more it will influence the political system, the institutionalization level of Parlasur can indicate at what extend these prospects are valid. This paper has therefore a double objective. First, it aims at analyzing the limited institutionalization of the assembly in terms of autonomy, complexity, universalization and socialization. Second, it searches to explain the gap between discourses about Parlasur and its current actions. The qualitative research intends to confront public declarations with minutes and verbatim reports of plenary sessions as well as with interviews conducted with members of the Parliament and national civil servants. The conclusions will hopefully help to understand the place of Parlasur within the rhetorical integration of Mercosur and its concrete possibilities of influencing regionalism and democracy in Latin America...|$|E
40|$|This {{issue of}} the INTERthesis, which, for {{technical}} reasons, is being released {{in the month of}} May of 2008, corresponds to the second semester of 2007. In the search of bigger efficiency in the management of articles received, and the prompt reply to the authors, we are implanting an electronic management system, task which, at a first moment, demands time and hard work; the effort, however, will certainly make things faster in a near future. As well as the other editions of the Journal, the articles assembled here evidence the multiplicity of speeches and areas of knowledge, characteristics of the Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Human Sciences (DICH) of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). The diversity of proposed approaches in these texts allows closeness among several areas of knowledge and speeches characterized by a critical way of looking at our present and our history. The Journal opens with an article by Luis David Castiel, recognized researcher of the National School of Public Health of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (ENSP/Fiocruz), associate publisher of the prestigious ` Notebooks of Public Health Journal' and author of several books and writings dedicated to explore the interfaces between the health sciences and the human sciences. In the article that we publish here, Castiel discusses, one more time, in a discerning and critical way, the problematic of the risk which was also his approach in other studies. However, this time, the author carries through an inciting sociological analysis concerning the {{issue of the}} Brazilian youth identity in relation to the risks in the contemporary culture. The text proposes to discuss the construction of fluid identities in a society marked by the precariousness and the excesses of several kinds, and the consequent attitudes of exposition (adventure) and avoidance (prevention) taken over by the youth. The second article also refers to the youth, and it is dedicated to an evaluation of the university experiences. The author, Muhammad Imran Yousuf, of the Rawalpindi University of Pakistan Department of Education, presents an empirical study performed among a thousand students of twenty universities, reaching unexpected conclusions on the importance of the parents’ role over the professors’ role in the conquest and consolidation of their university performance and their formation abilities as future professionals. Continuing with the thematic of education, Roberto Carlos Simões Galvão, Master in Fundaments of Education from the State University of Maringá (UEM), presents an analysis of Francis Bacon’s thought (1561 - 1626) and its contributions to Education. The author analyzes specifically Bacon’s desire to promote a reorganization of the mastery of the human knowledge, and the impact that this reorganization of knowledge can have over the mastery of Education. Next, Clarissa Franzoi Dri, PhD student at the Institute of Political Studies of the Montesquieu University - Bordeaux IV, questions the perspectives of the Constitutive Protocol of the <b>Mercosur</b> <b>Parliament,</b> signed in 2005, evaluating the difficulties and the perspectives of this fact according to the existing political patterns in South America. The fifth article, by Antonio Manoel Elíbio Júnior, PhD in Social History from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), with the suggestive, intriguing name of: “Without some sort of reaction, won’t we be doomed?”, approaches the political rows of the constitutionalist revolution that in 1932, starting in São Paulo, reached Rio Grande do Sul. The article analyzes the arguments of the Constituent National Assembly in Rio Grande Do Sul, and the resetting of the political forces between the years of 1932 and 1934. The next article by Izabel Cristina of Santos Teixeira, Professor of Literature and Portuguese Language at the Federal University of Tocantins (UFT), analyzes the concepts on “high” and “low” literature from the points of view pointed by Leyla Perrone-Moisés in her essay “High literatures”, in 1988. Finally, we present an article by the authors Barbara Marins Pettres, Master in Agro ecosystems from the UFSC, Luiz Carlos Pine Axe, PhD in Agronomy and retired University Professor of the Federal University of Rio Grande Do Sul (UFRGS), Maria José Hötzel, PhD in Animal Science from The University of Western Austrália, Tania Maria de Paula Lyra, PhD in Animal Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and Presidency Assessor of the Development Coordination of Higher Education Personnel - CAPES. In their article, they approach the issue of the foot and mouth disease social impacts, and mention that Santa Catarina is the only Brazilian State that does not immunize the bovine herd against this illness. The authors argue the policies that state adopts concerning this illness, especially the non-vaccination, and relate this fact with ethical questions of human and animal welfare. The study concludes that the real experience of an outbreak results in dramatic, social consequences for the affected families, showing a long-term rupture in these families’ rural lifestyles. Last, but not least, this issue also brings the book review of ‘the Ritual Use of the Plants of Power’ by Labate and Goulart, Editora Mercado das Letras, São Paulo, 2005. 518 p. Jose Eliezer Mikosz, PhD student at the Post graduation Program in Human Sciences (PPGICH/UFSC) and Master in Technological Innovations from the UTFPR - Curitiba PR, introduces us to this book.
