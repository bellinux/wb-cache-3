50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>exciter</b> is a 3,000 rpm 3-phase machine {{directly}} {{coupled to}} the main generator shaft. Cooling is effected by a closed air ventilation circuit with pannier mounted coolers supplied with cooling water from the condensate system. The exciter output is rectified by a 3-phase bridge-connected group of silicon diodes which are natural air cooled and accommodated in a bank of nine cubicles located on a platform cantilevered {{from the side of}} the foundation block. Mounted adjacent to the rectifiers is the main field suppression circuit-breaker which incorporates a discharge resistance and auxiliary switch to close the discharge circuit. A permanent magnet high frequency generator, directly coupled to the exciter shaft, acts as a pilot exciter and supplies the exciter field via a power stage magnetic amplifier which may be regulated either by manual control or by the automatic voltage regulator. The AVR is a continuously acting regulator including such features as VAR limiting, automatic follow-up of manual control, and protection against over fluxing or over exciting of the main generator.|$|E
50|$|The {{alternator}} {{was designed}} to operate at 3,000 rpm and was coupled to the turbine via a clutch. The <b>main</b> and pilot <b>exciters</b> were gear-driven {{from the end of}} the alternator shaft at 1,000 rpm.|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} focused on the {{synchronous}} generator mathematical model analysis. Based on the analysis are compiled mathematical models of <b>main</b> generator and <b>exciter</b> cooperating in brushless synchronous generator excitation system. Mathematical models of both machines are based on system of differential equations and their validity is verified in Matlab-Simulink. The master thesis is devided into three main parts. First part {{is focused on}} the derivation of differential equations to describe the behavior of electrical quantities of machines. In the second part are compiled and simulated mathematical models of both synchronous machines in Matlab-Simulink. The correctness of models are verified by approximate analytical calculations of selected steady and dynamic states. The last part is focused on design and simulation of concept for main generator rapid field winding deexcitation in brushless synchronous genereator excitation system...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some results}} of optimization of the vibrating system with electromagnetic exciter and multibody mechanical structure. Vibrating systems {{are used in}} different technological goals such as preparation of the granular materials in medicine, pharmacology, building technologies etc. But also vibration is very dangerous matter for many types of machines. So vibrating systems needs in optimal periodical motion of active elements. Such system allows increasing efficiencies of the traditional technological processes and giving new facilities for designers. It is important to get adequate mathematical model of investigated system and describe all parts of system from mechatronical point of view. In general case, structural scheme of vibrating systems consists from three <b>main</b> parts: vibrating <b>exciter,</b> mechanical structure and control system with sensors, microcontroller, and connecting elements. These parts interact together and provide necessarily properties of vibrating system. It is very important correctly to describe technological load to be interacted with vibrating machine. In the model are considered inward and outward friction, vibrating forces, reologycal properties etc. For description of vibration driven movement of technological load (granular material) can be used mathematical equations in a form of laws of conservation with corresponding reologycal equation connecting tensors of stress and deformation velocities. Design of the vibrating systems bases on the ideas of optimal motion calculation of the working element. It can be obtained if we use algorithms of dynamical optimal syntheses...|$|R
