The aim of the article is to look over the patterns of European and Asian regulatory models of cross-border <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> relations and to compare their ability to induce cross-border economic cooperation. This article examines the opportunity to adopt the successful experience of legal regulation in this sphere and also highlights some of the differences that may inhibit business interaction between entrepreneurs from European and East Asian countries...|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the Security by Means of <b>Movable</b> <b>Property</b> Act excludes the lessor’s hypothec in respect of property purchased in terms of a hire purchase agreement.

50|$|The {{distinction}} between {{these types of}} property is significant {{for a variety of}} reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on immovables (or real property).

In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a lien or other security interest) can be registered against personal or <b>movable</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} to what extent should a lease of <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> fall within the ambits of the National Credit Act. The paper analyses the courts decisions regarding leases of <b>movable</b> <b>properties,</b> and further adds value to the existing scholarship. Courts are not ready to entertain extrinsic evidence in the cases where it contradicts the terms of an agreement. Parties should make sure that their contractual provisions are clear and unambiguous. Such provisions depict the notion that a lease of a <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> should fall within the ambits of the National Credit Act, hereinafter called NCA. And in such circumstances that qualifies it in terms of the Act ought to be met. In terms of section 8 (4) of the NCA, a lease of <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> should by no means exclude the provision that ownership will pass to the lessee upon payment of the final rental instalment. Alternatively upon meeting certain conditions as determined by parties. One should therefore be able to differentiate leases in terms of the NCA and leases as defined by common law. Thus, one cannot try to qualify common law leases within the context of section 8 (4) of the NCA where the original intention was an ordinary common law lease agreement. The Court in the case of ABSA Technology v Michael`s Bid House concluded that the NCA was not applicable to leases of <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> in certain circumstances. It is the findings of this paper that courts, recognize lease of movable propert...|$|R

40|$|A real {{security}} right improves a creditor’s {{chances of}} recovering a debt owed {{to him by}} the debtor. In the case of an ordinary pledge, the pledgor delivers physical control of his <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> to his creditor to serve as security for the repayment of the principal debt. The increasing value and use of <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> as an object of security coupled with technological advancement have resulted in many countries calling for legal reform of real security rights over <b>movable</b> <b>property.</b> In South Africa this led to the introduction of the Security by Means of <b>Movable</b> <b>Property</b> Act 57 of 1993 which makes provision for a pledge without possession. The Act regulates only special notarial bonds and does not apply to general notarial bonds. The real security right vests in the bondholder upon registration of the bond, provided that the <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> encumbered is described in a notarial bond {{in a way that makes}} it readily recognisable. The Act has substituted delivery with registration in the Deeds Registry. Registration of the notarial bond in the Deeds Registry is questioned as to whether it complies with the publicity principle. This is because <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> can be shifted from one place to another without any knowledge on the part of the creditor due to the inaccessible and costly registration system. The third party then receives the property subject to the real security right of the creditor. The substitution of delivery with registration is the controversial feature in this study. Linked to the legal problems regarding compliance with the publicity principle, is the description and identification requirement as provided for under the Act, the exclusion of general notarial bonds from the application of the Act, and the question of whether it is appropriate to regard special notarial bonds as pledges without possession. This study questions whether the current land registry system should be used for the registration of notarial bonds and suggests that a new system designed specifically for the registration of real security rights over movables be considered. I compare the position in the Belgian legal system as regards developments in real security rights over movables to identify possible solutions and recommendations for the South African approach.

50|$|A {{notarial}} bond is {{a limited}} real security which hypothecates <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> {{in an attempt to}} secure the bondholder’s ranking for the satisfaction of a debt.

A notarial bond can only be taken over <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> and merely grants the bondholder a right of preference (prior ranking) over unsecured creditors and hypothec holders at the debtor’s insolvency.|$|R
