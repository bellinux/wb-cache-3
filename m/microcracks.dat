25|$|Amorphous oxide has a {{dielectric}} {{ratio of}} ~ 1.4nm/V. Compared to crystalline aluminum oxide, {{which has a}} dielectric ratio of ~1.0nm/V, the amorphous variety has a 40% lower capacitance at the same anode surface. The disadvantage of crystalline oxide is its greater sensitivity to tensile stress, which may lead to <b>microcracks</b> when subjected to mechanical (winding) or thermal (soldering) stressors during the post-forming processes.|$|E
25|$|With {{a reverse}} voltage applied, a reverse leakage current flows in very small areas of <b>microcracks</b> or other defects across the {{dielectric}} layer to the anode of the electrolytic capacitor. Although the current {{may only be}} a few microamps, it represents a very high localized current density which can cause a tiny hot-spot. This can cause some conversion of amorphous tantalum pentoxide to the more conductive crystalline form. When a high current is available, this effect can avalanche and the capacitor may become a total short.|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy observations of a fractured SiC-TiB_ 2 composite have provided conclusive evidence of stress-induced <b>microcracking</b> in this system. The <b>microcrack</b> density parameter around a steadily growing crack has been measured {{as a function}} of the distance from the crack plane. <b>Microcrack</b> toughening in this system has been assessed using a discrete model based on the measured <b>microcrack</b> density parameter. The computation results indicate that nearly half of the toughening arises from stress-induced <b>microcracking.</b> Other possible toughening mechanisms are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanics}} {{model of}} <b>microcrack</b> toughening is presented. The model predicts {{the magnitude of}} <b>microcrack</b> toughening {{as well as the}} existence of R-curve effects. The toughening is predicated on both the elastic modulus diminution in the <b>microcrack</b> process zone and the dilatation induced by <b>microcracking.</b> The modulus effect is relatively small and process-zone-size-independent. The dilatational effect is potentially more substantial, as well as being the primary source of the R curve. The dilatational contribution is also zone-size-dependent. The analysis demonstrates that <b>microcrack</b> toughening is less potent than transformation toughening...|$|R

25|$|Ramp {{is defined}} as the rate of change in {{temperature}} over time, expressed in degrees per second. The most commonly used process limit is 4°C/s, though many component and solder paste manufacturers specify the value as 2°C/s. Many components have a specification where the rise in temperature should not exceed a specified temperature per second, such as 2°C/s. Rapid evaporation of the flux contained in the solder paste can lead to defects, such as lead lift, tombstoning, and solder balls. Additionally, rapid heat can lead to steam generation within the component if the moisture content is high, resulting in the formation of <b>microcracks.</b>|$|E
25|$|The corium {{undergoes}} degradation. The Elephant's Foot, {{hard and}} strong shortly after its formation, is now cracked enough that a glue-treated wad easily separated its top 1–2 centimeter layer. The structure's shape itself is changed as the material slides down and settles. The corium temperature is now just slightly different from ambient, {{the material is}} therefore subject to both day-night temperature cycling and weathering by water. The heterogeneous nature of corium and different thermal expansion coefficients of the components causes material deterioration with thermal cycling. Large amounts of residual stresses were introduced during solidification due to the uncontrolled cooling rate. The water, seeping into pores and <b>microcracks</b> and freezing there, the same process that creates potholes on roads, accelerates cracking.|$|E

40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{the present}} work to address some of the aspects of <b>microcracking</b> in {{electron}} beam deposited scandia-stabilised zirconia electrolyte applied for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) where a thin electrolyte layer is deposited on a relatively thick anode substrate. A model of <b>microcracking</b> for the electrolyte material is proposed which takes into account the statistical distribution of grain sizes, the stress redistribution due to failure of individual structural elements as well as the local criterion of grain fracture. The combination of electron microscopy research with model calculations permits both the specific energy of new surface creation in the electrolyte and critical parameters of the <b>microcracking</b> process to be determined. The annealing-induced electrolyte <b>microcracking</b> discussed in this work corresponds to localised <b>microcracking,</b> where each next structural element fails mainly at an existing <b>microcrack</b> tip.

The objective of the research is to study the relationship between <b>microcrack</b> pattern and the weathering degree of granite at Pos Selim area, Malaysia. The fractures on the sheared surface are measured based on the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image. The microscopic aspects of fracture such as trans-granular crack, open cracks are measured using SEM before and after shearing test which is called pre-shear and post-shear respectively. Each of the fractured surfaces are measured and analyzed to come out with the fractured pattern of the weathered granite in different normal load and shear load. From the studies, the <b>microcrack</b> propagation patterns can be categorized into two type which are type A and type B.

40|$|Intra-ply <b>microcracking</b> in unlined {{composite}} {{pressure vessels}} {{can be very}} troublesome to detect and when linked through the thickness can provide leak paths that may hinder mission success. The leaks may lead to loss of pressure/propellant, increased risk of explosion and possible cryo-pumping into air pockets within the laminate. Ultrasonic techniques have been shown capable of detecting the presence of <b>microcracking</b> and in this work {{they are used to}} quantify the level of <b>microcracking.</b> Resonance ultrasound methods are utilized with artificial neural networks to build a <b>microcrack</b> prediction/measurement tool. Two networks are presented, one unsupervised to provide a qualitative measure of <b>microcracking</b> and one supervised which provides a quantitative assessment of the level of <b>microcracking.</b> The resonant ultrasound spectroscopic method is made sensitive to <b>microcracking</b> by tuning the input spectrum to the higher frequency (shorter wavelength) components allowing more significant interaction with the defects. This interaction causes the spectral characteristics to shift toward lower amplitudes at the higher frequencies. As the density of the defects increases more interactions occur and more drastic amplitude changes are observed. Preliminary experiments to quantify the level of <b>microcracking</b> induced in graphite/epoxy composite samples through a combination of tensile loading and cryogenic temperatures are presented.

50|$|In 1956, the {{microcrack}} theory {{became the}} first to explain the toughening effect of a dispersed rubber phase in a polymer. Two key observations {{that went into the}} initial theory and subsequent expansion were as follows: (1) <b>microcracks</b> form voids over which styrene-butadiene copolymer fibrils form to prevent propagation, and (2) energy stored during elongation of toughened epoxies is released upon breaking of rubber particles. The theory concluded that the combined energy to initiate <b>microcracks</b> and the energy to break rubber particles could account for the increased energy absorption of toughened polymers. This theory was limited, only accounting for {{a small fraction of the}} observed increase in fracture energy.|$|E
