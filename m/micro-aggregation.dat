40|$|One of the {{techniques}} of data holders {{for the protection of}} confidentiality of continuous data is that of <b>micro-aggregation.</b> Rather than releasing raw data (individual records), <b>micro-aggregation</b> releases the averages of small groups and thus reduces the risk of identity disclosure. At the same time the method implies loss of information and often distorts the data. Thus, the choice of groups is very crucial to minimize the information loss and the data distortion. No exact polynomial algorithms exist up to date for optimal microaggregation, and so the usage of heuristic methods is necessary. A heuristic algorithm, based on the notion of importance partitioning, is proposed and it is shown that compared with other <b>micro-aggregation</b> heuristics achieves improved performance.

This equilibrium concentration for each crystal facet can be characterized by Clausius–Clapeyron relation with regard to its surface energy. The diagram of atmospheric {{ice crystals}} morphology in dependence from absolute and relative vapor supersaturation of atmosphere is developed. It is determined that the relation of height H and diameter D of atmospheric crystals increases at a growth of relative supersaturation, Δ c i /c i, but increases at a growth of absolute supersaturation, Δ c i = c i  – c a. The alteration of H/D occurs gradually, which explains conditional character of delimitation on types on the base of this index.

We propose a partitioning algorithm to micro-aggregate uniform very large data sets with cost O(n). We provide the mathematical foundations proving the efficiency of our algorithm and we show that the error associated to <b>micro-aggregation</b> is bounded and decreases when the number of micro-aggregated records grows.

40|$|Micro-data {{protection}} {{is a hot}} topic in the eld of Statis-tical Disclosure Control (SDC), that has gained special in-terest after the disclosure of 658000 queries by the AOL search engine in August 2006. Many algorithms, methods and properties have been proposed to deal with micro-data disclosure. p-Sensitive k-anonymity has been recently de-ned as a sophistication of k-anonymity. This new property requires that there be at least p dierent values for each con dential attribute within the records sharing a combi-nation of key attributes. Like k-anonymity, the algorithm originally proposed to achieve this property was based on generalisations and suppressions; when data sets are numer-ical this has several data utility problems, namely turning numerical key attributes into categorical, injecting new cat-egories, injecting missing data, and so on. In this article, we recall the foundational concepts of <b>micro-aggregation,</b> k-anonymity and p-sensitive k-anonymity.

40|$|<b>Micro-aggregation</b> of {{precursor}} cells enhances cell performance upon differentiation both in vitro and in vivo [1]. Although {{the underlying mechanisms}} have remained largely unknown, it has been demonstrated that micro- aggregation creates a three-dimensional environment that recapitulates aspects of embryonic differentiation via auto- and paracrine signaling [2]. Moreover, <b>micro-aggregation</b> allows cells to establish a favorable mechanical micro-environment, by remodeling their cytoskeleton, depositing ECM and strengthening adhesion. Patterning micro-wells into a substrate is an ideal platform to generate micro-aggregates in a controlled and high throughput manner. The use of a non-adhesive substrate - e. g. agarose – prevents the cells from attachment and hence results in spherical micro-aggregates. In general, the formation of cell aggregates is characterized by two phases. First, the cells actively migrate towards each other to form a loose cluster of spherical cells. Next, the cell cluster condensates and contracts into a smooth spherical micro-aggregate. The dynamics of micro-aggregate formation differ depending on cell type, dimensions of the micro-well and number of cells per well. In this study, we developed a model which describes the mechanism of <b>micro-aggregation</b> {{by focusing on the}} behavior and mechanics of individual cells (See Figure 1). The model includes two important biological phenomena. Firstly, the cells perform a directed random walk which is influenced by chemo-taxis. Secondly, the adhesion energy for a given contact between two cells increases over a specified time. The cells’ positions are updated by solving the equation of motion which is formulated for an over-damped system. The simulations are compared to time lapsed microscopy images of in vitro micro-well cell aggregation of ATDC 5 cells. The model predicts that the same cell behavior that results in realistic single cell migration also gives rise to the observed collective cell migration of the complete aggregate. Furthermore, a parameter study shows that spherical aggregates will be created as long as cell migration forces are high enough to overcome the initial forces of adhesion, and the directed component of cell migration is high enough to prevent the formation of multiple aggregates.

Later, use of enzymes found its application in engineering and has been extensively used to improve the performance of soils for construction of roads, dams and airport runways, as it increases cohesion and stability, reduces permeability and helps in erosion control of the treated soil [8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20, 30].|$|E

Because of its high recurrence rate and long progression interval, improved treatment options are needed. To enable mechanistic and therapeutic aims of Fibronectin Attachment Protein (FAP) binding, novel tris-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) -Alexa probes and NTA-PEG-lipids were prepared and tested {{for their ability to}} promote bladder cell internalization of His-tagged FAP. Experiments with these unique chemical probes have established the therapeutic potential of FAP as targeting ligand for bladder tumor treatment. Drug delivery systems that can specifically target bladder tumor cells have been designed for the delivery of therapeutic cargo in a programmed manner upon internalization into low pH endosomal compartments. ^ Bladder tumor targeting and internalization requires the integration of many molecular design aspects: drug formulation and packaging, fabrication of nanoparticles with a discrete size, efficient targeting, controllable release and addressing the biological features that are characteristic of bladder tumor cells. Fluorescence microscopy and knockdown experiments, against clathrin or caveolin- 1, have shown that FAP is internalized via a clathrin-independent, caveolae-dependent mechanism. This important mechanistic information places a stringent size cutoff of 70 nm {{for the development of a}} successful FAP-targeted therapy that is designed to direct the drug or gene carrier system to the caveolar compartment. In addition, the carrier must aid the <b>micro-aggregation</b> of FAP-FBN-Integrin receptor complex to induce internalization. Based on previous findings, our design involves the production of small unilamellar vesicles (SUV, 3 ̆c 70 nm in size) for the proper targeting of the caveolae-mediated endosomal uptake pathway. NTA-PEG-lipids with a high affinity toward His-tagged FAPs have been synthesized for the targeting of bladder tumor cells. The distance between each NTA was calculated to mimic the distance between two antigen binding domains of antibodies that were initially used to crosslink polyclonal anti-FAP antibodies to induce bladder tumor cell uptake. <b>Micro-aggregation</b> of FAP-FBN-Integrin receptor complexes has also been shown to induce the accelerated uptake of these SUV drug carrier. ^ We have developed a novel non-viral system for drug and gene delivery that is safe, efficient and easily processed into targeted nanoparticle formulations. This was achieved by creating a new family of mosquito-borne fusion peptide-based fusogens that promote lipid-mediated membrane fusion, thereby capable of enhancing the bioavailability of the encapsulated cargo when activated within the acidic endosomal environment of target tissues.

We hypothesized that CD 13 {{may be involved in}} neutrophil migration and/or homotypic aggregation. Using purified human blood neutrophils we confirmed the expression of CD 13 on neutrophils and its up-regulation by pro-inflammatory agonists. However, using the anti-CD 13 monoclonal antibody WM- 15 and the aminopeptidase enzymatic inhibitor bestatin we were unable to demonstrate any direct involvement of CD 13 in neutrophil polarisation or chemotaxis. In contrast, IL- 8 -mediated neutrophil migration in type I collagen gels was significantly impaired by the anti-CD 13 monoclonal antibodies WM- 15 and MY 7. Notably, these antibodies also induced significant homotypic aggregation of neutrophils, which was dependent on CD 13 cross-linking and was attenuated by phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and extracellular signal-related kinase 1 / 2 inhibition. Live imaging demonstrated that in WM- 15 -treated neutrophils, where homotypic aggregation was evident, the number of cells entering IL- 8 impregnated collagen I gels was significantly reduced.

Here, we report on similar properties in halloysitic soils derived from volcanic ash, in Tongatapu island, Kingdom of Tonga, Pacific. The soils are fine clayey (68 - 96 % clay) and contain three dominant constituents: humic substances, halloysite and iron oxide (6 - 12 %). They exhibit a relatively large reserve in alkaline and alkaline-earth cations confined to the clay fraction, and more specifically to exchangeable and non-exchangeable cations associated with high charge clay minerals detected by XRD as smectite. Whatever the soil layer and the soil organic matter content, the soil materials have exceptionally high saturated hydraulic conductivity, ranging from 7 to 85 cm h(- 1), and large water retention (30 - 40 %) at low hydric potential (<- 15, 000 hPa).

Besides evaluating profile morphology, 13 physical and 15 chemical properties were selected for laboratory analysis. Most soils are well developed with the full complement of horizons echoing humid subtropical pedogenesis. Organic matter, and the associated nitrogen and phosphorus, are lower than the norms for comparable soils of undisturbed forests. Aggregate stability results indicate weak macro-scale ped strength, but <b>micro-aggregation</b> is strong and significantly correlated with free Fe and Al, {{and to a lesser}} extent to carbon. Bulk density is correlated positively with sand and negatively with both silt and clay; it is lower in the topsoil due to structural organization by physicochemical and biotic processes.

We successfully formed micro-aggregates of human and bovine chondrocytes with highly controlled size, stability and viability within 24 hours. Micro-aggregates of 100 cells presented a superior balance in Collagen type I and Collagen type II gene expression over single cells and micro-aggregates of 50 and 200 cells. Matrix metalloproteinases 1, 9 and 13 mRNA levels were decreased in micro-aggregates compared to single-cells. Histological and biochemical analysis demonstrated enhanced matrix deposition in constructs seeded with micro-aggregates cultured in vitro and in vivo, compared to single-cell seeded constructs. Whole genome microarray analysis and single gene expression profiles using human chondrocytes confirmed increased expression of cartilage-related genes when chondrocytes were cultured in micro-aggregates. In conclusion, we succeeded in controlled high-throughput formation of micro-aggregates of chondrocytes. Compared to single cell-seeded constructs, seeding of constructs with micro-aggregates greatly improved neo-cartilage formation. Therefore, <b>micro-aggregation</b> prior to chondrocyte implantation in current MACI procedures, may effectively accelerate hyaline cartilage formation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the relative abilities of three desensitizing dentifrices to the rapid relief of dentinal hypersensitivity (DH). Methods and Materials: Using a double-blind, randomized design, three dentifrices [1) containing 8 % arginine, 1450 ppm sodium monofluorophosphate; 2) containing 8 % strontium acetate, 1040 ppm sodium fluoride; 3) containing 30 % <b>micro-aggregation</b> of zinc-carbonate hydroxyapatite nanocrystals] were compared after 3 -day treatment. Participant’s DH was evaluated at baseline and after 3 days using Airblast, Tactile, Cold water and Subjective tests. Results: The final sample consisted of 85 subjects: 29 received the arginine-based dentifrice (group 1); 27 the strontium acetate-based dentifrice (group 2); 29 the dentifrice based on zinc-carbonate hydroxyapatite (group 3). All dentifrices were largely effective to reduce DH: the percentage of score reduction from baseline to 3 days was greater than 30 % for all tests (except for subjective test of group 2). The comparison among the three dentifrices showed that after 3 days there was an improvement in Airblast (mean percentage of reduction 39. 2 % in group 1; 42. 0 % in group 2; 39. 2 % in group 3), Cold water (41. 5 %; 51. 8 %; 50 %), Tactile (50. 3 %; 40. 1 %; 33. 8 %) and Subjective (33. 1 %; 17. 4 %; 31. 4 %) test scores, with differences being significant for Cold Water and Subjective tests. For Airblast and Tactile tests there were no significant differences across groups at 3 days. Moreover, no significant differences at any test were observed in a subset of patients that were followed up to 8 weeks: all dentifrices were all highly efficacious. Conclusions: This study documented that the three tested dentifrices significantly reduced DH after 3 -day treatment, supporting their utility in clinical practice. This is the first report documenting the rapid relief from DH of a zinc-carbonate hydroxyapatite dentifrice...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{structure}} {{is a key}} characteristic of soil functioning. More, silt and clay-sized organo-mineral fractions are usually considered as the most reactive soil fractions. As transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) appeared to be well-suited to study soil microstructures, {{it was used to}} test the sensitivity of micro-aggregates to land use and cultivation practices. The aims of this study were therefore (1) to use TEM to characterize the organic materials involved in the stable 0 - 20 mu m micro-aggregates of a cultivated topsoil and (2) to highlight any impact of cultivation practices and of inter-annual variation on <b>micro-aggregation.</b> For this, the study was conducted on a Calcic Cambisol (pH of 7. 1, organic matter content of 33 g kg(- 1), C-to-N ratio around 10), developed in Eastern France and sampled two consecutive years before and after the exceptional dry period occurring in 2003. It was cropped under maize following moderate tillage and fertilisation within an experimental station. Digested sewage sludge has been applied since 1996 according to regulations for environmental controls at the rate of 10 Mg ha(- 1) year for 4 years. Granulometric soil fractionations of samples from plots with or without sewage sludge addition were performed. Then, morphological and analytical characterization by TEM of the water-stable < 20 mu m micro-aggregates were carried out to specify their aggregative organic matter. 0 - 20 mu m water-stable fraction contained more than 60 % of the soil carbon. A typology of < 20 mu m micro-aggregates was established according the nature of aggregative organic matter. It appeared that among 0 - 2 mu m and 2 - 20 mu m micro-aggregates, those containing young organic matter of plant and microbial origin were involved in the most stable associations. The impact of the dry period on soil microstructure between 2002 and 2003 corresponded to both an increase in the 0 - 2 mu m water-dispersibility and a decrease in the mean size of the 2 - 20 mu m water-stable aggregates. Sewage sludge addition slightly increased the proportion of the 50 - 200 mu m water-stable macro-aggregates and induced the formation of micro-aggregates containing sludge flocs, which could be considered as specific sewage sludge fingerprints. Descriptors of 0 - 20 mu m stable micro-aggregates, i. e. size, stability and typology, appeared as a promising tool to specify the dynamics of the organo-mineral associations in soils subjected to environmental changes or cultivation practices.

40|$|In {{advanced}} {{stages of}} soil formation on volcanic ash, when more clay is formed, {{the combination of}} high surface area and variable charge causes strong soil aggregation, and very large porosity, water retention capacity and shrinkage (e. g. Nanzyo et al. 1993, Poulenard et al. 2002, 2003). Despite previous works, physical properties of Andosols have not been fully explored and explained. Maeda and Soma (1985), Warkentin et al. (1988), Mizota and van Reeuwijk (1993), Nanzyo et al. (1993), Pinheiro et al. (2001) and Poulenard et al. (2003) pointed out that, besides allophanes, organic colloids also influence bulk density and soil water retention. However, the interpretation by these authors are constituent-based and not physical-based. On another hand, most of the published results on hydraulic properties {{are related to the}} water retention at 1500 kPa and sometimes at 33 kPa (see the review Nanzyo et al. 1993). Rare are the published results on the effect on pedogenesis or/and land use the entire retention curve or on hydraulic conductivity as a function of soil saturation (Warkentin and Maeda 1980, Basile and De Mascellis 1999, Poulenard et al. 2003, Fernandez et al. 2004) or on the hydraulic conductivity and solute dispersivity (Katou et al. 1996, Basile and De Mascellis 1999, Fontes et al. 2004) Aggregation in many Andosols (WRB 2001) is also so strong that they fail to disperse completely when dispersion agents are used that are successful in other soils (e. g. Nanzyo et al. 1993, Mizota and van Reeuwijk 1993). Research in the areas of hydraulic properties, solute transport, aggregation and clay dispersion is therefore still required. Finally, relationships between properties at different scales, such as organo- mineral clay, physico-chemical properties, elementary aggregates and physical macro-properties (water retention, water and solute transport, soil hydrophobicity, aggregate stability, shrinkage etc.) are still unclear. Some expected relationships will be reported in the present synthesis, which is based both on studies by the authors and co-workers in the frame of the COST- 622 Action (Bartoli and Burtin, Basile et al., Buurman andvan Doesburg this book section, other published or unpublished works of co-authors of this chapter) and on a detailed analysis of literature. This chapter is organised as follows. First, <b>micro-aggregation</b> and clay dispersibility of the European reference pedon soil samples are reported. Second, we will highlight the key role played by capillary porosity in both soil water retention and shrinkage for the same soils. Third, irreversible drying effect on aggregate stability, hydraulic properties and solute transport parameters will be presented, followed by preliminary results on pore size distribution of the reference soil samples. Finally, recent results on (i) dielectric behaviour and water mobility, (ii) water and solute transport and (iii) soil hydrophobicity will be reported for European and other Andosols...|$|E
