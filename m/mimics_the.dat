5|$|Cercaria mirabilis, a trematode, has an {{especially}} large larval stage (known as a cercarium) which looks {{much like a}} small crustacean or mosquito larva. It also <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> locomotory behavior of such animals, allowing it to be eaten by predaceous fish.|$|E
5|$|Difficult {{situations}} {{arise in}} deficiencies of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis in people (both men and women) who experience infertility; infertility in hypopituitarism may {{be treated with}} subcutaneous infusions of FSH, human chorionic gonadotropin–which <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> action of LH–and occasionally GnRH.|$|E

5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a {{pheromone}} that <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> sex attractant of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female bee, {{and from there to}} the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.|$|E

5|$|On the {{left-hand}} {{side of the}} painting, in the background, {{the structure of the}} temple crumbles and burns {{in the wake of the}} angel's path, while figures in varying stages of undress flee the approaching daemons. In the foreground a drunken man <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> pose of the Barberini Faun as he clutches his head, alert enough to realise his fate if he does not escape but too intoxicated to flee.|$|E
5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be the prey of {{aggressive}} <b>mimics.</b> <b>The</b> assassin bug Stenolemus bituberus preys on spiders, entering their web and plucking its silk threads until the spider approaches. This vibrational aggressive mimicry matches a general pattern of vibrations which spiders treat as prey, having a similar temporal structure and amplitude to leg and body movements of typical prey caught in the web.|$|E
5|$|Artist Matthew Ritchie was {{commissioned}} to create {{much of the}} building's artwork. One piece is a metal sculpture located on the exterior in the courtyard that <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> nearby Willamette River's watershed, and includes metal spheres attached to the line shaped metal. The other main piece of art is a piece with two lightboxes on the interior that display different images as one moves along the display that uses lenticular glass.

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are often}} {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs. An {{example of such a}} transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in the reaction of the viral enzyme neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a sparrowhawk. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs and}} musical score {{used in the}} film were {{composed}} and written by Carlo Savina and Gilbert Kaplan. The songs were sung by Kaplan and Ann Collin. The music resembles Riz Ortolani's score from Africa addio, as most tracks are of a light and upbeat nature, particularly during the opening and closing credits. The arrangement of music to enhance atmosphere and create comic effect also <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> compositions in Africa addio.|$|E

5|$|In Batesian mimicry, a palatable, {{harmless}} prey species <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance of}} another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack. This form of mimicry {{is seen in}} many insects. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colors and markings, including Batesian mimics. Some species of octopus can mimic a selection of other animals by changing their skin color, skin pattern and body motion. When a damselfish attacks an octopus, the octopus mimics a banded sea-snake. The model chosen varies with the octopus's predator and habitat. Most of these octopuses use Batesian mimicry, selecting an organism repulsive to predators as a model.|$|E
5|$|Poisonous species {{often use}} bright {{colouring}} to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours {{tend to be}} red or yellow combined with black, with the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, {{it is likely to}} remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

5|$|The male's song {{is a rich}} musical warbling, often {{ending in}} a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30seconds. The song is {{repeated}} for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the Leiern (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit's call but more fluting. The main song is confusable {{with that of the}} garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard tac-tac, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking sweet alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.|$|E
5|$|The ruff is a long-necked, pot-bellied bird. This species shows marked sexual dimorphism; {{the male}} {{is much larger}} than the female (the reeve), and has a {{breeding}} plumage that includes brightly coloured head tufts, bare orange facial skin, extensive black on the breast, and the large collar of ornamental feathers that inspired this bird's English name. The female and the non-breeding male have grey-brown upperparts and mainly white underparts. Three differently plumaged types of male, including a rare form that <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> female, use a variety of strategies to obtain mating opportunities at a lek, and the colourful head and neck feathers are erected as part of the elaborate main courting display. The female has one brood per year and lays four eggs in a well-hidden ground nest, incubating the eggs and rearing the chicks, which are mobile soon after hatching, on her own. Predators of wader chicks and eggs include mammals such as foxes, feral cats and stoats, and birds such as large gulls, corvids and skuas.|$|E
25|$|The common mime has two mimetic {{forms in}} both sexes. The {{nominate}} form P. clytia form clytia <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> common Indian crow (Euploea core) while the form dissimilis <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> blue tiger (Tirumala limniace).|$|E
