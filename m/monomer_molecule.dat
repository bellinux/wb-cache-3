The classic view presented by Yasuda [...] based upon thermal initiation of parylene polymerization [...] is that there are many propagating species present at any given time as shown in Figure 3. This figure shows two different pathways by which the polymerization may take place. The first pathway is a monofunctionalization process, bears resemblance to a standard free radical polymerization mechanism (M•)- although with the caveat that the reactive species may be ionic and not necessarily radical. The second pathway refers to a difunctional mechanism, which by example may contain a cationic and a radical propagating center on the same monomer (•M•). A consequence is that 'polymer' can grow in multiple directions by multiple pathways off one species, such as a surface or other monomer. This possibility let Yasuda to term the mechanism as a very rapid step-growth polymerization. In the diagram, Mx refers to the original <b>monomer</b> <b>molecule</b> or any of many dissociation products such as chlorine, fluorine and hydrogen. The M• species refers to those that are activated and capable of participating in reactions to form new covalent bonds. The •M• species refers to an activated difunctional monomer species. The subscripts i, j, and k show the sizes of the different species involved. Even though radicals represent the activated species, any ion or radical could be used in the polymerization.

50|$|The {{ability of}} a cyclic monomer to polymerize, using ROP is {{determined}} by two integral factors: the conversion of <b>monomer</b> <b>molecules</b> into macromolecules must be allowed both thermodynamically and kinetically.

In the 1960 -ties, Semenov, Kargin and Kabanov proposed a theory of organized monomer polymerization. In the last 25 years, our research group has further developed and applied that theory to various polymerizing systems: the radical polymerization of compressed ethene gas, the radical polymerization of liquid methyl methacrylate, olefin polymerization by transition metals and by Al-based catalysts.

50|$|Although LSW {{theory and}} Ostwald {{ripening}} were intended for solids ripening in a fluid, Ostwald ripening is also observed in liquid-liquid systems, for example, in an oil-in-water emulsion polymerization.

The terminal carbon atom has sp2 hybridization and is planar. Consider the polymerization of the monomer CH2=CXY. There are two ways that a <b>monomer</b> <b>molecule</b> can approach the terminal carbon: the mirror approach (with like substituents on the same side) or the non-mirror approach (like substituents on opposite sides).

Based on their photodimerization properties, many applications were developed, such as fabrication of photo-switchable devices, biological reactions controlling and optical storage memory devices. In order to reveal the reaction kinetics and mechanism of the photodimerization reaction, time-resolved powder diffraction study of anthracene derivatives, 1 -chloroanthracene (1 -chA) and 9 -methylanthracene (9 -MA), {{in the course of}} solid state (4 π+ 4 π) photodimerization reaction was performed. The study was carried out in-situ using synchrotron X-ray source. To analyze the significant information of the collected data, Rietveld refinement was applied. The results of traditional sequential Rietveld refinement showed that the evolution of the dimerization process can be analyzed based on the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model. The parameters of the JMAK equation were obtained successfully by Rietveld refinement and suggested that the reaction follows heterogeneous nucleation and one-dimensional growth with a decreasing nucleation rate. Time-dependent diffraction data of 9 -MA monomer and dimer phases were analyzed based on the averaged structure in each phase. The <b>monomer</b> <b>molecules</b> have two important movements during the reaction, in which the adjacent reactant molecules shifted relatively each other {{and at the same time}} rotate mutually until reaching the distance and angles of conforming the dimer phase. In the dimer phase, the changes of the lattice constants indicate that the molecular arrangement of dimer phase was affected by the movement of <b>monomer</b> <b>molecules</b> and have movements during the dimerization. To see the effect of dimerization process on the molecular arrangement of dimer molecules, two different distances between the adjacent dimer molecules were measured in the time course. The measured distance of C 5 -C 5 i decrease with the time progress while the distance of C 15 -C 8 mutually increase giving similar behavior of the mutual rotation of angle 1 and angle 2 of the adjacent <b>monomer</b> <b>molecules.</b> The results were supported by IR and UV-Vis spectroscopic measurements. In conclusion, it is clearly demonstrated that time-resolved powder diffraction is a powerful tool to reveal the kinetics and mechanism of the photodimerization of anthracene derivatives in the course of in-situ solid state (4 π+ 4 π) photodimerization reaction...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{investigation}} of DNA-dye fluorescence enhancement based on shifting the dimer-monomer equilibrium of a fluorescent dye, acridine orange (AO), is reported. Formation of a virtually nonfluorescent dimeric dye, acridine orange homodimer (AOAO), induced by the pre-micellar aggregation of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), was observed. The possibility of using the in situ formed AOAO as a fluorescent probe for nucleic acids and polynucleotides was studied. The results showed that a nearly 1000 -fold fluorescence enhancement was observed upon addition of calf thymus DNA (CT DNA). The fluorescence enhancement effect of DNA {{was thought to be}} based on the DNA modulated shift of the dimer-monomer equilibrium of AO in the anionic surfactant solution. Intercalation of the monomer in DNA caused the dissociation of AOAO and led to a very high fluorescence enhancement. It seemed that the dimeric dye molecules acted as a source of <b>monomer</b> <b>molecules</b> ready for interacting with nucleic acids and, at the same time, decreased the inherent fluorescence of <b>monomer</b> <b>molecules,</b> which proved to be unfavorable to the detection of fluorescence enhancement.
