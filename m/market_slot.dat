40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the {{manipulative}} or strategic behaviors of slot-holding carriers have resulted in restricted market entry and service expansion by other carriers, especially rival carriers, at the four US airports that have secondary <b>slot</b> <b>markets.</b> Airport congestion and flight delays at many major airports have become a serious problem. It has been suggested that a secondary <b>slot</b> <b>market</b> is one of the most practical options for addressing airport congestion, which would increase the possibility of competitive entry and efficient use of scarce resources. A secondary <b>slot</b> <b>market</b> would work in the same manner as a congestion toll system or an auction system, provided that carriers' manipulative or strategic behaviors do not have serious effects on slot trading. However, the empirical effects of <b>slot</b> <b>markets</b> have not been investigated systematically. This paper examines empirically whether carriers' manipulative or strategic behaviors have impeded effective functioning of <b>slot</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Slot</b> transfer data from four US airports between 1994 and 1999 were examined using regression analysis.

As more modern competitors arrived and as the British-built Sprite was modernised, sales dropped precipitously, with only 63 cars built in 1965.

The Coupé's all-new bodywork was wider and longer than the Spider's, and the wheelbase was extended by 150 mm to 2180 mm.

However, the eff ect of these payments on channel efficiency is still discussed controversially among practitioners and researchers.

To address this issue, we build upon Pakes and McGuire (1994) and develop a dynamic model of entry and vertical competition, where strategic actions stem from a single Markov perfect equilibrium.

40|$|The {{following}} thesis describes and {{analyzes the}} development of the U. S. slot allocation system from 1968 until today, in order to draw relevant conclusions for a new European Slot Regulation. The European Commission is currently drafting a new Slot Regulation purporting to introduce market mechanisms. A similar approach was espoused in the United States from 1986 onward, but was ultimately supplanted by overriding legislation in 2000. The analysis of the U. S. slot allocation system reveals the reasons underlying its abolition and queries whether this experience can be successfully transposed in Europe. The thesis commences by providing general information on the definition of slots, slot allocation, and airport capacity. A brief review of the European Commission's current consultation process on the implementation of <b>market</b> mechanisms for <b>slot</b> allocation follows. The main part of the thesis discusses the U. S. High Density Rule and the Rules for the Allocation and Transfer of High Density Airport Slots in historical order. Some criticisms frequently voiced assert that the Rules artificially limited access to airports, constituted barriers to market entry, restricted airline competition, generated higher fares, and yielded adverse effects on smaller communities which, in turn, lost access to key markets. Through a favorable assessment of the Rules, the thesis analyses these concerns and concludes that the suppression of the Rules was rather prompted by local political motivations than by other rationalities. However, experiences drawn from the U. S. Rules demonstrate that a future European secondary <b>market</b> for <b>slots,</b> if implemented under a grand fathering system, will likely {{have a positive impact on}} the efficiency of airport capacity, but not on access to the market and competition...|$|R
40|$|Economic rent seeking is the raison d'être of a {{commercial}} undertaking and acts as the manipulator of Adam Smith's 'invisible hand'. The retention of economic rent, however, can cause undesirable distortions, especially if it persists over a long period. Public policy, therefore, often seeks to tempt business {{with the promise of}} rent, allow business an occasional nibble, {{but at the same time}} create structures whereby business cannot swim away with the bait. The discussion here is of how slot allocation procedures have rent seeking implications that affect both the existence of economic rents and the distribution of these rents. The actors in the game are the airlines, airports and politicians (broadly defined to include the executive as well as legislators). The ultimate distribution of rent is essentially a political decision, as is any form of allocation, but its form is influenced by the underlying nature of the <b>market</b> for <b>slots</b> and the way in which market power is spread. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses a {{bilateral}} oligopoly model {{to study the}} slotting allowances in retailing industries. There are two symmetric manufacturers competing in the upstream market. In the downstream, there are a large retailer with considerable market share, and many small retailers with insignificant market shares. Suppose that only the large retailer is able to require slotting allowances. The retailers engage in price competition with spatial differentiation. The model suggests that the large retailer uses slotting allowances to capitalize its market power. By requiring slotting fees, the large retailer can raise the wholesale prices faced by the competing small retailers, and therefore lower their profit margins and market shares. The large retailer, on the contrary, achieves greater profit margins and market share. The lump sum part of the slotting fees is wholly bore by the manufacturers. But the slotting fees that are linear to the sales are actually bore by the competing small retailers and their customers. In this sense, requiring slotting allowance is an exclusionary strategy of the large retailer. Exclusionary strategy, <b>Market</b> power, <b>Slotting</b> allowance...|$|R
