Two Mediterranean sites with aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis P.

Quantitative morphological methods were used to analyze and compare humus profiles, and data were analyzed using correspondence analysis. In both sites the influence of aleppo pine on humus forms was well-defined but minor, increasing the appearance of an Oe horizon characterized by intense activity of litter-dwelling fauna and fungi, Under all vegetation types, and in both sites, the organomineral A horizon was of the <b>mull</b> <b>type,</b> although the composition of the soil-building fauna varied between Navarre and Sicily, There was more heterogeneity among vegetation types in Navarre, where aleppo pine was planted on derelict land, than in Sicily where aleppo pine was a component of natural vegetation (maquis).

40|$|There {{are several}} types of finite automata on {{infinite}} words, differing in their acceptance conditions. As each type has its own advantages, there is an extensive research on the size blowup involved in translating one automaton type to another. Of special interest is the <b>Muller</b> <b>type,</b> providing the most detailed acceptance condition.

Considering the automaton size, some results take into account, in addition to the number of states, the alphabet length and the number of transitions while ignoring the length of the acceptance condition, whereas other results consider the length of the acceptance condition while ignoring the two other parameters. We establish a full picture of the translations to and from Muller automata, enhancing known results and adding new ones. Overall, Muller automata can be considered less succinct than parity, Rabin, and Streett automata: translating nondeterministic Muller automata to the other nondeterministic types involves a polynomial size blowup, while the other way round is exponential; translating between the deterministic versions is exponential in both directions; and translating nondeterministic automata of all types to deterministic Muller automata is doubly exponential, as opposed to a single exponent in the translations to the other deterministic types...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{river flow}} models are {{essential}} tools for water managers, but these hydraulic simulation models often lack a proper description of dynamic roughness due to hysteresis effects in dune evolution. To incorporate {{the effects of}} dune evolution directly into the resistance coefficients of hydraulic simulation models, we developed a dynamic roughness model consisting of: (1) a process-based simulation model to predict dune dimensions, and (2) an empirical roughness predictor to translate computed dune dimensions into a resistance coefficient. The dune evolution model solves the shallow water equations in a vertical plane using hydrostatic pressure conditions. The sediment transport is modelled using a Meyer-Peter <b>Müller</b> <b>type</b> of formulation including gravitational bed-slope effects. The separation streamline, the upper boundary of the flow separation zone, forms an artificial bed {{in the region of}} flow separation. Sediment transport in the flow separation zone is assumed to be zero and sediment passing the flow separation point deposits on the leeside of the dune. Computed dune dimensions, migration rates and times to equilibrium compare reasonably well with various flume data sets. Flow separation is shown to be crucial to take into account for modelling dune evolution: if flow separation is not included, dune shapes are incorrectly predicted and the dune height saturates at an early stage of bedform evolution, yielding an underprediction of dune height and time to equilibrium. The local bed slope at the dune crest also plays a crucial role to obtain saturation at an equilibrium dune height. The dynamic roughness model is coupled with the 1 -dimensional hydraulic simulation model Sobek. The resulting model can be applied to simulate water levels in natural river settings at river reach spatial scales and flood wave time scales, explicitly taking the time-evolution of river dunes into account. The hysteresis of dune dimensions and roughness coefficients is larger for broad-peaked flood waves than for sharp-peaked flood waves, since the relatively long period of high river discharge gives the dunes ample time to increase in height. This emphasizes the importance of the flood wave shape for dune evolution and thus roughness predictions...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is based}} on the data {{obtained}} from expeditions to Kurday, Kazakhstan in 2006 performed by Joint Norwegian- Kazakhstan – Kyrgyzstan- Tajikistan project in collaboration with the NATRO RESCA project. The former uranium mining and processing site Kurday, located in Zambyl region in southern Kazakhstan is rich in naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs) and technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORMs). It has been {{recognized as one of the}} earliest uranium legacy production sites in Central Asia. In addition, the area is not only contaminated with uranium and its daughters, but also from associated trace metals which may pose a risk to man and the environment. The objectives of the thesis were to use the available outdoor and indoor radon concentrations as well as gamma dose rates/doses to estimate public annual effective doses from gamma and radon exposure in selected area of the site. The corresponding doses estimated from gamma and radon obtained in Kurday, Kazakhstan and Taboshar, Tajikistan were also compared. The risk of human stochastic effects (excess cancer) from the estimated total doses was also evaluated. The absorbed gamma dose rates in air were measured at every sampling sites and also in the dwellings, using different dosimeters like Geiger <b>Muller</b> <b>type</b> (DKS- 96 Automess) and scintillation type (SRP- 68, Radiagem) dosimeters. For every measurement points, the detectors were positioned 1 m above the ground and occasionally at ground. In addition, simulteneous outdoor and indoor radon concentrations measurements were conducted around the Pit Lake, at the hills around the lake and in a grid pattern at the mountain plateau. Radon detectors were also placed indoor in the dwellings of Kurday, and outdoor in the garden of the dwellings. Indoor and outdoor concentration of Rn in air were measured using both active and passive devices. The screenings of preliminary level of radon concentration were done by RAMON- 01, RRA AND PRM- 145. The track detectors were then placed for a longer period (2 - 9 months). All the data were analyzed using windows office EXCEL 2007 and minitab 16. For all analyisis, p values << 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Annual average effective doses were estimated by extrapolating the abosorbed doses in air over the measured period and using the conversion factor 1 Sv/Gy. Indoor occupancy of 6000 hours per year was used, while 350 hours and 700 hours per year were applied for tailing piles and for gardens of houses, respectively, to estimate doses. In case of radon doses, equilibrium factor 0. 4 was used, while the dose conversion factor applied was 9 nSv/Bq/m 3 /hour. The occupancy factor used in radon calculations was similar to that of gamma doses for corresponding locations. Similarly, the risk of developing cancer in human was estimated using the risk factor of 5 × 10 - 2 per Sv. As a summary, the gamma dose rates were found to vary within the studied areas; highest at the Pit lake (0. 11 - 1. 07 μGy/h) and waste rock piles (0. 7 - 1. 05 μGy/h), inside dwellings (0. 131 - 0. 254 μGy/h) and lowest in the gardens (0. 07 - 0. 21 μGy/h). The calculated mean annual effective doses of gamma radiation at different areas of Kurday were; Pit lake (0. 31 ± 0. 26 mSv), waste rock piles (0. 36 ± 0. 05 mSv) inside room (1. 40 ± 1. 80 mSv) and garden (0. 11 ± 0. 02 mSv). One way ANOVA analysis showed the variation of mean dose rates for all the four areas investigated. The mean dose rate measured in waste rock piles was significantly higher (p<< 0. 05) than that in Pit Lake, inside dwellings and in gardens. The radon concentrations also varied according to the sites investigated. Peak radon concentrations were found in the living rooms and bedrooms of two selected houses exceeding 1000 Bq/m 3. The mean radon concentrations of indoor environment (inside rooms) were found to be significantly higher (p<< 0. 05) than that in outdoor conditions (gardens). The regression analyses of outdoor gamma dose rate and outdoor radon concentrations, and indoor gamma dose rates and indoor radon concentrations conditions showed that both of the combinations have p<< 0. 05 and R 2 around 76 %. The mean effective doses due to outdoor radon exposures at Kurday area was found to be 0. 13 ± 0. 05 mSv whereas, the mean effective dose due to indoor radon exposure was estimated to be 3. 91 ± 1. 80 mSv. Similarly, the mean concentration of uranium in drinking water from Muzbell dwelling area was found to be 26 μg/L and the annual effective dose was estimated to be 0. 25 mSv. The total dose calculated was 6. 31 mSv/year where indoor radon was the largest dose contributor. The dose could potentially contribute to health injuries to the individuals to develop one cancerous case to ionizing radiation- at a risk factor of 5 × 10 - 2 per Sv. In conclusion, the present study based on the summary report obtained in the NATO RESCA project and JNKKT project showed that the Kurday area of Kazakhstan represent sources of potential contamination of the living environment i. e. gamma radiation, radon exposure and the uranium concentration in drinking water sources. The outdoor gamma dose rates (0. 078 - 1. 226 μGy/h) were found to be higher than the indoor gamma dose rates (0. 013 - 0. 69 μGy/h), whereas the indoor radon concentrations inside dwellings (70 - 330 Bq/m 3) were recorded to be higher than the outdoor radon concentrations (30 - 90 Bq/m 3). The values of outdoor gamma dose rates, indoor and outdoor radon concentrations are considerably higher than global average corresponding values. The mean uranium concentration in drinking water from Muzbel dwelling area (26 μg/L) was also found to be higher than the recommended value by WHO. The highest dose contribution to humans was obtained from indoor radon concentration (0. 18 - 7. 13 mSv) in the houses of Kurday area. The doses from indoor gamma radiation was also significantly high (0. 14 - 4. 14 mSv), while that from drinking water (0. 25 mSv) was quite low (within the recommended value) compared to indoor radon and gamma radiation doses. The outdoor annual gamma doses obtained in Kurday, Kazakhstan were found to be similar to the outdoor gamma doses observed in Taboshar, Tajikistan (around 0. 6 mSv). However, the outdoor radon in Taboshar was found to be five times higher than that in Kurday, both the values were lower than the global recommended values. Similarly, the indoor radon dose and indoor gamma dose in Kurday and that in Taboshar were in the comparable range. However, the peak values for indoor gamma doses were found to be higher in Kurday than those in Taboshar region. The radiological risk to human (cancer) from the total dose was estimated to be one cancerous case in Kurday with 3000 population. Therefore, on the basis of the present findings, it can be recommended that interventions should be made at the high doses sites in Kurday region in order to minimize the probability of human stochastic effects and thereby limit the public doses as low as reasonably achievable...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) in the profile may constitute a significant factor for soil carbon cycling. However, {{the formation of the}} SOM profile is currently poorly understood due to equifinality, caused by the entanglement of several processes: input from roots, mixing due to bioturbation, and organic matter leaching. In this study we quantified the contribution of these three processes using Bayesian parameter estimation for the mechanistic SOM profile model SOMPROF. Based on organic carbon measurements, 13 parameters related to decomposition and transport of organic matter were estimated for two temperature forest soils: an Arenosol with a mor humus form (Loobos, The Netherlands), and a Cambisol with <b>mull</b> <b>type</b> humus (Hainich, Germany). Furthermore, the use of the radioisotope 210 Pbex as tracer for vertical SOM transport was studied. For Loobos the calibration results demonstrate the importance of liquid phase transport for shaping the vertical SOM profile, while the effects of bioturbation are generally negligible. These results are in good agreement with expectations given in situ conditions. For Hainich the calibration offered three distinct explanations for the observations (three modes in the posterior distribution). With the addition of 210 Pbex data and prior knowledge, as well as additional information about in situ conditions, we were able to identify the most likely explanation, which identified root litter input as the dominant process for the SOM profile. For both sites the organic matter appears to comprise mainly adsorbed but potentially leachable material, pointing to the importance of organo-mineral interactions. Furthermore, organic matter in the mineral soil appears to be mainly derived from root litter, supporting previous studies that highlighted the importance of root input for soil carbon sequestration. The 210 Pbex measurements added only slight additional constraint on the estimated parameters. However, with sufficient replicate measurements and possibly in combination with other tracers, this isotope may still hold value as tracer for a SOM transport...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen {{isotope ratio}} (δ 15 N) of {{terrestrial}} plants and soils {{are recognized as}} indicators of N cycle, since isotopic fractionations during the processes in N cycle cause variations in these δ 15 N values. Recent accumulation of δ 15 N data for wide spatial areas has enabled to investigate the characteristics of δ 15 N in large spatial scale from region toglobe. These studies have revealed that the ecosystem state factors such as climate, soil age, topography, parent material, and cultivation contribute spatial variation of δ 15 N. However, the contribution of vegetation type, one of the ecosystem state factors, has not been evaluated yet. To interpret the spatial patterns of δ 15 N into N cycle, the range ofδ 15 N variation with associated N process need to be evaluated for each factor. This studyaimed to clarify the variations in plant and soil δ 15 N and associated processes which arise from vegetation type. Six observation areas were set in the forest-grassland boundary in northern Mongolia, and sampling sites were set along forest to grassland boundary within an area. Each site was classified into forest site or boundary site, and needles of siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) and soils were investigated. The different type of accumulation of organic layer was observed in this region between forest and boundary sites: “moder type” in forest site and “mull type” boundary site. Needle and soil δ 15 N, and the difference in δ 15 N between needle and soil (Δδ 15 N) showed clear spatial trends along forest to grassland boundary in an area, and those trends were also consistent in all areas: needle and soil δ 15 N were low in forest sites and high at boundary sites, whereas Δδ 15 N was large in forest sites and small at boundary sites. The range of Δδ 15 N observed in this region was 7 ‰ (- 8. 4 ‰ to - 1. 8 ‰), which occupied half of the estimated range in globe. The N cycle processes suggested bynitrogen isotope mass balance and observed environmental parameters matched the typical characteristics of moder type in forest sites and and <b>mull</b> <b>type</b> at boundary sites. Small Δδ 15 N observed at grassland boundary was explained by rapid recycling of Nbetween larch and soil without significant microbial immobilization, whereas largeΔδ 15 N observed in forest was explained by significant microbial immobilization which retained 15 N-riched part of available N in soil, and additional N supply from organic layer to larch. This study proposes the new relationship between the type of the accumulation of organic layer and the variation in the difference between plant and soil δ 15 N (Δδ 15 N) through the divergence of available N between uptake by larch and immobilization by microbes along forest to grassland boundary...|$|R

In addition to soils exposed in their sites of origin, replicate units containing labelled material were translocated {{in a cascade}} sequence southwards along the transect, to simulate the effects of climate warming on decomposition processes. The current Atlantic climate represented the most favourable soil temperature and moisture conditions for decomposition. Northward this climatic zone, where the soil processes are essentially temperature-limited, the prediction for a temperature increase of 3 degrees C estimated a probable increase of C mineralisation by 20 - 25 % for the boreal zone and 10 % for the cool temperate zone. Southward the cool Atlantic climate zone, (the Mediterranean climate), where the processes are seasonally moisture-limited, the predicted increase of temperature by 1 - 2 degrees C little affected the soil organic matter dynamics, because of the higher water deficit.

40|$|Duchaufour {{has noted}} the {{relation}} between forest humus typesand natural regeneration of Fir in the Vosges : on the biologicallyactive humus of the <b>Mull</b> acide <b>type,</b> which maintain a high levelof fertility {{for the growth of}} adult trees, barely any seedlings areencountered, although they abund on the slowly decomposing humusof the Model,- or Mor types. Investigation of this phenomenonemphasized the decisive rôle played by the moss carpet which, byprotecting Moder and Mor against intense evaporation, maintainsthe humidity required by the growing seedlings; on the contrary,Hull humus are either bare or covered with a herbaceous florawhich dries up the zone occupied by the roots of the young seedlings. Investigation pursued at the Soils Laboratory of the Ecole Nationaledes Eaux et Forêts, has shown that the Mull of the Vosgesforests already highly permeable to water because of its coarsestructure, may loose through drought and changes in the state ofits colloidal components, the capacity to absorb summer rainfallwhich then infiltrates at a rate four-times that prevailing in thespring. The soil colloids seem to recuperate slowly during autumnor winter their initial water-holding capacity. However, the few Fir seedlings that were found in the Hullhumus possessed peculiar characteristics of atrophy and necrosisin their root system. As these symptoms seemed evidence for toxicityof some nature, it appeared logical to investigate the activityof antiphytotic substances. Laboratory cultures of seedlings in the various humus types, wateredwith aqueous extracts of these same humus, did not revealany toxic activity of the Mull as long as the humidity of the culturemedia remained high; but upon lowering the moisture contentof the humus, the necrosis of the roots already noted in the fieldstarted to appear and was followed by the death of the seedlings. The hypothesis of intoxication by water-soluble antiphytotic substanceshad therefore to be abandoned, since their activity should undoubtedlyhave increased {{as a consequence of the}} higher concentrationsarising from the extract-waterings. Chemical investigation of the soil revealed that a very largeamount of manganese, — particularly in its di-valent form availahle to plants, — was present in the toxic humus layer, even whenthis element was only found as traces in the sub-soil. The enrichmentis brought about by the adult trees which concentrate in theirfoliage the Manganese obtained by the deeper roots from the soil. The quantity of manganese in the various humus types, whenexpressed on a weight basis is already noticeably higher in Mullthan in Moder and Mor. This difference is in fact much more importantif it is considered that Moder and Mor have an apparentdensity 4 to 5 times lower than Therefore, and takinginto account the fact that seedling roots occupy a given volume ofsoil, exchangeable manganese :vas expressed as milliequivalents per 100 cubic centimeters. EXCHANGEABLE MANGANESE (in me/ 100 cc) Mull ModerSurface horizon 0. 14 - 1, 60 Traces - 0. 06 Sub-soil 0. 01 - 0. 13 Traces - 0. 01 This accumulation of manganese in Hull is attributed to theintense biological activity cf this type of humus, characterized by arapid mineralization of the litter, and also to seasonal drying whichincreases the plant-available reduced manganese at the expense ofthe higher hydrated oxides. Sand cultures were set up to verify the action of increasingamounts of manganese, toxicity of the M++ icn appearing in Firat a concentration of 5. 10 - 6. Mortality is slow and progressive atlow concentrations, but very rapid above 50. 10 - 6 : necrosis of theroots becomes evident and mortality is accelerated when the humidityof the culture media is lowered. The conclusion is therefore justified that disappearance of Firseedlings in the <b>Mull</b> humus <b>types</b> of the Vosges, is caused biologicallyby accumulation in the humus of exchangeable manganese,the toxic activity of which is considerably increased during periodsof drought...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades the theory of finite automata on {{infinite}} objects {{has been an important}} source of tools for the specification and the verification of computer programs. Trees are more suitable than words to model nondeterminism and thus concurrency. In the literature, there are several examples of acceptance conditions that have been proposed for automata on infinite words and then have been fruitfully extended to infinite trees (Büchi, Rabin, and <b>Muller</b> conditions). The <b>type</b> of acceptance condition can influence both the succinctness of the corresponding class of automata and the complexity of the related decision problems. Here we consider, for automata on infinite trees, two acceptance conditions that are obtained by a relaxation of the Muller acceptance condition: the Landweber and the Muller-Superset conditions. We prove that Muller-Superset tree automata accept the same class of languages as Büchi tree automata, but using more succinct automata. Landweber tree automata, instead, define a class of languages which is not comparable with the one defined by Büchi tree automata. We prove that, for this class of automata, the emptiness problem is decidable in polynomial time, and thus we expand the class of automata with a tractable emptiness problem...|$|R
50|$|Potassium spatial {{buffering}} {{that occurs}} in the retina is called potassium siphoning, where the Muller cell is the principal glial cell <b>type.</b> <b>Muller</b> cells have important role in retinal physiology. It maintains retinal cell metabolism and are critical in maintaining potassium homeostasis in extracellular space during neuronal activity. Like cells responsible for spatial buffering, Muller cells are distinctively permeable to potassium ions through Kir channels. Like other glial cells, the high selectivity of Muller cell membranes to potassium ions {{is due to the}} high density of Kir channels. Potassium conductance is unevenly distributed in Muller cells. By focally increasing potassium ions along amphibian Muller cells and recording the resulting depolarization, the observed potassium conductance was concentrated in the endfoot process of 94% of the total potassium conductance localized to the small subcellular domain. The observation lead to hypothesis that excess potassium in extracellular space is “siphoned” by the Muller cells to the vitreous humor. Potassium siphoning is a specialized form of spatial buffering mechanisms where large reservoir of potassium ions is emptied into vitreous humor. Similar distribution pattern of Kir channels could be found in amphibians.|$|R
40|$|Background: The pathologies of {{numerous}} retinal degenerative diseases {{can be attributed}} to a multitude of genetic factors, and individualized treatment options for afflicted patients are limited and cost-inefficient. In light of the shared neurodegenerative phenotype among these disorders, a safe and broad-based neuroprotective approach would be desirable to overcome these obstacles. As a result, gene delivery of secretable-neuroprotective factors to <b>Müller</b> cells, a <b>type</b> of retinal glia that contacts all classes of retinal neurons, represents an ideal approach to mediate protection of the entire retina through a simple and innocuous intraocular, or intravitreal, injection of an efficient vehicle such as an adenoassociated viral vector (AAV). Although several naturally occurring AAV variants have been isolated with a variety of tropisms, or cellular specificities, these vectors inefficiently infect Müller cells via intravitreal injection. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have previously applied directed evolution to create several novel AAV variants capable of efficient infection of both rat and human astrocytes through iterative selection of a panel of highly diverse AAV libraries. Here, in vivo and in vitro characterization of these isolated variants identifies a previously unreported AAV variant ShH 10, closely related to AAV serotype 6 (AAV 6), capable of efficient, selective Müller cell infection through intravitreal injection. Importantly, this new variant shows significantly improved transduction relative to AAV 2 (. 60 %) and AAV 6.

40|$|We analyse the radial {{growth of}} silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in the Vosges {{mountain}} in north-eastern France {{in relation to}} soil, climate and interspecific competition factors and to check the temporal stability of their effects during the 20 th century. Data were collected from 143 plots regularly distributed over three altitude ranges (from 330 to 1100 m), three humus forms (moder to <b>mull)</b> and seven <b>types</b> of stands, including a pure stand of silver fir and six mixed stands containing this species. For each plot, an index of mean radial growth of silver fir was calculated, independent of tree age and calendar year of ring formation. Relationships between radial growth and ecological factors were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Radial growth of silver fir is low {{in the presence of}} Picea abies or of a high density of other dominant trees. Low aluminium concentration and good nitrogen supply, measured by the soil C:N ratio, are correlated with high radial growth. Water reserves, related to available water storage capacity and to lateral run-off, are also correlated with high radial growth. Analysis of environmental effects during the 20 th century showed that growth was strongly correlated with nitrogen supply {{at the start of the}} century, and with aluminium toxicity and climate at the end of the century. The radial growth of trees located on sites with low nitrogen supply was lower before 1970 than that of trees located on nitrogen-rich soils. At the end of the century, radial growth of silver fir was the same for all levels of nitrogen nutrition. Our results indicate that nitrogen supply was a limiting factor for the mean radial growth of silver fir before the 1970 s. Eutrophication during the 20 th century may then have eliminated limitation by nitrogen...|$|R
