The bear at once pulled up, smelt it all round, tossed it into {{the air with his}} snout, pawed it once or twice, then tore it to pieces with one wrench, and {{continued}} the chase. Very little time was lost in this operation. He was soon up with the man again; then a mitten was thrown down for his inspection. After that the other mitten went, the cravat followed, and the axe went next. All that I have just related happened in a very few minutes. Davy was still a good quarter of a mile from the brig; everything that he could tear off his person in haste and throw down was gone, and the bear was once <b>more</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> behind. As a last hope he pulled off his heavy fur-coat and dropped it. This seemed to be a subject of great interest to the bear, for it was longer in inspecting it than the other things. And now poor Butts went tearing along like a maniac, in his flannel shirt and trousers. He was a miserable and curious object, for his body, besides being very long, was uncommonly lanky, and his legs and arms seemed to go like the wings of a windmill. Never, since the day of his birth, had Davy Butts run at such a pace, in such light clothing, and in such severe frost! ...|$|E

5000|$|Mayo {{returned}} to the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final in 2012 only for the [...] "Kafkaesque black farce" [...] to continue as usual - with Donegal allowed to bridge a 20-year gap between titles, helped {{in no small part}} by a nightmare opening quarter for Mayo as Michael Murphy launched a rocket of a shot into the goal after three minutes. Then, in the eleventh minute, Colm McFadden seized the ball from the grasp of Kevin Keane and slid it into the net for a second Donegal goal. Mayo managed thirteen points to Donegal's two goals and eleven, only got on the scoresheet after sixteen minutes when already two goals behind and never led during the match. 2013 saw Mayo in the final again, and once <b>more</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> short, this time being seen off by Dublin, who won by a single point. 2016 likewise, a single point against Dublin, though this time after a replay; the drawn game featuring two own goals by Mayo players.|$|E

By this measurements, the driving circuits in the boost converter are optimized in order to achieve high efficiency. The application of SiC BJTs in a high efficient 5 kW boost converter stage for PV systems (300 V 800 V) is demonstrated and the results are compared to the results obtained with the application of common silicon (Si) IGBTs...|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} has shown that analogies and metaphors can be useful tools in problem solving tasks (e. g., Gick 2 ̆ 6 Holyoak, 1980). In addition, mood has been shown to have an effect on a person’s ability to generate solutions to problems (Abele, 1992). The present study was designed to investigate how mood affects analogical problem solving, especially in relation to conflict resolution. I examined whether mood has the same effect on the use of analogies to solve interpersonal conflict problems as it does on the use of analogies to solve cognitive problems. In this experiment, participants began by writing about an especially happy or sad personal experience. After this mood induction, participants were presented with one solved interpersonal conflict problem and then its unsolved analogical problem as well as one solved cognitive problem and then its unsolved analogical problem. The participants were then instructed to type all possible solutions to the unsolved problems they read. Results showed that mood did not affect average analogy scores across both problems nor that mood differentially affected cognitive versus interpersonal problems. However, participants in a positive mood showed greater overall average solution efficacy scores, suggesting better overall problem solving abilities. In addition, participants had a <b>more</b> difficult time <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with analogical solutions for the interpersonal problem as compared to the cognitive problem, but that they had a <b>more</b> difficult time <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with alternative solutions for the cognitive problem as compared to the interpersonal problem.
