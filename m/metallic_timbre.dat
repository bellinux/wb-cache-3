50|$|The bass {{aperture}} {{is known}} as the thoppi or eda bhaaga and the smaller aperture {{is known as}} the valanthalai or bala bhaaga. The smaller membrane, when struck, produces higher pitched sounds with a <b>metallic</b> <b>timbre.</b> The wider aperture produces lower pitched sounds. The goat skin covering the smaller aperture is anointed in the center with a black disk made of rice flour, ferric oxide powder and starch. This black tuning paste {{is known as the}} satham or karanai and gives the mridangam its distinct <b>metallic</b> <b>timbre.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Dominican güira {{is similar}} in usage to the Puerto Rican/Cuban güiro though of {{distinct}} timbre. Whereas the güiro is often a hollowed-out gourd, thus producing a more wooden tone, the metal construction of the güira gives it a characteristic <b>metallic</b> <b>timbre.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{music video}} {{was created in}} {{computer}} graphics by Semiconductor's Joe Gerhardt and Ruth Jarman. It follows the view of a flock of birds, and presents a lighthouse, presumably {{very similar to the}} house in which they stayed. Brad Osborn has noted how the craggy, icy peaks depicted in the video are linked to the pentatonic leaps in the lead vocal melody, and also to the cold, <b>metallic</b> <b>timbres</b> used in the recording.|$|R
50|$|Normally a güira {{consists}} of an open-ended tube with many sound-producing nodules protruding its outer (usual) playing surface. The body of the güira is generally some type of thin sheet steel. One commercial variant commonly called a torpedo is fully enclosed with tapered ends and is supplied with mineral or glass beads or metal shot inside to double as a shaker. Given its unwieldy shape and the additional weight of tapered ends and shaker fill, using a güira as a shaker may be impractical. Regardless of how it is used, its traditional main function is to propel the tempo, not only to add its uniquely swishy <b>metallic</b> <b>timbre's</b> sabor ("flavor").|$|R
5000|$|The vocalisations of {{this species}} are diverse and {{markedly}} loud. The basic call is a high-pitched, rapid pi-pi-pi-pi [...] which has a somewhat <b>metallic</b> <b>timbre</b> and can be uttered when the bird stands on the ground during daytime. This call has been said to resemble {{the sound of a}} banjo with brass strings so big that it could be heard {{a mile and a half}} away.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1940s, Andrés Segovia {{mentioned}} {{the shortage of}} good guitar strings in the United States, particularly his favorite Pirastro catgut strings, {{to a number of}} foreign diplomats at a party, including General Lindeman of the British Embassy. A month later, the General presented Segovia with some nylon strings which he had obtained via some members of the DuPont family. Segovia found that although the strings produced a clear sound, they had a faint <b>metallic</b> <b>timbre</b> which he hoped could be eliminated.|$|E
40|$|The {{geometry}} of a floating bridge on a drumhead soundboard produces string stretching that is first {{order in the}} amplitude of the bridge motion. This stretching modulates the string tension and consequently modulates string frequencies at acoustic frequencies. Early work in electronic sound synthesis identified such modulation {{as a source of}} bell-like and <b>metallic</b> <b>timbre.</b> And increasing string stretching by adjusting banjo string-tailpiece-head geometry enhances characteristic banjo tone. Hence, this mechanism is likely a significant source of the ring, ping, clang, and plunk common to the family of instruments that share floating-bridge/drumhead construction...|$|E
50|$|Naděžda Kniplová (née Pokorná) (born 18 April 1932) is a Czech operatic soprano who had {{an active}} {{international}} career from the 1950s through the 1980s. Kniplová possessed a large voice with a sonorous, <b>metallic,</b> dark <b>timbre</b> that was particularly well suited to the dramatic soprano repertoire. While she was most admired in Czech operas and as Wagnerian heroines, she sang a wide repertoire that also encompassed Italian, Russian, and Hungarian language roles. A fine actress, her performances were praised for their intensity and pathos. However, some critics commented on a certain lack of steadiness or purity in her singing. Her voice is preserved {{on a number of}} recordings made on the Supraphon and Decca labels.|$|R
