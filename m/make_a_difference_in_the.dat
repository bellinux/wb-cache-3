25|$|Despite {{it being}} {{increasingly}} {{clear to the}} organizers of the project that it would never be finished in time to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war, the construction of Weingut I was approved on a 6-month time-line. Of a total of 10,000 workers who worked on the project, 8,500 were forced laborers and inmates of the Mühldorf concentration camp network. Of these more than 3,000 would die of overwork, underfeeding, and SS brutality. By the war's end, only 7 of the planned total of 12 bunker sections had been built, and construction of the factory itself had not begun.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, a {{scientist}} at the Naval Research Laboratory published a report of ten sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers, including nine in the Pearl River along the Louisiana-Mississippi border {{and one in the}} Choctawhatchee River. Three of the sightings are supported by video footage of birds with flights, behaviors, field marks, and other characteristics that {{do not seem to be}} consistent with any species of the region other than the ivory-billed woodpecker. Nobody has managed to obtain indisputable photographic evidence for the persistence of the ivory-billed woodpecker, but the paper contains an analysis based on factors related to behavior and habitat suggesting that such evidence is unlikely to be obtained in time to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conservation of this species.|$|E

25|$|APL {{has been}} both criticized and praised for its choice of a unique, {{non-standard}} character set. Some who learn it become ardent adherents, suggesting {{that there is some}} weight behind Iverson's idea that the notation used does <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> beginning, there were few terminal devices and even display monitors that could reproduce the APL character set—the most popular ones employing the IBM Selectric print mechanism used with a special APL type element. One of the early APL line terminals (line-mode operation only, not full screen) was the Texas Instruments TI Model 745 (circa 1977) with the full APL character set which featured half and full duplex telecommunications modes, for interacting with an APL time-sharing service or remote mainframe to run a remote computer job, called an RJE.|$|E
25|$|Dark Horse Comics {{acquired}} the rights in 1990 and published The Terminator (titled Tempest in trade paperbacks to distinguish itself), {{where a group}} of human soldiers and four Terminators come to the present, to respectively kill or protect the developers of Skynet. One of the Terminators is Dudley, a human doctor with cybernetic implants, and he betrays his group as he feels he can <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. In the following year's sequel Secondary Objectives, the surviving Terminator leader, C890.L, is reprogrammed to destroy another Terminator sent to aid him and kill Sarah Connor. In the immediate follow-up The Enemy Within, C890.L rebuilds and modifies himself to become more dangerous than ever, while a team of human assassins attempt to return to the past and kill a Skynet developer. The 1992 Endgame concludes this arc, with human colonel Mary Randall, having lost Dudley and her soldiers in the final battle with C890.L, protecting Sarah Connor as she goes into labor. Sarah gives birth to a girl named Jane, whose future leadership means Skynet is quickly defeated and never develops time travel.|$|E
25|$|Aiken {{attended}} Raleigh's Leesville Road High School {{and took}} courses at Campbell University before enrolling at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. In 1995, Clay started {{working at the}} YMCA. Still in high school, Clay learned quickly that he could <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lives of young people. He found his interest in special education while directing YMCA children's camps as a teenager, and at age 19, {{he served as a}} substitute teacher for a classroom of students with autism at Brentwood Elementary School in Raleigh. It was during that experience that he decided to finish college and become a special education teacher. While attending college in Charlotte, he took a part-time job as an assistant to a boy with autism, and it was this child's mother, Diane Bubel, who urged him to audition for American Idol. Although his American Idol activities temporarily delayed his academic pursuits, Aiken completed his course work while on tour and graduated with a bachelor's degree in special education in December 2003.|$|E

500|$|Many audiophiles {{and reporters}} {{disagree}} on whether more expensive cables {{have an effect}} on audio quality. In 1980 Speaker Builder said that Monster audio cables were [...] "a reasonable investment" [...] and that they out-perform generic 24- or 18- gauge cables. Tests by Stereo Review Magazine in 1983 concluded that Monster cables did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sound and were [...] "indistinguishable" [...] from 16-gauge lamp cord.

[...] The same publication in 1990 said that whether the cables are worth it depends on the application and the user's willingness to pay a premium.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, {{he defended}} {{students}} who had been tortured for suspicion of possession of contraband literature. Following this he {{decided to become a}} human rights lawyer. In early 2003, he was quoted as saying, [...] "After that defense, my life was totally changed. At first, even I couldn't believe that they had been tortured that harshly.

[...] "I do not understand how in just a few days, I could have lost over 2,000 votes, while Mr. Lambert gains as many," [...] said Fitzmorris. The suit listed thousands of alleged acts of election fraud and irregularities in twenty parishes.

Corban is committed small class sizes and interactive pedagogy, where students are treated as individuals. In order to graduate, students must also complete a minimum of 50 hours of community outreach.

2500|$|Poorly socialized or frightened Chihuahuas can {{be easily}} {{provoked}} to attack, and are therefore generally unsuitable for homes with small and undisciplined children. The breed tends to be fiercely loyal to one particular person {{and in some cases}} may become over protective of the person, especially around other people or animals. They are frequently not introduced to or socialized with dogs of other breeds, and as a result do not interact as well with them as other dogs who have been socialized to interact with different breed types and tend to have a [...] "clannish" [...] nature, often preferring the companionship of other Chihuahuas or Chihuahua mixes over other dogs. These traits generally make them unsuitable for households with children who are not patient and calm. If properly managed by older children, 13 and up, they can adapt to this kind of living with a dedicated owner.

2500|$|In 1991, she {{was hired}} by Northwestern University School of Law, as an adjunct {{professor}} of law with the title [...] "Clinical Associate Professor of Law". She {{was one of the}} founders of the Children and Family Justice Center, which supports the legal needs of adolescents and their families, in the Bluhm Legal Clinic at Northwestern Law. She left Northwestern Law on August 31, 2013. Because Dohrn was hired as an adjunct (a temporary assignment), her appointment did not need to be approved by the faculty. When law school officials were asked whether or not the dean hired Dohrn or the board of trustees approved the hiring, the school issued a statement in response stating: [...] "While many would take issue with views Ms. Dohrn espoused during the 1960s, her career at the law school is an example of a person's ability to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legal system." [...] Dohrn now serves on the board of numerous human rights committees. Since 2002, she has served as Visiting Law Faculty at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.

2500|$|The first {{production}} meeting between U2 and their creative {{team for the}} Innocence + Experience Tour was held in March 2013. Although Songs of Innocence was still in progress {{at the time and}} did not yet have a title, the autobiographical narrative that would characterise the album was already a driving idea for their tour. The band wanted {{to tell the story of}} their adolescence in Dublin in the 1970s and how they were [...] "trying to figure out how they fit into the often violent and disrupted world outside" [...] their homes. The manifesto for the tour was summarized by two phrases: [...] "I can't change the world, but I can change the world in me", and [...] "I can the change the world, but I can't change the world in me." [...] The first is a lyric from the band's 1981 song [...] "Rejoice" [...] and represents the mindset of a teenage Bono feeling powerless to make a difference in a world plagued by the Troubles, who instead views personal psychological changes as a possibility; the second phrase represents the modern-day realization that the same person could <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world through philanthropic efforts but still struggle with the complexities of internal change. Devlin said, [...] "The space between these two statements is the territory of the album and of the show." [...] The band intended to stage shows in pairs and alternate the setlist between [...] "innocence" [...] and [...] "experience" [...] motifs night to night. Williams said, [...] "The artfulness in this tour is in the ideas, not the hardware".|$|E
