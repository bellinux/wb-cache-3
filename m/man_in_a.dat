5|$|Created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, Raynor is {{loosely based}} on a {{character}} {{of the same name}} in the 1991 film Rush. Metzen conceived Raynor to represent the ordinary <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series populated with politically motivated characters. Raynor's physical appearance was designed by Metzen himself. A Terran in his thirties, Raynor is a former soldier and outlaw who eventually becomes a marshal on a backwater colony world. Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk's revolution against the oppressive Terran Confederacy but becomes disillusioned with Mengsk's genocidal tactics, forming his own paramilitary group to challenge Mengsk's tyranny.|$|E
5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter did not like mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, they realized that the two entities were separate and stood on their own.|$|E

5|$|Giovanni Battista Grassi, {{professor}} of Comparative Anatomy at Rome University, showed that human malaria {{could only be}} transmitted by Anopheles (Greek anofelís: good-for-nothing) mosquitoes.

5|$|Grizzly Rage {{breaks the}} {{standard}} mold for many Syfy natural horror films {{in that the}} bear featured is a normal grizzly bear rather than a mutant or genetically altered animal. However, the bear and actors never appear {{together in the same}} frame, rather a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bear suit takes over the role when the actors must interact with the bear. Critics heavily panned the film, feeling its plot, script, characters, and special effects were substandard.|$|E
