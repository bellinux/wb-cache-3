5|$|The Sagarin {{computer}} ratings calculated Alabama's {{strength of}} schedule {{to be the}} <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> out of the 245 Division I teams. The Congrove Computer Rankings also calculated it as the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> out of the 120 Division I FBS teams in its rankings. Alabama's 2009 schedule was officially released on December 19, 2008. In accordance with conference rules, Alabama faced all five Western Division opponents: Arkansas, Auburn, LSU, Mississippi State, and Ole Miss. They also faced three Eastern Division opponents: official SEC rival Tennessee, Kentucky, and South Carolina. Alabama did not play SEC opponents Georgia and Vanderbilt. Although not on the regular season schedule, Bama met Florida in the SEC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth {{stage was}} {{considered}} to be one of two queen stages, <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> stages, of this Giro, as it contained many high mountain climbs and the Giro's <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> summit stage finish. After the second rest day came an unusual stage, one that was very short in terms of sheer distance but on par with previous mountain stages in terms of difficulty. These stages were won by Carlos Sastre and Franco Pellizotti, respectively, who fought for the third step on the Giro's podium behind Menchov and previous race leader Danilo Di Luca. Though Sastre went on to win another stage, to Mount Vesuvius, it was Pellizotti who finished the Giro third overall.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the casting}} director, Newt was the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> role to cast: Schoolchildren were auditioned, {{but many of them}} had acted in {{commercials}} and were accustomed to smiling after saying their lines. Henn, from Atwater, California was chosen out of 500 children for the role, although she had no previous acting experience. She received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, but chose not to pursue an acting career, and became a teacher.|$|E

5|$|Alabama played four non-conference games. The {{game against}} Penn State was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played {{as part of the}} 2004 season, however the series was moved back to this season at the request of Alabama due to fallout from NCAA sanctions being levied on the program. The non-conference schedule also included games against Kent State of the Mid-American Conference, North Texas of the Sun Belt Conference and Georgia Southern of the Southern Conference. Alabama had one bye week after the Tennessee game and prior to the first LSU game. On December 4, 2011, the final Bowl Championship Series standings were unveiled with a rematch between No.1 LSU and No.2 Alabama in the BCS National Championship Game. The Sagarin computer ratings calculated Alabama's 2011 strength of schedule to be the fifteenth <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> out of the 246 Division I teams. The Cosgrove Computer Rankings calculated it as the twenty-ninth <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> out of the 120 Division I FBS teams in its rankings.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his match in 1890–91 against Gunsberg, some {{commentators}} showed an understanding of and appreciation for Steinitz's theories. Shortly before the 1894 match with Emanuel Lasker, even the New York Times, which had earlier published attacks on his play and character, paid tribute to his playing record, the importance of his theories, and his sportsmanship in agreeing to the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> match of his career despite his previous intention of retiring.|$|E

5|$|Development of Panzer Dragoon Saga began {{around the}} same time as its predecessor, Panzer Dragoon II Zwei (1996). According to {{director}} Yukio Futatsugi, the need to blend the series' shooting elements into an RPG with full 3D and voice acting, unusual for RPGs at the time, made it the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> Panzer Dragoon game to develop. Two staff members died during its two-year development, which Futatsugi attributed to the stressful working conditions of the video game industry.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} novel has been {{acclaimed}} in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner {{was writing about}} a Brazilian theme.

Irino said that {{ever since the}} introduction of the original Syaoranwho he also voicedhe sometimes had problems voicing both characters. Fellow voice actress Yui Makino also discussed Irino's role, saying that he was the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> character to cast because of the requirement to portray the two Syaorans.|$|E

LeMond later stated the 1986 Tour was the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> and stressful race of his career.|$|E

5|$|Shooting for {{the film}} was {{conducted}} in Kota, Jakarta, and Semarang, Central Java, {{over a period of}} one month. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> scenes to shoot were those which happened in modern times, especially the riots; for set design, however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that occurred in the past to be the <b>most</b> <b>difficult,</b> owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director who told the actors exactly what he wanted in a clear manner. However, cinematographer Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{creation}} of novel views using pre-stored images or image-based rendering has many potential applications, such as visual simulation, virtual reality and telepresence, for which traditional computer graphics based on geometric modeling would be unsatisfactory particularly with very complex 3 D scenes. This paper presents a new image-based rendering system that tackles the two <b>most</b> <b>difficults</b> problems of image-based modeling: pixel matching and visibility handling. We first introduce the joint view triangulation (JVT), a novel representation for pairs of images that handles the visibility and occlusion problems {{created by the}} parallaxes between the images. The joint view triangulation is build from matched planar patches regularized by local smooth constraints encoded by plane homographies. Then, we introduce an incremental edge-constrained construction algorithm. Finally, we present a pseudo-painter's rendering algorithm for the joint view triangulation and demonstrate the performance of these methods experimentally...|$|R
