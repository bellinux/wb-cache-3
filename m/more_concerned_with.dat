5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two problems at the LJS: first, he felt that the students there were <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> competition than his theories, and second, he felt that the students did not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts.

Mandelson headed the Campaigns and Communications Directorate, established in 1985, and initiated the Shadow Communications Agency. He oversaw Labour's relationship with the media and believed {{in the importance of}} the agenda-setting role of the press. He felt that the agenda of the press (broadsheets in particular) would influence important political broadcasters.

Smith delivered an openly defiant speech to his parliament on 30 June, attacking Britain for its handling of the Commonwealth's newer members, which he said were unduly influencing British policy in Africa. Britain was desperate to avoid the international humiliation that would accompany the organisation's break-up, he claimed, and was therefore attempting to hold it together by appeasing the less prominent members. While making clear his disdain, the Prime Minister pledged {{to go on with}} negotiations, saying that he did not believe Britain truly endorsed its professed line.|$|E

5|$|Of the six {{divisions}} encamped on {{the western}} side of the Tennessee River in early April, only Lew Wallace's 3rd Division was at Crump's Landing; the remainder were farther south (upriver) at Pittsburg Landing. Grant developed a reputation during the war for being <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> his own plans than with those of the enemy. His encampment at Pittsburg Landing displayed his most consequential lack of such concern—his army was spread out in bivouac style, with many of his men surrounding a small, log meetinghouse named Shiloh Church (Shiloh was a biblical city that served as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel), passing the time waiting for Buell's army with drills for his many raw troops without establishing entrenchments or other significant defensive measures.|$|E
5|$|Since the Middle Ages, {{both the}} Stjørdalen and Verdal valleys were {{important}} trade routes connecting Trøndelag and Jämtland. In particular, Levanger grew into an important trading town for Jämtland farmers, who would travel across the Verdal Mountains. The first public {{discussion of a}} railway was launched in Levanger in 1858; the initiative was pushed by Jämtland's governor Thome, who proposed a line via Verdal to Levanger. At the time, the Trondhjem–Støren Line {{was about to be}} built, and the commercial interests in Trondheim were <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> a southward connection along what would become the Røros Line to Oslo.

40|$|Self-presentational motives {{underlying}} online {{social network}} (OSN) use were explored in samples of British and Japanese users.

Independent self-construal emerged {{as the most important}} predictor across both samples, with less independent participants showing <b>more</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> image management and modesty.

According to Batatu, this publication displayed <b>more</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> social issues than with national problems. Bitar and Aflaq's political stance was closer to the Syrian Communist Party than {{to any of the}} other political groups in Damascus. They became disillusioned with the Communists in 1936, after the Popular Front government came to power in France. Although the French Communist Party was now part of the government, France's approach to its colonies barely changed. Bitar and Aflaq were unhappy with the Syrian party's stance in these circumstances.|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{economics}} {{is dominated by}} the neoclassical perspective. However, there are also other approaches developed by very diverse heterodox schools of economic thought. The main aim of the paper is to present two contemporary heterodox schools of economic thought, namely institutional and feminist. According to the author, these two schools constitute interesting alternatives to the orthodox view of the economy and economic relations. Epistemological and methodological changes postulated by institutional and feminist economics broaden the scope of the discipline, by challenging economics to show <b>more</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> well-being, and encouraging the discipline to rethink its main areas of interest...|$|R

With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for Christians.

5|$|The {{tradition}} of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent {{for much of}} the sixteenth century.

Mary Queen of Scots had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, {{with the exception of the}} joint portrait with her second husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where heraldic display, or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait.|$|E
