No myoinosos- 2 can be detected. <b>Myoinositol</b> is unevenly distributed throughout the worm; the scolex and germinative region contains more free and phosphatidyl-bound inositol than the more posterior proglottids. This region also contains more lipid-bound phosphorus, less lipid and less water. <b>Myoinositol</b> absorption is more rapid in this anterior region. The absorption of <b>myoinositol</b> by Hymenolepis diminuta involves diffusion at high substrate concentrations and mediated transport at low substrate concentrations. The mediated transport process exhibits saturation kinetics with V(,max) and Kt being 0. 0105 (mu) moles/g ethanol extracted dry wt/ 4 min and 0. 0067 mM, respectively. It is sensitive to changes in temperature, pH and sodium ion concentration.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if the combination of <b>myoinositol</b> + folic acid was able to improve the oocyte quality, the ratio between follicles and retrieved oocytes, the fertilization rate, and the embryo quality in PCOS patients undergoing IvF treatments. 29 patients with PCOS underwent IvF protocols for infertility treatment and were randomized prospectively into two groups. Group A (placebo) with 15 patients and group B (4000 [*]mg <b>myoinositol</b> + 400 [*]μg folic acid per day) with 14 patients. The patients of group B used for two months <b>myoinositol</b> + folic acid before starting the IvF protocol and data were obtained concerning number of follicles, number of oocytes, quality of oocytes, fertilization rates, and embryo quality in both groups. The ratio follicle/retrieved oocyte was better in the <b>myoinositol</b> group (= group B). Out of the 233 oocytes collected in the <b>myoinositol</b> group 136 were fertilized, whereas only 128 out of 300 oocytes in the placebo group were fertilized.

40|$|The factors {{influencing}} {{the development of}} impaired sciatic motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) in acute experimental diabetes were examined. Decreased MNCV developed by the 14 th day after streptozotocin administration but only in rats which became hyperglycemic. Insulin treatment, begun on day 3, failed to prevent imparied MNCV in diabetic rats in which improved or normal weight gain and a decreased degree of hyperglycemia was induced. However, insulin treatment prevented the development of impaired MNCV {{in a group of}} diabetic rats in which the tail vein plasma glucose concentration was never found to exceed 160 mg/dl during days 6 through 14, andin which the mean plus or minus SEM of the average plasma glucose concentration for each animal during the same period was 75 plus or minus 18 mg/dl. In normal rats fed diets containing 0. 011 % or 0. 069 % free <b>myoinositol</b> (a presumably normal range), sciatic nerve free <b>myoinositol</b> concentrations were 90 - and 60 -fold higher than those in plasma. On these diets the development of impaired MNCV in the diabetics was associated with a decrease in nerve free <b>myoinositol</b> as compared with nerves from normals fed the same diet, despite similar plasma levels in the normals and diabetics. Plasma and nerve free <b>myoinositol</b> increased with increasing dietary <b>myoinositol</b> content in both normals and diabetics, and nerve <b>myoinositol</b> content could be acutely increased by an i. p. <b>myoinositol</b> load. By supplementing the diets with 1. 0 % <b>myoinositol,</b> the difference in nerve <b>myoinositol</b> in normal and diabetic rats on day 14 was abolished; on this diet the development of impaired MNCV in the diabetics was moderated or totally prevented, despite persistent hyperglycemia and elevated nerve sorbitol and fructose concentrations. Insulin treatment that prevented impaired MNCV prevented a decrease in nerve <b>myoinositol</b> in diabetics. These studies suggest that insulin deficiency, and possibly hyperglycemia, are primary factors in the development of imparied MNCV in acute experimental diabetes. However, the development of impaired MNCV appears to be related in some manner to a derangement in the regulation of nerve free <b>myoinositol</b> content, which appears to be subject to modification by increases in plasma <b>myoinositol</b> concentration over a critical range...|$|E

We describe here the kinetic comparison of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) recombinant VTC 4 with d-myoinositol 3 -phosphate (d-Ins 3 -P) and l-Gal 1 -P.

To determine whether the VTC 4 gene impacts <b>myoinositol</b> synthesis in Arabidopsis, we isolated T-DNA knockout lines of VTC 4 that exhibit small perturbations in abscisic acid, salt, and cold responses.

OBJECTIVE: to investigate which is the more effective between metformin and <b>myoinositol</b> on hormonal, clinical and metabolic parameters in obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). STUDY DESIGN: crossover randomized-controlled study. PATIENTS: Thirty-four PCOS obese women (age: 25. 62 ± 4. 7 years; BMI: 32. 55 ± 5. 67 kg/m 2) were randomized to receive metformin (850 mg twice a day) or <b>myoinositol</b> (1000 mg twice a day) for six months. After a three month washout, the same subjects received the other compound for the following six months. MEASUREMENTS: Ultrasonographic pelvic examinations, hirsutism score, anthropometric and menstrual pattern evaluation, hormonal profile assays, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and lipid profile at baseline and after 6 months of treatment were performed. RESULTS: Both metformin and <b>myoinositol</b> significantly reduced the insulin response to OGTT and improved insulin sensitivity. Metformin significantly decreased body weight, and improved menstrual pattern and Ferriman-Gallwey score. Metformin treatment was also associated with a significant decrease in LH and estradiol levels, androgens and AMH levels.

Chronic hyperglycemia results in the formation of glycated proteins and activation of pathways leading to diabetic nephropathy. Increasing RAGE and TGF? production in the kidney tissue is a major pathway involved in diabetic complications. In this survey, the effect of <b>myoinositol</b> and Crocin on RAGE and TGF? expression in the kidney of diabetic rats was studied. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study after rendering rats with diabetes with strepto-zotocin, they were treated with oral 1 % <b>myoinositol</b> and injection of 100 mg/kg BW crocin for 12 weeks. Changes in both RAGE and TGF? expressions in the kidney tissue were as-sessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. The data was analyzed by SPSS 18 software and one way ANOVA and Tukey statisticaly tests. Results: Crocin administration caused a significant reduction in the RAGE and TGF? expres-sion in comparison with the untreated diabetic rats. Oral administration of <b>myoinositol</b> could not induce any significant changes in the expression of both genes in the diabetic rats. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, crocin has the ability to block pathways leading to diabetic nephropathy through reducing RAGE and TGF? expression in the kidney tissue, maybe through its ability to reduce the serum glucose and AGEs, and antioxidant ac-tivity.

40|$|Benign mammary lumps and mastalgia are {{the most}} common breast disorders; yet, there is no {{clear-cut}} consensus about the best strategy for their treatment. We hypothesized that a combination, including boswellic acid, betaine, and <b>myoinositol,</b> would be beneficial in breast disorders by exerting a pleiotropic effect on multiple pathways. Indeed, <b>myoinositol</b> has already been proven to modulate some factors involved in the genesis of breast diseases, such as fibrosis and metabolic and endocrine cues. In our study, 76 women were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the placebo arm. After six months of treatment, statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups were recorded for pain relief (56 % vs 17 %) and breast density reduction (60 % vs 9 %). Furthermore, benign breast mass dimension showed a reduction in the experimental group (40 % vs 16 %). The combination of boswellic acid, betaine, and <b>myoinositol</b> has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of breast pain and radiologically and histologically confirmed benign breast mass and in the reduction of breast density, one of the pivotal risk factors for the development of breast cancer, without any side effects...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Recent {{evidence}} suggests that taurine and <b>myoinositol</b> may serve as organic osmolytes {{in a number of}} cells, including lens and retinal pigment epithelia, but the mechanism for their increased accumulation in response to hypertonic stress is not known. To assess whether NaK ATPase contributed to the elevated levels of taurine and <b>myoinositol</b> in cells exposed to hypertonic media, we measured the activity of NaK ATPase, which is known to be implicated in the transport of these substances, in human lens and retinal pigment epithelia cultured in isotonic and hypertonic media. Methods. Primary cultures of human lens epithelial (HLE) and human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cells were maintained in isotonic and hypertonic media for varying periods of time, and the activity of NaK ATPase and the levels of taurine and <b>myoinositol</b> were measured in cells cultured under two different conditions. The possible involvement of the transport enzyme in the accumulation of the two osmolytes was also investigated by inhibiting the enzyme with ouabain. Results. When primary cultures of HLE and HRPE were exposed to hypertonic medium containing NaCl (600 mOsm) or cellobiose (500 m Osm) for 72 hours, the concentration o...|$|E

Exploitation of {{renewable sources of energy}} such as algal biodiesel could turn energy supplies problem around. Studies on a locally isolated strain of Dunaliella sp. showed that the mean lipid content in cultures enriched by 200 mg L− 1 <b>myoinositol</b> was raised by around 33 % (1. 5 times higher than the control). Similarly, higher lipid productivity values were achieved in cultures treated by 100 and 200 mg L− 1 <b>myoinositol.</b> Fluorometry analyses (microplate fluorescence and flow cytometry) revealed increased oil accumulation in the Nile red-stained algal samples. Moreover, it was predicted that biodiesel produced from myoinositol-treated cells possessed improved oxidative stability, cetane number, and cloud point values. From the genomic point of view, real-time analyses revealed that <b>myoinositol</b> negatively influenced transcript abundance of AccD gene (one of the key genes involved in lipid production pathway) due to feedback inhibition and that its positive effectmust have been exerted through other genes.

40|$|In various {{mammalian}} species, {{high concentrations}} of <b>myoinositol</b> {{have been found in}} seminal fluid and in male reproductive organs (Mann, 1964; Eisenberg & Bolden, 1964). In the work reported here, the fate of radioactive <b>myoinositol</b> after intraperitoneal injection was studied in mature male rats and in bi-laterally nephrectomized rats, because they cannot catabolize myoinositol(Howard & Anderson, 1967). The distribution of radioactivity among the male reproductive organs and glandular secretions was similar in bilaterally nephrectomized and intact animals (Table 1). Radioactive inositol was accumulated avidly, within 2 hr, by the coagulating gland and seminal vesicle, whereas the prostate, epididymis and ductus deferens concentrated inositol less actively. Approximately 24 hr was required for the radioactivity (d/min/g wet wt) of the secretion of the coagulating gland, seminal vesicle or prostate to equal that of the gland itself. The inability of the testis to concentrate inositol was surprising, since the testicular concentration of inositol was quite high(530 /tg/g wet wt) compared to that of blood (11 «g/ml). Likewise, the ram testis has been reported to synthesize <b>myoinositol</b> from glucose, in preference to utilizing preformed inositol present in the blood (Middleton & Setchell, 1972) ...|$|E
