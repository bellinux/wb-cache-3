5|$|By this time, the fortifications {{had fallen}} into {{disrepair}} because the Swedish command did not pay <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to these territories, and funds that were allotted for renovation were insignificant. In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed {{under the supervision of}} Captain L.

5|$|Hall {{initially}} {{sought to}} appeal to the State Council of the LCL. Although the body had no binding authority over the parliamentary caucus, which chose the leader, Hall and his followers saw it as an opportunity for a media victory.

5|$|LTP has {{received}} <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> {{among those who}} study Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that causes marked cognitive decline and dementia.

5|$|Since its English release, Silver Star Story has {{garnered}} <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> from critics {{for its use}} {{of fluid}} full-motion animated sequences, lavish game packaging, {{and quality of the}} English script.

5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be executed.

5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin. Stylistically and {{structurally}} experimental, the novel follows {{the development of}} human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has {{the reputation of being}} a difficult and polarizing novel, and has not received nearly as <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> as Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E
5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who {{has come a long}} way from his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner <b>much</b> <b>attention,</b> and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E

5|$|During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration {{chose to}} make Clark State Forest a {{training}} {{center for the}} Civilian Conservation Corps, and also made it Indiana's largest CCC cantonment in November1933.

The state forest's proximity to the Jeffersonville Quartermaster Depot was key in the decision to focus so <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> on it.|$|E

The presence of lemurs in national parks helps drive ecotourism, which especially helps local communities living {{in the vicinity of the}} national parks, since it offers employment opportunities and the community receives half of the park entrance fees. In the case of Ranomafana National Park, job opportunities and other revenue from long-term research can rival that of ecotourism.|$|E

Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.|$|E
