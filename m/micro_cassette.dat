2500|$|Following {{the release}} of Outkast's fourth studio album Stankonia (2000), André 3000 felt urged to do {{something}} different from his previous projects and moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. He was relatively unsuccessful, obtaining a minor role in Hollywood Homicide (2003) and a one-episode appearance in the drama series The Shield. He returned to music and recorded a solo album that was [...] different from the material he had recorded as part of Outkast. The output was a blend of pop, jazz and funk with live instruments and singing instead of rapping. When writing songs he used a <b>micro</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder in order to [...] "record melodic ideas and lyrics, then build the melody around the lyrics".|$|E
50|$|MIKOS (mikro kazetový operační systém - <b>micro</b> <b>cassette</b> {{operating}} system) {{with better}} machine code monitor was stored in ROM, any other programming language was loaded from tape, using blocks of 255 data bytes.|$|E
5000|$|As {{he could}} not write such vast work in his 80s, Mr. Ravi Adabala, an Advocate and his friend advised to record in audio tapes. He {{requested}} Mr Ravi Adabala to listen and record his speech. Mr.Ravi Adabala obliged his request and did so. His speech recorded in 10 <b>Micro</b> <b>cassettes.</b> The recording process took three months from March 2000, Later the recordings were transcribed and published. The Book was released by Mr.Akkeneni Nageswararao in the year 2006. After some months he died with small illness {{at the age of}} 86.|$|R
50|$|Acornsoft also {{published}} and distributed {{a range of}} educational software developed by ASK (Applied Systems Knowledge) that were widely used in schools running BBC Micros. These included Podd (find out which actions a red blobby character can perform (e.g. jump, smile, dance), Squeeze (a two player strategy game of squeezing shapes onto a board) and Cranky (solve maths problems to repair a living calculator). These titles {{were part of the}} Acornsoft catalogue but used a different code (XBE?? - all other Acornsoft titles began with S so the Education range on BBC <b>Micro</b> <b>cassettes</b> would be SBE??). They ran on both the BBC Micro Model B and Acorn Electron.|$|R
50|$|In late 1982, Acorn {{released}} an upgrade ROM chip for the Atom which allowed users to switch between Atom BASIC {{and the more}} advanced BASIC used by the BBC Micro. The upgrade was purely to the programming language; the Atom's graphics and sound capabilities remained unchanged, and hence, contrary to some pre-release beliefs, the BBC BASIC ROM did not allow Atom users to run commercial BBC Micro software, since nearly all of it {{took advantage of the}} BBC machine's much more advanced graphics and sound hardware. Commercial BBC <b>Micro</b> <b>cassettes</b> could not have been loaded anyway, as they ran at a transfer rate of 1200 baud and the Atom's cassette interface only supported 300 baud.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the first}} wave of the Japan-only Smallest Transformers toy line. Despite the small size (roughly 2 inches in robot height), the toy is {{virtually}} faithful to the original G1 toy in design and transformation. Soundwave also comes with a <b>micro</b> <b>cassette</b> that transforms into Ravage.|$|E
50|$|The {{crew had}} been {{involved}} in the study of paranormal procedures, been working on field with Ouija board (wee-gee board), electronic voice phenomenon, EMF meters, <b>micro</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder and much more scientific instruments. Also they involved at night shoots in the locations which were broadly believed to be haunted. Notably, all technicians who worked in this venture were newcomers.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} {{subsequently}} ported to other platforms, including the Commodore 64, Commodore 16, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron and MSX. The BBC <b>Micro</b> <b>cassette</b> version has 2 rooms {{not in the}} ZX Spectrum version, and omits 60 of the rooms, rather than being a subset of it as are the CPC and ZX Spectrum versions. Unofficial ports to the Acorn Archimedes, Windows/DOS and UNIX/X environments also exist.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in 1983. Principal {{activities of the}} company in the 1980s included the import and wholesale distribution of video <b>cassettes,</b> audio <b>cassettes,</b> <b>micro</b> <b>cassettes,</b> and computer equipment. In 1990, the company was publicly listed as Magna Pacific (Holdings) Ltd. During the 1990s, the company expanded its activities into intellectual property licensing, acquiring videogram home entertainment distribution rights {{for a number of}} licensed properties. Rapid growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s saw Magna listed in Business Review Weekly's Fast 100 List, as the company expanded its distribution and acquired several key licensed properties that ensured strong growth in home entertainment revenue. Magna followed the industry migration to DVD media during this period, and now releases home entertainment content via DVD, Blu-ray and digital distribution. Magna Pacific is a budget distributor known for producing bare-bones media without extras or subtitles.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was common}} for users of home {{computers}} of the time, {{such as the}} Apple II, Commodore 64 and BBC <b>Micro,</b> to use <b>cassette</b> tapes for storage if {{they could not afford}} a floppy disk drive, and in many cases there was a wide range of commercial software available on tape. This, however, was not the case with the IBM PC - very few were shipped without at least one floppy disk drive, and apart from one diagnostic tape available from IBM, there seems never to have been software sold on tape. An IBM PC with just an external cassette recorder for storage could only use the built-in ROM BASIC as their operating system, which supported cassette operations. IBM PC DOS had no support for cassette tape.|$|R

50|$|A transcriptionist {{is similar}} to an audio typist, but the audio source {{is more likely to}} be a {{recording}} of someone speaking naturally instead of a dictation. They are more likely to work at home because they usually have no secretarial or administrative duties. Work was traditionally delivered to their desk (or home) by <b>micro</b> <b>cassette</b> but nowadays they might be given video tapes, CDs, DVDs, electronic files, etc. The work will be varied and they may be asked to type up transcripts from TV shows, interviews, talks, lectures and meetings, etc.|$|E
50|$|An audio typist {{is someone}} who specialises in typing text from an audio source which they listen to. The source, or {{original}} document is usually recorded onto microcassettes created by someone dictating into a Dictaphone. The audio typist will have learnt to touch type at a high speed which means they {{can look at the}} monitor or keep an eye on a waiting area as they are typing because they do not {{need to look at the}} keyboard. A specialist player called a <b>micro</b> <b>cassette</b> transcriber (below) is used for playback of the cassettes to maximise the typing speed.|$|E
50|$|Reimer {{observes that}} Jackman's alter ego {{exhibits}} rage, heightened senses, greatly superior strength and speed, {{and a more}} playful and flirtatious manner. She assures this persona she will keep his secrets just as she keeps Jackman's, but asks for guarantees he will not harm her. After being informed of the novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Jackman's alter ego takes Hyde's name for his own and the two agree to form an uneasy truce. While they share a body, neither remembers what the other did while dominant. They use a <b>micro</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder to leave messages for each other.|$|E
40|$|Precipitates of {{a series}} of {{alkaline}} earth metal (barium and strontium) carbonates, chromates, phosphates, and sulfates were formed at high supersaturation by diffusion through silica hydrogel, agarose hydrogel, and the freshly developed agarosesilica mixed gels. The reaction vessels could be a small test tube, a recently designed standard <b>micro</b> slide <b>cassette</b> and a enlarged supercassette. Homogeneous nucleation is thought to have taken place, and particle development {{led to the formation of}} an unusual category of materials, known as Induced Morphology Crystal Aggregates [IMCA], at high pH under far-from-equilibrium conditions. Standard procedures were developed in order to produce homogeneous gels. Particle development led to characteristic style of pattern formation, which I have called monster, spiral, and flake. Among these IMCA, barium carbonate, chromate, and sulfate were moderately easy to grow. Barium phosphate was very difficult to grow as IMCA due to formation of poorly crystalline spherulites. IMCA of strontium carbonate, chromate and sulfate could be developed at high basic pH in the presence of silicate. Strontium carbonate sheet morphology displays a unique property, double internal layer structure, which was identified by backscattering electron imaging (BEI). Selected electron diffraction (SAD) revealed a new crystal phase which was called "Dentonite". Precipitate particles were isolated using a non-destructive isolation technique. Optical microscopy was widely used to examine particles in situ and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray dispersive energy (EDX) spectroscopy were applied to particles ex situ, together with ESCA for surface analysis. Growth patterns were found to be strongly dependent on pH. Other related pattern formation processes were also investigated including normal and dendritic structures, spherulitic structures and periodic pattern formation. Some interpretations were proposed in terms of mechanism. Chemical additive effects were examined experimentally in the calcium phosphate system. The effect of external ionic strength was investigated, and it was found that a certain concentration of sodium chloride (0. 2 M) approximately equals a fraction of pH unit (- 0. 2) ...|$|R

5000|$|MakeUEF {{claims to}} have been the sole creator of all UEF files {{available}} on the Web before November 2004, the month of its version 1.0 release. Although the file format was more capable, supporting [...] "gap lengths" [...] since February 2001 at the latest, only [...] "program data" [...] was retained by MakeUEF prior to version 1.0. From November 2004 the fidelity of MakeUEF improved and the file spec was further refined, and an extension of [...] ("high quality") was adopted to reflect this. The AcornPreservation.org archive only carries the HQ.UEF variety as well as the CSW source files. Its sister site StairwayToHell.com accepts 'amateur' UEF translations and files produced by pre-1.0 MakeUEF.

50|$|After Dr. Krane recovers, Det. Stewart Gleick (Christopher McDonald) the {{original}} detective on Mary's case, approaches Dr. Krane {{in the hospital}} saying that he asked around and a detective Boddner, might be the guy. The problem is that Det. Boddner {{tried to commit suicide}} on the same day Mary was killed, but ended up in a coma, instead of dying. Dr. Krane and Dr. Briggs go to the hospice where Det. Boddner is being kept, and take a sample of his CSF, so that Dr. Krane can experience his memories. Dr. Krane and Dr Briggs argue about who should take the injection due to Dr. Krane's weak heart and recent heart attack. Dr. Krane agrees to allow Dr. Briggs to take the injection, because Det. Boddner committed suicide Dr. Krane says he is not taking any chances and he tapes Dr. Briggs to the seat. With Dr. Briggs immobilized Dr. Krane injects himself. He confirms that his wife was in fact having an affair with Det. Boddner. Mary met Det. Boddner who was a witness against Det. Bressler, who was a dirty cop. As Dr. Krane is reliving these memories, Det. Bressler arrives at the house and begins to set the scene to kill Dr. Krane and Dr. Briggs, by lighting a fire. Kelly arrives at the house with kids, just as Det. Bressler is about to kill them, Dr. Krane uses this distraction to attack Det. Bressler, they fight. Dr. Krane gets the upper hand and beats Det. Bressler unconscious, then he pulls Dr. Briggs out of the house, and the rushes in and saves Det. Bressler. He then goes back into the burning house to retrieve the <b>micro</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder Dr. Briggs uses for dictation.|$|E
