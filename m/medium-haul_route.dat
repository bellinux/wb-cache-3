5000|$|The [...] "SyrianAir" [...] acronym {{was officially}} adopted on November 11, 1975, in {{anticipation}} of the delivery of the new Boeing fleet and in order to generate a more modern and international image. However, SyrianAir's official and legal title continues to be [...] "Syrian Arab Airlines" [...] to this day. The Boeing 727s supplemented the Caravelles throughout the network, while the Boeing 747SPs were used on high load international routes (Munich, Paris, London, the Persian Gulf region, Karachi and Delhi). Demand was particularly high on these routes in 1976, especially following the repeated closures of the Beirut International Airport, and the increasing number of passengers using Damascus International Airport for travel to and from neighboring and war-stricken Lebanon. A record 480,000 passengers were carried by the airline in 1976. Given the predominantly <b>medium-haul</b> <b>route</b> network of the airline, the choice of the Boeing 747SP continues to this day to raise interrogations. The two jumbo jets were ordered in 1976 with the intention of operating transatlantic services to New York. SyrianAir and Alia-the Royal Jordanian Airline were to join forces in launching the first transatlantic route ever operated by an Arab Middle Eastern airline. The joint flight agreement never really materialized, and Alia launched independently its own Amman-New York flights in 1977. SyrianAir started its Boeing 747SP operations on June 1, 1976, using the jumbo jet on the Damascus-Munich-London sector. In 1980, SyrianAir sold two of its ageing Caravelles as plans were made for the acquisition of newer aircraft. In 1981, the airline carried 510,000 passengers, but these numbers declined to 462,000 in 1982 following the unrest caused by Israel's invasion of nearby Lebanon.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} the commencement of high-speed rail (HSR) services on airlines’ domestic available seats on affected routes in China, Japan, and South Korea. The study is based on a dataset covering the 1994 – 2012 period. We use the propensity score matching method to pair HSR affected routes with routes without HSR services. The difference-in-difference approach is used to estimate the impact of HSR entry. We find that HSR entries may, on average, lead to a more significant drop in airlines’ seat capacity in China than in Japan and Korea given similar HSR service speed. In China, HSR services with a maximum speed about 200 km/h can produce strong negative impacts on <b>medium-haul</b> air <b>routes</b> but induce more air seat capacity on long-haul routes. HSR services with a maximum speed of 300 km/h have little extra impact on <b>medium-haul</b> <b>routes</b> but a strong negative impact on long-haul routes. Finally, although HSR has a strong negative impact in Japan's short-haul and medium-haul air markets, little impact is observed in its long-haul markets.

25|$|In 1949, Yugoslavia {{was faced}} with a dire {{international}} position: isolated both by the West and the East.

When Yugoslavia turned to the West, an agreement was made with Swissair to open the Belgrade-Zürich route, which was inaugurated on 24 August 1949. Company stagnation marked operations in 1949, because the traffic volume was well below fleet potentials and transport needs in the country. However, 1954 was in many ways a turning point. Convair CV-340 and Convair CV-440 Metropolitan aircraft were purchased for short-haul and <b>medium-haul</b> <b>routes,</b> after which the Douglas DC-3 was used only on domestic routes.

Two forms of appearance on intra-continental short- and <b>medium-haul</b> <b>routes</b> – with a complementary and a substitutive function regarding cargo flights – are distinguished: Access and egress of consolidation/deconsolidation airports for delivery and pick-up, and airline trucking (“road feeder services”/RFS, “truck-flights”) of airway billed consignments between two airports. The methodology comprises an empirical characterization of the supply side of both the air cargo consolidation and the airline trucking markets, the subsequent modeling of surface transport links within a scheduled network in terms of the surface links’ network topology, attainable journey times and hours-of service regulation for truck driving, and the simulation of RFS load pattern {{in the context of}} a global air cargo model...|$|R

30|$|The {{interpretation}} of the model is mostly intuitive, but we also provide some further explanation. An increase in the service quality of the sector in each market increases its market share. As customers value service quality, an increase in service quality also implies {{that they are willing}} to pay more, leading to higher optimal prices. In addition, this proposition implies that the market share of the air (or HSR) sector decreases as the service quality provided by the HSR (or air) increases in market 2. Since the air (or HSR) sector does not respond to changes in the rival’s service quality according to the IIA property, its market share decreases with increases in the rival’s market share. Related to this result, we can also show the effect of the HSR entities on the air sector share in the HSR-accessible market (i.e., market 2). From Eq. (8), the air sector share with consideration of the HSR entity is given by p^*_ 2,a=W[A_ 2,a]/(1 +W[A_ 2,a]+W[A_ 2,r]). When b_ 2,r→ -∞, the air sector share without consideration of the HSR entity can be obtained as p^**_ 2,a=W[A_ 2,a]/(1 +W[A_ 2,a]). Thus, the HSR entity has a negative impact on the air sector market share, and the better the service quality of the HSR is, the more the air sector market share decreases. Similar results have been found in empirical research. Wan et al. [26] used a difference–indifference approach and investigated the impact of the commencement of HSR services on airlines’ number of available seats for domestic flights and the frequency on the affected routes in China, Japan, and South Korea in the sampling period 1994 – 2012. They found that China’s HSR services with a maximum speed of about 200 km/h (300 km/h) can cause a significant reduction in airline seat capacity on <b>medium-haul</b> (or long-haul) <b>routes.</b> Since the reduction in available seats can be considered as a decrease in the market share, their results are consistent with our findings.|$|R
