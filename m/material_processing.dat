25|$|The {{acoustic}} {{and thermal}} properties of graphite are highly anisotropic, since phonons propagate quickly along the tightly-bound planes, but are slower {{to travel from}} one plane to another. Graphite's high thermal stability and electrical and thermal conductivity facilitate its widespread use as electrodes and refractories in high temperature <b>material</b> <b>processing</b> applications. However, in oxygen containing atmospheres graphite readily oxidizes to form CO2 at temperatures of 700°C and above.|$|E

25|$|Mineral {{processing}} (or mineral dressing) is {{a specialized}} {{area in the}} science of metallurgy that studies the mechanical means of crushing, grinding, and washing that enable the separation (extractive metallurgy) of valuable metals or minerals from their gangue (waste <b>material).</b> <b>Processing</b> of placer ore material consists of gravity-dependent methods of separation, such as sluice boxes. Only minor shaking or washing {{may be necessary to}} disaggregate (unclump) the sands or gravels before processing. Processing of ore from a lode mine, whether it is a surface or subsurface mine, requires that the rock ore be crushed and pulverized before extraction of the valuable minerals begins. After lode ore is crushed, recovery of the valuable minerals is done by one, or a combination of several, mechanical and chemical techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{adoption}} of high power fiber lasers as an industrial <b>material</b> <b>processing</b> tool has been ongoing {{for several years}} and is now expanding into other markets including the medical and scientific markets. One key enhancement enabling penetration into the scientific market has been the improvements in high finesse fiber amplifiers, which are now capable of delivering single frequency linewidths (<5nbsp&kHz) together with excellent beam quality and stable linearly polarized output. Systems meeting these specifications, have steadily progressed {{in the last few years}} from a few Watts of output power, initially to the 10s of Watts and now into the 100s of Watts power level. This power scaling has been achieved with developments in the fiber technology, such as the {{adoption of}} stimulated brillouin scattering (SBS) suppression/mitigation techniques within the fiber, along with improvements in the overall amplifier design. The latest generation of high finesse, high power fiber amplifiers now deliver power levels exceeding what is available from commercial solid-state single frequency sources and are opening up new scientific applications as a result of the higher power levels and stable optimized performance.|$|E

2500|$|Batch {{processing}} {{is one of}} {{the initial}} steps of the glass-making process.

[...] Some batch systems include <b>material</b> <b>processing</b> such as raw material screening/sieve, drying, or pre-heating (i.e. cullet). [...] Whether automated or manual, the batch house measures, assembles, mixes, and delivers the glass raw material recipe (batch) via an array of chutes, conveyors, and scales to the furnace. [...] The batch enters the furnace at the 'dog house' or 'batch charger'. [...] Different glass types, colors, desired quality, raw material purity / availability, and furnace design will affect the batch recipe.|$|E
