5|$|In the UK {{there were}} 124 {{separate}} occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell {{to less than}} 2% of installed capacity. A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002. Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind {{can be dealt with}} by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power. According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total nameplate capacity) to be used as reliable, baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads, as long as <b>minimum</b> <b>criteria</b> are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|E

40|$|Tang and Xu [Biometrika 101 (2014) 333 - 350] {{applied the}} <b>minimum</b> β-aberration <b>criterion</b> to {{selecting}} optimal designs for screening quantitative factors. They provided a statistical justification showing that <b>minimum</b> β-aberration <b>criterion</b> minimizes contamination of nonnegligible kth-order {{effects on the}} estimation of linear effects for k= 2, [...] .,r, where r is {{the strength of a}} design. Unfortunately, this result does not hold for k>r. In this paper, we provide a complete mathematical connection between β-wordlength patterns and contaminations (on the estimation of linear effects) and reveal that the <b>minimum</b> β-aberration <b>criterion</b> is not necessarily equivalent to the <b>minimum</b> contamination <b>criterion</b> for ranking designs. We prove that they are equivalent only when the number of factors of a design equals the strength plus one. We emphasize that the <b>minimum</b> β-aberration <b>criterion,</b> in fact, sequentially minimizes the contamination of nonnegligible kth-order effects on the estimation of the general mean, not on the estimation of linear effects. Therefore, the <b>minimum</b> contamination <b>criterion</b> should be more appropriate than the <b>minimum</b> β-aberration <b>criterion</b> for selecting optimal designs for screening quantitative factors...|$|R

25|$|According to a 2007 {{study of}} {{wind in the}} United States, ten or more widely {{separated}} wind farms connected through the grid could be relied upon for from 33 to 47% of their average output (15–20% of nominal capacity) as reliable, baseload power, as long as <b>minimum</b> <b>criteria</b> are met for wind speed and turbine height.

25|$|The {{original}} promotion play-offs {{divided the}} eight teams {{into two groups}} of four each, with the teams within each group playing a home-and-away mini-league. The top two teams in each group advanced to a knockout phase. In 2010, the semi-finals were one-off matches; in 2011, they became two-legged. The top team in each pool played the second-place team from the other group in the semi-finals; the winners advanced to the two-legged final, where the ultimate winner earned promotion to the Premiership (assuming that the team met the <b>minimum</b> <b>criteria</b> for promotion).|$|E

The 24 senior members of the Northern Ireland Football League are exempt until the fifth round, which consists of 32 clubs and is played in January.|$|E

25|$|Historically, UTPA had open {{enrollment}} {{such that}} any student able {{to graduate from}} an approved public or private high school was granted admission to the University. This policy was implemented by former president Miguel Nevarez. After Nevarez retired UTPA moved towards minimum admission standards. The minimum standards for Fall 2011 admission are a diploma from a recognized high school and a combined Math/Verbal SAT score of 860 or an ACT score of 18. Additionally the <b>minimum</b> <b>criteria</b> will be met with a SAT score of 810 or ACT score of 17 if the applicant is in the top third of his/her graduating class or an SAT score of 760 or ACT score of 16 will suffice if the applicant is in the top quarter of his/her graduating class.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} been {{undertaken}} to explore whether REM EMG suppression is exhibited in facial muscles other than the mentalis. The present study is an investigation of facial muscle activity during REM sleep in ten vivid dreamers. Sustained facial muscle activity (FMA) was observed during paradoxical sleep in six of the ten subjects. The FMAs observed ranged from a <b>minimum</b> <b>criterion</b> of 6 seconds to sustained FMA "bouts" of up to 59. 5 seconds in duration. The FMAs observed had voltages which ranged from a <b>minimum</b> <b>criterion</b> of 4. 0 v to maximum bursts of 78 v. Across the 6 subjects who exhibited FMAs, there was a total of 19 events. EMG activity was usually observed in the corrugator, although it was sometimes observed in the zygomatic, frontalis, and masseter. The potential relevance of sustained facial muscle activity to emotion experienced during REM is discussed...|$|R
2500|$|The use {{of credit}} ratings by {{regulatory}} agencies {{is not a}} new phenomenon. In the 1930s, regulators in the United States used credit rating agency ratings to prohibit banks from investing in bonds that were deemed to be below investment grade. [...] In the following decades, state regulators outlined a similar role for agency ratings in restricting insurance company investments. From 1975 to 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recognized the largest and most credible agencies as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, and relied on such agencies exclusively for distinguishing between grades of creditworthiness in various regulations under federal securities laws. The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 created a voluntary registration system for CRAs that met a certain <b>minimum</b> <b>criteria,</b> and provided the SEC with broader oversight authority.|$|E
